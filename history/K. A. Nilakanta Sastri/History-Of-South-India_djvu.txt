PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION 


This edition has been carefully revised in the light of suggestions 
made by many reviewers who have generally given a warm recep- 
tion to it in the learned periodicals. The Chapter (III) on the 
Earliest Peoples and Cultures has been rewritten in part in the light 
of recent advances in the knowledge of the prehistory of South 
India due particularly to the excavations of the Archaeological 
Department of India. Rather more attention has been given to 
the history and culture of Kerala than in the first edition. Some 
of the illustrations which figured in it have been dropped and a few 
new ones added. My thanks are due to Dr M. Seshadri of Mysore 
University and Messrs K. R. Srinivasan and N. R. Banerjee of the 
Indian Archaeological Department for much valuable help in the 
revision of the chapter on prehistory. Professor K. K. Pillai of 
the Madras University and Mr G. Harihara Sastri gave much help 
in the revision of the sections on Kerala history and culture. Prof. 
Mariappa Bhat helped in the revision of the section on Kannada 
literature. 

Diacritical marks and transliteration always present problems in 
books of this kind, and compromises were followed in both in- 
stances in the first edition with a view to minimize the marks which 
embarrass the general reader for whom the book is particularly 
meant and in order to retain familiar forms of the names of 
persons, rivers, and places even at the sacrifice of a consistent 
adherence to strict rules of transliteration. The reader will thus 
find both c and ch used for ^ and s and sh for q in different 
contexts. 

Dr T. V. Mahalingam made a number of valuable suggestions as 
the book was being printed and Mr S. Krishnamurti prepared 
the Index; I am grateful to them for their help.

The aim, scope and plan of the book are explained in the intro- 
ductory part of Chapter I, and this Preface is meant primarily 
to be an acknowledgement of the assistance I have received in the 
preparation of the book. It was not, however, till I began to plan 
the chapters of the book and the details of their sections that I 
came to realize how little equipped I was for the task and how 
much I had to depend on the co-operation of others for its fulfil- 
ment. But the help I so much needed was forthcoming in ample 
measure, particularly from my colleagues in the allied departments 
of study in the University, and this enabled me to press on with 
the work in spite of difficulties and complete it in a little over a 
year from its commencement. 

Chapter II on the geography of South India in relation to its 
history owes a great deal to the invaluable aid of Mr V. Kalyana- 
sundaram of the Geography Department, who, in addition, drew 
all the maps accompanying the book, with the assistance of Mr 
R. Tirumalai (Research Scholar) on the historical side. In writing 
Chapter III on the prehistory of South India Professor T. Bala- 
krishnan Nayar of Presidency College gave me aid of no less im- 
portance. Chapters IV-XIII, comprising the core of political history 
and a sketch of social and economic conditions, and Chapter XV 
on Religion and Philosophy are based primarily on published 
sources and the work of earlier authors in the field to which 
references are given at the end of every chapter; but they incorpo- 
rate also the results of much unpublished work, my students’ as 
well as my own, carried on in the University for over seventeen 
years, and this must be taken into account for any differences from 
current views that the reader may notice. Chapter XIV on Litera- 
ture covers very wide ground and indebtedness to my friends is 
correspondingly heavy: to the late Dr T. R. Chintamani and to 
Dr V. Raghavan, both of the Sanskrit Department, for the section 
on Sanskrit; to Mr S. Vaiyapuri Pillai for that on Tamil; to 
Mr M. Mariappa Bhat for Kannada; to Mr S. Kameswara Rao 
(Research Scholar) and Dr N. Venkataramanayya for Telugu; and 
lastly, to Mr K. Kanakasabhapati Pillai (Research Fellow) and 
Mr P. Krishnan Nayar of the Malayalam Department for

Malayalam. I must not omit to make special mention of the fact 
that the task of sketching the history of South Indian architecture 
and art was rendered particularly easy by the excellent guidance 
furnished by Percy Brown’s monumental survey of the subject 
which leaves all the older work on the subject at a great distance. 

I wish to make it clear that though I have availed myself of the 
co-operation, very willingly given, of so many scholars, they are 
in no way responsible for the views that find expression in this 
book.

CHAPTER I 


SURVEY OF THE SOURCES 

1. Scope: Neglect of South Indian history — its interest and general trends 
— no thesis to maintain or lessons to draw — main approach still necessarily 
from the North — political and cultural history: their relation. 

2. Sources: Inscriptions: stone, copper — coins — literature: Indian, foreign. 

Our aim in this book is to present a brief general survey of the 
ancient history of South India to the middle of the seventeenth 
century a.d. Then began a new epoch with the downfall of the 
empire of Vijayanagar, its partition between the sultanates of 
Bijapur and Golconda, and the establishment of the English 
East India Company at several points on the coast of peninsular 
India. We mean by South India all the land lying south of the 
Vindhyas — Dakshina (the Deccan) in the widest sense of the 
term. Our knowledge of the history of this region has been 
greatly advanced during the last fifty years by many important 
discoveries, archaeological and literary. Much of this new 
source-material lies embedded in the inaccessible periodical 
reports of the different branches of the Archaeological Survey of 
India, and of the more important 4 Indian states such as Hydera- 
bad, Mysore and Travancore. Scholars, none too many, have 
addressed themselves to the task of interpreting the data and 
have written learned monographs mostly confined to particular 
dynasties, areas, or topics; these are very helpful as far as they go, 
but by their very nature cannot give a general idea of the main 
lines of movement in the history of politics and culture. 
Sir R. G. Bhandarkar’s Early History of the Dekkan (1895) 
is the nearest approach to a general history; but that brilliant 
work is now outdated and does not deal with the history of the 
extreme South. P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar’s History of the Tamils 
(1929) deals only with the early history of the extreme South. 

In general histories of India, the part of the country 
with which we are concerned figures only in a small way. 
Vincent Smith rightly observed: ‘Hitherto most historians of 
ancient India have written as if the South did not exist ’, and 
explained this neglect of the South in two ways. ‘ The historian 
of India,’ he said, ‘ is bound by the nature of things to direct 



2 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


his attention primarily to the North, and is able to give only a 
secondary place to the story of the Deccan plateau and the far 
South.’ Again, ‘ the northern record is far less imperfect than 
that of the peninsula. Very little is known definitely concerning 
the southern kingdoms before a.d. 600, whereas the history of 
Hindustan may be carried back twelve centuries earlier. The 
extreme deficiency of really ancient records concerning the 
peninsula leaves an immense gap in the history of India which 
cannot be filled.’ Scanty as our information is on the earliest 
phase of the history of the South, the situation is not so hopeless 
as Smith depicts it, and this will become clear as we proceed. 

On any view the history of South India is an integral and 
not the least interesting part of the history of India. The 
Deccan is one of the oldest inhabited regions of the world and 
its prehistoric archaeology and contacts with neighbouring lands, 
so far as they are traceable, constitute an important chapter in 
the history of the world’s civilizations. All over India the 
foundations of Indian culture were laid by the fusion of Indo- 
Aryan and pre-Aryan elements in varying conditions and pro- 
portions; and in the languages, literatures and institutions of 
the South there has survived much more of pre-Aryan India 
than anywhere else. The Marathas of the western Deccan are 
the southernmost of the Indo-Aryan-speaking peoples of India, 
and all the country to the east and south of them speaks langu- 
ages that fall into a single group, the Dravidian, of which 
Tamil is the oldest surviving literary idiom. And the earliest 
strata of Tamil literature take us back at least to the early 
centuries of the Christian era. A picture of politics and society 
drawn on the basis of this early literature must be interesting 
in itself and go some way to help unravel problems of early 
culture-contacts between Aryan and pre-Aryan. The rise of 
Hindu kingdoms in the eastern lands across the Bay of Bengal 
is but an expansion and continuation of the process by which 
South India and Ceylon were colonized and aryanized; and 
beyond doubt the Deccan and the far South formed the ad- 
vanced bases from which this transmarine movement started 
in the early centuries before and after the Christian era: in 
Indonesia and Indo-China emigrants from India met the same 
problems as in India south of the Vindhyas and solved them 
in more or less the same manner. A detailed study of the 



SURVEY OF THE SOURCES

many interesting analogies between the results of these early 
culture-contacts in these different lands has not yet been 
attempted and lies beyond the scope of this book; but we 
should do well to remember that the history of India has 
been too long studied more or less exclusively in isolation 
and from the continental point of view, little regard being 
paid to the maritime side of the story. The Satavahanas were 
described as ‘ lords of the three oceans ’ and promoted overseas 
colonization and trade. Under them Buddhist art attained the 
superb forms of beauty and elegance preserved to this day in 
the cave-temples of western India and the survivals from the 
stupas of Amaravatl, Goli, Nagarjunikonda and other places in 
the Krishna valley; and the tradition was continued long afte^ 
the Satavahanas by their successors both in the easten} 
and western Deccan. The latter half of Satavahana rule in thq 
Deccan coincides with the age of the literature of the Sangam 
in Tamil and of active trade between India and the Roman 
empire in the west, and there is good reason to believe that 
the plastic arts of the Deccan in this period and the succeeding 
one owed something to Grseco-Roman models and artists. 

After the close of the Sangam epoch, from about a.d. 300 
to a.d. 600, there is an almost total lack of information regard- 
ing occurrences in the Tamil land. Some time about a.d. 300 
or a little later the whole country was upset by the predatory 
activities of the Kalabhras who are described as evil rulers who 
overthrew numberless chieftains (adhirajar) of the land and got 
a stranglehold on the country. With the overthrow of the 
Kalabhras opens the new era of Pandya-Pallava achievements 
from the close of the sixth century a.d. This obscure period 
of Tamil history was marked in the Deccan proper by the 
rise into prominence of several dynasties of kings who divided 
among themselves the heritage of the Satavahana empire, kept 
up its administrative and political system, and carried forward 
its artistic and cultural traditions. The Abhlras and Trai- 
kutakas in the north-west, the Vakatakas in Berar, the 
Ikshvakus, Salankayanas and Vishnukundins in the eastern 
Deccan, and the Chutas, Kadambas, Gangas and Pallavas in 
the south Deccan are the most notable among these dynasties. 
Buddhism and Jainism made considerable progress in this 
period, the former inspiring the art of Ajanta, the Andhra

country, and Sigiriya in Ceylon, the latter finding widespread 
acceptance among the kings of the western Deccan and 
the Tamil country and possibly also among considerable 
sections of their subjects. To this period also belong the 
earliest extant inscriptions from Burma, Malaya, Java, Borneo 
and Indo-China that furnish unmistakable evidence of the 
important part played by the Deccan and South India in the 
colonization and aryanization of these lands. 

The next period (c. a.d. 600-950) is one of relatively large 
states each with a notable record of its own in war and peace. 
In the Deccan at first the Chalukyas of Badami rise and 
spread their power over the entire country between the 
two seas, though the Telugu country along the east coast 
and the province of Lata in the north-west develop into 
virtually independent kingdoms under collateral branches 
of the royal fine. The Chalukyas hold their own against 
Harshavardhana and confine his empire to the north of 
the Vindhyas; they wage successful war against other neigh- 
bours in the North, and the Pallavas in the South, and 
the many fine stone temples, rock-cut and structural, found 
at Aihole, Badami and Pattadakal attest their devotion to 
religion and architecture; doubtless some of the additions 
to the caves and paintings at Ajanta must also be ascribed to 
this period. By the middle of the eighth century, the power 
of the Chalukyas declines, and from among their numerous 
feudatories the Rashtrakutas rise into eminence and establish 
a new empire with Manyakheta (Malkhed) as its centre. In 
administration, and in its relations with its neighbours in the 
north and south, this empire generally continues the tradition 
of the Chalukyas of Badami, except for the fact that it keeps 
up an almost perpetual feud with the Chalukyas of Vengi, the 
rulers of the eastern Deccan. The splendid rock-cut temple 
of Kailasa at Ellora is perhaps the most remarkable monument of 
the Rashtrakutas. 

In the South the Pallavas and the Pandyas share the 
country, and the frontier between their territories is shifting 
about the line of the Kaveri as a result of repeated warfare; 
the Pallavas in particular have a strenuous time as they have 
to fight all the while on two fronts. The name of the Cholas, 
who were so prominent in the Sangam Age and were again to 



SURVEY OF THE SOURCES

raise in the succeeding epoch one of the most splendid empires 
known to history, almost disappears from the political map of 
the Tamil country; and it is not known what relation, if any, 
the Telugu-Chodas of the Renadu country in the Ceded Dis- 
tricts, one of the minor dynasties of this epoch, bore to their 
namesakes of the Tamil land, though they claimed descent 
from Karikala, the most celebrated of the early Chola monarch s 
of the Sangam Age. The Pandy a- Pallava period was marked by 
striking developments in religion, literature and art. Sanskrit 
held an honoured place as the language of higher literature 
and culture, and the Ganga monarch Durvinlta had claims to 
authorship both in Sanskrit and in Kannada. The Pallava king, 
Mahendravarman I, aptly styled vicitra-citta — ‘ wonderful -mind ’ — 
was author, architect, musician and painter. In his time there 
arose a strong reaction against the growing influence of Jainism 
and Buddhism, which found expression in a widespread bhakti 
movement among the worshippers of £iva and Vishnu; the 
leaders of this movement were known as Nayanars and Alvars, 
and their exuberant devotional songs, gathered later in the 
collections known as the Devaram and the Divyaprabandham , 
celebrate every orthodox shrine they visited many times 
over in the course of their propagandist peregrinations, and 
constitute the most priceless treasure in all Tamil literature. 
The great Kumarila and the still greater Sankara also lived and 
taught in the same age, the former restating the principles of 
Vedic exegesis and upholding the religion of sacrifice, the latter 
expounding the fundamentals of monistic vedanta with unsur- 
passed power and brilliance. The temples and sculptures of the 
period register the highest perfection of form that their arts 
attained in the South. Mamallapuram (Mahabalipuram) and 
Kanchipuram (Conjeevaram) are the best museums of this art 
even now. 

The rise of the imperial Cholas of the line of Vijayalaya 
may be dated from the middle of the ninth century a.d. As 
they emerged from their obscurity, they soon displaced the 
remnants of Pallava power to the north of their capital Tanjore, 
and subdued the Pandya and Chera countries in the south and 
invaded Ceylon. The hostility of the Rashtrakutas, particularly 
of Krishna III, threatened to wreck the Chola empire at its 
birth (c. 950), but the Karnataka power was operating too far 



6 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


from its base to achieve permanent results; and Krishna’s wars, 
while putting a temporary check on the rising imperialism of 
the Cholas, spelled disaster to his own empire which was easily 
overthrown under his successors by the Chalukya Taila II* 
The Chola power recovered soon after the withdrawal of 
Krishna’s arms, and swept on to its meridian in the first part 
of the eleventh century under Rajaraja I and his even greater 
son Rajendra I. At a time when Northern India was divided 
into a number of weak and warring states, some of which began 
to stagger under repeated Islamic inroads, these two great 
monarchs gave political unity to the whole of Southern India 
for the first time and established it as a respected sea-power 
controlling the highways of the Indian Ocean and effectively 
regulating the affairs of the empire of Sri Yijaya by invasion 
and diplomacy. They perfected a highly organized administrative 
system of central control and fostered the autonomy of village 
assemblies as none had done before; the father constructed the 
Great Temple of Tanjore, the purest and most magnificent gem 
of South Indian architecture; and the son created its replica in 
the wilds of the Trichinopoly district and called up a new city 
to surround it. The name of the city, Gangaikondasolapuram — 

* the town of the Chola who took the Ganges ’ — was an advertise- 
ment of the new power of South India to the rest of the country. 
This was the silver age of the religious revival which had begun 
under the Pallavas; a fresh commentary on the Rig-Veda was 
composed by Venkata Madhava who lived in a village on the 
banks of the Kaveri in the reign of Parantaka I; the Tamil 
hymns, &aiva and Vaishnava, of the last epoch, were gathered 
together and grouped into canonical books, a form which they 
have retained to this day; the glorious conception of the form 
of the Dancing Lord Nataraja found embodiment in many 
monumental bronze images which, alike for the technical skill 
they imply and the artistic perfection they exhibit, have few 
rivals in the history of the world’s art. 

The Chalukyas of Kalyani who built up their power on the 
ruins of the Rashtrakuta empire were the contemporaries and 
opponents of the Cholas during the eleventh and twelfth centuries 
a.d. The frontier between their kingdoms fluctuated about the 
line of the Tungabhadra as the result of many wars, some of 
which were fought with unusual bitterness. The Eastern 



SURVEY OF THE SOURCES 


7 


Chalukya kingdom of Vengi was the bone of contention 
throughout; its rulers were allied to the Kalyani Chalukyas by 
descent; but they were also beholden to the Cholas who had 
restored them to their throne whence they had been driven into 
exile as the result of a civil war (at the end of the tenth century), 
and several dynastic alliances followed and brought the lines 
closer together until, in a.d. 1070, when succession failed in the 
Chola male line, the ruler of Vengi himself succeeded to the 
Chola throne. This was Kulottunga I. 

His great Chalukya opponent was Vikramaditya VI. Their 
rivalry filled the annals of South India for about half a century 
and made for the weakening of their respective empires under 
their less competent successors. The Hoysalas of Dva(o)ra- 
samudra, the Yadavas of Devagiri and the Kakatlyas of Warangal, 
all feudatory powers nurtured on the breast of the Chalukyan 
empire of Kalyani, come up in the latter half of the twelfth 
century and partition among themselves the territories of the 
parent empire. Ruling territory contiguous to the Chola empire, 
the Hoysalas not only aggrandize themselves partly at its 
expense, but intercede with effect in the politics of the far 
South; they protect the Chola monarchs from the aggressions 
of their overgrown vassals. At the beginning of the thirteenth 
century the Pandya line begins to throw up a succession of able 
and powerful monarchs, and the northern half of the Chola 
empire is dominated by the ambition and turbulence of Kop- 
perunjinga, a chieftain who claimed descent from the Pallavas. 
The help of the Hoysalas secures a brief respite for the Chola 
kingdom, but the inevitable end soon overtakes it and by the 
middle of the century the whole of the Tamil country and the 
east coast right up to Nellore passes under the Pandyas. 
Hoysala efforts to check the growth of Pandyan power were not 
attended by any conspicuous success, nor did the Telugu-Chodas 
fare better in the enterprise. 

Sanskrit learning and literature found patronage everywhere, 
while the study and cultivation of the languages of the people 
received encouragement each in its own place — Kannada under 
the Chalukyas and Hoysalas; Telugu under the eastern Chaluk- 
yas, Kakatlyas and Telugu-Chodas; and Tamil under the Cholas 
and Pandyas. The Rdmdyana and Mahdbharata were rendered 
into all these languages by celebrated poets, and a large volume 



8 A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 

of devotional and polemical literature in religion began to 
grow. The practice of entertaining a poet-laureate at each 
important court came into vogue and gave birth to many secular 
works of a quasi-historical nature. Political and juristic 
thinking made considerable progress and expressed itself in the 
form of commentaries on old law books like that of Yajnavalkya 
or in independent treatises on polity. In religious philosophy 
Ramanuja systematized the doctrines of Visishta-Advaita and 
sought to reconcile the Upanishadic doctrine of the Absolute 
with the theistic predilections of the great Vaishnava Alvars 
and Acharyas who had preceded him. Close to Ramanuja’s 
system, but still differing from it in some important respects, 
was that of Nimbarka in whose theology Krishna and Radha 
take the place of Narayana and Lakshml, and claim the ex- 
clusive devotion of their followers. The construction of large 
stone temples was undertaken everywhere in the land by all 
the dynasties, and architecture, sculpture and allied arts found 
extensive patronage and achieved new forms of beauty and 
splendour. In many ways the age of the Cholas and Chalukyas 
(900-1200) was the grandest epoch in the history of South India. 

The thirteenth century was the age of the four Hindu 
kingdoms which inherited the territories and traditions of the 
two large empires that had preceded them. The Pandyas and 
Hoysalas in the south, and the Yadavas and Kakatiyas in the 
north are the chief powers, and as usual a number of local 
feudatory dynasties flourished under the suzerainty of each. 
This state-system experienced a shock from outside at the end 
of the thirteenth century and the beginning of the fourteenth. 
The Khilji sultans of Delhi after consolidating their power in 
North India began to cast their covetous eyes on the South; and 
the Khiljis were followed by the Tughlaks. At first the motive 
was only plunder and spoil ; but soon the spread of Islam and 
territorial conquest became the objectives. Considerable parts of 
the country passed under the nominal sway of Delhi; and Madura, 
at first the seat of a Muslim governor from Delhi, grew by the 
rebellion of the governor into an independent sultanate. Colonies 
of Muslim soldiers and generals found lodgement in several 
parts of the country and began to control the administration of 
the land; temples were plundered and demolished, and mosques 
came to be erected. Hindu society faced a new peril; but the 



SURVEY OF THE SOURCES 


9 


crisis was of relatively short duration; the distance from Delhi, 
the inherent weakness of a far-flung military imperialism, and the 
spirit of resistance in the people saved the Hindu faith in the 
South. Out of the numerous revolts that disrupted the empire 
of Muhammad bin Tughlak there arose two kingdoms in the 
Deccan, with centres in Vijayanagar and Gulbarga, in the first 
half of the fourteenth century. 

The BahmanI kingdom of Gulbarga was a Muslim state 
which spread its sway from sea to sea in the northern Deccan, 
and was no less opposed to its Muslim neighbours in the north 
than to the Hindu empire to its south. The annals of the 
BahmanI kings make no pleasant reading; fourteen sultans 
occupied the throne between 1347 and 1518; of these, four 
were murdered, two others were' deposed and blinded, and all 
were cruel and bloodthirsty fanatics addicted to drink and 
debauchery. ‘ It would be difficult,’ says a modern historian, 
* to specify any definite benefit conferred upon India by the 
dynasty.’ This harsh, but not altogether unjust, judgement 
may be mitigated by the recollection of the patronage extended 
by the rulers to authors and architects from Persia, and of their 
particular regard on some occasions, as in time of famine, for the 
well-being of their Muslim subjects. In the sixteenth century 
the BahmanI kingdom split up into five separate sultanates which 
kept up the feud with Vijayanagar though they quarrelled not 
less among themselves. Bijapur and Golconda were the most 
prominent among them; all were absorbed in the Mogul empire 
at different dates in the seventeenth century. 

Starting on its career a decade earlier than the BahmanI 
kingdom, that of Vijayanagar became the focus of resurgent 
Hindu culture which offered a more successful resistance to 
Islam in this part of the country than anywhere else. But it 
was a long military vigil; the polity had to be organized on 
a warlike footing, and there was no room for weak or incompet- 
ent monarchs on the throne; whenever the hereditary claimants 
were found wanting, they were displaced by the ablest among 
their lieutenants. The empire is best looked upon as a military 
confederacy of many chieftains co-operating under the leader- 
ship of the biggest among them. Even so, the exigencies of 
the struggle compelled the rulers of Vijayanagar to resort to the 
employment of foreigners and even Muslims in the artillery

and cavalry sections of their armies to make them adequate for 
the defence of their country and religion. This course had its 
obvious disadvantages. The fact, however, remains that Vijaya- 
nagar kept up the fight, with not inconspicuous success, for the 
best part of three centuries before it succumbed to the forces 
it had struggled against so long; but, by then, other and in the 
long run more decisive factors had put in their appearance in 
the form of European trading companies, and a new epoch 
begins. The Portuguese indeed had built up their short-lived 
and predatory maritime empire much earlier — from the first 
half of the sixteenth century; but their activities never counted 
as a serious menace to the Hindu empire with which they took 
care to be on friendly terms though they quarrelled often enough 
with its feudatories on the coast, especially in the west. Their 
attempts to plunder rich Hindu temples, and the conversions 
to Christianity procured by the Jesuits and other orders of 
monks in the ‘ pearl fishery coast’ and elsewhere, constituted 
a threat to Hinduism from another side; but it was soon con- 
trolled and checked by the monarchs of Vijayanagar and their 
agents. 

The task of Vijayanagar was thus to conserve Hindu society 
and save it from the dissolution which threatened it from 
several directions. Little wonder therefore that during this 
period the outlook of the Hindus of the South developed new 
standards of a narrow and rigid orthodoxy in social and reli- 
gious matters which persist to this day in great force and render 
a widespread reform at once necessary and difficult. Literature 
and the arts subserved this rising tide of orthodox feeling and 
strengthened it in every way. The work of Sayana, Madhava and 
others, resulting in the great commentaries on the Vedas and 
on the Smriti of Parasara and in a new codification of the philo- 
sophical systems in the Sarvadarsana-sangraha (‘ Digest of all 
systems of philosophy ’), may be said to have laid the founda- 
tions of this development. The erection of new mandapas , pavil- 
ions and colonnades, as well as gopuras, in all the important 
shrines of the country, and the innumerable gifts to temples 
and learned men for the promotion of religious worship, edu- 
cation and learning that are found recorded in stone inscrip- 
tions all over the country attest the large material support 
given to the movement by the monarchs and the nobles of the

court. Painting, music, drama, indeed all fine arts, gathered 
round the court and the temple and found liberal support from 
both. In one important respect, however, there was a setback. 
In the villages the people seem to have lost a good deal of 
their initiative and come to depend more and more on the 
tender mercies of petty officials appointed and controlled by 
the central government or its representatives. The admirable 
system of autonomous village rule that had been established 
under the Cholas, and that survived intact for several generations 
after them, now fell into neglect and all but disappeared in this 
period, thanks to the pressure of military needs on the emperors 
and the feudatory nayakas. The militarization of the empire 
proved disastrous to some of its most valued civil institutions. 

In narrating briefly the history of the political and cultural 
movements in ancient South India in the following pages, the 
present writer has no thesis to maintain, and any lessons 
that the story may suggest he is well content to let the 
reader draw for himself. His endeavour will be to present 
as simply and clearly as possible a connected narrative of 
ascertained facts with the minimum of comment necessary 
to make the story intelligible. Attention will be confined to 
facts, persons and tendencies of outstanding importance — minor 
details being everywhere eschewed in order not to distract the 
attention of the reader by an array of names and details that 
often serve only to obscure the main trends. 

The study of the subject is still in its initial stages and 
there is scope for widely different views and interpreta- 
tions at almost every stage of the story. The plan of this 
book does not allow of elaborate discussions of rival authorities 
or citations from them, and to this reason and to no other must 
be ascribed the apparently summary and even dogmatic treat- 
ment of controversial topics. Care has always been taken, 
however, to choose the most reasonable reconstructions for 
presentation; but it is too much to expect that all of them will 
satisfy every reader. Several of the conclusions set forth will 
be found argued at some length in the works to which reference 
is made at the end of each chapter. 

* Attention has been concentrated too long on the North, on 
Sanskrit books, and on Indo-Aryan notions,’ said Vincent Smith. 

4 It is time,’ he added, ‘ that due regard should be paid to the

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


non-Aryan element.’ And, before Smith, an Indian scholar. 
Professor Sundaram Pillai, had remarked: 4 The scientific histor- 
ian of India ought to begin his study with the basin of 
the Krishna, of the Kaveri, of the Vaigai, rather than with the 
Gangetic plain, as has been now long, too long, the fashion.’ 
But this cannot yet be done, and it is doubtful if it will ever 
be possible to undertake such a revolutionary, though un- 
doubtedly logical, treatment of the subject. This is due to no 
reluctance on the part of historians to recognize the influence 
of pre-Aryan elements on the formation and growth of Indian 
culture, but to a very real difficulty which was recognized 
by Professor Sundaram Pillai himself. For after affirming that 
India south of the Vindhyas was India proper, where the 
bulk of the people still continue distinctly to retain their pre- 
Aryan features, their pre-Aryan languages and their pre-Aryan 
social institutions, he took care to add: ‘Even here, the pro- 
cess of aryanization has gone indeed too far to leave it easy 
for the historian to distinguish the native warp from the foreign 
woof. But if there is anywhere any chance of such success- 
ful disentanglement, it is in the South; and the farther south 
we go the larger does the chance grow.’ The difficulty of 
distinguishing the Aryan from pre-Aryan elements in Indian 
culture has continued to baffle the skill of modem scholarship 
to this day, and forced attempts to discover 4 Dravidian ’ 
elements has sometimes led to curious results like the attempt 
to derive the name Hanuman from an mandi — an impossible 
contradiction in terms unknown to Tamil — or to connect the 
Sanskrit word puja (worship) with the Tamil words pu (flower) 
and sey (do), on the one hand, or pusu (smear, with unguents 
or the blood of sacrificed animals), on the other. The Indus 
valley excavations have raised more problems than they have 
solved, and until the writing on the numerous seals has been 
satisfactorily deciphered, it will not be easy to decide the 
relation of this culture to that of the Indo-Aryans or of the 
* Dravidians ’ so called. Some attempt will be made in the third 
chapter to give a brief tentative account of the earliest inhabi- 
tants of the land and of their culture, as far as the evidence 
of prehistoric archseology and of probable survivals in later 
times at present enables us to do so; but it must be recognized 
clearly that the systematic study of the prehistory of South

India has just begun, and that our main approach to the historical 
growth of South Indian culture must for the present still continue 
to be made from the North. 

The complaint is often heard that history generally, and 
that of India in particular, tends to be a chronicle of dynasties 
of kings and the endless wars they waged, and devotes little 
attention to the common people and the cultural movements 
that influenced their daily life in a profound manner. The fact 
is that in recent times the conception of history has become 
much wider than it used to be, and changes in polity and 
administration, the development of social and economic in- 
stitutions, and developments in the spheres of religion and 
art claim the attention of the historian much more today than 
ever before. But chronology is the skeleton of history, and for 
the most part the establishment of a dependable chronology 
necessarily rests on an adequate study of political history; and 
when large sections of that history are still in the process of 
being studied and there remains scope for differences of opinion 
on a number of unsettled questions, the historian is obliged to 
devote rather more attention to the political side if he is to make 
his narrative intelligible. Further, the kings and chieftains who 
so much attract our attention were often splendid promoters of 
culture and the arts besides being the upholders of society and 
the protectors of the people. Their history, if pursued on a 
proper scale and with a full knowledge of the sources, will 
often be seen to verge on that true history of the life of the people 
which the critics of dry-as-dust history pine for. 

The ancient history of South India is still a relatively new 
subject of study, and the workers in the field are few; there is 
no dearth of source material, but the progress in its elucidation 
and interpretation has not been as great as one would wish. 
In this book we must pass by all unsettled questions and 
confine ourselves to the more or less established facts; but 
even the general outlines of South Indian history are so little 
known that they deserve to be set forth at some length before 
we proceed to sketch the main lines of cultural movements in 
the land. 

Inscriptions are the most copious and authentic source of 
Indian history, particularly of South Indian history. The 
earliest are in the Brahml script and constitute the southern 



14 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


versions of the Asokan edicts found in Siddapura, Jatinga- 
Ramesvara, and Brahmagiri in Mysore state, Maski in Raichur 
district, and Yerragudi and Rajula-Mandagiri in Kumool district. 
They show the extent of the Mauryan empire in the South, but 
their contents belong to the general history of India and have little 
particular bearing on conditions in the South. Not so the short 
inscriptions found in natural caves in the Tamil districts which 
seem to record the names of the carvers of the rock-cut beds they 
contain or of their occupants; though their script is ASokan 
Brahmi with modifications, the language employed in them 
seems to be the most ancient form of Tamil so far known 
i to epigraphy. These records number only twenty or thirty 
in all, though many more of a similar nature are found in the 
island of Ceylon. These brief records which still continue 
to be enigmatic in some measure are evidence of the spread 
of ascetic orders, probably Jain but also Buddhist, in the 
early centuries before the beginning of the Christian era. To 
the same epoch belong the inscribed relic casket from Bhat- 
tiprolu in the Krishna valley, an early witness to the strong- 
hold of Buddhism in that region, and the early inscriptions 
of the Satavahana dynasty found engraved on the walls and 
pillars of the exquisite cave temples at Kanheri, Karle, Nasik 
and other places in the western Deccan. The language of 
these records is generally a local variety of Prakrit which is 
the generic name for all popular tongues with Sanskritic affilia- 
tions; the script is Brahmi with variations due to locality and 
time; all are engraved on stone. 

In addition to stone inscriptions, copper-plate grants come 
into vogue under the successors of the Satavahanas, and some 
dynasties among them like the Brihatphalayanas are known only 
by a single copper plate. Prakrit continues to be the language 
of the inscriptions till about the fourth century a.d., and then 
Sanskrit comes to be preferred as the sole language of official 
documents by the Kadambas, Gangas and Pallavas for a period 
of two or three centuries. Later inscriptions become b ilin gual, 
employing Sanskrit generally at the beginning and the end, and 
the local speech of the people— Kannada, Telugu or Tamil— 
in the body of the document, particularly when describing in 
detail the gifts made and the boundaries of land given to 
temples, learned men, and so on. From about the tenth 



SURVEY OF THE SOURCES 


15 


century a.d. inscriptions composed altogether in the popular 
speech become very common, though Sanskrit continues to be 
employed wholly or in part in other records and holds an 
honoured place everywhere as the best medium of cultural 
intercourse. The script undergoes many changes and evolves, 
in the Deccan, into the ancestor of the modern Telugu and 
Kannada scripts while farther south its evolution first assumes 
the early form of Grantha known from the Pallava inscriptions 
of the seventh and eighth centuries, and then undergoes 
modifications under the influence of the Tamil alphabet in its 
two forms — Tamil properly so called and Vatteluttu or round 
hand. The origin of these two scripts is by no means definitely 
settled yet. It may be noted, however, that Biihler held it 
probable that the Tamil alphabet was derived from a northern 
alphabet of the fourth or fifth century which in course of time 
was strongly influenced by the Grantha used in the Tamil 
districts for writing Sanskrit. He also pointed out that ‘ the 
Vatteluttu may be described as a cursive script, which bears the 
same relation to the Tamil as the modem northern alphabets 
of the clerks and merchants to their originals, e.g. the Modi of 
the Marathas to the Balbodh and the Takari of the Dogras to 
the Sarada’. The Vatteluttu went out of use in the Tamil 
country about the tenth century a.d. though it continued in 
use till much later on the west coast. 

The early Pallava-Grantha script in the stage when it is 
yet little differentiated from the ancestor of Telugu-Kannada was 
carried by Hindu colonists across the seas to west Java, Borneo 
and Indo-China, the earliest stone inscriptions in this script 
from these places dating from about a.d. 300. The language 
of these early colonial inscriptions is Sanskrit. 

Stone inscriptions begin to increase in number steadily 
from the sixth century onwards, but copper-plate records con- 
tinue to be the mainstay of the historian for some centuries 
more, and at no time can they be left out of the reckoning. 
The history of the early Pandyas from the seventh to the tenth 
century a.d. rests altogether on two long copper-plate records 
which are both bilingual and employ the Grantha script for 
the Sanskrit and the Vatteluttu for the Tamil parts; so also 
the history of the contemporary Pallava line of Simhavishnu is 
derived more from copper plates than from stone inscriptions.

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Almost the whole Eastern Chalukyan history, and much of that of 
the Chalukyas of Badami are also based on copper-plate charters. 
Some of the Chola charters on copper plates attained enormous 
length, being engraved on a large number of good-sized, 
well-turned-out plates strung together on huge rings with a 
big circular seal soldered on them; the most conspicuous 
examples are the Leyden grant of Rajaraja (21st year)— so called 
because it happened to fall into the hands of the Dutch and 
pass into the custody of the Leyden museum — the Tiruvalangadu 
and the Karandai plates of Rajendra I, and the Charala plates of 
Virarajendra (7th year), the long Sanskrit prasasti of which is a 
copy of the Kanyakumari stone inscription of the same monarch. 
The copper plates of the Vijayanagar rulers often employ a 
variety of the Nagari script, known as Nandi Nagari, for 
Sanskrit. Sometimes, but very rarely and only in recent centuries, 
the charters were inscribed on more precious material than 
copper; a charter granted by Vijayaraghava Nayaka of Tanjore 
to the Dutch in 1658, and another to the same power by Ekoji 
in 1676, the former in Telugu and the latter in Tamil, are both 
engraved on silver plates now in the Batavia (Jakarta) museum. 
But copper is the metal prescribed in the law books and the most 
powerful rulers of the land did not employ any other metal. 

Copper plates, however, are apt to be fabricated either 
to establish titles to property or from other motives. Such 
spurious records betray themselves in one way or other, and 
the expert epigraphist generally experiences little difficulty in 
separating the genuine from the false. An exceptionally large 
number of spurious copper plates have brought confusion 
and obscurity into the early history of the Gangas of the 
Mysore country. . 

While copper-plate inscriptions number all together only a 
few hundreds, stone inscriptions amount to several tens of 
thousands. Most of them are records of small gifts of lamps, 
sheep, land, and so on, to temples, and are of little historical 
value. Records of larger gifts, especially when they are made 
by the ruling monarchs, are sometimes of exceptional interest as 
they record details of taxes remitted in favour of donees and 
privileges conferred on them, and furnish other details of 
administrative organization and policy. The T amil inscriptions 
of Chola Rajaraja I on the walls of the Tanjore temple deserve 



SURVEY OF THE SOURCES

special mention for the technical perfection of their engraving 
and the complete and detailed picture they give of the entire 
economy of the Great Temple — a creation of Rajaraja cal- 
culated to symbolize all the glory and grandeur of the empire he 
had built up. Quite a number of other fairly long inscriptions 
give interesting information on the constitution and functions 
of village assemblies, the part played by craft and trade guilds 
in the economic and artistic life of the country, the courses of 
study and the numbers of pupils and teachers in important 
educational centres, and so on. The Tirumukkudal inscription 
of Virarajendra is unique in the list it furnishes of the stock of 
medicines maintained in a hospital in the locality; and the 
Motupalli inscription of Kakatiya Ganapati is one of the very 
few records which give some idea of the conditions of mari- 
time trade. 

Almost every inscription on stone or copper, unless it 
is the very brief record of a mere name or small gift, is 
seen to follow a definite order. The opening is generally an 
invocation, either a brief formula in prose, a verse or some- 
times a number of verses invoking either one deity or several 
deities one after another. Then follows a preamble, the prasasti , 
in which the names and achievements of the ruler and his 
ancestors are narrated, sometimes in a set form which is 
common to several records of the reign; it is this part which 
is generally most valuable to the student of political history. 
After this comes a description of the actual donor, if he 
happens to be other than the king, together with details of 
his achievements and those of his ancestors, with a similar 
but generally briefer description of the donee and his ancestry 
where he is an individual. If the gift is made to a group or 
an institution, that is described in some detail. Next there 
is a description of the object given — money, cattle, taxes, and 
so on; often it is land, and then the boundaries of the land 
are carefully specified. Then comes the formula of gift which 
usually says that it is given with water poured out from the 
hand of the donor into that of the donee for his perpetual 
and undisturbed enjoyment. The record concludes with an im- 
precation on anyone who may terminate the charity or other- 
wise disturb it, and praise of those who will maintain and 
protect it in the future. This analysis of the different parts of 
2 



18 A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 

a typical inscription indicates roughly their relative value to 
the historian. 

Some of the longer inscriptions are dedicatory and com- 
memorative and often contain valuable prasastis of long lines 
of rulers; the Aihole inscription of the reign of Pulakesin II 
and the Talagunda pillar inscription of the Kadambas are 
the most conspicuous examples of this class. But few are 
so purely historical in their contents as the Tiruvendipuram 
inscription of the reign of Chola Rajaraja III which gives an 
unvarnished account of the troubles of this ruler and of the 
manner in which he got relief from the intervention of the 
Hoysalas. Two other inscriptions deserve particular mention. 
One is the fairly long Kudumiyamalai inscription from Pudu- 
kottai region, beautifully engraved in the ornate Pallava Grantha 
of the seventh or eighth century on a wide rock face and con- 
taining groups of musical notes arranged for the benefit of his 
pupils by a king, who was a mahesvara (worshipper of Siva) and 
a pupil of a certain Rudracharya. The other inscription comes 
from Tiruvidaivayil in the Tanjore district and contains an entire 
hymn, otherwise unknown, composed by Nanasambandar to the 
local deity and bearing all the marks of a genuine composition 
of the great saint. 

All the early inscriptions are dated in the regnal years of 
kings, and often there is no guide to absolute chronology 
except the palaeography of the inscriptions; synchronisms are 
rare, but very decisive where they clearly occur. The first 
mention of the Saka era by name is found in the Badami 
rock inscription of Pulakesin I, dated Saka 465 (a.d. 543), 
recording the fortification of the hill of Vatapi by that 
monarch, the existence of this record was brought to light 
only in 1941. Later inscriptions, whether they bear Saka 
dates or not, often contain astronomical details which do not 
always work out satisfactorily; in some cases, there is no way 
of reconciling all the data given in the inscriptions, and 
our choice must depend on the probabilities and remain to 
some extent arbitrary. One inscription in the reign of the 
Chola Parantaka I from South Arcot is dated by counting the 
number of days that had elapsed since the commencement of 
the Raliyuga and the date arrived at supplies satisfactory 
verification of the other details recorded. In giving the regnal 



SURVEY OF THE SOURCES

years of kings, the Pandyan inscriptions often mention one 
year opposite another; the exact significance of this has not 
been understood, and epigraphists are agreed in adding up the 
figures and treating the total as the year of the reign when 
the inscription was issued. 

Inscriptions can by no means be said always to speak the 
truth, much less the whole truth: legends and exaggeration 
| are often found, and easily recognized as such; more difficult 

* is the task of detecting the truth behind partisan statements 
made by the composers of records of different dynasties 
engaged in constant warfare. The instances are not few in 
which both parties claim victory in a war, and there is often some 
kind of justification for the claim. And much work still remains 
to be done in the study and interpretation of the social and 
economic information contained in the inscriptions — work that 
has been delayed mainly by the slackness of the Epigraphical 
Department in publishing the texts. 

Closely allied to the evidence of inscriptions on stone 
and copper is that of the shorter legends on coins. But the 
coinage of South India * presents greater difficulties to the 
student and offers less reward for his labours than that of the 
North \ Really ancient coins are rare and contain no dates 
and few intelligible legends, often only the ruler’s name 
or title; also, the devices upon them are often crude and 
indistinct. The rectangular pieces of impure silver bearing 
several punch-marks, the puranas (eldlings) of the law books, 
were common to both Northern and Southern India and 
certainly belong to the centuries before Christ; copper punch- 
marked coins were also known, and this type of coinage 
may be taken to have gone out of circulation about a.d. 200. In 
later times the principal coinage of the South was struck in gold, 
not silver; copper was used for smaller denominations. Of gold 
V coins there were generally two denominations: the varaha — 
i perhaps deriving its name from the Chalukya crest of a boar; also 

1 called pon, hurt , pagoda (from bhagayatil ) and pardaos (Portu- 

guese) — usually weighing a kalanju (Molucca bean), or 50 to 60 
! grains; and the fanam , being a tenth of the varaha , its weight, 
5 to 6 grains, conforming to the manjadi. The earliest gold coins 
are spherules of plain gold bearing a minute punch-mark; a little 
later came the padma-tankas which were thin cup-shaped pieces 



20 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


stamped with punches, at first on one side only and then on both; 
the gold coins of Rajendra I and Rajadhiraja I Chola, and of 
Rajaraja I E. Chalukya, discovered at Dowlesvaram in 1946, are 
marked and inscribed on one side only; and finally came 
the die-struck pieces of which the thick, small Vijayanagar 
pagodas are the best surviving specimens. There was a general 
preference for small coins and the silver tares of Calicut, only 
one or two grains in weight, furnish some of the smallest 
specimens of coins known. 

During the early centuries of the Christian era Roman 
imperial coins of gold and silver were imported in considerable 
quantity in the course of trade and circulated freely in the 
country; the small copper coins bearing Roman devices and 
legends might have been locally produced by foreign settlers. 
The Satavahanas used lead for many of their issues, and their 
coins bear legends of the names of kings which confirm the 
Puranic lists of these names. One of the most interesting 
types of these coins is that bearing a two-masted ship on the 
obverse, an indication of the maritime power and activity of 
the Andhras; the same design is found on some copper coins of 
about the same date or a little later from farther south. 

The earliest padma-tankas were perhaps struck by the 
Kadambas; but one of the coins that can be most satisfactorily 
dated is a base silver piece with a lion device and the title 
Vishamasiddhi on the obverse which clearly belongs to Vishnu- 
f vardhana (615-33), the founder of the long line of Eastern 
Chalukya rulers. The practice of punch-marking on the gold 
coinage lingered long after its disuse on silver and copper, and 
a large hoard of coins struck by the Telugu-Chodas of Neliore in 
the thirteenth century, found in 1913 at Kodur, shows that the 
padma-tanka type had a long history and wide ramifications, 
Nagari legends, generally incomplete, appear on Kakatiya coins 
and continue in those of Vijayanagar; they are also found on the 
coins of some other dynasties like the Kadambas of Goa and the 
Cholas. The legends on coins of other dynasties are in 
Kannada, Telugu or Tamil according to the locality in which 
they were struck. 

Conquests are often indicated by designs on coins; thus 
the Chola coins portray a tiger seated under a canopy in the 
centre of the field, with the Pandya fish on one side and the 



SURVEY OF THE SOURCES

Chera bow at the bottom, the latter symbols being smaller and 
less prominent than the tiger. 

The pagodas of many Vijayanagar kings are known; they 
are small and dumpy, and were issued also in their half and 
quarter divisions. Their legends were at first either in Kannada 
or Nagari, while later kings used Nagari exclusively. 

The coinage of the short-lived sultanate of Madura, usually 
in billon and copper, follows the contemporary Delhi models 
and is hardly distinguishable from Delhi issues except by its 
southern type of calligraphy. The gold and silver coins of the 
Bahmani sultans also followed the Delhi patterns on a more 
generous scale. In those of earlier reigns there is some variety 
in arrangement and design, but later a single design was adopted 
for both metals. The earliest copper closely followed that of 
Delhi, but innovations soon appeared, and the copper standard 
underwent many and frequent changes. The five sultanates that 
succeeded the Bahmani kingdom had their own separate issues, 
though not so well turned out. 

Literary evidence is the next important source of knowledge. 
It is both indigenous and foreign. In all Indian literature there 
are few professedly historical works. There are indeed some 
temple chronicles like the Maduraittala-varaldru,<i nd the Srirangam- 
kdyil-olugu. While furnishing valuable hints on comparatively 
recent times, say from 1 200 onward, they are nothing more than 
a farrago of legends for the earlier times and contain too many 
inaccuracies and distortions to be used by themselves without 
the testimony of other more trustworthy sources. The semi- 
historical works that were produced at the beginning of the 
nineteenth century to the orders of Col. Colin Mackenzie do 
not concern us as they deal with recent events outside the scope 
of this book. The Kongu-desa-rdjakkal caritram and the Keraldt- 
patti in its various recensions have often been overrated and are 
in fact of very little value; so too are the numberless sthala - 
puranas , mostly recent redactions of popular legends. Ballads like 
the Rdmappayyan-ammanai are in a somewhat better class, but 
no early specimens of such popular quasi-historical material have 
survived. 

While the direct contribution to history from literary sources 
is thus seen to be of little importance, the indirect value to 
the historian of a study of the literatures of the country can 



22 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


hardly be overrated. Not only do they enable him to picture 
the social and religious milieu in which the characters of history 
lived and moved and acted, but the prologues, epilogues and 
colophons of different works often embody valuable data on 
the lineage and achievements of the authors of the works and 
their royal patrons, and these often eke out the scrappy informa- 
tion drawn from inscriptions. The history of South Indian 
literatures in Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada will be briefly 
reviewed in the chapter on literature, and mention need be made 
here only of some outstanding facts of general interest. 

The later Vedic literature and the epics, though composed 
in the North and mainly preoccupied with that country, contain 
unmistakable hints of the progressive penetration of North 
Indian influences in the southern lands, and these constitute 
almost the only source of our knowledge about this important 
movement of culture. The earliest extant stratum of Tamil 
literature, that of the 3angam Age, exhibits clearly the results 
of this movement. It reveals to us a fairly well-developed 
civilization evolved out of the harmonious blending of much 
that was borrowed from the incoming northern culture with 
that already in existence. The details of this most interesting 
chapter of human history are here as elsewhere hidden from 
our view. But none can miss the significance of the facts, 
that early Tamil literature, the earliest to which we have access,, 
is already fully charged with words, conceptions and institutions 
of Sanskritic and northern origin, while it is characterized by a 
direct and forceful expression and an unrivalled vividness and 
realism all its own. The independence of the framework of the 
language and a good part of its vocabulary, and of many of the 
social institutions and conventions reflected in this literature, is 
also very clearly seen. Legends bearing on this blend of cultures 
are preserved both in the northern and southern literatures; 
though legend is not history, the historian can never afford alto- 
gether to neglect the memory of races which often takes these 
fascinating if enigmatic shapes. 

Some types of the prabandha class of literature in Tamils 
such as the kalambakam , uld, parani and kovai, narrate much 
history by the way, especially if they happen to be the composi- 
tions of court poets who chose their royal patrons as the heroes 
of their poems. A Pandik-kdvai is cited extensively in an 



SURVEY OF THE SOURCES 


23 


ancient commentary on the celebrated Iraiyanar Agapporul ; 
though the verses of the kovai mention the names of several 
battles fought by the Pandya rulers of the line of Kadungon, 
yet the hero of the poem seems to have been not any single king 
of the line, but a composite figure to whom the poet attributes 
the achievements of the entire dynasty; the adoption of such 
literary conventions was quite common, and without great caution 
one is apt to be easily misled by them. The Nandik-kalambakam , 
which has Pallava Nandivarman III for hero, is much more 
trustworthy and of real value on the history of the time. 
Somewhat richer in historical content are a few works of a quasi- 
historical nature that belong to the imperial Chola period; 
* prominent among them are the Kalingattup-parani of Jayangondar, 
treating of the invasion of Kalinga by the Chola forces in the 
reign of Kulottunga I, and the three ulas of Ottakkuttan on 
three successive monarchs — Vikrama Chola, Kulottunga II and 
Rajaraja II. In Kannada, the Pampa-bharata and Raima’s Gada- 
yuddha , though mainly devoted to themes from the Great Epic, 
shed much welcome light on contemporary Rashtrakuta and 
Chalukya history because the authors have chosen to identify 
their patrons with some of the epic characters and find occasion 
to introduce into their narrative several historical incidents 
very well known to them. Bilhana’s Vikramankadeva-carita, a 
Sanskrit kavya not devoid of poetic quality, is not nearly so useful 
to history as some of the Tamil and Kannada works just 
mentioned. 

For the history of Vijayanagar, Indian literary evidence 
becomes very voluminous. Much of this has become accessible 
in two handy collections of select sources brought out by the 
University of Madras. Though the class of works known as 
Kalajhdnas , purporting to be prophecies of the future by seers, 
are not as helpful as one would expect, the value of this litera- 
ture as a whole lies in the necessary corrective it furnishes to biased 
accounts written by the Muslim historians of the Bahmani kingdom 
and its succession states. 

The Muslims gave themselves much more to genuine his- 
torical working than the Hindus, and a number of historical 
works were composed in Persian under the patronage of 
Muslim monarchs in the Deccan. Many, however, have either 
perished or are still to see the light of day; Ferishta mentions 



24 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


several works which he used in the composition of his great 
history but they are no longer accessible. The most important 
among those that survive and bear on the period covered by 
this book may be briefly noticed here. The Futuh-us-salatin 
by Isamy is the only extant contemporary work on the history 
of the Bahmanl kingdom. The author was the grandson 
of an old Sipah Salar Isamy who was compelled by Sultan 
Muhammad bin Tughlak to leave Delhi for Daulatabad in 
a.d. 1327; the grandfather died on the way, but young Isamy 
made his home there. He attached himself to the first 
Bahmani sultan, began to write his work in 1358 and com- 
pleted it the next year. Modelled on the Shah Namd of 
Firdausi, the work is written in limpid verse and narrates 
the history of the sultanate of Delhi to the time of Mu- 
hammad bin Tughlak. It then gives a vivid picture of the 
years of political turmoil in the Deccan which preceded the 
foundation of the Bahmanl kingdom besides much valuable 
and accurate information on the Muslim conquest of the Deccan 
and South India and on the reign and character of the first 
Bahmanl sultan. Other works on the Bahmanl kingdom were 
late compositions written long after the extinction of the 
sultanate and from the particular standpoint of one or other 
of the succession states. Notable among them is the Burhan-i- 
maasir of Ali bin Aziz-ullah Taba Tabai of Simmln (Persia) — 
a contemporary of the more famous Ferishta, and like him at 
first a courtier of the Nizam Shahi kingdom of Ahmadnagar. 
Little is known of the life and activities of Taba Tabai; he 
began his history in 1591 and completed it in the next five 
years. It is a history of the Nizam Shahis to which is pre- 
fixed an account of the Bahmani sultans as an introduction. 
His bias in favour of his patrons is evident throughout his 
narrative; but in some respects his statements seem to be 
more authentic than those of Ferishta and better in accord 
with the evidence from coins. But beyond a shadow of doubt 
Ferishta is the prince of Muslim historians of the period. 
The wide range and sweep of his work which forms a general 
history of Muslim rule in India, the number of authorities 
he consulted, and the general sense of perspective that 
dominates the entire narration impart a monumental character 
to his history. Covering wide ground, and often at second hand.

he is sometimes inaccurate in detail: writing in the court 
of the Adil Shahis of Bijapur at the instance of Ibrahim II, 
he narrates Deccan affairs in a way that puts his patrons 
in the most favourable light. There is no doubt that this 
history, finished in 1606, is the most comprehensive and read- 
able account of Indian Islam. A Persian by birth, Muhammad 
Kasim Hindu Shah Ferishta came to Ahmadnagar with his 
father at the age of twelve in 1582. The father became tutor 
to a Nizam Shahi prince, but died soon after. Young Ferishta 
look to a military career, but a palace revolution deprived him 
of his position as captain of the king’s guard. Being a Shiah 
nnd having few friends at Ahmadnagar, he migrated to Bijapur 
where he obtained an appointment in the army. We do not know 
iow and when he changed the sword for the pen and found his 
true vocation. 

Another work, also written from the standpoint of Bijapur, 
is the Tazkirat-ul-muluk by a Persian merchant from Shiraz, 
known as Shiraz! on that account. His business brought him 
to Sagar on the Krishna in 1560, and he entered Adil Shahi 
service in 1574. He wrote his work between the years 1608 
and 1610; apparently of not much value for Bahmani affairs, 
it is a contemporary account of some aspects of Bijapur history 
giving many details not otherwise known. Of the four historians 
noticed here, three came directly from Persia and all of them 
wrote in Persian, signal proof of the great influence of Persia on 
Indo-Muslim culture. ’Abd Allah Shiraz! Wassaf, a Persian writing 
in Persia early in the fourteenth century, had access to information 
on contemporary occurrences in the Tamil country, and he gives 
some valuable data on the civil war in the Pandyan country and 
conditions of trade prevalent at that time. 

Notices of Southern India by foreign writers are often both 
instructive and interesting. Speaking generally, the earliest ac- 
counts are those of the Greek and Roman writers whose references 
to India gain in extent and accuracy to the end of the second 
century a.d. Then we have the Chinese travellers and annalists, 
the subjects of researches that are still in progress. From the 
eighth century the writings of Arab merchants and travellers, 
historians and geographers begin to be important, and the Chinese 
sources become more copious and definite than before. We also 
have occasional notices by European travellers like Benjamin 


26 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


of Tudela and Marco Polo. After the end of the fourteenth 
century the number of foreign travellers and writers increases 
greatly; at first Portuguese and Italians predominate, but soon 
Dutchmen, Englishmen and others join in. 

Among classical writers, the first direct notice of South 
India occurs in Megasthenes who gives a quaint account 
of the Pandyan kingdom ruled over by Pandaia, a daughter 
of Herakles to ‘whom he assigned that portion of India 
which lies southward and extends to the sea The kingdom 
was organized into 365 villages; one village had to bring the 
royal tribute to the treasury every day and, if necessary, assist 
the queen in collecting it from defaulters. Trade between 
South India and Egypt was carried on in the Hellenistic period 
and continued more actively under the Roman empire. Strabo- 
records the increase in the knowledge of India among the 
Romans of his day and the success of the expedition under 
Gallus, sent by Augustus (25 B.c.) to secure for the empire the 
command of Aden and the Red Sea route to India which was 
becoming increasingly popular among the merchants of the 
empire. Pliny the Elder (c. a.d. 75), the anonymous author of 
the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea , and Ptolemy (a.d. 130) 

represent the further stages in that increasing acquaintance of 
the Romans with the countries of the east of which we get the 
first hints in Strabo. While Pliny and Ptolemy derived their 
information from other writers, the author of the Periplusr 
certainly visited many of the ports of western India and had a 
direct knowledge of the conditions of trade that prevailed there. 
However, he seems to have had little knowledge of the east 
coast. Ptolemy’s geography, on the other hand, takes account 
of the east coast of India and of much of Farther India as well. 
The most notable name after Ptolemy is that of the crotchety 
Byzantine monk Cosmas (c. a.d. 550) called Indikopleustes 
(‘ the man who sailed to India ’). A merchant in his early life^ 
he visited many places on the Persian Gulf, on the west coast 
of India and as far east as Ceylon. His Christian Topography 
has been characterized, not very unjustly, as ‘ a continent of 
mud ’ from which we may extract, however, ‘ a few geographical 
fossils of considerable interest \ 

Intercourse between China and South India by sea as early 
as the second century b.c. is attested to by the record of a

Chinese embassy to Kanchl (‘Houang-tche’) and the discovery 
of a Chinese coin of about the same date from Chandravalli in 
Mysore. Entries in the Chinese annals of the third, fourth, and 
fifth centuries a.d. show clearly that the Hindu kingdoms of 
Indo-China and the archipelago were in active touch with South 
India on the one side and China on the other: they are said to 
have sent to the Chinese court on many occasions presents of 
vaidurya (the semi-precious ‘ cat’s eye ’), sandalwood and pearls 
which are specifically South Indian products. Fa-hien did not 
visit the mainland of South India: he took ship from Tamluk 
to Ceylon, and his account of the Deccan and the ‘ pigeon 
monastery ’ is just edifying gossip. Many Buddhist monks went 
from South India and Ceylon to China by sea and settled 
there, helping to spread Buddhism in that land and to translate 
Buddhist scriptures into Chinese. Cosmas mentions the arri- 
val of Chinese ships bringing silk to Ceylon. The celebrated 
Yuan Chwang, Master of the Law (of Buddhism), travelled 
much more extensively in India than any of his compatriots 
who came on similar missions, and on the whole he was 
much less of a recluse than they. He spent a number of 
months in the states of the Deccan and South India (a.d. 
641-2) and has left behind interesting observations on the 
religious and social conditions that prevailed in these lands in 
his day; but even he does not completely satisfy the curiosity 
of modem students, and it has been said of him: ‘ He was not 
a good observer, a careful investigator, or a satisfactory re- 
corder, and consequently he left very much untold which he 
would have done well to tell.’ I-tsing who spent many years 
in India in the last quarter of the seventh century did not 
visit South India and has nothing directly to tell us about it. 
But his works are valuable for the itineraries they contain, for 
their notices of differences in doctrine and practice among the 
Buddhists of different lands and, above all, for the brief 
biographies of about sixty eminent monks who visited India 
at the same time as he. There are records in the Chinese 
annals of embassies exchanged between China and the Pallava 
court of Kanchl in the eighth century and the Chola court in 
the eleventh. A fair amount of trade was carried on between 
China and South India in the following centuries and Chinese 
junks visited Indian waters pretty freely. The great Mongol 



28 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


emperor Kublai Khan sent a number of embassies to South 
Indian states and some of them even sought to influence 
the course of local politics; with what results we are not in a 
position to judge. A Chinese merchant, Wang Ta-yiian, visited 
a number of foreign countries for purposes of trade between 
the years 1330 and 1349, and wrote the TaoA-chi-lio {Descrip- 
tion of the Barbarians of the Isles). This work, poor in style 
but marked by the wide learning and philosophic turn of the 
author’s mind, describes no fewer than ninety-nine countries, 
ports and noteworthy localities, and is valuable as the account 
of an eye-witness. Colombo, the Maldives, Kayangulam, Eli 
and Calicut are among the places he described. In the first 
quarter of the fifteenth century a.d., the third emperor of 
the Ming dynasty sent out a series of stupendous naval ex- 
peditions calculated to establish the fame and supremacy of 
the dynasty over many lands; this prompted a number of 
foreign rulers in their turn to send embassies to the Chinese 
court. No fewer than seven of these expeditions reached South 
India under the command of the famous Cheng Ho. He was 
accompanied on these expeditions by Fei Hsin and Ma Huan 
who have left behind accounts of the different countries 
they visited. Fei Hsin’s Hsing-cha-sheng-lan or Description 
of the Star Raft (1436) and Ma Huan’s Ying-yai-sheng-Ian 
( Description of the Coasts of the Ocean , 1451) are particularly 
valuable for their notices of Ceylon, Cochin and Calicut in the 
interval between Ibn Batuta’s travels and the arrival of the 
Portuguese. 

Arab travellers and geographers begin to be a valuable 
source from the ninth century a.d. Much of the trade of the 
Indian Ocean was in the hands of Arabs from very early times, 
and with the rise of Islam there came a sudden expansion, 
the effects of which were not confined to religion and politics 
but spread to commerce and science. Muslim merchants en- 
joyed great prestige as the Prophet himself had been one of 
them. Before the end of the seventh century a colony of 
Muslim merchants had established themselves in Ceylon, and 
in 758 the Arabs and Persians settled in Canton were suffi- 
ciently numerous for them to be able to raise a tumult in the 
city and profit by the resulting confusion. Ibn Khurdadbeh, 
a Persian Muslim of Magian descent, is the first writer who 



SURVEY OF THE SOURCES 


29 


claims mention here; his Book of Routes and Kingdoms , com- 
posed between 844 and 848 and still being revised in 885, 
covers wide ground but presents facts in a dry and often incom- 
plete manner. Then, Abu Zaid Hassan of Siraf on the Persian 
Gulf, no great traveller himself, had many opportunities of 
meeting much-travelled merchants and scholars, the celebrated 
Masudi among them. Abu Zaid declares (916) that his object 
was to supplement an earlier work on India and China with 
data drawn from his own studies and talks with persons who 
had travelled in the eastern countries. Abu Zaid’s predecessor 
who wrote his work in 851 has often been identified with the 
merchant Suleiman who seems, however, to have been only 
one of the sources of information commanded by that unknown 
writer. I bn al-Faklh, another writer of the early tenth century 
who slightly preceded Abu Zaid and Masudi, also drew largely 
upon this anonymous writer; in fact it is a common trait of 
Arab writers to copy one another extensively and this absolves 
us from noticing in any detail many other authors of the tenth 
century. The illustrious Alberuni (1030) has little on South 
India and the celebrated historian and geographer Abulfeda 
(1273-1331) marks no great advance in knowledge relating to 
India. His notices of South India are brief, vague and second- 
hand, though he cites quite often the inveterate traveller and 
geographer Ibn Said (1214-86). The last and perhaps the 
most important Arab writer we must notice is the indefatigable 
Moorish explorer Ibn Batuta. Born in Tangier about 1300, he 
left his native place at the age of twenty-two, and continued 
to travel incessantly for the next thirty years. He died at Fez 
in 1377. He spent many years in India during the time when 
the mad tyranny of Muhammad bin Tughlak drove all the 
governors of provinces into open revolt, and led to the rise of 
independent kingdoms in different parts of the empire. By 
profession a doctor of the Muhammadan law and traditions, he 
was a good liver and keen observer of men and affairs. A good 
part of his work is devoted to an account of his travels 
and experiences in South India, and contains much accurate 
information on the state of politics, religion and society at 
the time. 

To turn lastly to the European travellers in India after 
Cosmas, it has been doubted if the Jewish traveller from Spain, 



30 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Benjamin of Tudela (c. 1170), ever visited India, though he 
has some interesting remarks to offer on Quilon and its 
trade. With Marco Polo, the ‘ prince of medieval travellers \ 
begins a new epoch in the direct contacts between Europe and 
the East. He reached the court of Kublai Khan after a 

hazardous journey of three and a half years across Asia. He 
spent seventeen years in the Mongol court where he became a 
great favourite of the Khan and was employed on many 
important missions. Finally he was chosen to escort a princess 
of the Khan’s family on her bridal journey to the ruler of 
Persia. He left China in 1292 and his voyage to Persia through 
the Indian seas lasted about a year and a half. Thence he 
travelled to Constantinople and returned to Venice finally in 
1295. He was only passing through some parts of South India 
on his way to Persia, but the amount of information he was 
able to collect is indeed surprising. His veracity and just- 
ness of observation were doubted for a long time, but this 
is no longer so. He has much to tell on the manners, beliefs, 
and practices of the people of South India, and on their 
maritime trade. ‘ The commerce of India he found stretch- 
ing, like an immense chain, from the territories of Kublai 
Khan to the shores of the Persian Gulf and of the Red 
Sea. He found the shores and the islands of the Indian Sea 
luxuriantly covered with nature’s choicest products. . . He 
tells us of the topaz, the amethyst, and the emerald, of the 
sapphires of Ceylon, and the diamonds of Golconda.’ 

If the Venetian merchant represents one side of the culture- 
contacts between the West and East, the three monks who 
visited South India soon after Marco Polo represent another. 
First among them was the Franciscan friar, John of Monte 
Corvino, who travelled in 1292-3 by way of India to China to 
preach the gospel in that vast land of paganism and, what he 
considered little better, Nestorianism. This lonely monk was 
out of sympathy with much that met his eye in India, and 
with him may be said to begin the stream of Christian mission- 
ary criticism of Indian life and habits which has not always 
been either intelligent or charitable. Nearly 30 years later 
came Friar Odoric of Pordenone who reached India soon after 
1321. He travelled along the west coast, visited Ceylon and 
went up to the shrine of St Thomas in ‘ Mailapur \ His 



SURVEY OF THE SOURCES 


31 


account of some Hindu customs and practices is obviously that 
of an eye-witness. Lastly we have Friar Jordanus who may have 
reached India a little before Odoric. Two of his letters are 
dated from India in 1321 and 1324; in both, he holds out to his 
brother friars in Europe the prospect of extensive missionary 
work in the East. His mention of the Parsis and their mode of 
exposing the dead is among the earliest notices of this com- 
munity in India. He was appointed Bishop of Columbum 
(Quilon) in 1328, but it is not known if he actually took charge 
of the office. Yet another monk, John of Marignolli, a native 
of Florence, deserves a passing mention; he went out to China 
by land, like Marco Polo, as papal legate to the court of the 
Great Khan; he left China by sea from the celebrated port of 
Zayton in 1346 and reached Quilon where he spent some time 
before setting sail for the Coromandel Coast to visit the shrine 
of St Thomas. He also spent some time in Ceylon and gives an 
interesting account of the Buddhist monks of the Island. 

The rise of Vijayanagar in the fourteenth century and of 
the Portuguese power in the East a little later attracted many 
foreigners to India, and as a consequence foreign evidence on 
South India increases vastly in volume, variety and interest. 
We cannot possibly go over all this evidence here, but must 
confine our attention to those sections of it which are of 
particular value to us. The earliest European visitor to 
Vijayanagar whose account has come down to us is the Italian 
Nicolo Conti who came to the city in 1420 or 1421; he wrote 
nothing himself, but narrated his experiences to a papal secretary 
who wrote them down in Latin for his master’s information; 
this was translated into Portuguese and from Portuguese into 
Italian. The original Latin version is not extant. Conti gives 
a description of the Vijayanagar court and its festivals, its 
currency and other matters. At about the same time, there 
came to Vijayanagar the Persian ambassador Abdur Razzak, sent 
on an important mission to the Zamorin by Shah Rukh. He sailed 
to Calicut from Ormuz in 1442, and did not much like that city. 
His stay there was cut short by a message from the Raja of 
Vijayanagar asking that he should be sent on to the capital 
without delay. Abdur Razzak went to Vijayanagar by way of 
Mangalore, was well received and witnessed the Mahanavami 
festival. Later some jealous merchants from Ormuz cast doubts 



32 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


on his credentials with the result that the ambassador came to 
be treated with less consideration than before; he left Vijayanagar 
for Mangalore towards the end of 1443, and Mangalore for 
Persia early in 1444. The record of his mission is the testimony^ 
of a trained official on the state of administration and society at 
the time. 

The Russian trader Athanasius Nikitin spent some years, 
in the Deccan round about 1470 and travelled in the Bahmani 
kingdom which he entered by way of Chaul. His observations 
give details of the court, the army, and the condition of the 
people under Bahmani rule. Ludovico di Varthema of Bologna,, 
an Italian gentleman and soldier who was eventually knighted 
by the Portuguese, travelled in India during the years 1502-& 
and has left behind a vivid record of his experiences. His credi- 
bility was doubted for a long time, but wrongly. His account 
of Goa and Calicut and other ports of the west coast and of 
the effects on them of the advent of the Portuguese, and his 
description of the city and empire of Vijayanagar, contain much 
that is interesting and valuable. The Portuguese Duarte Barbosa 
served the government of his country in India from 1500 to 
about 1516; he knew the Malayalam language very well and 
‘ spoke it better than the natives of his country \ He was feitor 
(factor) in Cannanore in 1502, and acted as interpreter between 
Francisco Albuquerque and the king of Cannanore in 1503. He 
was valued as a writer by Gaspar Correa, and was employed 
by Alfonso D’Albuquerque for his ability, though he did not 
support the policy of developing Goa at the expense of Cochin 
and Cannanore. Barbosa returned to Portugal between 1517 and 
1518 and then gave the final touches to his narrative which covers 
much wider ground than the sphere of his official activities and 
includes a full description of Vijayanagar. The value of other 
Portuguese writers for the history of the sixteenth century has 
been sufficiently recognized since Sewell emphasized it generally 
in A Forgotten Empire (1900) which included translations 
of the chronicles of Domingos Paes (c. 1520-2) and of Femao 
Nuniz, a horse-dealer who spent three years in Vijayanagar 
(1535-7), besides part of a letter written from Cochin by 
Manuel Barradas (12 December 1616) giving an account 
of the origin and course of the civil war then in progress in 
the kingdom of Vijayanagar. Caesar Frederick, who visited

Vijayanagar a couple of years after the battle of Talikota 
(Rakshasi-Tangadi), Ralph Fitch who spent the years 1583-91 
in India, Nicolas Pimenta, Visitor of the Jesuits in India at the 
close of the sixteenth century, the Dutch traveller John Huighen 
van Linschoten (1583) are other writers who have their own 
contribution to make to our knowledge of South India in their 
day. The contemporary Jesuit letters from South India often 
embody passing, but vivid, references to political events of the 
early seventeenth century. The affairs and trade of the king- 
dom of Golconda and the port of Masulipatam at that time 
receive much elucidation from the writings of the Dutch factor 
Schorer (1615) and the English factor William Methwold 
(1618-22), which have been edited by Moreland together with 
another Dutch account, anonymous, dating from about the 
same time. 

This sketch of our foreign sources may be closed with the 
mention of Pietro della Valle who has been described as the 
most eminent among those who travelled for pleasure, with no 
motive of trade or service, 4 the most intelligent in apprehension 
and the most accurate in description \ He was bom in Rome 
in 1586 and sailed for India from Bandar Abbas in January 
1623. He visited Cambay, Ahmadabad, Chaul, Goa, Ikkeri, 
Mangalore and Calicut, and sailed back from Goa to Muscat 
in November 1624. His letters ‘bring before the mind’s eye a 
vivid and life-like representation of men and manners as they 
existed in the early part of the seventeenth century in the 
Portuguese settlements on the coast and in the native territories 
adjacent to them \

CHAPTER II 


THE LAND IN RELATION TO HISTORY 

North and South — the peninsula — the Western Ghats — passes and trade 
routes — the Eastern Ghats — the Deccan plateau — rainfall and vegetation — 
changes in coast level — drainage — the Godavari — the Krishna, Bhima and 
Tungabhadra — the Kaveri — the Narmada — the Tapti — ports — western coast 
strip — the east coast — river deltas — Coromandel coast. 

In this chapter we shall attempt to give a general description 
of the geography of the country to serve as the foundation for 
the historical chapters which follow. Our concern is primarily 
with the land lying to the south of the Vindhyas, that rugged 
mountainous tract varying much in width and elevation and 
stretching almost east to west along the Tropic of Cancer. On 
the northern side of the Vindhyas the slope is gentle and there 
are no well-marked spurs or steep valleys; on the southern side, 
however, there is a steep fall from the crest to the valley of the 
Narmada, and we have a mountain wall buttressed by several 
forest-clad spurs overlooking the deep, narrow trough of the 
river bounded on the south by the Satpura-Mahadeo-Maikal 
range. From the southern slopes of the Satpuras the Tapti 
flows parallel to the Narmada to the west and the Mahanadi 
to the Bay of Bengal in the east. This double wall effectively 
divides the peninsular South from the plains of North India, 
but not in a manner that hinders seriously the intercommuni- 
cation between the two regions. From prehistorical times to 
the present day there has been no period when the two regions 
did not influence each other politically and culturally, and on 
at least three occasions before the advent of British rule both 
the North and the South formed parts of a single empire 
embracing nearly the whole of India. 

The peninsula juts out into the Indian Ocean between the 
Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal and narrows to a point at Cape 
Comorin. From Cape Comorin the Malabar and Coromandel 
coasts extend for a thousand miles, the one to the north-west, 
and the other at first northward and then to the north-east. 
There are few good natural harbours along either coast, though 
the west coast is a little better than the Coromandel coast in

this respect, as places like Cochin, Goa and Bombay offer fairly 
safe anchorages for ships. Located half-way on the maritime 
routes from the Mediterranean and Africa to China, peninsular 
India developed and maintained a fairly brisk maritime trade 
with the nations on either side, and had a large share in the 
colonization of the eastern lands across the Bay of Bengal. And 
its rulers, at least some of them like the Satavahanas, Pallavas 
and Cholas, are known to have devoted particular care to the 
maintenance of a strong navy. The Malabar coast retained 
for many centuries an unenviable reputation for the piratical 
activity of its sailors, while the mariners of the Chola country 
came to be looked upon as authorities on sailing conditions in 
the Indian Ocean and were cited by the Arab geographers of the 
Middle Ages. An early account of the ports of peninsular India 
and the conditions of maritime trade is found in the Periplus of 
the Erythraean Sea . 

The nucleus of the peninsula is a triangular block of very 
old rocks that covers its greater part from the Satmala-Ajanta 
ranges to the Nilgiris. This has a typical plateau relief: its 
western edge is a steep brink, the Western Ghats, overlooking 
the west coast formed by a narrow strip of rough, wet lowland; 
its surface has a gentle fall to a lower brink in the east, the 
Eastern Ghats. Between the Eastern Ghats and the Coromandel 
coast is a belt of lowland, the Carnatic, much wider, smoother 
and relatively drier than the western strip. 

Seen from the west the Western Ghats present the appear- 
ance of a gigantic sea-wall, often rising in steps from the shore- 
line — hence the name ‘ ghats \ They are a steep and rugged 
mass of hills, little more than 2,000 feet above sea-level at the 
northern end, rising to more than 4,000 about the latitude of 
Bombay, generally increasing in altitude towards the south 
and culminating in the Nilgiris with Dodabetta at a height 
of 8,760 feet where the Eastern Ghats meet the Western after 
making a sweep from the other side of the peninsula. Immedi- 
ately south of the Nilgiri plateau lies the only break in the 
continuity of the Western Ghats, the Palghat or Coimbatore 
gap, which is about twenty miles from north to south and 
affords lowland access from the Carnatic to the Malabar coast at 
a level of about a thousand feet above the sea. This easy road 
into the Carnatic from Cochin and Calicut and other ports on the

west has played an important role all through history. South of 
the gap, the ghats reach an even greater height in Anaimudi peak 
(8,841 ft.) and strike SSE., terminating at the extremity of the 
peninsula in Cape Comorin. The crest line of the ghats is generally 
at a distance of from fifty to one hundred miles from the 
Arabian Sea although in places it approaches so close to the shore 
as to restrict the width of the coastal plain to no more than five 
miles, and it is not uncommon for spurs and ridges to end as 
cliffs along the coast. 

North of Goa the surface of the ghats is largely covered 
by an immense thickness of basaltic lava-flows — the Deccan 
trap of Indian geology. They reach their maximum thickness 
about the latitude of Bombay. ‘ The weathering action of ages 
has shaped the trap formation into natural citadels and fortresses 
which dominate the crest of the hills, and were found most 
useful as military positions in the wild days of Maratha 
supremacy.’ The uplands round Poona being clothed with the 
volcanic cotton soil are quite as fertile as the alluvial valleys of 
the Narmada and Tapti rivers. South of Goa, however, the 
ghats become a series of gneisses and schists, much more resistant 
than the lava-capped belt. 

‘ South of Bombay the seaward face of the hills is clothed 
with dense forest, and passes inland from the coast are few. 
But in the north the interior plateau is approached by several 
roads, famous in history, from the level coast strip on the 
western side.’ Notable among these is Trimbak Pass at the 
source of the Godavari. Vaitama, the only considerable river 
draining into the Arabian Sea across northern Konkan, issues 
from a point almost opposite to the source of the Godavari. 
The sacredness of its source and the importance of its valley 
made it one of the earliest trade routes between the sea and the 
north Deccan, and the beauty of the lower reaches of the river 
attracted to its banks some of the earliest Aryan settlements. 
The Thai Ghat is another historic pass carrying the road from 
Bombay to Agra and now the northern branch of the Western 
railway. Then we have the Pimpri Pass bearing an old route 
from Sopara and Kalyan to Nasik, and the Nana Pass between 
Junnar and the Konkan, guarded by Shivner, the fort of Junnar. 
Bhimsankar at the source of the Bhima river, and Chakan are 
important historic strongholds in this region. Perhaps the best

known of the passes is the Bhor Ghat or Khandala Pass (about 
2,000 feet) by which the Bombay-Poona road and the southern 
branch of the Western railway enter the Deccan; this ancient 
military road ‘ has ever been regarded as the key to the Deccan ’ 
and on or near it lie the historic caves of Kondane, Karle, 
Bhaja and Bedsa. The Amba Pass carrying the road from 
Ratnagiri to Kolhapur, and the passes providing less important 
routes from Vengurla to Belgaum, Karwar to Dharwar, and so 
on, need not be mentioned. The Shencottah Ghat and the 
Aramboli Pass form the two southernmost passes providing routes 
between Travancore and the Pandya country. 

‘ The precipitous square-cut peaks, which give such a fantastic 
appearance to the scenery of the Western Ghats, are to be found 
wherever horizontal strata of varying degrees of resistance are 
subject to sub-aerial denudation. They repeat themselves in the 
droogs of Deccan scenery.’ 

In South India the Anaimalai hills form the most striking 
range; the higher range consists of a series of plateaux 7,000 
feet in elevation running up to peaks of over 8,000. They 
are covered with rolling downs and dark evergreen forests, 
cut off from one another by deep valleys characterized by 
magnificent scenery. The lower range which lies to the west 
has an average elevation of 3-4,000 feet, and thousands of acres 
of this area are now under coffee. It contains the teak belt 
and also produces most of the timber usual in deciduous forest 
belts of the same elevation; much valuable game, including 
elephant which gives its name to the range, are also found 
there. It is inhabited by hill tribes like the Kadan, Muduvan 
and Pulaiyan. 

The Eastern Ghats possess little of the magnificence gained 
by the regular structure but irregular outlines of the ghats of 
the west. They are scattered, broken, and of much lower 
altitude, though geologically they seem to be distinctly older 
than the Western Ghats. Beginning in Orissa, they pass into 
Madras state keeping parallel to the coast, generally at a 
distance of fifty miles as far south as latitude 16°N. They 
then recede from the coast, follow a north to south course till 
the latitude of Madras where they strike south-westwards 
to form the southern edge of the Deccan plateau in its wider 
sense and meet the Western Ghats in the Nilgiris. Because 


38 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


of their lower elevation and their broken character, the Eastern 
Ghats have not been as great an obstacle to intercourse between 
the plateau and the coastal plain as the Western Ghats ; and the 
fact that the major rivers rise on the crest of the Western 
Ghats and course down all the way to the Bay of Bengal, 
cutting across the Eastern Ghats, has also helped freedom of 
movement. 

The Deccan plateau has a general elevation of 2,000 feet, 
but tends to become higher and more rugged as the ghats are 
approached on the east and west, and attains its highest 
elevation at the southern end, in the Nilgiris formed by the 
convergence of the two ghats; the Mysore plateau in conse- 
quence has a higher average elevation than the rest of the Deccan. 
The general slope of the whole is towards the south-east as 
indicated by the course of the major rivers of the peninsula, 
the Godavari, Krishna (Kistna) and Kaveri (Cauvery). The 
monotony of the plateau surface is broken by a number of 
spurs from the Western Ghats and other mountain features. 
Among these, two may be noted in particular: the two ranges 
enclosing the triangular plateau on which Ahmadnagar stands, 
the watershed between the Godavari and the Bhima; and the 
Mahadeo range forming the watershed between the Bhima and 
the Krishna. Closely associated with the Eastern Ghats are a 
range of hills with different local names. The Nallamalais 
extend north to south from the banks of the Krishna to the 
Penner valley and are made up of Cuddapah quartzite overlaid 
by Cuddapah slate; their average height is less than 2,000 
feet, but the maximum elevation reached is over 3,000; they 
contain several plateaux but scarcity of water has foiled attempts 
at habitation there. Srlsailam was apparently inhabited of old, 
and the remains of ancient towns, forts, temples, reservoirs and 
wells testify to the prosperity of the settlements. Only Chenchus 
inhabit the region today. The forests are neither dense nor 
large as the rainfall is poor and the rocks are deeply fissured 
and fail to retain enough moisture on the suface for large trees 
to grow. The Erramalais to the west of the Nallamalais in 
the Kumool district, and other minor ranges, do not call for 
detailed notice. 

The south-eastern and the relatively higher southern 
Mysore portion of the plateau is a granitoid and gneissio

country strikingly different from the trap region. The extensive 
vista of level-topped, square-crested, nearly horizontal lava-capped 
hills gives place to more rounded and graceful dome-capped hills 
and knolls in the south. Many of these circular or nearly 
circular hills rise precipitously from the surrounding gneissic 
plain, and their strategic value was appreciated by successive 
rulers of the land who erected extensive and sometimes impregna- 
ble fortifications on them. 

Lying athwart the course of the Arabian Sea branch of the 
south-west monsoon, the Western Ghats bring about a striking 
difference in rainfall between the regions on either side of 
them; west of the ghats, the steep edge receives the bulk of 
the moisture carried by the monsoon, while to the east on the 
leeward side is the rain-shadow region where the rainfall is not 
only scanty but highly variable in character. The monsoon 
literally pours on the west, the annual average being 80 inches 
on the coastal plain increasing in the higher regions to more 
than 300 in some stations like Mahabaleshwar. On the eastern 
side of the ghats the rainfall in most cases is less than 40 inches. 
This difference in rainfall is naturally reflected in the vegetation. 
The copious summer rainfall of the coastal plain and the 
windward slopes of the ghats clothes them with dense 
vegetation of the evergreen-forest type. The forests contain 
many kinds of trees of great size and much economic value. 
Bamboos are plentiful and associated with them locally are 
to be found teak in abundance, rosewood, and ironwood. The 
shore is skirted with coconuts and the villages surrounded with 
groves of betel-nut palm and talipot. Cassia and cardamom 
flourish wild in the jungles, and the fact that pepper can 
be cultivated without the screens used in other parts of India 
to preserve the humidity conveys an idea of how naturally 
moist the coastal region is. 

In the Deccan plateau where the rainfall is not enough to 
support a vegetation of tali evergreen trees, deciduous forests 
form the most conspicuous feature of the flora. Teak is found 
at intervals in relatively well-watered areas over the whole 
region, though it is economically cultivated under plantation 
conditions only in certain places. Forests of odoriferous 
sandalwood abound in Mysore and the adjoining districts. 
The steep slopes of the Eastern Ghats also have an evergreen 


40 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


type of vegetation, though owing to the lighter rainfall the 
trees are shorter than those of the Malabar area. 

Changes in the level of the Coromandel coast in historical 
times are attested to in different ways; the once wealthy 
commerical cities of Korkai and Kayal on the Tinnevelly 
coast, which were flourishing in the thirteenth century, are 
now buried under sand dunes miles from the sea; on the 
other hand in some places not very distant from those named 
above the sea has encroached on the land, and large parts of 
once-flourishing ports like Kaveripattinam and Mamallapuram 
(Mahabalipuram) seem to have disappeared under the waves. In 
some instances, particularly Kaveripattinam, popular tradition 
preserves the memory of the occurrence though with no clue 
to its date. Similar changes have occurred in the Gulf of 
Cambay and its neighbourhood. 

The Narmada and Tapti in the north are the two remark- 
able exceptions to the generally eastward drainage of the 
peninsula; they flow westwards in comparatively deep and 
narrow valleys into the rapidly shallowing Gulf of Cambay. The 
Western Ghats form the water-parting between the easterly 
and westerly drainage of the plateau; the crest line of the 
water-parting is at no great distance from the west coast, but 
the main rivers of the peninsula which have their sources in 
these heavily forested ghats course right across the peninsula 
and drain into the Bay of Bengal. This is thought to be the 
relic of a relatively ancient geographical feature, a view which 
finds support in the sluggish nature of the rivers which 
flow along fairly broad and flat-bottomed valleys across a wide 
and nearly level or gently undulating tract of country in 
striking contrast to the short swift-flowing rapids that drain 
the western face of the ghats into the Arabian Sea. The 
steep-sided valleys of the streams and their tendency to deepen 
and reach backward at their sources seem to testify to a yet 
unadjusted gradient. 

The three great rivers of the plateau proper are the 
Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri; and to these may be 
added the Mahanadi. Among the minor rivers, the Penner, 
Palar, Pennar and the Tambrapami are important In the 
early part of their courses these rivers seem rather to drain 
the country than water it as they flow rapidly in deep rocky

valleys, but as they approach the more level ground of the 
coastal plain, dams have been thrown across all of them and 
their waters turned to account for irrigation. The deltas of the 
Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri are covered with wide expanses of 
irrigated crops. 

The Godavari is surpassed in India only by the Ganges 
and the Indus for its sanctity, the picturesque scenery of its 
course, and its utility to man. Rising in the hills behind 
Trimbak in the Nasik district, within fifty miles of the Arabian 
Sea, it runs a course of 900 miles before reaching the Bay 
of Bengal and drains an area of 1,12,000 square miles. Above 
Nasik it flows along a narrow rocky bed, but farther east 
the banks are lower and more earthy. Below Sironcha it 
is joined on its left by the Pranhita, carrying the combined 
waters of the Wardha and the Wainganga which drain the 
whole of the Satpura and Nagpur plains. A few miles farther 
down it receives the Indravati which drains the wild and 
thickly forested areas of the Eastern Ghats in Bastar and 
its neighbours. Below this confluence the river strikes a pre- 
dominantly south-easterly course till it joins the sea. Half-way 
in its course, after it enters Andhra Pradesh, the bed of the river is 
broad and sandy, from one to two miles in width, and inter- 
rupted by rocks in only two places. After running placidly 
through this flat and monotonous country, it begins to force 
its way across the Eastern Ghats by a deep and narrow 
£orge barely 200 yards wide, on either side of which the 
picturesque wooded slopes of the hills rise almost sheer from 
the dark waters of the river. Once across the ghats, the 
river opens out again and forms a series of broad reaches 
dotted with low alluvial islands — the lankas. Below Rajah- 
mundry it forks into two — the Gautami Godavari on the east 
and the Vasistha Godavari on the west which with their dis- 
tributaries flow down the fan-shaped delta formed in the course 
of ages by the silt the river has deposited. Below Rajahmundry 
the river has been dammed at Dowlesvaram from where high- 
level channels take the water for irrigating an enormous area 
of the country. The main canals are also used as lines of 
communication. 

Shorter by a hundred miles in its course than the Godavari, 
and perhaps less sacred in popular estimation than either the

Godavari or Kaveri, the Krishna is the largest of the three 
in the area of its drainage basin. Rising just north of Maha- 
baleshwar, within forty miles of the Arabian Sea, it flows 
southwards skirting the eastern spurs of the Western Ghats 
and receiving a number of tributaries mostly from the west. 
Below Kurundvad it turns eastwards to pass through the 
south Maratha country into Mysore and Andhra Pradesh. 
Near the hills the channel is rocky and the stream too 
rapid for navigation, but it is used largely for irrigation in 
the Satara district and the more open country to the south- 
east. In the Belgaum and Bijapur districts its banks of black 
soil and laterite are high (between 20 and 50 feet) especially 
on the southern side. On entering Mysore it drops down 
from the tableland of the Deccan proper to the alluvial doab 
of Raichur by crossing a succession of lofty ledges of granite 
that stretch across the river. The stream is very swift here 
with a fall of over 400 feet in three miles. It receives 
first the waters of the Bhima draining the Ahmadnagar, Poona 
and Sholapur districts, and later the Tungabhadra draining 
the northern part of the Mysore plateau and the districts of 
Bellary and Kurnool. Then for a considerable distance its 
bed is deep and rocky, its channel has a rapid fall, and 
then its course winds in a north-easterly direction across the 
Nallamalai range. On reaching the Eastern Ghats, it turns 
sharply south-eastwards and flows directly to the sea which it 
enters by two mouths. At Yijayavada, forty-five miles from 
the sea as the crow flies, it runs through a gap barely 1,300 
yards wide in a range of gneissic hills and just below this point 
the river has been dammed for irrigation purposes. Below 
the dam the channel of the river is at a somewhat higher level 
than the surrounding plain. 

The Tungabhadra is the chief tributary of the Krishna 
formed by the union, near Kudali, of the two streams Tunga 
and Bhadra which rise near the Bababudan hills in the western 
marches of Mysore. The united stream strikes in a north- 
easterly direction through Mysore and skirts the Ceded Dis- 
tricts till it reaches its confluence with the Krishna a little 
beyond Kurnool town after a total run of 400 miles. The bed 
of both the heads treams of the Tungabhadra is rocky, and the 
country along the course of the united stream rises rapidly away

from the river rendering difficult the use of its waters for irriga- 
tion. The river is perennial in character and comes down in 
frequent heavy rushes during the rains. It was dammed by the 
rulers of Vijayanagar near Hampi for watering the palaces and 
gardens of that great city. 

The Tungabhadra has served as a historic natural frontier 
right through the centuries; the Chalukyas of Badami, the 
Rashtrakutas, and the Chalukyas of Kalyani to its north, and 
the Pallavas and Cholas to its south, not to speak of the Gangas 
who were mostly subordinate to one or other of these powers, 
made several attempts to extend their sway across the river 
and only met with indifferent success. The historic city of 
Vijayanagar and its predecessor Kampili rose on the southern 
bank of the Tungabhadra. And the Raichur doab between the 
Tungabhadra and Krishna might well be called 4 the cockpit of 
the Deccan 

The Kaveri, known as the southern Ganges, has a course 
of 475 miles and is equally famous for its sanctity, its pictures- 
que scenery and its usefulness for irrigation. Tamil literature 
cherishes many traditions of its origin and is replete with 
expressions of pious and fervent admiration for the life-giving 
properties of its water. It rises in the Brahmagiri, near 
Talakaveri in Coorg, and flows generally south-eastwards across 
the plateau, making great falls as it descends the Eastern Ghats, 
and traverses the Carnatic lowland past Trichinopoly and 
Tanjore to the Bay which it enters by a number of distributa- 
ries in the district of Tanjore. After a tortuous course in 
Coorg over a rocky bed bordered by high banks covered with 
luxuriant vegetation, it enters Mysore state and passes through 
a narrow gorge with a fall of 60 to 80 feet in the rapids of 
Chunchankatte, after which it widens out. The river twice 
forks into two streams, only to reunite a few miles farther on, 
thus forming two islands — Seringapatam and 6ivasamudram — 
fifty miles apart. The celebrated falls of Sivasamudram have 
been harnessed to supply electrical power to the Kolar Gold 
Fields over a hundred miles distant. The enterprise was the 
first of its kind in India and, at the time of its inception, 
involved one of the longest lines of high tension electric 
transmission in the world. The Kaveri receives a number of 
tributaries in its course across Mysore, the most important 



44 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


being the Kabbani, the Hemavati and the Arkavati. In the 
plain, the course of the river is strongly controlled by the structure 
of the country as is well shown by its straight course and acute 
bends. After the confluence of the Bhavani, it changes its 
southern for a south-eastern direction and then takes an east- 
south-easterly course before forking a third time to form the 
island of Srirangam. Immediately below Srirangam, the river 
divides into two, the Coleroon and the Kaveri, the latter re- 
peatedly branching and thus ramifying over the entire surface 
of the Tanjore delta. The waters of the Kaveri are used 
extensively for irrigation in Mysore state and Coimbatore and 
Trichinopoly districts, but it is in Tanjore that they are used to 
the fullest. The problem of utilizing the flood waters of the 
Kaveri for irrigation was tackled from very early times by succes- 
sive Chola monarchs though not with the efficiency commanded 
by modern engineering. 

Passing over less important rivers, we may note that the 
Tambraparni, rising amongst the wooded hills of the southern 
ghats and benefiting from both the monsoons, forms a life-line 
for agriculture in the Tinnevelly district. At its mouth in the 
Gulf of Mannar are the famous pearl fisheries often described by 
travellers from other countries. 

Turning now to the rivers draining on the west, the 
remarkably straight trend of the valleys and the precipitous rise 
of the banks of Narmada and Tapti as well as the exceptional 
course of their drainage are the results of a geological accident. 

The Narmada (Namnadios in the Periplus and Namados to 
Ptolemy) is one of the seven sacred rivers of India and rises on 
the summit of the plateau of Amarkantak at the north-eastern 
apex of the Satpura range in Rewah in Central India. It runs 
a course of 801 miles before entering the Gulf of Cambay by a 
wide estuary 17 miles across below Broach, the Bharukaccha of 
ancient fame. The river is estimated to drain an area of about 
36,000 square miles lying principally to the south of it and com- 
prising the northern portion of the Satpura plateau. Its rocky 
bed and liability to rapid floods render the river useless for 
navigation, and its high banks are an obstacle to irrigation. 
It can be used by small craft up to Broach, 30 miles from 
its mouth, though the influence of the tide reaches up to 
55 miles. 



THE LAND IN RELATION TO HISTORY 


45 


The Tapti (436 miles in length), rising on the Satpura 
plateau near Multai, flows through a straight and steep-sided 
valley, locally opening out to form wide alluvial plains, to the 
Gulf of Cambay which it joins by an estuary. Its banks are too 
high (30 to 60 feet) for the water to be used for irrigation while 
the frequent rocky ridges crossing the river render navigation 
impossible except for the last 20 miles of its course. The 
Khandesh plain in the middle Tapti valley is the most northern 
section of the Deccan; stretching for 150 miles east to west it 
is an extensive area of rich alluvial black soil, a land of large and 
prosperous towns. Physically it merges eastward into the 
Nagpur plain characterized by the same type of land use. The 
rugged hilly and forested regions adjoining the river were 
breeding-grounds for wild elephants until about the seventeenth 
century. 

The Gulf of Cambay was once frequented by Arab mariners, 
and in the early days Broach was more prominent than the 
better port of Surat which rose only after the silting up of the 
Narmada estuary and the advent of the European traders 
who first came to India round the Cape of Good Hope. Besides 
the estuarine mouths of the rivers, there are a number of 
real island harbours — Diu, Daman, Bombay. The west coast 
of the peninsula from Daman southwards to Trivandrum 
possesses a unity of structure, relief, and climate. On details 
of relief it can be divided into two halves— the northern half 
being the Konkan coast and the southern the Malabar coast. 
The term Konkan is now applied to the strip of country below 
the ghats south of the Damanganga river up to North Kanara. 
It varies from 20 to 50 miles in width and is intercepted by 
hills and cliffs jutting into the sea from the ghats, and num- 
bers of little streams forming rapid torrents during the rains 
but dwindling to insignificant dimensions in the dry weather. 
Annual floods have carved deep tidal creeks in their mouths 
which form valuable highways for traffic. These westward- 
flowing streams become larger in the extreme south, and one 
of them, the Sharavati, plunges 850 feet downward from 
the mountains to form the celebrated Gersoppa falls. The 
coastal plain is thus altogether a difficult country to traverse; 
where flat it is fertile and capable of yielding valuable crops 
of rice. 


46 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


The Malabar coast differs from the Konkan in many ways. 
The ghats recede much farther from the sea and the coastal 
strip is broader, and the Palghat gap relieves the country 
from the more or less complete isolation of the Konkan tracts 
and makes for easy communication with the Carnatic plain. 
The long, firm coastline of Bombay is lost here and replaced 
by inlets and backwaters that break across the dividing line of 
sea and shore creating the beautiful, and also typical, coastal 
scenery of Malabar. The backwaters, which are elongated 
parallel to the coast, provide easy and natural communication 
from north to south. The seaward scarp of the ghats has been 
opened up for the cultivation of tea, coffee, cardamom and 
cinchona; and natural forests of great commercial value con- 
taining bamboos, blackwood and teak grow with special 
luxuriance. 

‘ The low-lying plains bordering the sea throughout the 
whole length of western India from Kathiawar promontory to 
Cape Comorin represented in medieval ages most of the wealth 
and strength of India, and are still noted for their great 
fertility. Ancient ports and factories (Arab, Portuguese, and 
Dutch) are to be found scattered along the coastline, and amid 
the palm groves of Malabar are many relics of the days when 
the commerce of the East centred on this coast.’ Historically, 
there has been a striking contrast between the relative political 
isolation of this coastal country from the rest of India and its 
generally active contact by sea with the nations of the outside 
world — the Roman empire, Arabs, Chinese, Portuguese and the rest. 

The lowland that interposes between the Eastern Ghats 
and the shore of the Bay of Bengal extends with little variation 
from the Mahanadi to Cape Comorin. The maritime strip varies 
at first from 50 to 100 miles in width, but becomes broader 
as the ghats recede from the coast about 16°N. Everywhere 
there is the same narrow strip of sandy foreshore leading to 
a wide vista of green rice-crops and palm growth, the same 
background of forest-clad hills now receding into misty dis- 
tance, now breaking the dead monotony of the surf-beaten 
coast with bold, bleak headlands, with large lagoons here and 
there, not unlike the backwaters of the Malabar coast, with wide 
expanses of sandbanks and shallows opposite the deltaic mouths 
of rivers which render close approach to the ports impossible

to ships of any size. Where no such silt formations exist, the 
open roadsteads usually afford fair and close anchorage as at 
Cuddalore and Cocanada and, until they were developed recently 
into artificial harbours, at Madras and Vizagapatam. 

The coast of the Northern Circars, the historic Golconda 
coast, recalls in a measure some of the features of the west 
coast — the parallelism between the ghats and the coastline, the 
nearness of the edge of the ghats to the sea which restricts the 
coastal lowland to a narrow elongated strip, with spurs from 
the ghats descending the scarp face and jutting out to sea to 
end in headlands like the Dolphin’s Nose. The ghats are fairly 
densely clothed with forest while the flat lowland is covered with 
scrub jungle. A succession of short streams descend the ghats 
and run directly out to sea. Important features of this region are 
the Chilka lake and the double delta of the Godavari and Krishna 
embracing the Colair lake. 

Except in the immediate neighbourhood of the short rivers, 
the coastal strip is for the most part covered with low-level 
laterite, red gravel, and clay, and is therefore not very productive. 
But the conditions change thoroughly when the deltas of the 
Godavari and Krishna are reached. With their immense quantities 
of water and of rich black mud drawn largely from the fertile 
lava of the trap area, they have created a double delta extending 
over a million acres round the 300 square miles of the Colair 
depression. The delta country is a regular granary of rice and 
produces many other valuable crops like tobacco, cotton and 
sugarcane. The coast of the delta was the site of some of the 
earliest settlements of Europeans in India, the Dutch, French and 
English having all established factories there; the channels of the 
rivers which led to these have since largely silted up. 

Half lake, half swamp, Lake Colair is the only large natural 
freshwater lake in coastal Andhra. Originally a part of the Bay 
it has been cut off from it by the growth of the two river deltas 
which, growing year after year, pushed out farther and farther 
into the sea until the northern end of the one joined the southern 
extremity of the other. Lake Colair is known to history as 
Kolanu, and its chieftains, the Saronathas, played a fairly promi- 
nent part in the history of the Andhra country. „

Nilgiris. There are offshoots like the Javadi, Shevaroy, Pachai- 
malai, and so on, which retain something of the plateau aspect; 
but the Carnatic or the Tamil plain increases in width steadily 
southwards until in the Kaveri basin it stretches for about 170 
miles. This plain presents a great contrast to the other parts of 
the coastal plains and to the Deccan plateau in topography, in 
climate and in history. This is the real old India of the South, 
the land where all the great historical kingdoms of South India 
fixed their capitals, 4 the land of unnumbered temples, of indigen- 
ous arts and of almost prehistoric industries \ Here artificial 
irrigation was practised from remote antiquity, and the irrigation 
system of the fertile river belt between Karur and Tanjore must 
be almost as old as agriculture itself.

Haimendorf’s view of the Dravidian problem. 

The people of South India cannot be said to have any well-marked 
racial characteristics. They are ‘ a miscellany of differing physical 
types most clearly the product of a mixture from immemorial 
antiquity of many different strains, and modern attempts to 
distinguish these strains are matters of opinion based on the 
appraisal of obscure and intricate evidence along several lines. 
The subject-matter of this chapter affords therefore little scope 
for confident assertions of a categorical nature. 

The evidence bearing on the cultural and racial problems of 
the prehistoric period is threefold. First, there is the actual 
distribution of physical characteristics among the population of 
the country today which may, when carefully related to similar 
characteristics of peoples elsewhere, furnish clues to the early 
origins and movements of peoples. Secondly, there is the distri- 
bution of language-groups and the interrelations among them. 
It is now well recognized that language has no definite relation 
to race, but the value of good linguistic evidence for the study 
of cultural history can be very great. Lastly, archaeological 
excavation brings to light the tools and utensils used by men in 
different places and times, and comparison of their types and 
designs, particularly in pottery, as also of the different levels 
at which they are found in the earth’s surface, often gives clues 
to the movements and relative ages of the cultures of these 
localities. The remains of human skeletons found in ancient 
graves sometimes throw light on the probable racial elements 
in the population. Clearly each of these lines of evidence is 
difficult to study and interpret properly, and the co-ordination 
4

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


of results reached along the different lines is much more so. 
Such study and co-ordination has hardly yet begun, and without 
going into details we can only set forth the broad conclusions 
so far reached by scholars. 

When did man begin to inhabit South India? The answer 
is suggested by the examination of fossil remains of fauna found 
along with primitive stone tools in the terraces of river valleys 
like the Godavari and the Narmada, and of mountain ranges 
like the Siwaliks. The antiquity of human life in these regions 
goes back about 300,000 years; but for quite a long time man lived 
at what is known as the 4 Old Stone ’ (Paleolithic) Stage, using only 
crude stone implements and able only to gather his food as he 
found it instead of growing it according to his needs. His tools 
were simple hand-axes and cleavers, Clactonian or Levalloisian 
flakes at first, but later blades and burins came into use. The 
Paleolithic industries of India can be grouped as follows: (1) 
the 4 Chopper’ industries of the North (Sohan); (2) the Abbevillo- 
Acheulian hand-axes of the South (Madras) ; and (3) a mixture 
of both prevailing. This cannot, however, be a hard and fast 
rule, and the Singrauli basin near Mirzapur (U.P.), Deogarh in 
Jhansi district (U.P.) in the basin of the Betwa, Gujarat, and the 
Mayurbhanj region, have been found to furnish meeting points 
of the two tool traditions of Sohan and Madras. 

The Paleolithic Stage is generally divided into Early or Lower 
Paleolithic and Later or Upper Paleolithic. We cannot be sure 
if India had an Upper Paleolithic Stage. According to Movius 
its presence is suggested by the 4 evolved Sohan ’ ; on the other 
hand the Microlithic industries of South India are not linked up 
with the Upper Paleolithic, and Seshadri derives them from a 
hypothetical Levalloisian flake industry and this excludes the 
Upper Paleolithic from the succession of the Stone Stage cultures 
of India. Further exploration and the study of the teri indus- 
tries of the south-east littoral and Bruce Foote’s finds of the 
Kumool caves may throw light on this question. 

The Paleolithic Stage was followed by the Mesolithic or Middle 
Stone Stage and Neolithic or New Stone Stage, all names related 
to the implements used in each stage. In India the Mesolithic 
Stage is not so well defined as the Paleolithic. Two kinds of 
industry, one Microlithic and the other styled * protoneolithic 
may be assigned to this Stage. 



THE EARLIEST PEOPLES AND CULTURES 


51 


Microliths have a fairly wide distribution extending, as they 
do, from Jamalgarhi (Peshawar district) in the NW. Frontier 
to Sawyerpuram (Tinnevelly district) in the extreme south, and 
from Karachi in Sind on the west to Serai Kala in Bihar on the 
east; and very often they are not truly Mesolithic in stage and 
overlap with the Neolithic and the Metal Stages. The material 
employed consists of jasper, agate, cornelian, flint, chert, chalce- 
dony, quartz and other semi-precious stones, while the types 
include blades, crescents, trapezes, triangles, points, beaked en- 
gravers and side-and-end scrapers. These tiny tools must have been 
attached singly or collectively to a handle for effective use as 
arrow heads, sickles, etc. ‘ In their typology they exhibit a striking 
similarity with the Western Capsian of the Mesolithic Stage. It 
may, in all probability, be derived from the western Mesolithic, 
inasmuch as the Mesolithic has not yet been found in Burma ’ 
(Krishnaswami) . 

Foote observed that the Tinnevelly Microliths lay embedded 
in the fossil sand-dunes (teris) and were stained red by their long 
contact with the ferruginous soil; in 1949 Zeuner found Microliths 
near Tuticorin in a geological section which suggests that some of 
them may be of considerable antiquity. These facts and similar 
evidence from Nandi Kanama and Khandivli have led to the 
supposition that the first appearance of Microliths may be placed 
some time between 8000 and 6000 b.c. 

The Microlithic industries of India may be divided roughly 
into two classes: (1) pre-pottery industries and (2) those associated 
with pottery. Gordon has given an elaborate list of the 
Microlithic sites of India, and the discovery of a large number of 
sites subsequently in recent years will have to be added to the 
list. Special studies of the Microlithic industries of Gujarat, 
particularly Langhnaj, have been made by Zeuner and Sankalia, 
and the Mysore ones by Seshadri. It is now fairly certain from 
the evidence from Mysore and elsewhere that some of the 
Microlithic industries are contemporaneous with metal industries. 
The problem of similarities of the Indian Microliths with those 
of South Africa and Palestine is a fascinating but unexplored 
field as yet. Attempts have been made to differentiate the 
Microliths as coastal and inland groups; the former are perhaps 
older, simpler and cruder than those found inland, but their range 
of types is different and rather larger, though the only type 

J

52 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


that they may possess which the inland ones definitely do not 
is the burin. From the functional point of view it may be well 
to classify these industries into (a) hunting group and (6) peasant 
group. The evidence from Langhnaj and elsewhere has been 
held to warrant the possibility that some primitive form of 
agriculture was practised before pottery came into use. If this- 
is correct, we have evidence here 6 of a Microlith- and bone tool* 
using people being introduced to agriculture and pottery and tho 
original Mesolithic food-gatherers becoming Neolithic food- 
producers, albeit probably on a very restricted scale ’ (Gordon). 

It is noteworthy that Microliths are associated with polished 
stone celts. This has been proved from a carefully conducted 
excavation at Brahmagiri in Mysore State. This site is remarkable 
for its culture continuity extending from the polished stone axe 
culture to early historic cultures. Whether, in India, there was any 
break or not in this continuity from Paleolithic through the so-called 
Mesolithic to Neolithic requires more careful investigation. In 
Europe and elsewhere this continuity prevailed, the Mesolithie 
merging into the Neolithic when the art of grinding and polishing 
stone tools became generally known together with domestication of 
animals and plants. The great revolution from food-gathering to- 
food-producing, typical of the Neolithic, had a long transition. In 
Palestine have been discovered mounted on bone handles Micro* 
lithic sickle blades with that peculiar gloss consequent on cutting 
grass and plant. 

In India it is exceedingly difficult to reconstruct the Neolithic- 
complex. This difficulty has been pertinently pointed out by 
Zeuner. Not much evidence is available for the domestication of 
plants from our sites. The study of skeletal material with a view 
to differentiate wild species from domesticated ones should go a 
long way to throw light on the problem. But large quantities 
of polished stone axes, adzes and chisels come from all our 
so-called Neolithic sites in Bellary, Mysore, ‘Hyderabad’ and 
other parts of the Deccan. Since the material for these tools 
came from trap dykes, the sites and settlements of these people 
are situated in the neighbourhood of these dykes. As yet 
excavation has been confined to three important sites : Sangana- 
kallu near Bellary town, Brahmagiri in North Mysore, and 
Burzahom in Kashmir. At Brahmagiri two phases of the polished 
stone axe culture have been distinguished on the basis of pottery 



THE EARLIEST PEOPLES AND CULTURES 


53 


and also by the presence of a sterile layer. The authors of this 
culture besides using Neolithic celts and Microliths, had knowledge 
of the working of copper and bronze though in a restricted degree. 
The pottery study at Brahmagiri and Sanganakallu relating to 
this culture is of great value to the student of the prehistoric 
cultures of India. Sanganakallu has yielded evidence of fresh 
stone axes, a fine Microlithic industry, and pale grey ceramic ware 
decidedly earlier than though apparently of the same culture com- 
plex as Brahmagiri, and going back to 1000 b.c. or beyond, dubbed 

* True Neolithic 5 by Subba Rao. 

The problem of the ‘shouldered celt’ is not to be mixed up 
with the ‘ pointed butt ’ type; very probably it was confined to an 
Austric people who had more affinities with the peoples and 
cultures of Indo-China and Malay Peninsula. 

The date of the rock-paintings of peninsular India was 
at one time thought to go back to the Stone Stage. But recent 
studies assign them to a later period when iron had come 
into common use. A considerable number of paintings have 
been found in the Mahadeo Hills from Tamia on the east to 
just south of Seoni-Malwa in the west; the latest of them are 
believed to be of the tenth century a.d., and it has been held 
unlikely that any are earlier than the seventh century b.c., but 
certainly not beyond the limits of the first millennium b.c. The 
paintings back to the earliest series show obvious metal arrow- 
heads. The rock-paintings of Singhanpur and Kabra Pahar 

* Raigarh State’ (Madhya Pradesh) have been connected with the 
earlier paintings of the Mahadeo Hills; they are probably contem- 
porary with part of the Microliths found in their immediate 
vicinity, and this applies also to the shelters, paintings and Micro- 
liths of the Son Valley. 

Lastly, the Megaliths of South India present a series of questions 
that have found no satisfactory answer as yet. Their existence 
has been noticed for well over a century, and some investigations 
were made in the early years of this century at Adichanallur 
{Tinnevelly district), Perumbair and the Nilgiris. But the work 
was not followed up. It is only since 1945 that the Indian 
Archaeological Department has resumed systematic work on 
these monuments. A detailed ground survey has been conduct- 
ed in the Chingleput district and adjoining areas, Pudukkottai, 
and Cochin; and a few monuments have been excavated. The 


54 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


monuments of each of these areas apparently belong to a common 
Megalithic complex; the dead were exposed for excarnation, and 
the bones were collected in part and interred in different ways — 
in sarcophagi with legs, in urns, in pits or dolmenoid cists with 
port-holes, besides circular rock-cut underground vaults with or 
without a central pillar (typical of the West Coast). Without 
stopping to note these differences in detail, we may observe that 
iron implements and polished black-and-red ware pottery are 
generally found all over. ‘These monuments have invariably 
been found to occur on rocky high grounds which are them- 
selves unfit for cultivation, in close juxtaposition to a hillock 
and an irrigation-tank, but in very close proximity to arable 
land* (Srinivasan and Banerjee). This was perhaps the begin- 
ning of irrigated rice-cultivation in South India. 

On the data obtained at Brahmagiri in Mysore, Maski in 
Raichur district and Porkakm in Travancore-Cochin, Sanur, 
Amritamangalam and Kunrathur in Chingleput, this culture is 
thought to have been introduced by an iron-using people from 
the south some time between 300 b.c. and the middle of the first 
century a.d.; and 800 b.c. has been suggested as the earliest 
possible date for the first occupation of Brahmagiri. The date 
suggested for the commencement of Megalithic culture appears, 
however, to be rather too late; Gordon’s date some time between 
700 and 400 b.c. sounds better, but it may go still further back. 

Many of the South Indian Megaliths show a similarity, seem- 
ingly amounting to kinship, with Megaliths in other parts of the 
world — in the lands bordering upon the Mediterranean and the 
Atlantic, in the Caucasus, in Iran. The monuments in Europe 
have yielded Stone Stage implements on the basis of which they 
have been dated to about 2000 b.c. and the dolmens in the 
Caucasus area are assigned to a somewhat later date, 1500 b.c. 
Between Iran and India lies a vast expanse of space without any 
known trace of Megalithic monuments. While the distribution 
of Megaliths in the West is coastal, elsewhere, particularly in India,, 
this culture penetrated far into the interior, and they generally 
contain iron implements. In spite of these rather wide gaps, 
spatial and chronological, Gordon Childe has suggested that ‘ Sialk 
B (graves in Iran) might be used to link with the west, with the 
Caucasus or Palestine, the celebrated Indian dolmens ; for these 
too may at least be entered through port-hole slabs.’ He adds: 





THE EARLIEST PEOPLES AND CULTURES 55 

4 But they are concentrated in the south of the Peninsula in areas 
not likely to be affected by land borne impulses from Iran, but 
exposed rather to maritime influences. If their distribution do sug- 
gest inspiration from the West, that must surely have come by sea.’ 
At Adichanallur in Tinnevelly district another class of inter- 
ments, urn-burials without any Megalithic appendage in the form 
of a bounding circle or otherwise, has been found in large num- 
bers; though they cannot be brought strictly into the orbit of 
Megalithic monuments, they seem to be somehow related to them 
as iron implements, black-and-red ware, and fragmentary burials 
are common to both. There are other notable differences also. 
The pottery of Adichanallur is more primitive than the Megalithic 
pottery of the other sites. There is found here also a quantity of 
bronze ware and gold diadems or mouth pieces not found else- 
where in South India but having typological parallels in Palestine 
about 1200 b.c. as also in Syria and Cyprus. Among the tombs 
of the early Iron-Age of the time of Solomon in Palestine an 
outstanding find was a remarkable three-pronged iron fork or 
trident similar to the Adichanallur tridents in the same metal. 
And the eastern Mediterranean has been suggested by Childe as 
the region where the Megalithic complex originated, presuming 
that it had a single origin at all. But it is difficult as yet to say 
exactly when and in what order the urn-burials and the dolmen 
and port-hole slab reached the Indian peninsula. It seems to be 
clear that this iron-using culture did not grow out of the earlier 
Neolithic culture. 

The evidence from Adichanallur also appears to suggest that 
the worship of Murugan or Velan, a popular deity with the 
Tamils from very early times, was known at the time. The god’s 
favourite weapon was the vel (trident) and his banner carried a 
wild fowl as his emblem. Besides iron tridents, there have been 
found at Adichanallur iron banner-bases and representations of 
fowls in bronze. The practice of wearing mouth pieces, still 
maintained by devotees carrying Kavadi to the shrine of Murugan 
in the Palni Hills, may well be a survival from prehistoric times. 

The people of Adichanallur cultivated rice; several earthen- 
ware bowls containing the husk of paddy and bronze bowls with 
grains of rice in them have been found. 

The Nilgiri cairns and barrows are different from the Mega- 
liths of the plain in their structural details and pottery. The 

\ 



56 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


bronze vases and bowls found there were thought by Richards to 
have a philogenetic connexion with a gold bowl from Ur dis- 
covered by Woolley. Other likenesses were also discovered by the 
earlier archaeologists, but until their work is checked again and 
confirmed by fresh studies, no conclusions can be drawn from such 
vague and stray data. 

We turn now to a brief consideration of the racial com- 
position of the population. We do not know to which stock the 
men of the Paleolithic Stage in South India belonged, as no human 
skeleton associated with this culture has yet been discovered in 
peninsular India, apart from a tibia at Attirampakkam (Chingle- 
put). At Vadnagar in Baroda a fossil skeleton of a Pygmy man, 
thirty inches in height, was discovered in 1935; in this skeleton 
we probably have the earliest representative of the negrito in 
India. The negrito is a diminutive type of negro which, rising in 
Africa like the negro, passed through India eastward, and is found 
in the Andamans associated with a prelithic stage of culture. 
There is reason to hold that a large part of peninsular India was 
inhabited by this type for a considerable period of the old Stone 
Stage. The occurrence of dwarfish woolly-haired individuals with 
more or less round heads among the Kadars of Parambikkulam 
and the Pulaiyans of the adjoining Anaimalai hills in the extreme 
south of the peninsula may be taken to attest the influence of this 
early negrito type. Designs on the bamboo combs of the Semangs, 
a negrito people of Malaya, seem to be identical with those on the 
combs used by Kadar women, a fact suggesting that originally the 
Kadars and the Semangs shared the same culture and possibly even 
belonged to the same ethnic group which underwent a change 
in Ihdia in consequence of the later advent of long-headed peoples. 

Next must be mentioned the proto-Australoid element with 
long heads, protruding faces, broad flat noses and pronounced 
brow-ridges. There is no early evidence from India supporting 
the presence of this element; but evidence from neighbouring 
lands, too complicated to be set out here, strongly supports the 
assumption of its presence in India. There is no doubt that the 
bronze figure of a dancing girl from Mohenjo-Daro has unmistak- 
able proto- Australoid features; her coiffure is strongly reminiscent 
of the coiffure of the present-day proto-Australoid jungle-folk 
of Central and Southern India. In South India this element 
generally entered into the composition of the so-called exterior 


THE EARLIEST PEOPLES AND CULTURES 


57 


castes and forms the basis of jungle-folk like the Chenchus, 
Malayans, Kadars, Kurumbas, and Yeruvas. 

A third element is furnished by the proto-Mediterranean type 
-with its long narrow head and face, nose of medium length and 
straight or aquiline shape, and dark brown hair. This is the 
•dominant type among the Dravidian-speaking peoples of South 
India at the present day. 

As there was perhaps no break in continuity between the 
Mesolithic and Neolithic Stages, it seems safe to conclude that the 
people of the Neolithic Stage were the descendants of the proto- 
Mediterranean stock. Proto-Mediterranean was also the prevailing 
type at Adichanallur and in the iron-age cairns of the Deccan. 

Another racial element that is traceable has been called 
Mediterranean and seems to have been the major element among 
the mixed population of the Indus valley. Slender build, short to 
medium height, a long head, small brow-ridge, an oval face and, 
usually, a pointed chin are its dominant characteristics. Typical 
•examples of this stock occur most frequently today among the 
Telugu Brahmins, and the Kallars. If the Mediterranean type 
was not evolved from the proto-Mediterranean in India, but 
represented an imported strain as it seems to have done, then its 
arrival in India has to be placed in late Neolithic times. 

In certain parts of South India the basic long-headed element 
represented by the proto-Mediterranean and Mediterranean has been 
overlaid by a short-headed element. Its occurrence is greatest in 
Maharashtra and can be traced through the Mysore plateau into 
Tamilnad beyond. It has affected Andhradesa slightly but has 
left Kerala untouched. This short-headed element is of two main 
types, the Alpine and the Armenoid which is a specialized variety 
of the Alpine. The Alpines are concave or straight-nosed, square- 
jawed people with globular heads. They were in evidence in the 
Indus valley during chalcolithic times, and are now traceable in 
Gujarat, Maharashtra, Coorg and Karnataka. 

The Armenoid type is short-headed with a markedly convex 
high-bridged nose, and a high-vaulted head rising steeply from 
the nape of the neck. This type seems to have been evolved in 
south-west Asia. These characteristics are now found, though 
both seldom occur together in the same individual, among peoples 
inhabiting the mountainous tract extending from the Pamirs and 
the western flanks of the Himalayas to the mountains of Anatolia. 


58 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


In South India the Armenoid type is found especially among 
the Tamil-speaking people. But this type could not have arisen 
in South India. The present home of this type — the wide tract of 
Asia stretching from the Pamirs to the Levant— must also have 
been its original home, that is to say the area of its characteriza- 
tion. According to Keith, the Armenoid in India is the result of 
an early trade migration from Persia (Iran) or an adjacent country 
along the Persian Gulf. Round-headedness among the Tamils can 
be traced through the Deccan, Gujarat and Sind into the eastern 
portions of the Iranian plateau where there is a striking group of 
round-heads. In Iran they are more numerous in the uplands 
than in the plains. Some writers postulate a connexion between 
these round-heads of the Iranian plateau and uplands and the 
Dravidian-speakers of India, a connexion borne out by resem- 
blances between the culture of the Caspians, the earliest inhabit- 
ants of the highlands of Iran, and the Dravidian-speakers. 

The fact that Andhradesa and Kerala — Andhradesa to a 
lesser degree than Kerala — are free from the round-headed (Alpine- 
Armenoid) element, shows that it came in by way of Sind, 
Gujarat and Maharashtra, and broke into Tamilnad over south- 
eastern Mysore. If numbers be any criterion, the round-heads 
who constitute a small percentage when compared with the basic 
long-heads (proto-Mediterranean and Mediterranean) are later 
arrivals in India — a conclusion supported by the evidence on the 
succession of race strata elsewhere. 

Lastly, there remains to be noticed another progressive long- 
headed element, the Nordic, which entered South India in late 
prehistoric or proto-historic times. Deriving from the same 
original stock, the Mediterranean and the Nordic show resem- 
blances in the shape of their heads; but whereas the Mediterranean 
head is small, the Nordic is massive. The largest percentage of 
this element in South India is found among the Chitpavan or 
Konkanastha Brahmins. Its presence among Tamil Brahmins is 
not entirely unknown. 

It remains to add that another type of round-headedness, 
different from that of Alpine- Armenoid and akin to the Mongo- 
lian, has also been noticed in South India, though only in a very 
slight degree, from Orissa in the east to Malabar in the west; this 
is supposed to be the result of an oceanic migration in pre- 
historic times. 



THE EARLIEST PEOPLES AND CULTURES 


59 


The languages of South India fall into three main groups — 
the Indo-Aryan represented by Marathi, the Dravidian repre- 
sented by Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malavalam besides Gondi 
and other minor dialects, and the Austro-Asiatic by the Munda 
languages including Kharia, Juang, Savara and Gadaba of the 
north-eastern portions of the Deccan, the Kurku of the north- 
western districts of Madhya Pradesh. Though the Indo-Aryan 
vocabulary shows traces of Munda influence, the number of 
Dravidian loan-words in it is much larger and the conclusion 
seems inevitable that the Dravidian group of languages is more 
recent than the Austro-Asiatic which is usually recognized as 
pre-Dravidian. There is no doubt that at one time the Munda 
languages spread over the whole of North India, for they form 
the basis of a number of mixed languages along the Himalayan 
fringe from the Punjab to Bengal. But the Dravidian languages 
have also left survivals in north-western India, including the islet 
of Brahui in Baluchistan in an ocean of Indo-Aryan. Hence 
this group of languages may have prevailed in the north-west 
at the time the Indo-Aryans arrived. If this view is correct, 
throughout the bulk of India, Dravidian speech was preceded 
by Austro-Asiatic and followed by Indo-Aryan. Von Fuerer- 
Haimendorf, however, has, with good reason, questioned the 
correctness of this view, and held that the Dravidian speech never 
prevailed in India outside its present area. Brahui in Baluchistan, 
he thinks, can be explained by a migration of Dravidian speakers 
on land or by sea along the coast from more western lands. 

Munda languages now survive also in the Mahadeo Hills of 
Madhya Pradesh and are found as far south as the Godavari; 
they must have prevailed at one time over the whole of the 
Deccan, for Bhili shows Munda affinities. Whether they extended 
farther south cannot be determined at present; a few tribes in the 
extreme south like the Kakkalans of Travancore are said to 
possess languages peculiar to themselves, but how far, if at all, 
they include Munda elements is not known. 

There is a divergence of opinion among scholars as to 
which particular race was responsible for the introduction of 
the Austro-Asiatic languages into India. The proto-Australoid, 
the Mongolian and the proto-Mediterranean have all been 
suggested by different writers. Racial prehistory when cor- 
related with linguistic prehistory seems to suggest the following 



60 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


provisional general conclusions. Indo-Aryan was the latest 
language family to reach India, and it seems reasonable to 
ascribe it to the Nordics, the last ethnic element to arrive. 
But the Nordics were by no means a pure stock when they 
entered India; on their way they must have absorbed much of 
the Alpine element of the Pamirs and their neighbourhood. For a 
similar reason, Dravidian must have been the speech of the round- 
heads, particularly the Armenoids who represent the earlier 
amongst the two strata of round-heads in India, and Austric the 
language of the Mediterraneans. About the language of the other 
ethnic elements noted above we have no knowledge. 

Dravidian language and culture hark back to the highlands of 
Anatolia, Armenia and Iran, the area of characterization of the 
Armenoid type. The script of the Indus valley seals has not yet 
been satisfactorily deciphered, and this casts a shadow of doubt 
over all the problems of pre-Aryan Indian culture. Yet there are 
not wanting many indications that point to some connexion between 
the great culture-complex that spread from the Mediterranean to 
the Indus valley in the third and second millennia b.c. and the 
prehistoric culture of South India. The name Trimmlai by which 
the Lycians of Asia Minor called themselves in their inscriptions 
is a very close approach to Dramila (Tamil). Caldwell indicated 
a connexion between Susian and Dravidian as regards structure. 
A large number of ancient place-names in Afghanistan, the 
highlands of Iran, the plains of the Euphrates and the Tigris, and 
Mesopotamia generally, have been shown to conform to Dravidian 
forms, and the non-Semitic, non-Aryan prehistoric peoples of this 
region have been held to have been Dravidian-speaking. The 
Hurrian and Kassite languages possess a clearly demonstrable 
affinity with Dravidian. One writer has connected Elamite and 
Brahui. The conclusion seems unavoidable that there is some 
genetic connexion between all these languages. Western Asia 
being the home of Elamite, it seems not unlikely that the 
Dravidian or rather proto-Dravidian language and its speakers 
also reached India from this part of the world. 

A number of cultural affinities enforce this conclusion sug- 
gested by linguistic data. Inheritance through women which still 
survives in Dravidian India was in vogue among the Elamites, the 
earliest branch of the 4 Caspian * to emerge into history. There 
is evidence of the prevalence of the snake-cult in the earliest

pre-historic stratum at Persepolis; Dravidian-speaking India is the 
stronghold of snake worship at the present day. The worship of 
the Mother-goddess under the name c Lady of the Mountain ’ and 
the annual celebration of her nuptials with the Moon-god of Ur 
closely resemble the Indian worship of Parvatl in her various 
forms and the annual celebration of the tirukkalyanam (divine 
marriage) in South Indian Siva temples; in fact the resemblance 
is so close that, in spite of the absence of any direct proof of 
connexion, it is difficult to believe that it is accidental. Again, 
the nature of the worship offered in the temples of ancient 
Sumeria and the organization and even the structure of the 
temple itself have much in common with what has prevailed in 
South India to this day, allowance being made for the changes 
that naturally flowed from the increasing aversion to meat-eating 
among the higher classes of India. * The essence of worship/ 
says Leonard Woolley, of ancient Sumer, 6 was sacrifice, and by the 
ritual of sacrifice the cooked flesh of the animal was shared between 
the god, his priests and the worshipper; the kitchen was therefore 
not the least important part of the temple, and at all times of 
the day the fires would be burning and the priests would be 
overseeing the slaves who carried on the work of butchers, bakers, 
scullions and cooks.’ Numerous medieval inscriptions of southern 
India bear abundant testimony to the readiness of the people to 
enrol themselves as the slaves of a neighbouring temple and bind 
their descendants also to the same status. The institution of 
devadasis common in South India was well known in ancient 
Sumer. Again, what can be more accurate as a description of 
the form and spirit of worship in the Indian temple of today, of 
the rdjopacdra offered to the image of God, than this account 
given by Woolley of worship in the Sumerian temple: ‘Where 
the God was also the King, where church and state were so 
nearly synonymous, material efficiency was only too likely to get 
the better of faith. Long life and well-being in this world was 
the reward men asked in return for formal service such as they 
might have rendered to a human overlord, and they regarded 
the wealth and prosperity of the Moon-god as a pledge for the 
welfare of the city.’ The temple and the palace are both indi- 
cated by one word kdyil in Tamil, and prasada in Sanskrit, and 
it is universally recognized that temple-worship was not part of 
the original Vedic religion.

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


It must be admitted that much of this evidence on which 
the old approach to the Dravidian problem was based is vague 
and circumstantial, and furnishes no reliable chronological frame- 
work. Not so the recent and very plausible attempt of Fuerer- 
Haimendorf to equate the Dravidian-speakers with the iron-using 
Megalithic folk who came to South India from the west by sea, 
perhaps leaving colonies along the coast in the course of their 
migration — which may account for the Megaliths near Karachi 
and Brahui in Baluchistan. He thinks that an immigration of 
Dravidian speakers about 500 b.c. would allow sufficient time 
for the development of the early Tamil Literature of the Sangam; 
but this may well be doubted and the mention of four well-ordered 
Tamil Kingdoms in the Asoka inscriptions may also indicate the 
need for postulating an earlier date. This view suggests that 
the Dravidian civilization of South India is much younger than 
has been supposed, and that the Aryan occupation of the North 
and the Dravidian occupation of the South were more or less 
*1 contemporary. Haimendorf writes: ‘ It is in Maharashtra that the 
megalithic iron-age civilization must have clashed with the south- 
ward movements of the first Aryan people to invade the Deccan ’ ; 
this suggestion gains some support from the Agastya legends 
t centering round Vatapi (Badami) as will be seen in the next 
chapter. But the whole question needs further study and it is 
too early yet to decide if the postulate of Haimendorf should be 
accepted as it is or should be modified suitably to take into 
account the other racial and cultural data briefly reviewed above.

CHAPTER IV 


THE DAWN OF HISTORY: ARYANIZATION 

Evidence — Aryavarta — Vindhya and Pariyatra — Vidarbha — Growing know- 
ledge of the South in North Indian literature — Panin i — Katyayana — Kautiiya 
— Greek accounts — Baudhayana — Asokan edicts. 

Agastya legends and their significance — Parasurama and the west coast — 
nature of aryanization — evidence of language — later reactions and theories 
— routes from north to south — contact with lands in the west — and in the east. 

History begins in the South of India as in the North with 
the advent of the Aryans. The progress of the aryanization of 
the South is reflected in literature and legend. Until about 
600 b.c., works composed in the North exhibit little knowledge 
of India south of the Vindhyas, but acquaintance increased 
with the progress of the centuries. Legends centering round 
the name of Agastya found in the epics and the Puranas appear 
in their own quaint way to preserve the memory of this vast 
and important cultural movement. Another clearly later cycle 
of legends has Parasurama for hero and seeks particularly 
to account for the peculiarities of the Kerala country and its 
institutions. 

The Vindhya range was the recognized southern limit of the 
Aryan land. Manu states distinctly that the country between 
the Himalayas and the Vindhyas and between the eastern and 
western oceans comprised Aryavarta, the abode of the Aryas. 
* The name Pariyatra says Bhandarkar, ‘ was given to the more 
northern and western portion of the (Vindhya) range from 
which the rivers Chambal and Betva take their rise, probably 
because it was situated on the boundary of their yatra or range 
of communication.’ A comparatively late hymn of the Rig-Veda 
mentions that one expelled from the Aryan fold betook himself 
to the South and turned his feet in that direction ( dakshinapada ). 
The Aitar ey a Brahmana mentions the kingdom of Vidarbha 
(Berar) and its king Bhima. The same Brahmana and the 
Sankhayana Srautasutra state that the sage Visvamitra condemn- 
ed his fifty sons who were jealous of Sunahsepha Devarata to 
live on the borders of Aryavarta, and that their descendants were 
the Dasyus, like the Andhras, Pundras, Sabaras, Pulindas and 
5

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Mutibas. Clearly, in the period of these books, while the 
aryanization of Northern India had become complete, little 
progress had been made beyond the Yindhyas; only one settled 
Aryan kingdom was known, Vidarbha, and the rest of the South 
was dominated by pre-Aryan inhabitants. Possibly some of the 
.more enterprising Aryans ventured into their midst, married their 
women and raised families of mixed descent who were looked 
down upon by the ‘ purer ’ Aryans of the north, as may be 
inferred from the story of the sons of Yisvamitra. It is difficult 
to fix any definite date for this stage of affairs, but round about 
1000 B.c. may well be suggested. 

The next stage is marked by the mention of Cherapadah, the 
Cheras, in the Aitareya Ar any aka , as one of the three peoples 
who transgressed certain ancient injunctions; but the text is 
obscure and its meaning is by no means clearly settled. How- 
ever, if we accepted it as a reference to the Cheras, it would be 
proof that the customs and habits of Malabar began very early 
to diverge from those of the rest of the South. But of this we 
have no other early evidence. 

The grammarian Panini, who may be taken to have lived 
more or less about 600 b.c., mentions only Kalinga in the east 
and knows nothing south of the Narmada on the west except 
the country of Asmaka, near the headwaters of the Godavari. 
The Sutta Nipata of the Buddhist canon records that a teacher 
Bavari left Kosala and settled in a village on the Godavari in 
the Assaka country in Dakshinapatha. His pupils are said to 
have gone north to meet the Buddha and their route lay through 
Patitthana (Paithan) in the Mulaka country, Mahishmati 
(Mandhata) on the Narmada, and Ujjain. Bavari is said to have 
been learned in the Yedas and performed Yedic sacrifices. 
Probably we have in him the type of many a teacher who took 
part in the task of colonizing and aryanizing the southern lands 
by a process of slow and peaceful permeation. The descriptions 
of dsramas , abodes of ascetics situated in the Dandaka forest, 
which are found in the Ramdyana of Valmlki confirm the 
impression derived from the story of the teacher Bavari. 

Katyayana, the grammarian of the fourth century b.c., who 
was probably a southerner and who supplemented the aphorisms 
of Panini to bring his grammatical system up to date, makes 
mention of the countries of the extreme South, Pandya, Chola 


THE DAWN OF HISTORY 


67 


and Kerala. These countries were well known to Kautilya and 
the Asokan edicts, which last mention Ceylon also under the 
name Tambapanni. Kautilya speaks of the pearls and muslins 
of the Pandyan country. The name of the Pandyan capital 
Madhura recalls Mathura of the North, and Greek accounts, as 
we have seen, narrate the story of Herakles (in the context, 
Krishna) setting his daughter Pandaia to rule over the kingdom 
bordering on the southern sea. Other Mathuras are known in 
Ceylon and near Java, and they suggest the continuity of the 
movement from North India to the South, and farther across 
the seas. Baudhayana, one of the earliest lawgivers, notices in 
his Dharmasutra five customs as peculiar to the people of the 
Deccan, viz. dining with one who is not initiated (anupeta), 
dining with women, eating food kept overnight, marrying the 
daughter of one’s maternal uncle, and marrying the daughter of 
one’s paternal aunt. We know that the last two customs 
mentioned here, cross-cousin marriages, are practised conspicu- 
ously to this day in South India among all classes of the 
people. And Baudhayana’s notice must really belong to a very 
early period; for he also states that travel by sea to other lands 
was permissible only to North Indians — a statement which 
ceased to be true at least at the dawn of the Christian era if 
not earlier. 

Thus it is evident that starting somewhere about 1000 b.c. 
the movement of the Aryans into the South proceeded more or 
less steadily and peacefully, and had reached its completion 
some time before the establishment of the Mauryan empire which 
included in its fold all India except the extreme South. The 
fact that the edicts of Asoka were engraved in places as far south 
as Mysore and Kurnool shows that there must have been present 
in these places people to whom the Brahml script and the Prakrit 
idiom were nothing strange; also that Asoka had political and 
diplomatic relations with the southern countries that lay outside 
his empire. 

Even the slightest consideration shows that it is this large 
movement of the aryanization and civilization of the South 
that provides the historical basis for the Agastya legends which 
figure prominently in the epics and the Puranas as well as 
in Tamil literature. In the Rig Veda there occurs a brief 
reference to his miraculous birth from a pitcher ( kumbha) % 



68 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


but otherwise he is a real historical person who composes 
hymns, has a wife and sister and perhaps also a son; and he is 
applauded for combining domesticity with a life of austerity. 
In the Mahabharata the story is more fully developed, and 
Agastya’s connexion with the South comes into prominence. 
His marriage with Lopamudra, a princess of Vidarbha, is 
mentioned together with her demand that, before claiming the 
exercise of his marital rights, he should provide her with costly 
jewellery and all the luxuries she was used to in her father’s 
house, without in any manner impairing his asceticism. The 
only way in which Agastya could meet his wife’s wish was by 
seeking a large gift of wealth. He appipached three Aryan kings 
one after another, but in vain, so they all went to Ilvala, the 
daitya king of Manimati. Ilvala, however, was no friend of the 
Brahmins, because one of them had refused to grant him a son 
equal to Indra. His vengeance took a queer form. He used to 
transform his younger brother Vatapi ‘into a ram and offer his 
flesh to Brahmins as food, and then to recall him to life (whom- 
soever Ilvala summoned with his voice would come back even 
from the abode of Yama), and Vatapi, ripping the flanks of the 
Brahmins, would come out laughing’. The two brothers thus 
killed many Brahmins and, on the occasion of the visit of 
Agastya and the three kings, Ilvala wanted to play the same 
game. 4 He prepared the flesh of Vatapi in order to entertain 
them, at which the kings became sad, but Agastya ate it all, 
and when Ilvala summoned Vatapi there came only air out 
of Agastya’s stomach, Vatapi having already been digested. 
Then Ilvala, becoming sad, promised to give him wealth, if 
Agastya could tell him what he intended to give.’ Agastya 
was able to give the right answer and he and the kings returned 
with the wealth they needed. Vatapi, as is well known, is the 
name of the fortified city in the western Deccan which was 
the capital of the early Chalukyas; it is now called Badami. 
And if, as seems probable, the abode of the two daitya kings 
is to be sought in this region, this story may be taken to mark 
the beginning of Agastya’s connexion with the South. 

The Mahabharata also records the story of Agastya drinking 
up the waters of the ocean to enable the Devas to dispose of 
their enemies who had taken refuge under the sea, and of his 
journey to the South on some unspecified business— when he 



THE DAWN OF HISTORY 


69 


prevailed upon the Vindhyas to stop growing until he returned, 
which, however, he never did. In later Tamil tradition, Agastya’s 
southerly march is accounted for by the interesting legend 
that on the occasion of Siva’s marriage with Parvati, Agastya 
had to be sent to the South to redress the balance of the earth 
which had been rudely disturbed by the assemblage of all the gods 
and sages in the North. 

The pact with the Vindhya mountains and the drinking of 
the waters of the ocean have been generally accepted as alle- 
gorical representations of the spread of Aryan culture first to 
India south of the Vindhyas, and then across the seas to the 
islands of the archipelago and to Indo-China — an interpretation 
not only intrinsically quite plausible, but supported by other facts 
relating to Agastya and his abode. 

In the Ramayana> as they are on their way to Agastya’s 
dsrama , Rama tells his brother Lakshmana how Agastya, intent 
upon the good of the world, overpowered a deadly demon and 
thereby rendered the earth habitable. He goes on to narrate 
the story of the death of Vatapi in a form which differs from 
that of the Mahdbharata in some ways, though the deviations 
are of no significance. What deserves particular notice is the 
idea that the Dandakaranya was first made fit for human (Aryan) 
occupation by the success of Agastya against the asuras. Agastya’s 
conflict with the asuras and rdkshasas is also hinted at else- 
where in the Ramayana . The sage Visvamitra, for instance, 

explains to Rama the reason for Tataka’s depredations against 
Aryan settlers. Agastya had destroyed Tataka’s husband Sunda, 
and was consequently attacked by Tataka and her son Marica. 
Agastya cursed them both, turning Marica into a rakshasa 
and his mother into an ugly ogress. From that time to the 
moment when Rama did away with her, she maintained a war 
of revenge. 

‘ It is very clear,’ observes a modern student of the Agastya 
legends, * that the stories of Agastya were based on historical 
memories. Agastya is typical of the early fighters among the 
Aryans in the South of India. In the Deccan, he is even 
now one of the most famous of holy men and is considered 
the oldest teacher of ancient times. A later age has transformed 
this first apostle of Aryan culture into a tapasvin and a 
holy man. But he must have been a brave and doughty 



70 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


man, a hard fighter and a keen hunter, who triumphed in the 
midst of barbarous enemies. And the same Agastya, the famous 
hunter and archer, whom, like Hercules, none could approach in 
eating and drinking and whose inner essence is yet traceable 
behind the distortions of old sagas, was a holy man somewhat of 
the brand of Friar Tuck in Ivanhoe / 

The site of Agastya’s asrama has been located in many places 
from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin, as well as outside India 
— that in the Malaya mountains, the southernmost section of the 
Western Ghats, being perhaps the most famous. This multipli- 
city of Agastya dsramas and bhavanas has been taken to imply 
either that he is a purely mythical figure or that a whole clan 
of Agastyas spread to all the places mentioned, though it is 
admitted that there is nothing to show when or how the clan 
arose. It seems better to suppose that round the one historical 
Agastya, the author of the Vedic hymns and husband of Lopa- 
mudra, who played an important role in his time in furthering 
the aryanization of the South, there naturally gathered in course 
of time a number of stories representing the further stages of 
the movement he started. 

One of the latest accretions to the cycle is the following 
story which, in some versions of the Ramayana , Agastya him- 
self narrates to Rama. The great forest of Dandaka had be- 
come unfit for human habitation because Bhargava had cursed 
it. From the foot of the Vindhyas to the far South, the land 
remained a howling wilderness for a thousand yojanas. Agastya,. 
however, happening to go there from the white peaks of the 
Himalayas, caused rain to fall, restoring fertility to the soil y 
and making it a fit dwelling-place for several groups of Aryan 
sages (rishis). 

This narrative is not found in any early manuscript of the 
Ramayana and is not annotated by any of the commentators. 
It is obviously a late and clumsy invention. Its account of 
Agastya’s reclamation of desert land and its reference to 
Bhargava’s curse nevertheless seem to bring it into some rela- 
tion with the following legend of Parasurama’s creation of the 
Kerala country, which is also of relatively recent origin and finds 
no place in the genuine Puranas. 

Parasurama slew his mother Renuka at the command of his 
father Jamadagni, and had to expiate this sin by undertaking 


THE DAWN OF HISTORY 


71 


to exterminate the Kshatriyas, enemies of the Brahmins. This 
he did in twenty-one expeditions, and then, at the instance of 
Visvamitra, gave the whole earth to the Brahmins. As he was 
thus left with nowhere to call his own where he could live, 
he sought Subrahmanya’s assistance and, by penance, obtained 
from Varuna, the god of the seas, some land to dwell on. Its 
extent was to be determined by a throw of his parasu (axe). 
He threw it from Kanyakumari to Gokamam, which became 
the chief place in the land won from the sea, the land of 
Parasurama. To people this land, he imported Brahmins from 
abroad, settling them in sixty-four gramas , and making laws 
and institutions for them and for other settlers who came at 
the same time. It may be noted that Kannada inscriptions of 
the early twelfth century a.d. outline the Parasurama story in 
relation to the creation of Konkan, the coastal strip to the north 
of Kerala. 

A rough idea of the process and results of the aryanization 
of the South may be formed by a study of the linguistic map 
of India as it is today, always remembering that difference in 
language is by no means indicative of difference in race, but only 
in culture. The languages of Northern India and Maharashtra 
in the Deccan are clearly dialects of Sanskrit, or some idiom 
closely akin to it, formed in the process of its being spoken 
by different classes of people whose original language it was 
not. Sounds and words unknown to Sanskrit are found in 
considerable numbers in these popular dialects, and they are 
doubtless derived from the original languages of the pre-Aryan 
inhabitants which, in general, were killed by the speech of the 
more masterful incoming culture. But while this was the course 
of events in Northern India and the western Deccan, it was 
quite different on the eastern coast and farther south. Here 
too the Aryans penetrated in sufficient numbers to communicate 
their own civilization to the local inhabitants; but they ‘were 
not able to incorporate them thoroughly into their own society 
and to root out their languages and their peculiar civilization \ 
The bulk of the population in these parts retained their own 
speech and customs, and both were enriched and refined by 
contact with the northern culture. On the other hand, the in- 
coming Aryans had to learn the language of the people of the 
South in addition to cultivating their own Sanskrit idiom, to 



72 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


accept local customs and incorporate them as part of the new 
composite social order they evolved, and to find more or less 
suitable places in their elastic pantheon for the many godlings 
and goddesses cherished by the pre-Aryan peoples. We shall 
never know the exact details of the process; but a study of 
early Tamil literature, the oldest evidence from the southern 
side to which we have access, produces the definite impression 
that the new influences were everywhere welcomed and embraced 
with alacrity, and that the changes were effected peacefully 
and in an orderly manner. This impression may be due to Tamil 
literature being relatively late in its development, and by no 
means contemporary with the first Aryan impact on the South — 
the product, perhaps, of an age of peace and harmony that 
followed a period of initial struggles. But the little we 
know of the history of Indo-Aryan civilization in the eastern 
colonies renders such a supposition alike unnecessary and 
improbable. Nevertheless, the Ramayana lays stress on the 
hostility of the rakshasas to the sacrificial religion of the Aryan 
sages, on their repeated incursions into halls of sacrifice where 
they created much confusion and disorder, and on the great 
need that existed for Rama to curb the excesses of these 
inimical folk in order to secure the safety and peace of the 
asramas. If this part of the story has any historical basis (it is 
indeed very doubtful if it has), it would provide some evidence 
of initial opposition to the incoming culture on the part of the 
older inhabitants of the land. 

Tradition makes Agastya the father of Tamil, the author 
of the first grammar of that language, and the royal chaplain 
(kulaguru) of the divine line of Pandyan rulers, the descendants 
of &iva and Parvati who condescended to become the first king 
and queen of this celebrated line. 

There is no clear and specific reference to Agastya, the sage, 
much less to his exploits, in any of the early Tamil works now 
known — the anthologies of the &angam Age; once indeed the 
phrase 4 Sage of Podiyil 5 (Podiyil being the southernmost section 
of the Western Ghats, the Bettigo of Ptolemy) is applied to the 
star Canopus — an indication that the legends relating to Agastya 
were not unknown in the Tamil land at the time. His miracu- 
lous birth and his relation to Vasishtha were known to the 
author of the poem Mcmimekalau The same work also says that 


THE DAWN OF HISTORY 


73 


Agastya was a friend of the Chola king Kanta at whose request 
he released the Kaveri from his water pot, that Agastya’s abode 
was in the Malaya mountains, and that he advised another 
legendary Chola monarch — he who overthrew the hanging castle 
( tungeyil ) — to institute at Puhar an annual festival in honour of 
Indra. Another story narrated by Naccinarkkiniyar (c. a.d. 1400), 
a commentator of the Middle Ages, on the authority of a more 
ancient writer, is that Ravana who tyrannized over the extreme 
South was persuaded by Agastya when the latter came to Podiya 
hill to leave that land alone and betake himself to Lanka. 

References to Agastya’s work on Tamil grammar make their 
appearance rather late. The first occurs in the amazing legend 
of the three Sangams narrated in the Iraiyanar Agapporul UraU 
a work of the eighth or ninth century a.d. Here Agastya is 
counted as a member of the first and second Sangams which lasted 
for 4,440 years and 3,700 years respectively. His work Agattiyam 
is said to have been the grammar ( nul ) for the first Sangam, while 
that work together with the Tolkappiyam and three other works 
formed the nul for the second Sangam. 

Whether Agastya wrote a treatise on Tamil grammar, and if 
so in what relation that work stood to the Tolkappiyam , the 
oldest extant work on the subject, has been discussed by 
all the great annotators of the Tamil country. Perasiriyar 
(c. a.d. 1300) says that in his day some scholars held that 
Tolkappiyan, the author of the grammar named after him, 
composed his work on principles other than those of the 
Agattiyam , following in this other grammars no longer extant. 
He refutes this theory by an appeal to tradition and authority, 
the Iraiyanar Agapporul Urai being the chief. He maintains, 
with support from more ancient writings, that Agastya was the 
founder of the Tamil language and grammar, that Tolkappiyan 
was the most celebrated of the twelve pupils of the great sage, 
that the Agattiyam was the original grammar, that Tolkappiyan 
must be held to have followed its teachings in his new work, 
and that Agastya’s work must have been composed before the 
Tamil country was confined, by an inundation of the sea, to 
the limits indicated by Panambaranar in his preface to the 
Tolkappiyam — i.e. from Vengadam hill to Cape Comorin. The 
opposite party that denied Tolkappiyan’s indebtedness to 
Agastya did not give up its position. The general belief that 



74 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Tolkappiyan was a disciple of Agastya was too strong for them 
to deny, so they postulated hostility between teacher and pupil 
arising out of Agastya’s jealousy and hot temper. Naccinark- 
kiniyar records the story that after his migration to the South, 
Agastya sent his pupil Trinadhumagni (Tolkappiyan) to fetch 
his wife Lopamudra from the North. Agastya prescribed that 
a certain distance should be maintained between the pupil and 
the lady during their journey, but when the rising of the Vaigai 
threatened to drown Lopamudra, Tolkappiyan approached too 
close in holding out to her a bamboo pole with the aid of which 
she reached the shore in safety. Agastya cursed them for violat- 
ing his instructions saying that they would never enter heaven; 
to which Tolkappiyan replied with a similar curse on his master. 
This silly legend represents the last phase of a controversy, 
longstanding, significant, and by no means near its end even in 
our own time. 

The affirmation and denial of Agastya’s fathership of Tamil 
and of his work being the source of the Tolkappiyam are both 
symbolic of an attitude to the incoming northern Sanskritic 
influences. As a matter of fact there is no mention of Agastya 
either in the Tolkappiyam or in the preface to it by Panam- 
baranar. The earliest reference to the Agattiyam occurs only 
in the eighth or ninth century a.d., as we have seen, and that 
is also the time when the Pandyan charters begin to proclaim 
the preceptorship of Agastya to the Pandyas, the patrons of 
Tamil literature and the Sangam, and the first genuine Tamil 
power to achieve political expansion and establish an empire 
in the full fight of history. Almost all the stories meant to 
support Agastya’s connexion with Tamil and Tolkappiyan must 
have been elaborated in subsequent ages; but the attempt to 
give Agastya the dominant position in the evolution of Tamil 
culture evoked a challenge. Things went on smoothly so long 
as Aryan influence, the influence of the ‘ Northern ’ speech and 
culture, was content to penetrate the Tamil land quietly and 
by imperceptible stages, and effect a silent transformation of 
the native elements. This process began very early and was 
accepted by the Tamils to an extent that has rendered it all but 
impossible to differentiate the elements that have gone to make 
up the composite culture. But when a theory was put forward, 
that is when a legend was invented to show that Tamil as a 



THE DAWN OF HISTORY

spoken language and with it the entire culture of the Tamil 
country was derived from a Yedic seer, this was met, naturally, by 
a counter-assertion and the elaboration of legends in the opposite 
sense. And then, as with some even now, legends were arguments. 

The aryanization of the South was doubtless a slow pro- 
cess spread over several centuries. Beginning probably about 
1000 b.c., it had reached its completion before the time of Katya- 
yana, the grammarian of the fourth century b.c., who men- 
tions the names of the Tamil countries of the extreme South. 
What were the routes followed by the colonists who moved 
into the South? Arguing a priori , some scholars have held that 
the hills and forests of the Vindhya and the Satpura ranges and 
the Narmada river formed an effective barrier to movement 
towards the South, and that consequently the chief line of 
communication must have lain along the eastern coast. But 
the Aryan expansion started from the north-west and proceeded 
towards the east and south. The eastern parts of North India 
came under Aryan influences at a relatively late period, and 
even then were not as completely aryanized as the western half. 
Though Kalin ga is indeed mentioned by Panini, it still appears 
extremely unlikely that the main route of Aryan advance to 
the South lay along the east coast. The evidence of the Brah- 
manas, of the Ramayana and of the Buddhist canon indicates 
clearly that the barrier of the Vindhyas was negotiated at con- 
venient points and that the chief routes lay right across them, 
the Narmada and the Satpuras. Vidarbha is one of the ear- 
liest kingdoms to be mentioned and no one has sought to locate 
any place connected with Rama’s exile anywhere to the east 
of Nagpur, while many would locate them all in the west- 
ern Deccan, Nasik and its neighbourhood having the best 
claims. The route taken by the pupils of Bavari from Asmaka 
to Magadha must have been the reverse of the usual Aryan 
route to the South, which must have passed through the Avanti 
country to Mandhata on the Narmada, whence it crossed the 
river and mountains into the South. The Mulaka country 
with Paithan as its principal city must have been among the 
earliest colonies after Vidarbha, and then Asmaka might have 
followed. The route farther South cannot be traced with any 
certainty. It has been suggested that the name of one section 
of South Indian Brahmins, Brihaccarana, 4 the great migration \ 



76 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


preserves the memory of a great movement towards the South; 
and if this view is correct, the fact that a section of this group, 
the Malanadu, is further subdivided into the Kandra-Manikkam, 
Mangudi and Satya-mangalam — all names of villages along the 
Western Ghats — may be taken to indicate that the immigrants 
hugged the line of the adjacent highlands and peopled the skirts 
of Mysore and the Coimbatore and Madura districts before they 
spread elsewhere. But all this is too speculative, and there is no 
direct evidence worth the name. Other routes than across the 
Vindhyas might have been followed; there is, for example, the 
sea-route from the mouths of the Indus to Gujarat and the north 
Bombay coast; or, at a relatively later date, the eastern route by 
Kahnga. Ceylon, perhaps, was aryanized by immigrants who 
followed the sea-route from North India, as evidenced by their 
language, Sinhalese, which is Indo-Aryan. 

During the long period of seven or eight centuries when South 
India was being progressively aryanized and a new culture was 
being evolved, the ancient maritime contacts of the country with 
the lands to the west and east were still maintained, the tangible 
evidence of which, literary and archaeological, deserves the follow- 
ing brief notice. 

The queen of Sheba visited Solomon at Jerusalem ‘ with a 
very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, 
and precious stones \ Again, the navy of Hiram ‘ that brought 
gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug 
trees, and precious stones \ King Solomon made ‘ a great throne 
of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold’. Lastly, ‘the king 
had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in 
three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, 
ivory, and apes, and peacocks ’. Hiram was the Phoenician king 
of Tyre and Solomon’s alliance with him was an essential element 
in the prosperity of Jerusalem in his time. Hiram used Solomon’s 
kingdom as a high road to the Red Sea where he built shipping 
which greatly promoted trade and led to an accumulation of great 
wealth in Jerusalem. Ophir may well be the Abhira country, and 
its twin Tharshish may also be sought there. The peacocks and 
sandalwood (almug) Solomon obtained are both South Indian in 
name as well as in origin. Though silver was not an Indian 
product some of the ivory might have been, especially as the 
Hebrew, Egyptian and Greek names for the elephant are derived

ultimately from the Sanskrit ibha. Ebony was another Indian 
article conveyed to Palestine in this period by the merchants of 
Dedan on the south shore of the Persian Gulf. The Assyrian and 
Babylonian empires traded with India by sea from their ports on 
the Persian Gulf and continued to receive gold, spices and fragrant 
woods from India. It has been pointed out rightly that 4 rice, 
peacocks, sandalwood, every unknown article which we find 
imported by sea into Babylon before the fifth century b.c., brought 
with it a Dravidian, not a Sanskrit, designation In the seventh 
century b.c. traders from the west introduced into southern China 
a system of inscribed coinage based on a Babylonian standard, 
and a sea-trade between Babylon and China necessarily includes 
India. A beam of Indian cedar found in the palace of Nebu- 
chadnezzar (604 — 562 b.c.), the teak logs found in the temple of 
the Moon-god at Ur at levels belonging to about the same age or 
a little later, and the Baveru Jataka which relates the adventures 
of certain Indian merchants who took the first peacock by sea to 
Babylon, all confirm the existence of active maritime intercourse 
between South India and its western neighbours. In the seventh 
and sixth centuries b.c., Babylon was at the height of its splendour, 
the greatest commercial mart of the world ; men of many nations, 
frequented its bazaars, and we may well assume that among them 
were merchants from South India. When Babylon fell, the trade 
passed into the hands of the Arab merchants of Mouza, Aden and 
Kane. The author of the Periplus says that the voyage to India 
was made along the shore and in small ships until Hippalus dis- 
covered the monsoon; but the normal trade route from the Persian 
Gulf to India can never have lain along the inhospitable shores of 
Gedrosia, and 4 the exploring expeditions despatched by Darius 
in 512 b.c. from the mouth of the Indus, and nearly two centuries 
later by Alexander the Great, show the difficulties and dangers 
of the route, the time it occupied, and the ignorance of the pilots \ 
The knowledge of the monsoons must have been very common 
among the sailors of India, Arabia and Persia from early times, 
and the mariners who reached China in the seventh century b.c. 
could not have feared sailing on the open seas. Hippalus’ discovery 
(c. a.d. 45), if it was a fact, must have been of value to the Roman 
and Greek traders of his time. 

In Chinese historical sources occur references to maritime 
traders bringing typical Indian products to China as far back as 



78 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


the seventh century b.c. Generally regarded with incredulity, 
these accounts receive striking confirmation by the discovery in 
the Philippines of a number of Iron-Age finds bearing close 
resemblance to objects found in South India of about the same 
age — the first millennium b.c. These comprise iron implements 
and weapons such as knives, axes, daggers and spear-points; 
glass beads and bangles, both green and blue; and finally beads 
of semi-precious stones such as agate, cornelian, amethyst, and 
rock-crystal. In the earlier Iron-Age strata only green glass, 
whose colour is due to iron, occurs; in the later, a blue glass, 
whose colour is due to copper, also occurs. ‘ Both the iron and 
glass objects are similar to and in some cases identical with the 
prehistoric glass and iron finds in the South of India. These 
occur in the dolmen tombs and in burials which are found by 
the hundreds of thousands, and which almost certainly antedate 
the historic Chera, Chola and Pandyan kingdom, whose history 
goes back to the beginning of the Christian era or before. 
As finds of similar glass beads and bangles have recently been 
made in the Malay Peninsula, in dolmen tombs in Java, and 
in North Borneo, the inference is inescapable that we have clear 
evidence of a trade contact between the northern Philippines 
and Southern India running well back into the first millennium 
B.c. The extensive trade and colonization and later conquests 
of the South Indian kingdoms, in Sumatra and Java as well 
as in Indo-China in the early centuries of the Christian era, are 
of course well known. The new material, however, seems to 
make it clear that this was far from being the beginning of 
such contacts, but rather the last stages in an associaion reach- 
ing as far as the northern Philippines, which had begun many 
centuries before.’

CHAPTER V 


THE AGE OF THE MAURYAN EMPIRE 

Nanda rule in the South — Jain accounts of the end of Chandragupta 
Maurya — inscriptions — Arthasastra on trade between North and South India — 
Megasthenes oiv-Pandya — Tamil kingdoms in the edicts of Asoka — Satiyaputa 
— Asoka’s empire in the Deccan— confederacy of Tamil states — Mauryan 
interest in the politics of the South — Brahml inscriptions in caverns and 
their import. 

In the fourth century b.c., the empire of Magadha was greatly 
expanded under the powerful, though unpopular, dynasty of 
the Nandas who, according to puranic accounts, conquered 
all rival monarchs and became sole emperors of the whole of 
India. How far their sway extended into the South, it is by 
no means easy to determine. That it included Kalinga seems 
to be confirmed by the famous Hathigumpha inscription of 
Kharavela who ruled over Kalinga in the second century b.c. 
This inscription mentions a Nanda raja in connexion with the 
construction of an aqueduct, and states elsewhere that King 
Nanda carried away as trophies of war a statue of Jina and 
other heirlooms of the rulers of Kalinga. Kannada inscriptions 
from Mysore of the tenth and eleventh centuries a.d. preserve 
faint memories of the rule of the Nandas in the Kuntala coun- 
try; but there is little confirmation of this tradition. Nander 
on the upper reaches of the Godavari has sometimes been 
taken to be the survival of an ancient name like Nau-Nand- 
adhera and as indicating the extent of Nanda power into 
the Deccan. Indeed, punch-marked Purana coins, which are 
found all over the Deccan, South India, and Ceylon as well 
as in North India, are clear witnesses of ancient contacts 
between the North and South whose details are now lost; 
but while they enable us to infer the existence of trade con- 
nexions, they are of no avail in fixing the southern limit of 
the Nanda empire. The inclusion of Kuntala in that empire 
conforms to the limits of the Mauryan empire under Asoka 
as determined by the existence of his inscriptions in the South, 
and there is no clear evidence of the Mauryan emperors having 
undertaken wars of conquest in the South. It may, after

all, be that the Kannada inscriptions mentioned above pre- 
serve a correct tradition — that the Mauryas came by their 
Southern possessions as a matter of course by overthrowing 
the imperial dynasty of the Nandas. The enormous wealth 
accumulated by the Nandas was well known to the ancient 
Tamils, and became proverbial. Mamulanar, one of the poets 
of the Sangam Age, puts these words into the mouth of a 
love-lorn lady: ‘What is it that has attracted my lover more 
than my charms and kept him away from me so long? Can 
it be the treasure accumulated in prosperous Pataliputra and 
hidden in the waters of the Ganges by the great Nandas vic- 
torious in war?’ 

Jain tradition affirms that when Bhadrabahu, the last of 
the saints called srutakeyalins , foretold a famine of twelve 
years’ duration, the Mauryan emperor Chandragupta abdicated 
the throne and migrated to the South with the saint and his 
pupils. The emperor is said to have lived for many years as 
a Jain ascetic in Sravana Belgola in Mysore, and ultimately 
committed suicide by sallekhana , or starvation, surviving his 
teacher by twelve years. Inscriptions from Sravana Belgola 
and its neighbourhood mention Bhadrabahu and Chandragupta 
munindra; one inscription, which may be as old as a.d. 600, 
mentions the pair (yugma) and says that theirs was the safe 
faith (i dharma ); and another of even earlier date, probably 
not later than the fifth century, contains all the elements of 
the story given above. Bhadrabahu, according to this ac- 
count, foretold at Ujjain a period of twelve years of dire 
famine, and the whole of the Jain sangha thereupon migrated 
from the North to the South under his leadership. When they 
arrived at a mountain named Katavapra (that is, Chandragiri) 
in a populous and prosperous country (Mysore), an Acharya 
(Prabhachandra by name), knowing he had but a short time 
to live, sent away the entire sangha and, with only one disciple 
attending on him, performed penance and gained emancipation 
from his body. Two inscriptions of about a.d. 900 from the 
neighbourhood of Seringapatam describe the summit of the lower 
hill Chandragiri at Sravana Belgola as marked by the footprints 
of both Bhadrabahu and Chandragupta munipati. Later inscrip- 
tions at Havana Belgola bearing dates in the twelfth and fifteenth 
centuries repeat this tradition with variations. Similar attestation 



THE AGE OF THE MAURYAN EMPIRE 


81 


also comes from literary sources, of which the earliest seems to- 
be the Brihatkathdkosa of Harishena (a.d. 931). The absence 
of any clear evidence about the actual end of Chandragupta 
Maurya lends some plausibility to this legend; but it is impro- 
bable in itself, and the identity of the Chandragupta muni of the 
inscriptions is by no means beyond doubt. 

The Arthasastra of Kautilya gives some information of value 
about the trade between the North and the South in the age of 
the early Mauryan empire. ‘ Among land routes,’ says Kautilya, 
‘my teacher considers that leading to the Himalaya superior to the 
one leading to Dakshinapatha, because of the elephants, horses, 
spices, ivory, hides, silver and gold articles, all very valuable (to 
be had there).’ He then expounds his own quite different view 
as follows : ‘ No,’ says Kautilya. ‘Although it is deficient in woollen 
cloth, hides and horses, the Dakshinapatha abounds in conch- 
shells, diamonds, precious stones of other kinds, pearls, and articles 
of gold. Moreover, the southern trade route across Dakshinapatha 
traverses a territory rich in mines and valuable merchandise, is 
frequented by many (traders) and easy to travel by. That is the 
superior route.’ This passage almost brings before our eyes the 
large-scale opening-up of trade with the South which the founda- 
tion of the Nanda and Mauryan empires brought about. The 
view represented by Kautilya’s teacher (achdrya) was becoming 
rapidly out of date as a result of new conditions, and the pupil 
affirms that there were in his day more wealth and larger possi- 
bilities of trade in the South than ever before. The mention of 
gold, diamonds and other precious stones and pearls, and of the 
easy conditions of travel along the much frequented routes, 
deserves to be particularly noted. Again, in his account of the 
articles that entered the royal treasury, Kautilya includes varieties 
of pearls from the Tambraparni river in the Pandyan country, from 
Pandyakavata (which is explained in the commentary as the 
Malayakoti mountain in the same area), and from the Churna 
river in Kerala. He also mentions fine cotton fabrics from 
Madura, as well as vaidurya (beryl) of various colours, and 
varieties of sandalwood which must also have come from 
South India. 

The legendary account given by Megasthenes of the rule of 
the Pandyan kingdom by Pandaia, a daughter of Herakles, has. 
been noticed already ; it must be understood as recounting 
6 



82 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


the origin of the kingdom rather than as describing contem- 
porary conditions. Megasthenes says that each day one village 
brought its due tribute to the royal treasury, this tribute being, 
perhaps, a payment in kind calculated to ensure a regular supply 
of provisions for the daily consumption of the royal household. 
There is a similar statement in the Silappadikdram ( c . a.d. 600) that 
on a particular day a certain cowherd family in a suburb of Madura 
took its turn to supply ghee to the royal palace. 

The kingdoms of South India, together with Ceylon, are 
mentioned in the second and thirteenth rock-edicts of Asoka. 
The list in the second edict is the more complete and includes 
the names of Chola, Pandya, Satiyaputa, Keralaputa and Tamba- 
panni (Ceylon). All these lands are distinctly stated to have 
lain outside the empire of Asoka; but the great emperor was on 
such friendly terms with them that he undertook to arrange for 
the proper medical care of men and animals in all of them, and 
for the importation and planting of useful medicinal herbs and 
roots wherever they were needed. He also sent missionaries to 
preach the dhamma , the essentials of Buddhism, among the people 
of these countries, thus evincing a keen interest in their spiritual 
and moral well-being no less than in their physical fitness. The 
mere mention of such facts is enough to indicate a certain level 
of general culture and progress in the arts of civilization among 
the people of the South. The Tamils and the Sinhalese must 
have had a settled polity and lived in well-ordered states for 
some time before Asoka could think of starting his friendly inter- 
course with them. 

The identification of the Satiyaputa kingdom is not easy and has 
long been a subject of controversy. The name was, till recently, 
recognized as a tribal name which may be Sanskritized into 
Satyaputras, ‘members of the fraternity of truth’, and the only 
tribe answering to this description known to early Tamil literature 
held to be the Kosar, celebrated for their unswerving fidelity to 
the plighted word as well as for their heroism in war. Their 
home is said to have been in the Kongu country — roughly the 
modem districts of Salem and Coimbatore — and they overran 
the Tulu country on the west coast in the early centuries of the 
Christian era. They occupy a considerable place in the literature 
•of the Sangam period, and it seemed highly probable that they 
should find a place in the earliest enumeration of the political

4i visions of the Tamil country next to the three main kingdoms 
of the South. Scholars therefore tentatively accepted the identity 
of the Satiyaputa with the Kosar and their country with Kongu. 



SOUTH INDIA: 300 B.C. -A.D. 500 


The Satputes among modern Marathas were taken to be descen- 
dants of emigrants to Maharashtra from the South. A more 
satisfactory equation is that of Satiyaputa with Adiyaman (also 
Adigaman or Adigaiman), first suggested by K. G. Sesha Aiyar 
and supported on good linguistic grounds by T. Burrow. 1

84 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


The conquest of Kalinga by Asoka (c. 260 b.c.) is one of the 
best-known events of his reign and formed the turning-point in 
his spiritual career. No wonder his edicts are found in Dhauli 
in the delta of the Mahanadi, and at Jaugada in the Ganjam 
district, then certainly part of Kalinga. Dhauli was perhaps 
the same as Tosali, the capital of Kalinga in those days. A 
fragment of one of the edicts of Asoka discovered at Sopara near 
Bombay proves the inclusion within the Mauryan empire of the 
north-west as well as the north-east of the Deccan. Farther 
south Asokan inscriptions have been found in the Raichur and 
Chitaldrug districts in Mysore, and in the Kurnool district of 
Andhra. How much farther south the empire of the Mauryas- 
extended can only be conjectured; it seems not unlikely that a 
part of the Tondaimandalam was included in it; at any rate, a 
Pallava inscription of the ninth century a.d. (the VeLurpalaiyam 
plates) mentions an Asokavarman among the earliest rulers of 
Kanchipuram. The countries of the Deccan are very well re- 
presented in the account given by the Ceylonese chronicle Maha - 
vamsa of the missions sent after the third Buddhist council at 
Pataliputra for the propagation of the dhamma in different 
countries. We learn that a certain Mahadeva was sent to 
Mahishamandala (Mysore) and one Rakkhita to Vanavasi (after- 
wards the centre of the Kadamba kingdom), a Yona Dhamma- 
rakkhita, possibly a Greek monk, was deputed to Aparantaka 
(the northern half of the Bombay coast) and Maharakkhita to 
the Maratha country. Mahinda, the son of Asoka, who was 
responsible for the conversion of Ceylon, also finds a place in the 
list along with four others who share with him the honour of 
carrying the gospel to Lanka. Though this account is seven or 
eight centuries later than the time to which it relates, there is good 
reason to believe that it preserves a fairly correct tradition quite 
in conformity with the evidence of the Asokan inscriptions. 
All the Deccan states mentioned were of course within the empire 
of Asoka. 

The Rathikas and Bhojas of the western and northern 
Deccan as well as the Andhras and Paradas of the eastern 
Deccan and the Pitenikas who have not yet been localized seem 
to have enjoyed a considerable measure of autonomy in their 
government. They could not have been independent as they 
are definitely described in Asoka’s inscriptions as peoples in. 


THE AGE OF THE MAURYAN EMPIRE

the king’s territory. The Deccan was an important part of 
the Mauryan empire and contained the seats of two viceroyal- 
ties — Tosali (Dhauli), and Suvarnagiri, now called Kanaka- 
giri, between Hampi and Maski in Hyderabad. The land was 
placed under mahamatras , some assisting viceroys, others in 
charge of districts and others dispensing justice in the cities. 
Antamahamatras were charged with defence and missionary work 
among backward peoples. 

The characters of the Asokan inscriptions in Mysore, and 
Kurnool vary in several respects from those of the Northern 
edicts and have been recognized as a special Southern variety of 
the Brahml script. This shows that writing must have been in 
use in the South for some time before to allow of such variations 
being developed, and that the southerners understood the language 
and were the equals of their North Indian contemporaries in 
their culture and outlook. 

Inscriptions on stone relic caskets found in the stupa at 
Bhattiprolu near the mouth of the Krishna river are probably 
only a few decades later than Asoka’s edicts; they are engraved 
in the same Southern variety of the Brahml script, and their 
language obviously reflects many peculiarities of local speech. 
These inscriptions mention a king Kubiraka and his father whose 
name is lost. 

The famous Hathlgumpha inscription of Kharavela (first 
half of the second century b.c.) mentions a league of Tamil states 
that was 113 years old at the date of the inscription and had 
been for some time a source of danger to the Kalinga kingdom. 
This shows that the different states of the Tamil country were, 
even at that early age, capable of entering into enduring diplo- 
matic relations and pursuing a steady policy towards neighbouring 
states, near and far. 

The poet Mamulanar, whose reference to the hoarded wealth 
of the Nandas has been cited above, says that the Kosar 
started operations against their foes and gained successes against 
many of them; but as the chief of Mohur did not submit, the 
Moriyar, who had a large army of which the war-like Vadugar 
formed the vanguard, sent an expedition to the South to assist 
them. Mamulanar wrote about four centuries later than the 
fall of the Mauryan empire, and if his expression ‘ vamba moriyar ’ 
is taken to refer to the newly-risen Moriyas, the dispatch of 



86 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


assistance to the Kosar to help them in their conquests must have 
occurred when the Mauryan empire was still strong and powerful. 
This active intervention of the Mauryas in the politics of the 
Tamil country has so far escaped notice, but the lines of 
Mamulanar are clear in their import. The political unification of 
India under the Mauryas was then very real, and the court of 
Pataliputra was interested in occurrences in the extreme South 
of the peninsula. ‘Vadugar’ literally means ‘ northerners \ and 
was the name applied in Sangam literature to the ancestors of the 
Telugu-Kannada people living in the Deccan, immediately to the 
north of the Tamil country whose northern limit was Vengadam* 
the Tirupati hill. The Deccan was a part of the Mauryan empire* 
and that Deccani troops formed the vanguard of the Mauryan 
army is quite intelligible. 

Mamulanar himself and other poets make further references 
to the Mauryas strongly tinged with the mythology of the con- 
cept of Chakravarti — the wheel-emperor; but these need not 
detain us or detract from the value of the specific historical 
references in Mamulanar cited above. Let us note further that 
the poems contain no basis for the view often expressed that 
the Mauryas invaded South India and reached the Podiya moun- 
tain in the extreme South. 

The short Brahml inscriptions found in natural rock caverns 
in the hills of the South have many features in common with 
the similar, but more numerous, records of Ceylon, and are 
among the earliest monuments of the Tamil country to which 
we may assign a date with some confidence. The script em- 
ployed resembles that of the inscriptions from Bhattiprolu 
and may well be assigned to the third century B.c. These 
inscriptions have not yet been fully elucidated; but clearly 
they are mostly either brief donative records or the names of 
the monks who once lived there. One of the places where 
the caverns are found bears the name Kalugumalai, ‘vulture’s 
hill ’, Tamil for Gridhrakuta, a name hallowed in the annals of 
early Buddhism. From this fact it has been deduced that these 
monuments were all of them of Buddhist origin; but it is 
premature to formulate final conclusions on this matter. New 
caves and inscriptions are still being discovered, such as the 
inscribed natural cave at Malakonda in the Nellore district. And 
\ tradition is strong, as we have seen, that Jainism came into South 


THE AGE OF THE MAURY AN EMPIRE 


87 


India about the same time as Buddhism, if not earlier. It is not 
possible to assert that these monuments owe their origin exclusively 
to Buddhists or Jains; it is probable that some may be attributed 
to* the one and some to the other. 

Though the script of these inscriptions is Brahmi of the 
Southern variety, the language employed in many of them is 
Tamil in its formative stages. The writing was alphabetic, and 
already included signs for peculiarly Dravidian sounds like r, /, 
/ and n. Other notable features are that vocalic consonants were 
represented by two symbols, first the sign of the consonant and 
then the complete vowel sign. These developments (and others 
not detailed here) must have resulted from a process of trial and 
error extending perhaps over several generations. 

The exact contents of these inscriptions still remain obscure, 
but a few facts emerge from tentative studies of them. We 
can say, for instance, that among the donors of monuments 
were a husbandman (kutumbika) of Ceylon (Ila), besides a woman, 
merchants ( vanikar ), and members of the Karani caste. These 
brief inscriptions are thus seen to bear testimony to the support 
commanded from all classes of the laity by the ascetics who 
pursued their spiritual life in the solitudes of mountains and 
forests. Yet it seems easy to exaggerate their social and reli- 
gious significance; there is no evidence that the Tamil people 
in general had accepted Jainism or Buddhism in this early period; 
and the evidence from the literature of the succeeding age, that 
of the §angam, shows the Yedic religion of sacrifice and some 
forms of popular Hinduism entrenched in the affections of the 
people and their rulers.

THE SATAVAHANAS AND THEIR SUCCESSORS 


Duration and area of Satavahana rule — Satavahanas and Andhras — rise 
and expansion of the Satavahana power — Hala — §aka conquests — Sata- 
vahana revival under Gautamlputra Satakarni and his son — Yajna §atakami 
— later Satavahanas — Satavahana polity — society — cities — ports — trade — 
religion. 

Successors of the Satavahanas — Abhiras — Chutus — Ikshvakus and their 
administration — Brihatphalayanas — Pallavas and their adminstrative system. 

The Salankayanas— Matharas of Kalinga — Vishnukundins — kings of the 
Ananda gotra. 

The Vakatakas of Berar — the Kadambas of Banavasi— the Gangas of 
Gangavadi. 

In the Deccan, the Mauryan empire was followed by the rule of 
the Satavahanas, which lasted for four and a half centuries 
from about 230 b.c. At its greatest extent the Satavahana empire 
covered the whole of the Deccan and spread far into Northern 
India, perhaps even as far as Magadha. Its collapse followed 
ultimately upon long wars against the Sakas of Gujarat in the 
first and second centuries a.d. By the beginning of the third 
century the empire had virtually disappeared, giving place to a 
number of minor independent dynasties. 

The dynasty ( kula ) of the Satavahanas is doubtless identi- 
cal with the Andhras or Andhrabhrityas in the puranic lists of 
kings. They were called Andhras because they were of Andhra 
origin (jdti) and their rule was probably confined to the Andhra 
country at the time the puranic lists were compiled. The other 
name, Andhrabhrityas (‘Andhra servants’), may imply that the 
ancestors of the royal Satavahanas were employed in the service 
of the Mauryan empire and thus moved into the western Dec- 
can where they set up an independent state when that empire 
declined after Asoka. Pliny mentions the Andhra territory in 
the eastern Deccan as including thirty walled towns, besides 
numerous villages, and as maintaining an army of 100,000 in- 
fantry, 2,000 cavalry, and 1,000 elephants. Though the Puranas 
list thirty kings of the dynasty ruling all together over 460 years, it 
is very difficult, in the present state of our knowledge, to narrate 



THE SATAVAHANAS AND THEIR SUCCESSORS 89 


their history in a connected form. The names of the earliest 
kings in the puranic lists figure also in inscriptions and on coins 
found in the western Deccan at Nasik, Karle and Naneghat. 
There is no trace of these early monarchs in the Andhra country 
on the east coast. Again, Kharavela of Kalinga states clearly 
that the territory of the Satavahana king Satakarni lay to the 
west of his kingdom. From these facts we may conclude that 
the Satavahanas rose to power in the western Deccan, in the 
region round about Paithan (Pratishthana) traditionally associated 
with them, and thence spread their empire in all directions. In 
the first instance they conquered north and south Maharashtra, 
eastern and western Malwa, and what is now Madhya Pradesh. 
. In this task they were helped by the Rathikas and Bhojas 
who were duly rewarded with offices, titles and matrimonial 
.alliances. 

The exact date of the foundation of Satavahana power cannot 
be determined, but the puranic lists suggest that the first king, 
Simuka, probably began to reign about 230 b.c. This suggestion 
is confirmed by the script of the Nasik inscription of the second 
king Kanha (Krishna) which has been assigned by Blihler to ‘ the 
times of the last Mauryas or the earliest Sungas, in the beginning 
of the second century b.c.’ According to Jain accounts Simuka 
(who ruled for 23 years) grew so wicked towards the end of 
his reign that he was dethroned and killed. He was succeeded 
by his brother Kanha (207-189 b.c.) who extended his king- 
dom to the west as far as Nasik if not farther. The third king 
was Sri Satakarni I, whose figure was sculptured in rilievo at 
Naneghat along with the figures of his father Simuka, his 
queen Naganika, a Maharathi, and three princes. He conquered 
western Malwa, and an inscription of his queen records his 
performance of certain great sacrifices and the fees paid to the 
officiating priests, including tens of thousands of cows, thou- 
sands of horses, numbers of elephants, whole villages and huge 
sums of money (tens of thousands of karshapanas). Twice it 
appears that Satakarni proclaimed his suzerainty by performing 
the horse-sacrifice, and the victory thus celebrated must have 
been at the expense of the Sungas, the imperial power of the 
North. In the drama Malavikagnimitra , Kalidasa mentions a 
victory of the Sungas over the Andhras, which was doubtless 
an episode in the struggle which ended with the final victory of 



90 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


the Andhras. Coins and inscriptions indicate the progress of 
Satavahana power, first from Pratishthana to Ujjain and then 
to Vidisa. Satakarni I may be the king mentioned in the Hathl- 
gumpha inscription of Kharavela, but it is more likely that it 
refers to Satakarni II, the seventh Andhra king who must have 
come to the throne about 172 b.c. Satakami I is described in 
the inscription of his queen as ‘ the Lord of Dakshinapatha ’ and 
as 6 the wielder of the unchecked wheel ’ (< ipratihata-chakrd)„ 
Satakarni II enjoyed the longest reign, 56 years, and wrested 
Malwa from the Sungas. He was most probably the Satakarni 
whom Kharavela of Kalinga defied in the second year of his 
reign by sending a large army of horse, elephant, foot-soldiers 
and chariots to the west. Two years later Kharavela claims to 
have humbled the Rathikas of the Maratha country and the 
Bhojas of Berar, both feudatories of the Andhra ruler of 
Pratishthana. This challenge to the predominant power of the 
Deccan was apparently not pursued beyond the limit of safety. 
Satakami II may have extended his empire to Madhya Pradesh, 
as a coin of his successor Apllaka has been found in the 
eastern half of that state. Hala, the seventeenth Satavahana 
king ( c . a.d. 20-24), is famous in literature as the compiler of 
Sattasal ( Saptasati ), a collection of 700 erotic gathas in the 
Arya metre in Maharashtrl Prakrit. In its present form the 
work contains linguistic features of the second or third century 
a.d. or even later. 

The expansion of the Satavahanas received a check from a 
new power from the west. About 75 b.c., the Sakas of Seistan 
had occupied the Indus delta, known thereafter as Sakadvxpa 
to Indian writers and as Indo-Scythia to Greek geographers. 
A legendary episode in the history of Ujjain may be taken to 
mark the beginnings of the long struggle between the Sakas 
and the Andhras, the varying fortunes of which can be traced 
clearly in the inscriptions of a slightly later time. The story 
is that the Jain saint Kalaka was insulted by King Garda- 
bhilla of Ujjain and persuaded the Sakas to invade Ujjain 
and avenge his wrong. Gardabhilla was thus overthrown, but 
some years later his son Vikramaditya (‘ Sun of Valour ’) issued 
from Pratishthana, repelled the invaders and founded an era 
in 57 b.c. to commemorate his victory. It is not improbable 
that these traditions have an historical basis connected with the 



THE SATAVAHANAS AND THEIR SUCCESSORS 91 


history of the Andhras. But it is certain that the Saka power 
in the west was finally destroyed by the Gupta ruler Chandra- 
gupta II (a.d. 380-414), also a Vikramaditya, and that legend 
has failed to distinguish the later Vikramaditya from his earlier 
namesake. 

The four immediate successors of Hala had short reigns 
totalling less than a dozen years all together, an indication of a 
troubled time. About the same time the 4 western satraps ’ (Sakas) 
came into prominence. Bhumaka is the earliest of them, and 
Nahapana the greatest conqueror. His rule extended over Gujarat, 
Kathiawar, northern Maharashtra, Konkan, and even parts of 
southern Maharashtra for a time. The Periplus states that the 
kingdom of Mambanus (Nahapana) began with Ariake (Aryaka 
of Varahamihira), and that the Greek ships coming into the Sata~ 
vahana port of Kalyan were diverted to Barygaza (Broach). 
Nahapana’s capital was Minnagara, perhaps Dohad, half-way 
between Ujjain and Broach. The expansion of Saka power at the 
expense of the Satavahanas probably occurred in the period 
a.d. 40-80, about the time of the Periplus. 

Under Gautamlputra Satakami (c. a.d. 80-104), the Sata- 
vahana power revived. He is described as the destroyer of the 
£akas, Pahlavas and Yavanas. He overthrew Nahapana and 
restruck large numbers of his silver coins. From the Sakas he 
recovered northern Maharashtra and the Konkan, the Narmada 
valley and Saurashtra, besides Malwa and western Rajputana. 
His empire extended to Vidarbha (Berar) and to Banavasi in the 
south. There is no evidence of his rule in Andhradesa, though 
it may have touched Kalinga. His achievements are recorded in 
glowing terms by his mother, GautamI BalasrI, in an inscription 
at Nasik engraved after his death in the nineteenth year of his son 
and successor Pulumayi II. This shows that the Sakas did not 
regain their lost possessions for some time. Coins of Pulumayi II 
who reigned for at least 24 years have been found in the Godavari 
and Guntur districts and on the Coromandel coast as far south as 
Cuddalore. His preoccupations in the east gave the Sakas an 
opportunity to regain some of their lost territory in western 
Rajputana and Malwa (c. a.d. 126-31). In an effort to stay 
this reconquest Pulumayi’s successor, a Satakami, married the 
daughter of Mahakshatrapa Rudradaman. But this Saka king 
defeated the next Sata vahana ruler twice in ‘fair fight’ and 



92 A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 

took from him Aparanta (north Konkan) and Anupa (the Narmada 
valley). 

Perhaps the best known Satavahana ruler is Sri Yajna Satakarni 
(c. a.d. 170-99). He must have renewed the struggle with the 
Sakas and recovered some of the provinces lost by his predeces- 
sors. His rare silver coins imitating the satrap coinage must 
have been struck for circulation in the newly-conquered western 
districts. Some of the potin coins he issued have been found in 
the Chanda district (Bombay), while many of bronze and lead have 
come to light in the eastern provinces. Others, bearing the figure 
of a ship, should also be referred to his reign and indicate that his 
power was not confined to the land. Also belonging to his reign 
are inscriptions found at Kanheri and Nasik in the west and at 
Chinna Ganjam in the east. As far as we know, Sri Yajna was 
the last king to retain control of both the western and the eastern 
provinces. 

His successors were Vijaya, whose coins have been found in 
Akola in Bombay, Sri Chandra, one of whose inscriptions is in 
Kalinga and whose coins have been picked up in the Godavari and 
Krishna districts, and finally a Pulumayi one of whose inscriptions 
has been found in Bellary district. 

The names of other Satavahana kings — Kama, Kumbha and 
Rudra Satakarni who ruled over the eastern Deccan and Madhya 
Pradesh — are known from coins but are not included in the 
puranic list which was presumably compiled before their reigns 
began. Other princes of Satavahana extraction governed minor 
kingdoms in different parts of' the Deccan, but nothing is 
known of the causes that brought about the downfall of the 
main dynasty. 

Despite the vast extent of the Satavahana empire its polity 
was simple and local administration was left largely to feudatories 
subject to the general control of royal officials. Kingship was 
hereditary in the male line though matronymics were freely 
prefixed to the names of kings and nobles. The king was the 
guardian of the established social order and was expected to 
raise taxes justly and to further the prosperity of the poor 
equally with the rich. Feudatories were of three grades : Rajas 
who struck coins in their own names; Mahabhojas and Maharathis 
who were confined to a few families in the western Deccan — the 
latter being connected with the Satavahanas by marriage; and 



THE SATAVAHANAS AND THEIR SUCCESSORS 93 


relatively late in the history of the empire was created the office 
of mahasenapati which continued under later dynasties. Some 
mahasenapatis were in charge of outlying provinces while others 
controlled departments at the centre. The state was divided into 
dharas (administrative divisions) each under a minister (, amatya ). 
Below these came the villages, each with its own headman 
( gramika ). Other officials named in the inscriptions are treasurers 
and stewards, goldsmiths and coiners, administrators ( mahamdtras), 
record keepers, ushers, and ambassadors. 

In society new sub-castes were forming on an occupational 
basis, such as shepherds ( golikas ) and ploughmen (halikas). More 
interesting is the total assimilation of foreigners, Sakas and 
Yavanas, either as Buddhists or as degraded Kshatriyas, many 
of them bearing such thoroughly Indian names as Dharmadeva, 
Rishabhadatta and Agnivarman. The Saka Rishabhadatta, we 
read, made a pilgrimage to Pushkara on the river Barnasa and 
presented cows and villages to Brahmins; but we do not hear of 
foreigners following Hindu practices in the western Deccan 
after the second century a.d. Gautamiputra, who is said to have 
destroyed the Sakas, Yavanas and Pahlavas, was evidently 
thorough in his work. Though nothing is said of the Yavanas in 
the eastern Deccan, it is certain that Graeco-Roman influences had 
a great share in fashioning the stupas at Amaravati and other 
places in the Krishna valley, and Greek ( yonaka ) lamps are 
mentioned in an inscription from Alluru. 

That women were prominent in social life and held property 
in their own right is seen from records of their lavish charity 
mentioned in inscriptions. In sculptures we see them worship- 
ping Buddhist emblems, taking part in assemblies and entertaining 
guests alongside of their husbands. Men vied with women in the 
scantiness of their dress and in the profusion of their ornaments. 
Even the cottage had its share of such comparative luxuries as 
jugs, jars, chairs, tables, stools, beds and other household furnish- 
ings of attractive design. 

Cities were protected by high walls, ramparts and gates which 
were often built of brick and mortar, gateways being surmounted 
by toranas as at Sanchi. Armies were led into battle by foot- 
soldiers who carried short swords for offence, and protected 
themselves from the enemy’s weapons with circular shields and 
bandages wound round their stomachs. The infantry was flanked 



94 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


by the cavalry and elephants, with bowmen in the rear. Long 
spears, battle-axes and mallets were also used. Cavalrymen and 
elephant-drivers, but not the foot-soldiers, wore turbans. 

The western and eastern coasts were studded with ports 
throbbing with trade. Ptolemy names several in fi Maisolia the 
region between the deltas of the Godavari and Krishna, and 
states that one of them was the starting-point of ships bound 
for ‘Golden Chryse’ — the Malay peninsula and the eastern 
archipelago. In the western Deccan, Barygaza (Broach) was the 
most northern port, Sopara the most ancient, and Kalyan the 
largest. The market-towns of the interior, besides Paithan and 
Tagara, were Junnar, Karahataka, Nasik and Vaijayanti; those 
of the eastern Deccan were less important: Dhanyakataka, 
Vijayapura and Narasela. Each group of traders — corn-dealers, 
braziers, weavers, florists, ironmongers and scribes — was organ- 
ized into a guild. Each guild had an alderman ( sethi ) and its 
own office or guildhall (j nigamasabha ), and acted as a bank, receiv- 
ing deposits and lending out money. Imports included luxuries 
like wine, cloth of the finest texture, choice unguents, glass, storax 
and sweet clover. Exports were common cloth, cornelian, muslins 
and mallow cloth. The absence of roads hindered commerce 
as much as it was helped by the plentiful currency towards the 
end of the first century a.d. The eastern Deccan seems to have 
entered at this time upon a period of great industrial and com- 
mercial activity which reached its climax towards the end of the 
•second century. 

Buddhism was well established by the third century b.c. 
and continued to flourish throughout the Satavahana period; 
indeed, the first two centuries of the Christian era constitute 
the most glorious epoch of Buddhism in the Deccan. The 
stupa of Amaravatl was enlarged and embellished, and at 
Alluru, Gummadiduru, Ghantasala, Gudivada and Goli new 
stupas were built or old ones enlarged. New caves were cut and 
additional benefactions made at Nasik, Karle, and Kanheri. In 
the inscriptions of the time appear the names of a number of 
sects as well as of monks of various grades of learning and 
eminence engaged in enlightening the faithful in the Law of 
the Master. Stupas, the sacred tree, the footprints of the Master, 
the trisula emblem, the dharmachakra , relics and statues of the 
Buddha and other great teachers and of the Nagarajas were all 



THE SATAVAHANAS AND THEIR SUCCESSORS 95 

objects of worship. The sculptures of this time show men and 
women in states of ecstatic devotion rather than merely kneeling 
or perhaps prostrating themselves with joined hands before the 
objects of their devotion. 

Brahminism also flourished and most of the Satavahana 
rulers were devoted to it. The third king of the line performed 
a number of Vedic sacrifices and even named one of his sons 
VediSri. Hala’s Saptasatl opens with a passage in adoration 
of £iva. Gautamlputra Satakarni was a great supporter of the 
Brahmins and tried to emulate the epic heroes Rama, Kesava 
and Arjuna. The pantheon of Hinduism in this period included 
Indra, Vasudeva, the sun and the moon, Siva, Vishnu, Krishna, 
Ganesa and Pasupati. Temples to Gaurl are mentioned in the 
Saptasatl as also the vrata of fire and water. 

After its fall, the Satavahana empire was partitioned among 
the Abhlras in the north-west, the Chutus in the South and 
the Ikshvakus in Andhradesa. In Madhya Pradesh, descen- 
dants of the Satavahanas themselves continued to rule and the 
Pallavas rose to power in the south-east. Thus was broken the 
political unity of the Deccan which had lasted for about six 
centuries from the time of the Nandas. 

The Abhlras were certainly foreigners and are mentioned 
In the Mahabhashya. In the second century a.d., they figure 
as generals under the Saka satraps of western India. The 
Puranas state that ten Abhiras succeeded the Satavahanas and 
ruled for 67 years. An inscription from Nasik speaks of king 
Madhariputa Isvarasena, the Abhlra, and a son of Sivadatta. 
The record has much in common with Satavahana inscriptions, 
including the manner of its dating. Isvarasena was perhaps 
the founder of the dynasty about which nothing more is known 
than that in a.d. 249-50 it originated an era called Kalachuri 
or Chedi in later times. 

As little is known of the Chutus who ruled in Maharashtra 
and Kuntala. The names of certain kings of the line are 
known from coins found in the North Kanara and Chitaldrug 
districts of Mysore, and from inscriptions in Kanheri, Banavasi 
and Malavalli. Lead coins with the horse device and inscribed 
with the name Hariti (a part of the name of the Chutus) have 
come from the Anantapur and Cuddapah districts. Some his- 
torians consider the Chutus to be a branch of the Satavahanas, 



96 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


while others postulate a Naga origin for them. They were- 
supplanted by the Kadambas. 

The Ikshvakus ruled over the Krishna-Guntur region. The 
Puranas call them Srlparvatlyas — rulers of Srlparvata and 
Andhrabhrityas (‘Servants of the Andhras’). Though seven kings 
are said to have ruled for 57 years in all, only a few are known 
by name from inscriptions. Originally they were feudatories of 
the Satavahanas and bore the title mahatalavara . Vasithlputa 
Siri Chantamula, the founder of the line, performed the asvamedha 
and vajapeya sacrifices. The reign of his son Virapurisadata 
formed a glorious epoch in the history of Buddhism and in 
diplomatic relations. He took a queen from the Saka family of 
Ujjain and gave his daughter in marriage to a Chutu prince. 
Almost all the royal ladies were Buddhists: an aunt of Virapurisa- 
data built a big stupa at Nagarjunikonda for the relics of the great 
teacher, besides apsidal temples, viharas and mandapas. Her 
example was followed by other women of the royal family 
and by women generally as we know from a reference to one- 
Bodhisiri, a woman citizen. The last known member of the line 
is Ehuvula Chantamula, whose reign witnessed the completion 
of a devtvihara, a stupa and two apsidal temples. We hear also^ 
of a Sihala vihara , a convent founded either by a Sinhalese, or, 
more probably, for the accommodation of Sinhalese monks; and 
a Chaitya-ghara (Chaitya hall) was dedicated to the fraternities- 
( theriyas ) of Tambapanni (Ceylon). Ceylonese Buddhism was 
thus in close touch with that of the Andhra country. The sculp- 
tures of Nagarjunikonda, which include large figures of the 
Buddha, show decided traces of Greek influence and Mahayana 
tendencies, but do not depict the crowds of devotees that charac- 
terized the monuments of the preceding century. 

In administration and social life, the Satavahana tradition was 
continued, although signs of change are not wanting. The titles 
of officials, for example, continued to be the same as in the 
Satavahana period, but the duties of several were often combined 
in one individual; and while matronymics continued to be 
employed, patronymics are also mentioned. The slightly later 
Kadamba practice of bearing matronymics and the patronymic 
gotra is in the line of development from Satavahana to Pallava 
practice. Aharas came to be called rashtras , and the title Raja 
gave place to the more impressive Maharaja. 


THE SATAVAHANAS AND THEIR SUCCESSORS 97 


In the Andhra country the Ikshvakus were followed by kings 
of the Brihatphalayana gotra, only one of whom — Jayavarman 
— is known by name, from the solitary surviving copper-plate 
grant of the line. His kingdom was divided into aharas , each 
under an executive officer, \dpatam ( vyaprita ). This grant 
may be said to start the series of brahmadeyas , or gifts to 
Brahmins, which increase in number and importance through 
the centuries and confirm the decline of both Buddhism and 
Jainism. 

The Pallavas, in the south-east of the former Satavahana 
empire, made Kanchipuram their capital. A foreign, Pahlava, 
origin has often been postulated for them, and this seems to gain 
some support from the crown, recalling that of the Indo-Greek 
king Demetrius, in the shape of an elephant’s scalp, offered to 
Nandivarman II on the occasion of his being chosen for the 
throne; but on a broad view they appear — like the Kadambas 
and even the Chutus before them — to have been a dynasty of 
North Indian origin which moved to the South and there adapted 
local traditions to their own use. Thus Satakarni of the Chutu 
dynasty, ruler of Banavasi, worshipped at and endowed the shrine 
of the god of Malavalli, and the Kadamba king who succeeded 
him did likewise. A little later the Kadamba fine began to declare 
its devotion to the kadamba tree and to Svami Mahasena (i.e. 
Subrahmanya) whom Tamil tradition regarded as dwelling in the 
kadamba tree. In the same manner, Pallava, as the name of the 
dynasty of Kanchipuram, must be taken to be the Prakrit-Sanskrit 
rendering of tondai, the name of the land and its rulers as well as 
of a creeper. 

Pallava history opens with three copper-plate grants, all in 
Prakrit and all dating from the time of Skandavarman, the 
earliest when he was yuvaraja, the others after he had become 
king. He belonged to the Bharadvaja gotra , performed the 
agnishtoma , vajapeya and asvamedha sacrifices and bore the title 
4 Supreme King of Kings devoted to dharma \ In his time 
Kanchipuram was the capital and his kingdom extended up to 
the Krishna in the north and the Arabian Sea in the west. The 
steps by which this empire was built up cannot now be traced. 
A ninth-century tradition affirms that Virakurcha, an early Pallava 
king of great fame, seized the insignia of royalty together with 
the daughter of the Naga king. This may be an echo of the 
7 



98 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Pallava conquest qf the Chutus who, as we have seen, ruled 
the west for a time after the dissolution of the Satavahana 
empire. We do not know the name of Skandavarman’s father, 
but obviously Skandavarman was not the first Pallava ruler of 
KanchL The title yuvaraja makes that clear enough; but at 
present we have no certain knowledge of his predecessors, al- 
though among them was, perhaps, Simhavarman, a king men- 
tioned in a Prakrit stone inscription recently discovered in the 
Guntur district. His successors were a son, Buddhavarman, 
who was yuvaraja and his son Buddhyankura by his queen Charu- 
devl. All the three charters of Skandavarman’s time may be 
taken to belong to the latter part of the third century a.d. In 
this period other princes of the royal family besides the yuva- 
raja took an active part in the administration, in which many 
officials with specific duties in different territorial divisions or 
state departments were employed. The designations of these 
officials, and other administrative details, can all be gathered 
from inscriptions. 

The Pallavas were followers of the Brahminical religion and 
made gifts of land to gods and Brahmins in the belief that they 
would thereby secure health, prosperity and victory in war. 

The total darkness that follows the records of Skandavarman’s 
time is broken only by a streak of light in the account of Samudra- 
gupta’s invasion of the South, given in his Allahabad pillar 
inscription of about the middle of the fourth century a.d. From 
this it is evident that he did battle with his opponent Vishnugopa, 
the ruler of Kanchi, somewhere north of this city and never, in 
fact, reached the Pallava capital. Another of his opponents, 
Ugrasena of Palakka ruling somewhere in the Nellore district, 
was probably a feudatory of Vishnugopa. 

The next stage in the annals of Pallava rule is represented 
by ten copper-plate charters and a fragment of another charter, 
all of them in Sanskrit; some of them, however, are suspect. They 
are all dated in the regnal years of the kings. For absolute 
chronology, therefore, we depend on a Saka date in the Jain 
manuscript Lokavibhaga . This work on cosmology was finished 
on the equivalent of the 25th of August 458 in the twenty-second 
year of Simhavarman’s reign. This date receives confirmation 
from the Ganga charters and enables us to construct the following 
genealogical table for the Pallavas.

The charters on which this table is based only record grants, so 
that the political history of the Pallavas from 325-500 is almost a 
blank. All we can deduce, therefore, is that Vishnugopa, the 
opponent of Samudragupta, was a contemporary and perhaps 
brother of Kumaravishnu I, while Yuvamaharaja Vishnugopa- 
varman I probably did not live to reign as king, and Simhavarman II 
must have had a very prosperous reign as he is known to have 
issued a large number of grants; but what happened after his death 
is by no means clear. Simhavarman, the father of Simhavishnu, 
who started the best-known line of Pallava rulers towards the end 
of the sixth century a.d., finds no place in this genealogy and thus 
leaves another gap in the line of succession which cannot 
be bridged. 

We can say, however, that the Pallava administrative system 
made a further advance at this time. The king adopted the addi- 
tional title of bhattaraka , the heir-apparent had a recognized 
position, as yuvamaharaja , and the other princes continued to be 
employed on state affairs. Different classes of district officers are 
listed, though the exact nature of their functions is not known. 
There is evidence of strong military and police organizations and 
labour may have been conscripted by force. The manufacture of 
salt, and sometimes of sugar, was a royal monopoly, and villages 
were expected to maintain the king’s officers free of charge when 
they were on tour. On the other hand, exemption of taxation 
was allowed on ail gifts of land to Brahmins who were held, in 
theory at any rate, to be entitled to a total of eighteen such

immunities. This is a continuation and development of Sata- 
vahana practice for the Pallava kings also followed the Brahminicai 
religion, worshipped Siva and Vishnu and performed sacrifices. 

The obscure but extensive political revolution in which the: 
Kalabhras overthrew all the established dynasties of Southern 
India affected the Pallava kingdom also. The next stage of Pallava 
history therefore opens with the subjugation of the Kalabhras by 
Simhavishnu at the close of the sixth century. 

At this point, however, we shall go back to the Andhra country.. 
Another opponent of Samudragupta was Hastivarman (c. 350),. 
ruler of Vengi which may be identified with Peddavegi, near Ellore„ 
in the Krishna district. Hastivarman’s family, known to historians- 
as the Salankayanas from the gotra to which it belonged, must have 
risen to power at the expense of the Brihatphalayanas and possibly 
also of the Pallavas. The earliest known member of the dynasty 
is Devavarman whose father was evidently an independent king, 
as he was given the title bhattaraka . Devavarman certainly ruled 
before Hastivarman, but the relationship between the two princes- 
is not known. His only extant inscription is dated by the monttL 
and tithi (lunar day), a practice followed by later dynasties but 
different from the older Satavahana method of mentioning the 
particular fortnight of one of the three seasons into which the year 
was divided. 

Hastivarman was not much affected when Samudragupta in- 
vaded his territory. At the time the eastern Deccan was cut up* 
into a number of minor kingdoms, among them Kosala, com- 
prising the modem districts of Bilaspur, Raipur, Sambalpur and 
part of Ganjam; Kurala, the region around lake Colair; two small 
kingdoms in the Ganjam district with capitals at Kotttira and 
Erandapalla; two more in the Godavari district with Pishtapura 
and Avamukta as capitals; Devarashtra (i.e. Elamanchili) in the 
Visakhapatnam district, and kingdoms with Palakka and Kusthala- 
pura as capitals. We have little definite knowledge of the political 
position of these Southern states or of their relations with 
one another. 

Hastivarman was succeeded by his son Nandivarman I (c. 375)^ 
His kingdom included the vishaya of Kudrahara on both sides 
of the Krishna river. The part that lay to the south was 
subsequently conquered by the Pallavas who named it Vengi- 
xashtra. Nandivarman I was followed on the throne by his son 


THE SATAVAHANAS AND THEIR SUCCESSORS 101 


Hastivarman II; then came Skandavarman son of Hastivarman II; 
Skanda was followed by Chandavarman, the second son of Nandi- 
varman I, and the latter by his son Nandivarman II ( c . 430), the 
last known king of the line. 

Like the Pallavas the Salankayanas had the bull crest, but there 
is little else to show definitely that the two dynasties were closely 
Telated or that on that account the Salankayanas were left un- 
molested by their more powerful neighbours in the South. The 
Salankayana administrative system had much in common with 
that of the contemporary Pallavas. The village headman was 
called mutuda, or alderman, a title that does not occur elsewhere. 
The tutelary deity of the dynasty was the sun god and they wor- 
shipped Siva or Vishnu in addition. Their charters bear a close 
resemblance in their script to the earliest inscriptions of the Hindu 
colonies of Indo-China and Malaysia, and there is good reason to 
hold that the Telugu country took a prominent part in the move- 
ment of coloni 2 ation abroad. 

In Kalinga the period following Samudragupta’s invasion is 
taken up by the rule of a line of kings who belonged to the 
Mathara kula. Seven kings bearing names ending with varman 
are known, from their copper-plate grants, although their genea- 
logy is not forthcoming. Pishtapura, Simhapura, and Vardha- 
manapura are among the places from which grants were issued. 
Though some of the kings used matronymics and adopted the 
antique Satavahana mode of dating their records, in other respects 
they clearly mark a transition to the records of a later time. The 
language of the inscriptions is Sanskrit and the kings called them- 
selves Kalingadhipatis and Paramamahesvaras. Roughly, the 
period of their rule extended from 375 to 500 when they were suc- 
ceeded by the Gangas in north Kalinga, south Kalinga becoming 
part of Vengi. 

In Vengi the Salankayanas were followed by the Vishnukundins 
who had 6riparvatasvami (‘Lord of &riparvata ’) for their family 
deity. The genealogy of this line has been the subject of much 
difference of opinion but without entering into details the best 
view of the whole matter may be presented as follows:

Madhavavarman I is reputed to have performed eleven aha- 
medhas and countless agnishtomas , but we need not take this 
literally for the same is also said of Madhavavarman II (556-616). 
Madhavavarman Fs queen must have been a Vakataka princess 
for we read that his son Vikramendra I belonged to the families 
of Vishnukundi and Vakataka. Indra-bhattaraka was victor in. 
many fights, on one occasion overwhelming a kinsman — probably 
Madhavavarman of the collateral line, lord of Trikuta. He also 
came into conflict with the eastern Ganga Indravarman and en- 
larged his kingdom at his expense. Govindavarman had the title 
Vikramasraya (‘ Refuge of Valour ’), and his son Madhavavarman II 
was probably the greatest monarch of his line and became the 
centre of many popular legends in later times. He had the title 
Janasraya (‘Refuge of the People ’) and performed a hir any agar bha. 
Hostilities with the Gangas seem to have continued throughout 
his reign and he is said to have crossed the Godavari to conquer 
the eastern region. The Vishnukundins were still ruling the Vengi 
country and its neighbourhood at the time of the invasion of the 
eastern Deccan, at the beginning of the seventh century, by the 
Chalukya ruler of Badami, Pulakesin II. 

Between the kingdom of the Vishnukundins in the north and 
1 that of the Pallavas in the south there rose, early in the sixth cen- 
tury, a small kingdom ruled by kings of the Ananda gotra. The 
first of the line was Kandara who gave his daughter in marriage 
to a Pallava prince and who, after sharp battles with the Vishnu- 
kundins on the banks of the Krishna, wrested from them the title 
* Lord of Trikutaparvata \ His kingdom was nevertheless small. 


Devavarman

(48 years)

probably comprising no more than the modem taluks of Guntur 
and Tenali. Other kings of the line were Damodaravarman, whose 
father performed many sacrifices, Attivarman and Kandara’s grand- 
son whose name is not known but who has left at Chezarla a stone 
inscription which may be assigned to the last quarter of the sixth 
century. The capital of the kingdom, Kandarapura, is mentioned 
in inscriptions and must have been founded by king Kandara. 
The kings of this house were generally Saivites, though Damodara- 
varman was a Buddhist; and whatever their own predilections may 
have been they patronized all sects impartially. 

The Vakatakas of Madhya Pradesh held an important place in 
the politics and culture of the land in the fourth and fifth centuries 
a.d. They had notable diplomatic and matrimonial relationships with 
all the great contemporary royal families like the imperial Guptas, 
the Vishnukundins and the Kadambas. They made substantial addi- 
tions to the famous gallery of cave temples and paintings at Ajanta. 

The name of the Vakatakas has been connected by some his- 
torians with the little village of Bagat in Bundelkhand, while others 
are inclined to treat it as of Andhra origin. They rose to power 
at a time when the last of the Satavahanas had ceased to rule in 
Madhya Pradesh and the £aka satraps had exhausted themselves 
by their long struggles with the Satavahanas. The Puranas men- 
tion Vindhyasakti as their founder and Purika in * Berar ’ as their 
early capital, and also testify to the expansion of their power north 
of the Vindhyas as far as Vidisa. This rise of the Vakatakas may 
be placed in the last quarter of the third century a.d. 

The son and successor of Vindhyasakti was Pravarasena I 
(c. 280-340) who made extensive conquests in all directions and 
was the only king of the dynasty to bear the title samrat (emperor). 
He had four sons whom he set over the newly-conquered pro- 
vinces. The eldest, Gautamlputra, died before his father. Another, 
Sarvasena, ruled over southern Berar and the north-western part 
of ‘ Hyderabad \ In the west the absence of the title of Maha- 
kshatrapa among the Saka rulers between 304 and 345, and the total 
cessation of coinage between 332 and 348, suggest the extension 
of Vakataka power over the £aka dominions. Pravarasena I 
celebrated his victories by performing several sacrifices — four asva- 
medhas and a vdjapeya. When Rudrasena I (340-65), son of 
Gautamlputra, succeeded his grandfather, his uncles, who were 
viceroys, proclaimed their independence. He overcame two of 



104 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


them with the help of his maternal grandfather Bhavanaga of the 
Bharasiva family ruling in Padmavati in central India, but the 
house of Sarvasena continued its independent rule. 

Rudrasena was more fortunate in his relations with the Guptas 
and the conquests of Samudragupta did not affect him. The 
Sakas succeeded in improving their position and reviving the title 
of Mahaksbatrapa from 346. Rudrasena’s son, Prithvishena I 
(365-90), assisted the house of Sarvasena in its conquest of a part 
of Kuntala or southern Maharashtra. A greater event of his reign 
was the marriage of his son Rudrasena II with Prabhavati-gupta, 
daughter of Chandragupta II. The alliance was probably meant 
to strengthen the position of the Guptas in the execution of their 
plans against the Sakas; but Rudrasena II died prematurely after 
a reign of five years leaving two minor sons. The widowed Gupta 
princess became regent, and uncles of the collateral branch ruling 
at Basim did not venture to oppose the arrangement. It was 
during her regency that Gujarat and Kathiawar were conquered by 
Chandragupta II, Prabhavati-gupta offering considerable help to 
her father. After she had been regent for 13 years, her elder son 
Divakarasena died and she held the regency on behalf of the 
younger son Damodarasena (later Pravarasena II) till 410. 
Pravarasena II (410-45) was a man of peace, more devoted to 
literature and the arts than to war. A worshipper of Vishnu, he 
composed the Prakrit poem Setubandha , said to have been revised 
by Kalidasa, describing the most famous exploits of Rama. He 
also founded a new capital at Pravarapura to which he mcved in 
the second half of his reign. The crown prince, Narendrasena, 
married a Kadamba princess — the daughter of Kakusthavarman. 

Narendrasena (445-65) was beset by difficulties at the beginning 
of his reign. The Nala king Bhavadattavarman ruling in 4 Bastar 
state ’ invaded the Vakataka kingdom and for a time his victory 
seemed to be complete. Narendrasena, however, soon recovered 
his strength and turned the tables on the enemy, even though his 
grand-uncle Kumaragupta was in no position to help him on 
account of the danger to his own empire from the HQnas. Malwa 
Mekala and Kosala also passed under the rule of Narendrasena* 
for a time. His son, Prithvishena II, the last known king of the 
main line, had to retrieve the fortunes of his family twic e. His 
opponents were very probably the Nalas, and possibly, the Trai- 
kutakas of southern Gujarat. 


THE SATAVAHANAS AND THEIR SUCCESSORS 105 


The history of the collateral Basim branch may now be briefly 
noticed. Sarvasena was succeeded by his son Vindhyasena or 
Vindhyasakti who conquered southern Maharashtra with the aid 
of Prithvishena I of the main line. His son was Pravarasena II 
who, after a reign of fifteen years, left on the throne a minor son 
of eight who had a long and peaceful reign. His son Devasena 
( c . 460-80) was a pleasure-seeker who left the government of the 
state to a minister named Hastibhoja, and was succeeded by his 
son Harishena ( c . 480-515). He was the most powerful ruler of 
the line and succeeded Prithvishena II in the main kingdom as 
well. His Ajanta record shows that he extended his rule over 
Gujarat, Malwa, southern Kosala and the Kuntala provinces, thus 
extending the boundaries of the empire wider even than under 
Pravarasena I. The fall of the Vakatakas occurred between 515 
and 550, during which period Chhattisgarh was lost to the Soma- 
vamsis, southern Maharashtra to the Kadambas, northern Maha- 
rashtra to the Kalachuris, and Malwa and the northern part of 
Madhya Pradesh to Yasodharman. Finally the Chalukyas of 
Badami completed their overthrow (c. 550). 

From the middle of the fourth century, the Kadambas rose to 
power in the south-west Deccan as a result of the Pallavas’ 
weakened position after Samudragupta’s invasion of the South. 
The earliest Kadamba inscription is in the Prakrit language and 
is found engraved on a pillar below a shorter record of the Chutus. 
The Kadambas were a Brahmin family which derived its descent 
from Hariti and belonged to the Manavya gotra. They were de- 
voted to the study of the Vedas and the performance of Vedic 
sacrifices. The Kadamba king Mayurasarman entered the ghatikd 
(college) at Kanchipuram with the intention of studying the entire 
Veda; but a fierce quarrel with a mounted Pallava guard encouraged 
him to forsake the scholar’s cell for the battlefield. He overpower- 
ed the Pallava frontier-officials and entrenched himself in the dense 
forests round about Srlparvata after levying tribute from the 
Brihadbanas and other subordinates of the Pallavas. He con- 
tinually harassed the Pallava forces sent against him and peace 
only came when they recognized his sovereignty over all land 
between ‘ the western sea and Prehara * (by which, perhaps is 
meant the Tungabhadra or Malaprabha). A short stone inscrip- 
tion in Prakrit from Chandravalli mentions in relation to 
Mayurasarman a tank, and the names of Abhlra, Sakasthana, 



106 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Sayindaka, Punnata and Mokari, among others; the import of 
the record is by no means clear. 

The genealogy of the Kadambas of this period with an approxi- 
mate indication of chronology is given below:

Kangavarman (360-85) 

I 

Bhagiratha (385-410) 


Raghu (410-25) Kakusthavarman (425-50)

(500-38) | 

| Krishnavarman II (550-65) 

Harivarman | 

(538-50) Ajavarman 

Later legend credited Mayuravarman, as he then came to be- 
called, with the performance of eighteen horse-sacrifices and the 
distribution of many villages among Brahmins, but the early in- 
scriptions of the dynasty say nothing about this. Vakataka Vindhya- 
sena of the Basim branch is said to have conquered Kuntala^ 
and his invasion was resisted with a fair measure of success by 
Kangavarman. VaijayantI (Banavasi) was the capital of the 
Kadambas, and Palasika (Halsi) a secondary capital. Kakustha- 
varman was one of the great rulers of the line. He had a 
prosperous reign and his daughters married into many important 
royal families, including the Guptas. His son Santivarman was^ 
a ruler of great fame and much personal charm. He is said to 
have worn three crowns and 4 attracted to himself the prosperity 
of his enemies During his reign danger threatened from the 
Pallavas; and the situation was met by transferring control in the 
southern districts to his younger brother, Krishnavarman. This- 
amounted to a virtual division of the kingdom, as is seen from 


THE SATAVAHANAS AND THEIR SUCCESSORS 107 


the latter’s performance of a horse-sacrifice — never undertaken by 
a subordinate ruler. The war with the Pallavas cost Krishna- 
varman his life, besides ruining the principality of the Kekayas^ 
the homeland of his queen. His son Vishnuvarman had to accept 
investiture from the Pallavas. The Pallava rulers concerned were 
Nanakkasa and £antivara, names otherwise unknown. Mrigesa- 
varman, the son and successor of Santivarman, fought successful 
wars against the Gangas and Pallavas. Besides being an expert 
rider of horses and elephants, he was a scholar who built and 
endowed liberally a Jain temple in Palasika to the memory of 
his father. 

Ravivarman killed Vishnuvarman and other kings in battle, and 
occupied Palasika after driving out Chandadanda, ‘ Lord of 
Kanchl a title which here seems to mean only 4 a Pallava ’ and 
not necessarily ‘ ruler of Kanchi Most probably Chandadanda 
belonged to the same branch of the Pallavas as Santivara who 
anointed Vishnuvarman. The successes of Ravivarman restored 
the original unity and extent of the Kadamba kingdom. 

His successor was Hari varman (538-50). He was a man of 
peace in whose reign the Kadambas lost the northern half of their 
empire, and Pulakesin I established the Chalukya power in 545 by 
erecting a strong hill fortress in Badami. The Kadambas were by 
no means a strong or united power, and the feud between the elder 
and the younger branches was revived by Krishnavarman II who 
actually undertook an expedition against VaijayantI which put an 
end to the reign of Harivarman, the last known ruler of the elder 
branch. Either Krishnavarman II himself or his son Ajavarman 
must have been ruling Banavasi at the time of its conquest by the 
Chalukya Klrtivarman, son of Pulakesin I. 

In between the territory of the Kadambas in the west and the 
Pallavas in the east lay the kingdom of the Gangas in the southern 
part of the modern Mysore territory which came to be known as 
Gangavadi by its long association with Ganga rule. Early Ganga 
history has been much obscured by legend and by an unusually 
large number of spurious copper-plate grants. According to the 
authentic contemporary inscriptions, the first ruler, Konganivarma* 
belonged to the Jahnaveya kula , the family of the Gangas, and the 
Kanvayana gotra. He distinguished himself in many battles and 
carved out a prosperous kingdom for himself. His title 4 Dharma 
Mahadhiraja ’ implies independent status in the beginning, but the 



108 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Gangas soon lost their position and throughout their long history 
were compelled to acknowledge the suzerainty of one or other of 
the greater dynasties of South India. Konganivarma may be 
placed about 400. The name of his capital is not given in the in- 
scriptions, though later tradition first locates it at Kuvalala, modern 
Kolar, and afterwards at Talakad, nearer the hostile frontier of 
the Kajdambas against whom, in company with the Pallavas, he 
waged war at this date. 

Konganivarma’s son and successor was Mahadhiraja Madhava I 
{c. 425). He was a clever politician to whom later tradition 
attributes the authorship of a commentary on the Dattakasutra , 
a treatise on erotics. The next ruler was his son Ayyavarman 
{c. 450), a great warrior who was also proficient in the sastras , 
itihdsas and Puranas. He was anointed by the Pallava Simha- 
varman I of Kanchi, possibly because he sought support from 
the Pallava ruler in a dispute for the throne with his younger 
brother, Krishnavarman. He is called Harivarman in later in- 
scriptions which credit him with the removal of the capital to 
Talakad. The disputed succession was evidently settled by a 
virtual division of the kingdom between the two brothers, both 
of whom named their sons Simhavarman in recognition of their 
political relation to the Pallava ruler. This division seems to 
have continued under their sons and successors Madhava II, alias 
Simhavarman, and another Simhavarman. The former was 
anointed by Pallava Skandavarman and married a sister of 
Kadamba Krishnavarman I. According to later grants, Avinlta, 
the child of this union, was anointed successor to the throne while 
still a baby (c. 500). The genealogy of the Gangas may then be 
represented as follows: 


Konganivarman (400) 
Madhava I (425) 


Ayyavarman (450) 


Krishnavarman (450)

The social, administrative and religious conditions that prevailed 
in the Kadamba and Ganga kingdoms were very much the same 
as those in the contemporary Pallava kingdom.

CHAPTER YII 

THE AGE OF THE SANGAM AND AFTER 


Kalinga and the Tamil states — Sangam literature — its age — The Cheras — 
Ay and Pari — Adigaiman Anji — The Cholas, Karikala — Uandiraiyan — The 
Pandyas — Nedunjeliyan of Talaiyalanganam — his ancestors — civil war in the 
Chola kingdom — end of the Sangam age, political changes. 

Social life — composite culture — land — people — monarchy — sabha and 
manram — revenue — army — war — royal patronage of arts and letters — poetry, 
music and dance — pastimes — houses — popular beliefs and customs — trade, 
foreign, and internal — religion and ethics — dark age after the Sangam, 
Kalabhras. 

The inscription of Kharavela briefly mentioned in an earlier 
chapter contains the only early epigraphic reference to the king- 
doms of the Tamil country after the Asoka inscriptions. Kharavela 
ruled in Kalinga in the first half of the second century b.c., and 
in the eleventh year of his reign ( c . 165 b.c.) is said to have destroyed 
a confederacy of Tamil states — Tramiradesasanghatam — which was 
113 years old at the time, and had long been a source of danger. 
The same inscription records that Kharavela caused ‘ numerous 
pearls in hundreds’ to be brought from the Pandya to Kalinga, 
and perhaps also horses, elephants, jewels and rubies. In itself a 
difficult document, the gaps in the inscription and its extremely 
worn-out condition render its meaning very uncertain. Of the 
Tamil confederacy and its aims, of how it became a danger to 
Kalinga, and of the measures taken by Kharavela to avert the 
danger and the new relations he established with the Pandyan 
kings we hear nothing more from any other source. 

The first well-lighted epoch in the history of the Tamil land is 
that reflected in the literature of Sangam (i.e. the first three or 
four centuries a.d.) — the earliest stratum of Tamil literature now 
available. This is found grouped in eight more or less schematic 
anthologies, viz., (1) Narrinai , (2) Kurundogai , (3) Aingurunuru, 
(4) Padirruppat tu, (5) Paripadal , (6) Kalittogai , (7) Ahandnuru and 
(8) Purandnuru ; a ninth group Pattuppdttu (‘ Ten Idylls ’) completes 
the tale. The entire collection includes 2,279 poems of lengths 
varying from four or five lines to over eight hundred, by 473 poets 
(including some women) besides 102 anonymous pieces. At the 
end of each poem are notes giving the name of its author, the

-occasion of its composition and other details. These notes, prob- 
ably the work of the editors, must be taken generally to represent 
a correct tradition though there are difficulties about doing so. 

The Tolkappiyam , a comprehensive work on Tamil grammar, is 
also of the same age. 

Doubtless what has survived is only a part of the much vaster 
literature of these remote times. An inscription of the early tenth 
century a.d. mentions among the achievements of the early Pandyas 
the translation of the Mahabharata into Tamil and the establish- 
ment of a Sangam at Madura. This translation has been lost, 
though poems composed by 4 Perundevanar who sang the Bhdratam > 
form the invocations placed at the beginning of six out of the 
eight anthologies named above. Parts of a Tamil Bharatam by 
a Perundevanar have come down to us, but the author was a con- 
temporary of Nandivarman III Pallava (ninth century a.d.) and 
probably different from his namesake of the Sangam anthologies. 

That a college (Sangam) of Tamil poets flourished for a time 
under royal patronage in Madura may well be a fact. But the 
earliest account of it, which occurs in the introduction to the com- 
mentary on the Iraiyanar Agopporul (c. a.d. 750), is enveloped 
in legend. It refers to three Sangams which lasted, at long 
intervals, for 9,990 years all together and counted 8,598 poets 
(including a few gods of the Saiva persuasion) as members, and 
197 Pandyan kings as patrons. Some of the names of the kings 
and poets — such as Kadungon and Ugrapperuvaludi — are found 
in inscriptions and other authentic records, showing that some 
facts have got mixed up with much fiction, so that no conclusions 
of value can be based on it. 

A careful study of the synchronisms between the kings, chief- 
tains and poets suggested by the notes at the end of the poems 
indicates that this body of literature reflects occurrences within 
a period of four or five continuous generations at the most, say a 
period of 120 or 150 years. It is only for the Chera line of rulers 
that we can construct anything like a continuous genealogy, and 
this shows the existence of two lines of rulers, either connected by 
marriage or otherwise, each extending over three or four genera- 
tions at the most. In all other instances we only have unrelated 
names which render a regular history of the period impossible. 
We must therefore rest content with the outstanding figures and 
their achievements reported by the poets. 



112 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


The land was divided among the three ‘ crowned kings ’ of the 
Chera, Chola and Pandya lines, and a number of minor chieftains 
who according to the political conditions of the time either owned 
allegiance to or fought for one or other of these monarchs, or else 
led an independent existence. Seven of these chieftains gained 
particular recognition from the poets for their liberal patronage of 
literature and the arts and were described as vallals (patrons). 

We have seen that the language of the short Brahmi inscriptions 
of the third century b.c. was Tamil, still in its formative stages, 
with an admixture of words of clearly Sanskritic origin. In the 
poems of the Sangam anthologies, the Tamil language has reached 
maturity and begun to serve as a powerful and elegant medium of 
literary expression, and has already received and assimilated many 
words and ideas from Sanskrit sources. It also reflects the existence 
of a fairly elaborate code of conventions governing the portrayal 
of social life in literature. This must clearly have been the result 
of a long course of development spread over some generations. 

Another indication of the date of this literature is furnished 
by the synchronism of Gajabahu I of Ceylon with £enguttuvan, 
one of the Chera monarchs celebrated in the Padirruppattu , the 
anthology exclusively devoted to the Cheras. The date of Gaja- 
bahu’s reign has been fixed at about 173-95, and this may well 
be the period when Senguttuvan flourished. On this basis, the 
Sangam age may be taken to have extended from say a.d. 100 
to 250. 

But this synchronism is found not in any of the Sangam antho- 
logies, but in the Silappadikaram which presents with great literary 
charm the popular legend of Kovalan and Kannagi, and relates 
the institution of the Kannagi cult in South India and Ceylon. 
In its present form this work cannot be placed earlier than the 
fifth century; but considering the quasi- religious nature of the 
story and the institution of the cult, it is not unlikely that the legend 
preserved the memory of a historically correct synchronism. 

The third and strongest line of argument in support of this 
suggested chronology for the Sangam is to be found in the striking 
correspondence between the evidence of the poems on the trade 
and other relations of the Tamil states with the Yavanas (Greeks 
and Romans) in this period and that of the classical writers on 
the same subject, particularly Strabo, the anonymous author of 
the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, Pliny, and Ptolemy. The 



THE AGE OF THE SANGAM AND AFTER 


113 


details are set forth later in the chapter, and they show beyond a 
shadow of doubt that this stratum of Tamil literature must have 
belonged to the age of the classical writers mentioned above. 

Archaeology confirms the evidence of literature. The numerous 
discoveries throughout South India of gold and silver coins of 
the Roman emperors of the first two centuries a.d. and the 
evidence recently unearthed of the presence of § ‘ Roman factory ’ 
in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry in the first century go far to 
confirm the correctness of the date suggested for the Sangam age. 

We may now set forth the salient facts of the politics of the 
period before proceeding to give an account of its social life. The 
monarchies of the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas were believed, at 
least in subsequent ages, to be of immemorial antiquity; and the 
poems of the Sangam attest the anxiety of all of them to connect 
themselves with the events of the Great War between the Kauravas 
and the Pandavas. The first Chera monarch we hear of, Udiyan- 
jeral ( c . a.d. 130) is said to have fed sumptuously both the armies 
of Kurukshetra, and thereby earned for himself the title 6 Udiyan- 
jeral of the great feeding \ Perhaps it is best to look upon this 
as a conventional attribution to him of an achievement of some 
remote ancestor. The same honour is also claimed in other poems 
for the Pandyas and Cholas. 

The son of Udiyanjeral was Nedunjeral Adan who won a naval 
victory against some local enemy on the Malabar coast, and took 
captive several Yavana traders whom for some time he subjected 
to harsh treatment, for reasons that are not clear, but subsequently 
released after obtaining a heavy ransom. He is said to have 
fought many wars and spent many years in camp with his armies. 
He won victories against seven crowned kings, and thus reached 
the superior rank of an adhiraja. He was called Imayavaramban 
— * He who had the Himalaya for his boundary ’ — a title explained 
by the claim that he conquered all India and carved the Chera 
emblem of the bow on the face of the great mountain — an instance 
of poetic exaggeration not uncommon in these poems. His capital 
is called Marandai. He fought a war with the contemporary 
Chola king in which both the monarchs lost their lives and their 
queens performed satl . 

Adan’s younger brother was * Kuttuvan of many elephants * 
who conquered Kongu and apparently extended the Chera power 
from the western to the eastern sea for a time. Adan had two 
8 



114 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


sons by different queens. One of them was known as 4 the Chera 
with the kalangay festoon and the fibre crown ’ ; the crown he wore 
at his coronation is said to have been made of palmyra fibre and 
the festoon on it contained kalangay , a small black berry. It was 
not altogether to be despised for the crown had a golden frame 
and festoons of precious pearls; but why the king had to wear such 
an extraordinary tiara is not explained anywhere. He is said to 
have won successes against the contemporary Adigaiman chieftain 
Anji of Tagadur and to have led an expedition against Nannan 
whose territory lay to the north of Malabar, in the Tulu country. 
He too was an adhiraja wearing a garland of seven crowns. 

The other son of Adan was Senguttuvan, 4 the Righteous 
Kuttuva ’ (c. 180), celebrated in song by Paranar, one of the most 
famous and longest-lived of the poets of the Sangam age. Sen- 
guttuvan’s life and achievements have been embellished by legends 
of a later time of which there are no traces in the two strictly con- 
temporary poems, both by Paranar — the decad on the king in the 
4 Ten Tens and a song in the Purananuru. The only martial 
achievement they celebrate is a victorious war against the chieftain 
of Mohur. Paranar also says that Senguttuvan exerted himself 
greatly on the sea, but gives no details. He was given a title for 
driving back the sea, and this is taken to mean that he destroyed 
the efficiency of the sea as a protection to his enemies who relied 
on it. If this is correct he must have maintained a fleet. For 
the rest, we only learn that he was a skilled rider on horse and 
elephant, wore a garland of seven crowns as adhiraja, and was 
adept in besieging fortresses, besides being a great warrior and a 
liberal patron of the arts. 

The epilogue to the decad adds a number of new particulars, 
the most important bearing on the establishment of the Pattini 
cult, i.e., the worship of Kannagi as the ideal wife. Others refer 
to an attack on Viyalur in Nannan’s country (perhaps to suppress 
a rebellion), the overthrow of the fortress of Kodukur in the 
Kongu country, and intervention in a Chola war of succession 
resulting in that throne being secured to one prince at the cost 
of the lives of nine others. The stone for making the image of 
Pattini, the Divine Chaste Wife, was obtained after a fight with 
an Aryan chieftain and bathed in the Ganges before being brought 
to the Chera country. All these events are narrated with numerous 
■embellishments and in epic detail in the Silappadikararn , though 


THE AGE OF THE &ANGAM AND AFTER 


115 


whether this poem derives from the epilogue to the decad, or the 
epilogue from the epic, is more than we can say. The antiquity 
and popularity of the story of Kannagi and Kovalan and the prob- 
able existence of other and earlier versions of the Kannagi saga 
which preceded the Silappadikdram are fairly well attested, and it 
is not unlikely that Senguttuvan took the lead in organizing the 
cult of Pattini, and was supported in his effort by the contemporary 
rulers of the Pandya and Chola countries and of Ceylon as the 
Silappadikdram says. 

All together five monarchs of the line of Udiyanjeral belonging 
to three generations are mentioned in the Padirruppattu . The 
number of years they are said to have ruled totals 201, while an- 
other three monarchs of the collateral line are said to have reigned 
for a further 58 years in all. Their reigns surely cannot have been 
successive, and we must therefore postulate a very considerable 
degree of overlapping. The Chera kingdom must have been a 
sort of family estate in which all the grown-up males had a share 
and interest — what Kautilya calls a kula-sangha, a family group, 
and considers a very efficient form of state organization. A similar 
clan-rule might also have prevailed in the Chola and Pandya king- 
doms in this period. Such an assumption for the Cholas would 
be the best means of explaining Senguttuvan’s interference in a 
war of succession in which nine Chola princes lost their lives; it 
would also furnish a natural explanation for the occurrence in the 
Sangam poems of so many royal names, all to be accommodated 
within four or five generations. 

The heroes of the last three decads of the ‘ Ten Tens ’ and their 
ancestors must be taken to have ruled contemporaneously with 
the kings of the house of Udiyanjeral. The first to be heard of 
among them are Anduvan and his son Selvakkadungo Vali Adan, 
both praised by the poets in general terms for their valour and 
liberality; the father is said to have been a well-read scholar and 
the son performed many Vedic sacrifices. Famous among the 
minor chieftains who were their contemporaries were Ay and 
Pari, both celebrated in several poems by a number of poets. Ay 
was the patron of a brahmin poet from Uraiyur, and Pari 
befriended and patronized another brahmin, Kapilar, who re- 
paired to the Chera court only after Pari’s death. There he was 
welcomed by Anduvan’s son whom he praised in the seventh decad 
of the ‘ Ten Tens \ 



116 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Ay was one of the many vel chieftains ruling in several parts 
of the Tamil country. The vels claimed to have issued from the 
sacrificial fire-pit of a northern sage and cherished other legends 
of their connexion with Vishnu and Agastya, and of one of their 
ancestors having shot down a tiger which was about to attack a 
sage in the midst of his penance — legends very similar to those of 
the Hoysalas in later times. The country he ruled lay round 
about the Podiya hill, the southernmost section of the Western 
Ghats; and the Greek geographer Ptolemy says that one ‘ Aioi * 
was ruling in the country which included Cape Comorin and mount 
Bettigo. Ay seems to have been a dynastic name borne by all 
the kings of the line as a prefix to their personal names. The 
patron of the brahmin poet of Uraiyur was also called Andiran, 
a Sanskrit word meaning hero. His country is described as fertile 
and teeming with elephants which he presented liberally to his 
favourites. He is said to have presented the God Siva with a 
cloth of very fine texture given to him by a naga chieftain Nila. 

Andiran seems to have been a man of peace; while the excel- 
lence of his country and his liberality form the theme of a large 
number of poems, there is only one casual reference to his success 
in the battle-field when he is said to have once pursued the Kongar 
to the western sea. On his death, the poet says, Andiran was 
welcomed in the abode of the gods and the drum in Indra’s palace 
reverberated at his arrival. 

Pari, the lifelong friend and patron of Kapilar, was another ve[ 
chieftain also noted for heroism and generosity. His principality 
lay in the Pandya country round the hillock known as Kodun- 
gunram or Piranmalai. The fame of Pari’s liberality was echoed 
in a later age in the Saiva saint Sundaramurti’s lament: ‘There 
is no one ready to give, even if an illiberal patron is exalted in 
song to the level of Pari.’ Pari’s country is said to have comprised 
three hundred villages round the fortified hill at the centre. The 
fertility of the land, the strength of the fortress on the hill, and 
the ruler’s liberality are praised in many charming poems, not 
only by Kapilar. Kapilar stood by Pari through thick and thin 
when his hillock was closely invested by the three crowned kings 
of the Tamil land. Kapilar’s intelligence went far to aid Pari’s 
heroism in prolonging the resistance; for instance, several other 
poets say that Kapilar trained a large number of birds (parrots 
according to one) to fly out from Pari’s beleaguered fortress into- 


THE AGE OF THE SANGAM AND AFTER 


117 


the open country behind the enemy’s lines and bring in com to 
feed the city and the army for several months! But the inevitable 
end came, and in a short poem Pari’s two daughters thus bewailed 
the occurrence : ‘ In those days we enjoyed the moonlight happily 
with father, and our enemies could not take our hill. Now, this 
day, in this bright moonlight, kings with victorious war-drums 
have captured the hill, and we have lost our father.’ The reference 
to the victorious drum is ironical as Pari was not killed in open 
fight but by treachery. 

After Pari’s death Kapilar took charge of his two unmarried 
daughters and tried without success to get them suitably married. 
Of what happened subsequently there are different accounts. A 
note at the end of one of the poems in the Purananuru records that 
Kapilar, after the death of Pari, left his daughters in the charge 
of brahmins and committed suicide by starvation. The tradition 
recorded in a Chola inscription of the eleventh century, however, 
is very different; it mentions only one daughter whom Kapilar 
had given in marriage to the Malaiyaman before the former entered 
the fire to attain heaven. And there exist many songs by Kapilar 
on Malaiyaman Tirumudik-Kari of Mujlur, the excellence and 
easy defensibility of his country, and his liberal patronage of poets 
and min strels. Kapilar also states that Kari killed in battle an- 
other chieftain called Ori and transferred his mountain, Kollimalai, 
to the Cheras. 

Whatever may be the truth about the marriage of Pari’s daughter 
or daughters, it is certain that Kapilar neither committed suicide 
by starvation nor by entering fire soon after the death of his friend 
and patron. In fact, he repaired to the court of the Chera prince 
£elvakkadungo Vali Adan, the son of Anduvan, because he was 
reputed to possess all the great qualities of Pari. Kapilar 
celebrated Adan in song and was sumptuously rewarded for 
his effort. 

Adan’s son was Perunjeral Irumporai (c. 190) renowned for his 
overthrow of the stronghold of Tagadur (Dharmapuri in Salem 
district), the seat of the power of the- Adigaiman chieftains. He 
is also said to have subjugated a rebellious shepherd leader named 
Kaluvul and captured his fortress. He was learned, performed 
many sacrifices and begat heroic sons worthy of succeeding him. 

' His wise and righteous conduct was such as to induce his purohit 
to renounce the things of the world and retire to a life of asceticism. 



118 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Adigaiman, also called Neduman Anji, the opponent of Irum- 
porai and lord of Tagadur, was one of the ‘ seven patrons ’ and 
the supporter of the celebrated poetess Auvaiyar who has left 
many songs about him and some about his son Poguttelini. 
Evidently patron and poetess did not get on well at first start, for 
one poem gives expression to Auvaiyar’s vexation at having waited 
a long time for a present. Soon, however, a perfect under- 
standing grew up between them; the poetess is all praise for the 
hero and his achievements in the field, and undertakes a diplomatic 
mission to the Tondaiman on his account. On his side Anji 
showed his devotion by many valuable presents including a rare 
myrobalan fruit believed to prevent the ailments of old age and 
to assure longevity. According to Auvaiyar, Adigaiman was born 
of a family which honoured the gods by puja and by sacrifices, 
which introduced into the world the sweet sugar-cane from heaven, 
and ruled the world with great ability for a very long time. 
Adigaiman fought with success against seven opposing princes and 
destroyed amongst other rebellious strongholds that of Kovalur, 
The Chera invasion of Tagadur, however, is not mentioned by 
Auvaiyar in her poems, evidently because she did not like to advert 
to the misfortunes that befell her patron; the event formed the 
theme of a poem of later times, the Tagadur Yattirai , now known 
only from quotation in other works. Adigaiman was aided by 
the Pandya and Chola monarchs against the Chera, but their help 
made no difference to the result. The war led to Adigaiman’s 
acknowledgement of the suzerainty of the Chera on whose behalf 
he subsequently led an expedition against Pali, the capital of 
Nannan, where, after inflicting great losses on Nannan’s forces, 
he was killed in battle along with Ay Eyinan, another Chera 
feudatory, by the intrepid general of Nannan, known as Nimili or 
Minili. Auvaiyar laments his death without mentioning its occa- 
sion, and bewails the desolation of the days that remained to her 
after Adigaiman had earned his title to a hero-stone, a clear, 
statement that he fell on the battle-field. 

The last Chera prince mentioned in the extant portions of the 
‘ Ten Tens ’ is Kudakko IJanjeral Irumporai ( c . a.d. 190), a cousin 
of the victor of Tagadur. He is said to have fought a battle 
against * the two big kings ’ (Pandya and Chola) and Vicci, to 
have captured five stone fortresses, to have defeated the big Chola 
who ruled at Potti and the young Pajaiyan Maran, and to have 



THE AGE OF THE SANGAM AND AFTER 119 

brought to the ancient city of Yanji much booty from these 
campaigns. 

The mention of the Vani river flowing near the Chera capital 
shows that Karuvur was in fact Vanji. The discovery of numerous 
Roman coins in the neighbourhood, and Ptolemy’s statement that 
the inland city of Korura was the Chera capital, also point to the 
same conclusion. The location of Vanji has been much debated 
in recent years however, and some historians hold strongly, though 
with few tangible reasons, to the view that it is to be sought on 
the west coast at Tiruvanjaikkajam in Kerala State (Cochin). 

Another Chera prince deserving mention is 4 Sey of the elephant 
look ’ who had also the title Mandaranjeral Irumporai ( c . a.d. 210). 
After one battle, he was captured by his Pandya contemporary 
Nedunjeliyan, victor of Talaiyalanganam, but regained his freedom 
in time to prevent his enemies at home from deposing him. 

Among the Cholas, Karikaia (c. a.d. 190) stands out pre-eminent. 
He is described in a poem as the descendant of a (nameless) king 
who compelled the wind to serve his purposes when he sailed his 
ships on the wide ocean — possibly a reference to the early maritime 
enterprise of the Cholas. Karikala’s father was Ilanjetcenni ‘ of 
many beautiful chariots % a brave king and a hard fighter. Karikaia 
means * the man with the charred leg \ a reference to an accident 
by fire which befell the prince early in life. Other explanations 
for the name were invented in later times, however, and it has also 
been taken to be a compound word in Sanskrit meaning either 
‘ death to Kali ’ or 4 death to (enemy) elephants \ Early in life 
he was deposed and imprisoned. The plucky way in which he 
escaped and re-established himself on the throne is well portrayed 
by the author of Pattinappalai , a long poem on the Chola capital 
Kaveri-pattinam in the Pattuppattu (‘ Ten Idylls ’). One of his 
early achievements was the victory in a great battle at Venni, 
modern Kovil Venni, 15 miles to the east of Tanjore. This battle 
is referred to in many poems by different authors. Eleven rulers, 
velir and kings, lost their drums in the field; the Pandya and the 
Chera lost their glory, and the latter sustained the last disgrace 
that could befall a warrior — -a wound on his back — and from a 
sense of profound shame he sat facing north, sword in hand, and 
starved himself to death. Venni thus marked a turning point in 
the career of Karikaia; his victory meant the breaking-up of a 
widespread confederacy that had been formed against him.

it 

' Another important battle he fought was at Vahaipparandalai, the 

! field of vahai trees \ where nine minor enemy chieftains lost their 

I j umbrellas and had to submit. As a result of his victorious 

; : campaigns, says the poet of Pattinappalai , 4 the numerous Oliyar 

j submitted to him, the ancient Aruvalar carried out his behests, 

: 1 the Northerners lost splendour, and the Westerners were depressed; 

j j conscious of the might of his large army ready to shatter the for- 

j | tresses of enemy kings, Karikala turned his flushed look of anger 

! | against the Pandya, whose strength gave way; the line of low herds- 

| men was brought to an end, and the family of Irungovel, was 

I uprooted.’ The Aruvalar were the people of Aruvanad, the lower 

| valley of the Pennar, to the north of the Kaveri delta. Karikala is 

S said to have prevented the migration of people from his land to 

other regions evidently by offering them inducements to stay. 

; Karikala’s wars thus resulted in his establishing a sort of hege- 

mony among the 4 crowned kings ’ of the Tamil country and in 
' some extension of the territory under his direct rule. The descrip- 

tion of Kaveri-pattinam and its foreshore, which takes up so much 
of the Pattinappalai , gives a vivid idea of the state of industry and 
1 : commerce at this time. Karikala also promoted the reclamation 

• ! and settlement of forest land, and added to the prosperity of the 

country by multiplying its irrigation tanks. The poems also bear 
evidence that the king, who was a follower of the Vedic religion, 

* performed sacrifices and lived well, enjoying life to the full. 

* : In later times Karikala became the centre of many legends found 

1 in the Silappadikdram and in inscriptions and literary works of 

j the eleventh and twelfth centuries. They attribute to him the 

! conquest of the whole of India up to the Himalayas and the con- 

struction with the aid of his feudatories of the flood-banks of the 
Kaveri. The famous scholar Naccinarkkiniyar probably follows 
1 a correct tradition when he says that Karikala married a yelir girl 

from Nangur , a place celebrated in the hymns of Tirumangai Alvar 
for the heroism of its warriors. More open to suspicion is the 
story in the Silappadikaram about a supposed daughter of 
Karikala’s, named Adi Mandi, and her husband, a Chera prince 
called Attan Atti. Earlier poems which mention their names and 
some of the incidenis attest only the relation between Adi Mandi 
and Atti, but not that between her and Karikala, nor the Chera 
1 descent of Atti. Both husband and wife were, according to the 

early testimony, professional dancers — attan means dancer. 



THE AGE OF THE SANGAM AND AFTER 121 

Tondaiman Ilandiraiyan, who ruled at KancMpuram, was a con- 
temporary of Karikala and is also celebrated by the poet of the 
Pattinappdlai in another poem in the ‘ Ten Idylls \ Ilandiraiyan 
is said to have been a descendant of Vishnu and belonged to the 
family of Tiraiyar given by the waves of the sea. There is no hint 
anywhere of his being related to Karikala or of his political sub- 
ordination to the Chola power. Nor is it clear whether it was to 
Mm or to some other member of his line that Auvaiyar went as 
Adigaiman’s ambassador. Ilandiraiyan was himself a poet, and 
there are four extant songs by him, one of them on the importance 
of the personal character of the monarch in the promotion of 
good rule. 

The Pandya king Nedunjeliyan distinguished by the title * he 
who won the battle at Talaiyalanganam ’ may be taken to have 
ruled about a.d. 210. This ruler was celebrated by two great poets, 
Mangudi Marudan alias Mangudi Khar, and Nakkirar each con- 
tributing a poem on the monarch to the * Ten Idylls 5 ( Pattuppdttu ) 
besides minor pieces in the Pur am and Aham collections. 

From the Maduraikkanji of Mangudi Marudan and elsewhere, 
we learn something of three of Nedunjeliyan’s predecessors on the 
Pandyan throne. The first is an almost mythical figure called 
Nediyon (* the tall one ’), whose acMevements find a place in the 
* Sacred Sports ’ of £iva at Madura and among the traditions of 
the Pandyas enumerated in the Velvikudi and Sinnamanur plates. 
He is said to have brought the Pahruli river into existence and 
organized the worship of the sea. The next is Palsalai Muduku- 
-4umi, doubtless the same as the earliest Pandya king named in 
the Velvikudi grant and about whom there are several poems. He 
is a more life-like figure than Nediyon, and is said to have treated 
conquered territory harshly. He also performed many sacrifices, 
whence he derived his title palsalai meaning * of the many (sacri- 
ficial) halls \ It is not possible to say what distance in time 
separated these two kings from each other or from their succes- 
sors. The tMrd ruler mentioned in the Maduraikkanji was another 
Nedunjeliyan, distinguished by the title * he who won a victory 
against an Aryan (i.e., North Indian) army \ The tragedy of 
Kovalan’s death at Madura occurred in his reign, which according 
to the Silappadikaram caused the king to have died of a broken 
heart. A short poem ascribed to tMs king puts learning above 
birth and caste. 



122 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Nedunjeliyan of Talaiyalanganam came to the throne as a youth 
and soon after his accession, he proved himself more than equal 
to a hostile combination of his two neighbouring monarchs and 
five minor chieftains. There exists a simple poem of great force 
and beauty in which the youthful monarch swears an oath of 
heroism and victory in the ensuing fight. Despising his tender 
years and hoping for an easy victory and large booty, his enemies 
invaded the kingdom and penetrated to the heart of it ; but, nothing 
daunted, Nedunjeliyan readily took the field, pursued the invading 
forces across his frontier into the Chola country and inflicted a 
crushing defeat on them at Talaiyalanganam, about eight miles 
north-west of Tiruvalur in the Tanjore district. It was in this 
battle that the Chera king * §ey of the elephant-look ’ was taken 
captive and thrown into a Pandyan prison. By his victory Nedun- 
jeliyan not only made himself secure on his ancestral throne, but 
gained a primacy over the entire state system of the Tamil country. 
He also conquered the two divisions ( kurram ) of Milalai and 
Mutturu from Ewi and a velir chieftain and annexed them to his 
kingdom. The Maduraikkdnji contains a full-length description of 
Madura and the Pandyan country under Nedunjeliyan’s rule. The 
poet gives expression to his wish that his patron should spread 
the benefits of his good rule all over India. He makes particular 
mention of the farmers and traders of a place called Muduvellilai 
(unidentified) as among his most loyal subjects for many genera- 
tions. He also refers to the battle of Alanganam, calls his patron 
lord of Korkai and the warlord of the southern Paradavar — hinting 
that the people of the pearl-fishery coast formed an important 
section of his army. 

Passing over the many contemporaries of Nedunjeliyan — Pandya 
and Chola princes and the poets who mention them and their 
achievements — we must now notice a rather protracted civil war 
in the Chola kingdom mentioned by Kovur Kilar and other poets. 
This war was between Nalangilh (also called £etcenni) and 
Nedungilli. The latter shut himself up at Avur which was being 
besieged by Mavalattan, the younger brother of Nalangilh. In 
one poem Kovur Khar says that if he claimed to be virtuous, 
Nedungifli should open the gates of the fort, or if he claimed to be 
brave he should come into the open and fight. He did neither^ 
but caused untold misery to the people of his beleaguered city by 
shutting himself up in a cowardly manner. Another poem dealing 


THE AGE OF THE SANGAM AND AFTER 123 


with the siege of Uraiyur by Nalangilli himself, once more Nedun- 
gijli being the besieged, is more considerate and impartial; it is 
addressed to both princes and exhorts them to stop the destructive 
war, as whoever loses would be a Chola, and a war to the finish 
must necessarily end in the defeat of one party. A third poem 
relates to a somewhat piquant situation. A poet, Ilandattan by 
name, who went into Uraiyur from Nalangilli, was suspected by 
Nedungihi of spying. As he was about to be killed, Kovur Kilar 
interceded with his song on the harmless and upright nature of 
poets and thus saved him. Another poem hints at internal dis- 
sensions in the royal family at Uraiyur, which induced Nalangijli’s 
soldiers to rush to war in utter disregard of omens. Civil war 
seems, indeed, to have been the bane of the Chola kingdom in 
this age; Senguttuvan, as we have seen, was called upon to intervene 
in another war at an earlier time. 

This sketch of the political conditions of the Sangam age may 
be closed with the mention of two other Chola rulers, both oppo- 
nents of the Cheras in war. Ilanjetcenni of Neydalanganal 
captured two fortresses from the Cheras known by the names of 
Seruppali and Pamajur. Senganan, the Chola monarch famed in 
legend for his devotion to Siva, figures as the victor in the battle 
of Por against the Chera Kanaikkal Irumporai. The Chera was 
taken prisoner, asked for drinking water when he was in prison, 
got it rather late, and then, without drinking it, confessed the 
shame of his position in a song. Subsequently, Poygaiyar, a 
friend of the Chera monarch, is said to have secured his release 
from the Chola prison by celebrating the victory of 3enganan in 
a poem of forty stanzas — the KalavaU . According to this poem, 
the battle was fought at Kalumalam, near Karuvur, the Chera 
capital. &enganan became the subject of many pious legends in 
later times. It is possible that this monarch who, according to 
Tirumangai, built 70 fine temples of Siva, lived somewhat later* 
say in the fourth or fifth century a.d. 

A thorough change in the political map of South India and 
the definite close of an epoch seem to be clearly implied in the 
Sirupan-arruppadai by Nattattanar, one of the Pattupdttu ('Ten 
Idylls ’). The poem has Nalliyakkodan for its hero and he may be 
taken to stand right at the end of the Sangam age. He ruled a 
territory which included Gidangil, a village near Tindivanam r 
Eyirpattanam — modern Markanam, and Amur and Velur, all

places in the South Arcot district. We may assign to him a date 
about a.d. 275, and in his day the poet says that charity had dried 
up in the capitals of the three Tamil kingdoms, and all ancient 
patrons of learning and the arts were no more! There may well 
be some exaggeration here; but clearly Vanji, Uraiyur and Madura 
must have passed the meridian of their prosperity and entered on 
a period of decline. 

Of the social and economic conditions of the age, the cultural 
Ideas and ideals accepted and cherished by the people, of the in- 
stitutions and activities which embodied and sustained them, the 
literature of the Sangam gives an unusually complete and true 
picture. The most striking feature in the picture is its composite 
character; it is the unmistakable result of the blend of two origin- 
ally distinct cultures, best described as Tamilian and Aryan; but 
it is by no means easy now to distinguish the original elements in 
their purity. Some of them may be recognized, however, to have 
clearly originated in Northern India and made their way into the 
South during the period of its aryanization and later. The stories 
of the Mahabhdrata and Rdmayana were well known to the Tamil 
poets, and episodes from them are frequently mentioned. The 
claim of each of the three Tamil kings to have fed the opposing 
forces on the eve of the Great Battle has been noted already. The 
destruction of the three metallic forts of the Asuras ( Tripura ) by 
3iva, king Sibi giving away the flesh of his body to save a dove that 
was pursued by a vulture, and the struggle between Krishna and 
the Asuras for the possession of the sun, are among other legends 
alluded to by the authors. The presence of a great fire underneath 
the ocean, Uttara-kuru (the northern country) as a land of per- 
petual enjoyment, Arundhati as the ideal of chastity, the 
conception of the threefold debt ( rinatraya ) with which every man 
is bom, the beliefs that the cakora bird feeds only on raindrops, 
and that raindrops turn into pearls in particular circumstances, 
are instances of other Sanskritic ideas taken over bodily into the 
literature of the Sangam period. The Tolkdppiyam is said to have 
been modelled on the Sanskrit grammar of the Aindra school. 

The Tolkdppiyam states definitely that marriage as a sacrament 
attended with ritual was established in the Tamil country by the 
Aryas. It is well known that the earliest Dharmasastras mention 
eight forms of marriage as part of4he Aryan code — itself the result 
of a blend between Aryan and pre-Aryan forms that prevailed 


THE AGE OF THE SANGAM AND AFTER 


125 


in the North; these eight forms are mentioned in the Tolkdppiyam 
and other works, and much ingenuity is spent in accommodating 
them to Tamil forms. The Tamils had a relatively simple con- 
ception of marriage; they recognized the natural coming together 
of man and woman, and the natural differences in the manifes- 
tations of love, possibly due ultimately to differences in the physical 
conditions of the different parts of the country. These they 
designated as the five tinais . They had also names for unilateral 
love, kaikkilai and improper love, perundinai. Into this framework 
an attempt was made to squeeze the eight Aryan forms with results 
by no means happy. Such difficulties of synthesis apart, the most 
tangible result of the meeting of the Tamil and the Aryan was the 
tremendous richness and fecundity that was imparted to the Tamil 
idiom thereby and the rise of a beautiful literature which combined 
classic grace with vernacular energy and strength. This literature 
of the Sangam, the earliest stratum of Tamil literature now 
available, is also in many ways the best. 

The land was fertile and there was plenty of grain, meat and 
fish; the Chera country was noted for its buffaloes, jack-fruit, 
pepper and turmeric. In the Chola country, watered by the 
Kaveri, it was said that the space in which an elephant could lie 
down produced enough to feed seven, and a veli of land yielded a 
round thousand kalams of paddy. The little principality of Pari 
abounded in forest produce like ‘ bamboo-rice jack-fruit, valli- 
root and honey. Many rural activities like the cultivation of rdgi 
and sugar-cane, the making of sugar from the cane, and the 
harvesting and drying of grain are described in the Sangam poems 
in a vivid and realistic manner. 

The people were organized for the most part in occupational 
groups living apart from one another but in fairly close proximity 
within each village or town, and their life was regulated by a per- 
vasive sense of social solidarity. Differences in status and economic 
conditions were accepted by all as part of the established order, 
and there is little evidence of any tendency to protest or revolt 
against them. The poets describe with equally intimate touches 
the unlettered Malavar who thrive on robbery in the northern 
frontier of the Tamil land, the hunters (eyinar) with their huts 
full of bows and shields, the homes of shepherds where quantities 
of curds and ghee are produced for sale, and those of learned 
brahmins versed in the Vedas and performing their daily ritual 



126

duties including the entertainment of guests. Apparently brahmins 
ate meat and drank toddy without incurring reproach. One poem 
in the Purananuru affirms that there are only four castes ( kudi ), 
viz., tudiyan, pdnan , paraiyan and kadamban, and only one god 
worthy of being worshipped by having paddy strewn before him, 
namely the hero-stone recalling the fall of a brave warrior in battle. 
These castes and this worship were of very great antiquity, perhaps 
being survivals from pre-Aryan times. The practice of erecting 
hero-stones and of offering regular worship to them continued 
throughout the Sangam age and many centuries after. Foreigners 
(Yavanas) were numerous in the ports on the sea-coast like Tondi, 
Musiri and Puhar (Kaveri-pattinam) which they visited for trade. 
Although unable to speak Tamil they were employed as palace- 
guards in Madura and on police duty in the streets. Curiously 
wrought lamps and wine in bottles figure prominently among the 
articles of trade brought to India by the Yavanas. 

Hereditary monarchy was the prevailing form of government. 
Disputed successions and civil wars were not unknown, as we 
have seen, and sometimes caused grave misery to the people. The 
king was in all essential respects an autocrat whose autocracy, 
however, was tempered by the maxims of the wise and the 
occasional intercession of a minister, a poet or a friend. The 
sphere of the state’s activity was, however, limited, and in a society 
where respect for custom was deep-rooted, even the most perverse 
of autocrats could not have done much harm; indeed it must be 
said that the general impression left on the mind by the literature of 
the age is one of contentment on the part of the people who were 
proud of their kings and loyal to them. As the people took the 
king for their model, it was his duty to set up a high moral standard 
by his personal conduct; in many poems he was exhorted to keep a 
strict mastery over his passions in order to rule successfully. He 
was to be liberal in his patronage of religion, arts and letters. He 
was to show paternal care for his subjects and to be impartial as 
among different sections of them. He held a daily durbar (nalavai) 
at which he heard and set right all complaints. The onerous 
character of the royal task is emphasized by a poet who compares 
a king to a strong bull which drags a cart laden with salt from the 
plains to the uplands; another affirms that the king, much more 
than rice or water, is the life of the people. To brahmins was 
assigned an 'important role in the state; they were the foremost 



THE AGE OF THE SANGAM AND AFTER 


127 


among those (, surram ) on whose assistance the king relied in his 
daily work; and the highest praise of a monarch was to say that 
he did nothing which pained the brahmins. Agriculture was the 
mainstay of polity and the basis of war; and a good king was 
believed to be able to command the course of the seasons. The 
ideal of the 4 conquering king ’ ( vijigfshu ) was accepted and acted 
on. Victory against seven kings meant a superior status, which the 
victor marked by wearing a garland made out of the crowns of 
the seven vanquished rulers. The most powerful kings were ex- 
pected to undertake a digvijaya , which was a conquering expedition 
in clockwise direction over the whole of India. The idea of a 
chakravarti, 4 wheel-king whose digvijaya was led by the march 
of a mysterious wheel of gold and gems through the air is mentioned 
in one of the poems in the Purandnuru. Another poem in the 
same collection mentions the companions of a king who com- 
mitted suicide when the king died — an early anticipation of what 
later became a widespread institution under such names as 
Companions of Honour (Abu Zayd), velaikkdrar , garudas , 
sahavasis , dpattudavigal and so on. 

The sabha or manram of the king in the capital was the highest 
court of justice. The sons of Malaiyaman were tried and sentenced, 
and later released by the intercession of Kovur Khar, in the manram 
of Uraiyur; and Pottiyar, after the death of his friend Kopperun- 
jolan, could not bear the sight of the same manram bereft of him. 
The elders are said and were doubtless expected to have laid aside 
their personal quarrels when they attended the sabha to help in the 
adjudication of disputes. We may infer that the assembly was 
used by the king for purposes of general consultation as well. The 
Kural, clearly a post-Sangam work, definitely regards the sabha as 
a general assembly dealing with all affairs. Even less specialized, 
and more entangled in the social and religious complex of village 
life, was the manram. Each village had its common place of meet- 
ing, generally under the shade of a big tree, where men, women 
and children met for all the common activities of the village, in- 
cluding sports and pastimes. There may also have been a political 
side to these rural gatherings, the germ out of which grew the 
highly organized system of village government which functioned 
so admirably in later Chola times. 

Land and trade were the chief sources of the royal revenue. 
The md and veli as measures of land were already known ; but the 



128 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


king’s share of the produce of agriculture is nowhere precisely 
stated. Foreign trade was important and customs revenue occu- 
pied a high place on the receipts side of the budget; the Pattinappdlai 
gives a vivid account of the activity of customs officials in Puhar 
(Kaveri-pattinam). Internal transit duties on merchandise moving 
from place to place were another source of revenue, and the roads 
were guarded night and day by soldiers to prevent smuggling. 
Moderation in taxation, however, was impressed on the rulers by 
many wise sayings of the poets. If their word may be trusted, 
booty captured in war was no inconsiderable part of royal 
resources. The Cholas are said to have had a strongly guarded 
treasury at Kumbakonam in the 3angam age. 

The streets of the capital cities were patrolled at nights by watch- 
men bearing torches, and the prison formed part of the system 
of administration. 

Each ruler maintained an army of well-equipped professional 
soldiers who no doubt found frequent employment in those 
bellicose times. Captains of the army were distinguished by the 
title of enadi conferred at a formal ceremony of investiture where 
the king presented the chosen commander with a ring and other 
insignia of high military rank. The army comprised the traditional 
four arms — chariots (drawn by oxen), elephants, cavalry and in- 
fantry. Swords, bows and arrows, armour made of tiger-skins, 
javelins, spears and shields (including a protective cover for the 
forearm) are among the weapons of offence and defence speci- 
fically mentioned. The drum and the conch were employed on 
the field for signalling and the former to summon soldiers to arms. 
Each ruler and chieftain certainly had a war-drum among his 
insignia. Not only was it carefully guarded, but it was bathed 
periodically and worshipped with loud mantras. The occasions 
for war were numerous, but we need not suppose that the refusal 
of one king to give his daughter in marriage to another was as 
frequent a cause as the poets assert. A campaign might be started 
by the capture of the enemy’s cattle, or a brahmin messenger might 
be sent with a formal declaration before hostilities started. The 
military camp was often an elaborate affair, with streets and roads 
and a separate section for the king guarded by armed women; 
in this camp the hours of day and night were announced by 
watchers of water-clocks; the gnomon was employed to indicate 
midday and a drum beaten early every morning. Camp fires kept 



THE AGE OF THE SANGAM AND AFTER 129 


off the cold when necessary, and there were towers at important 
points from which a regular watch was maintained against sur- 
prises from the enemy. Death in battle was welcome to the soldier 
and even to his mother, for it was held to lead him straight to 
heaven. To the warrior, a peaceful death in bed was looked upon 
as a disgrace, and in the families of ruling chieftains the body of 
a man who died otherwise than in war was cut with the sword, 
and laid on darbha grass, and mantras were chanted to secure him 
a place in the warriors’ heaven ( virasvarga ). Soldiers who fell in 
war were commemorated by hero-stones which bore inscriptions 
detailing their names and achievements; these stones were often 
worshipped as godlings. Wounded soldiers were carefully attend- 
ed to, their wounds being cleaned and stitched where necessary. 

Kings often took the field in person and delighted to rejoice 
with the common soldiers in their successes; on the other hand, 
if a king was killed or even seriously wounded in the midst of the 
fight, his army gave up the struggle and accepted defeat. The 
vanity of the victor often inflicted deep personal humiliations on 
his vanquished foe, the memory of which rankled and brought on 
further strife. The crowns of defeated kings furnished the gold 
for the anklets of the victor, while a woman’s anklet and a garment 
of leaves were forced on the defeated party who was compelled 
to wear them; his guardian tree was destroyed and its trunk con- 
verted into a war-drum for the victor. The conquered country 
was at times ruthlessly laid waste, even cornfields not being spared. 

The Kalavali is one of the most detailed descriptions we possess 
of a battle-field in the Tamil country, and the poem supplies in a 
casual way much interesting information on military affairs. The 
soldiers, infantry and cavalry alike, wore leather sandals for the 
protection of their feet. The nobles and princes rode on elephants, 
and the commanders drove in pennoned chariots. The poet says 
that women whose husbands were killed bewailed their loss on the 
field of Kalumalam; unless this is mere rhetoric, we must suppose 
that women, at least of the higher orders, sometimes accompanied 
their husbands to the field. 

Besides being the head of the government and leader in war, 
the king also held the first rank in society. He patronized poetry 
and the arts, and kept open house. War and women were, in 
fact, the universal preoccupations of the leisured classes, besides 
wine and song and the dance. The king and his enadis with their 
9

retinues must have formed a gay, boisterous crew at the top of 
society with a boundless capacity for enjoying the pleasures 
of life. 

No occasion was lost for holding a feast and the poets are most 
eloquent in their praise of the sumptuous fare to which they were 
so often asked. One poet declares to his patron : 4 1 came to see 
you that we might eat succulent chops of meat, cooled after boiling 
and soft like the carded cotton of the spinning-woman, and drink 
large pots of toddy together.’ Another speaks of wine poured 
into golden goblets by smiling women decked with jewels in the 
court of Karikala. The flesh of animals cooked whole, such as 
pork from a pig which had been kept away from its female mate 
for many days and fattened for the occasion, appam (pudding) 
soaked in milk, the flesh of tortoises and particular kinds of fish 
are mentioned as delicacies served at such feasts. Among drinks 
particular mention is made of foreign liquor in green bottles, of 
munnir (‘ triple water ’) — a mixture of milk from unripe coconut, 
palm fruit juice and the juice of sugar-cane, and of toddy well 
matured by being buried underground for a long time in 
bamboo barrels. 

The habit of eating betel-leaves with lime and areca-nut perhaps 
came into use only after the Sangam age. Women are said to 
have given up eating greens and bathing in cold water when their 
husbands fell in battle. The lot of widows was a hard one; they 
had to cut off their hair, discard all ornaments, and only eat the 
plainest food. No wonder, perhaps, that some wives preferred to 
die with their husbands and earn fame as satis. The tonsure of 
widows, it may be noted by the way, like the tying of the tali at 
the marriage ceremony, was obviously a pre-Aryan Tamil custom 
taken over and perpetuated into later times. 

Easily the most cultured amusements open to the upper classes 
in those days were poetry, music (particularly singing) and dancing, 
which often went together. The poets were men and women drawn 
from all classes of society; they composed verses to suit the 
immeditate occasion, and were often rewarded generously for their 
exertions, as when Karikala is said to have given the author of 
Pattinappalai 1,600,000 gold pieces. Their poems, especially the 
shorter ones, are full of colour and true to life. They abound in 
fine phrases giving compact and eloquent expression to the physical 
and spiritual experiences of the poet. Nor do they lack width of 


THE AGE OF THE SANGAM AND AFTER 


131 


range: besides short lyrics, odes and religious hymns were known. 
The metres employed were simple and flexible, the more elaborate 
Sanskrit forms not having come into vogue. 

Some of the poets were the resident companions and advisers 
of kings and chieftains, while others moved from one court to 
another in search of patronage. The lasting friendships between 
Kapilar and Pari, between Pisir Andaiyar and Kopperunjolan, and 
between Auvaiyar and Adigaiman Anji are among the best known 
instances of life-long attachment between poet and patron. Un- 
generous princes who delayed their gifts or were niggardly some- 
times provoked the poets into pillorying their stinginess in song. 
One poet refused to accept a present sent to him by a prince who 
had not granted him the usual interview. Golden lotuses and 
lilies, land, chariots, horses, and cash are enumerated among the 
presents usually given on such occasions. Besides general and 
probably exaggerated statements, such as Karikala’s more than 
princely gift already mentioned, the gift of an elephant is mentioned 
in one instance, though it is not clear what use the poet could have 
for the animal. 

The courts were also enlivened by roving bands of musicians 
followed by women who danced to the accompaniment of their 
music, the panar and viraliyar who moved about the country in 
companies carrying with them all sorts of quaint instruments. 
They seem to have been the representatives of primitive tribal 
groups who preserved the folk-songs and dances of an earlier age. 
Their numbers and their dire poverty form a recurring theme of 
poems, and from all accounts they lived from hand to mouth and 
seldom knew where their next meal was to be had. Here is a 
humorous account of their experiences after meeting a generous 
patron : ‘ The Chola king showered on us great quantities of wealth 
in (the form of) fine and costly jewels not suited to our condition; 
on seeing this, some among the large group of my kinsfolk, used 
(only) to abject poverty, put on their ears ornaments meant for 
the fingers; some wore on their fingers things meant for the ear; 
others put on their necks jewels meant for the waist; others again 
adorned their waists with ornaments properly worn on the neck; 
in this wise, like the great group of red-faced monkeys which shone 
in the fine jewels (of Sita) that they discovered on the ground, on 
the day when the mighty rakshasa carried off Sita, the wife of 
Rama of the swift chariot, we became the cause of endless 


132 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


laughter.’ Literary convention evolved a class of poem, the 
drruppadai (‘ setting one on the path ’), in which a poet, pdnan or 
virali told of the gifts he had received from a patron and exhorted 
his friends to visit him. 

The arts of music and dancing were highly developed and 
popular. Musical instruments of various types are described 
and included many kinds of ydl (a stringed instrument like the 
lute) and varieties of drums. Karikala is called ‘ the master of 
the seven notes of music The flute is quaintly described as the 
‘pipe with dark holes made by red fire Conventions had grown 
up regarding the proper time and place for each tune. Virali s 
sometimes danced at night by torchlight and particular dance- 
poses of the hands are mentioned by name as in the Ndtyasdstra 
of Bharata. Mixed dances in which men and women took part 
were also known. In this sphere a conscious and systematic 
attempt was made to bring together and synthesize the indigenous. 
pre-Aryan modes ( desi ) with those that came from the North 
(mdrga), the result of wljich is reflected fully in the Silappadikdram^ 
a work of the succeeding age. This subject, however, is too- 
complicated and technical to be pursued further here. 

Among other sports and pastimes, the hunting of dogs and 
hares, wrestling and boxing matches among warriors are men- 
tioned. Old men engaged in dice-play, and women and girls played 
with balls and molucca-beans on the terraces of houses. Mixed 
bathing and picnic parties, children playing in the manram and 
their toy bows and arrows also find casual mention in the poems. 
Boys and girls bathed together in tanks and rivers. The dancing- 
girl was often a serious rival to the wife, and the whole plot of 
the celebrated story of Kovalan and Kannagi turns on this rivalry. 
Like Vatsyayana’s Kdmasutra , the Manimekalai , a work of the 
period after the Sangam, indicates that hetaerae underwent a 
regular course of instruction extending over a number of years and 
comprising court dances, popular dances, singing, playing on the 
lute and flute, cookery, perfumery, painting, flower-work and many 
other fine arts. 

The richer classes dwelt in houses of brick and mortar; the walls, 
often bore paintings of divine figures and pictures of animal life. 
Royal palaces were surrounded by gardens tastefully laid out. 
Houses and palaces were constructed according to rules laid down 
in the sastra , care being taken to start at an auspicious hour 



THE AGE OF THE SANGAM AND AFTER 133 


carefully determined beforehand. The Nedunalvadai, one of the ‘ Ten 
Idylls contains a detailed description of the women’s apartments 
in the palace of Nedunjeliyan, their walls and pillars and the artistic 
lamps manufactured by the Yavanas; this is followed by an account 
of the equipment of the bedroom in the palace, its ivory bedsteads 
.and superior cushions. High life even in those early days was 
thus no stranger to refined luxuries. The wife was highly honoured 
and was held to be the light of the family. The common folk 
dwelt in humbler structures in the towns and villages, while out- 
castes and forest tribes lived in huts of sorts which are also 
described in the poems. The making of rope-charpoys by pulaiyans 
and the use of animal skins as mats for lying on deserve to be 
noted. The Pattinappalai gives a vivid account of the life of the 
fisherfolk of Puhar, the paradavar, including some of their holiday 
amusements. 

Valuable hints on popular beliefs and customs are scattered 
among the poems. There was much faith in omens and astrology; 
one song mentions the portents which preceded the death of 4 Sey 
of the elephant look A woman with dishevelled hair was a bad 
omen. There were fortune-tellers who plied a busy trade. 
Children were provided with amulets for warding off evil; and 
rites were practised which were supposed to avert the mischief of 
demons (pey), to bring about rain, and produce other desired 
results. The banyan tree was considered to be the abode of gods, 
while eclipses were held to be the result of snakes eating up the 
sun and the moon. Crows were believed to announce the arrival 
of guests, and particularly the return of the absent husband to 
his lonely wife, and were fed regularly in front of royal palaces, 
as well, perhaps, as in every household. Mass feeding of the poor 
was also known. 

Trade, both inland and foreign, was well organized and briskly 
carried on throughout the period; Tamil poems, classical authors 
and archaeological finds in South India all speak with one voice 
on this subject. The great port-cities were the emporia of foreign 
trade. Big ships, we are told, entered the port of Puhar without 
slacking sail, and poured out on the beach precious merchandise 
brought from overseas. The extensive bazaar of that great city 
was full of tall mansions of many apartments each with doorways, 
wide verandahs and corridors. The family life of the rich mer- 
chants was carried on in the upper floors while the lower ones 



134 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


were set apart for business. Besides the flags waving on the masts 
of ships in harbour, various other kinds of flags advertised the 
different kinds of merchandise as well as the fashionable grog- 
shops. Saliyur in the Pandya country and Bandar in Chera are 
counted among the most important ports in the poems. Horses 
were imported by sea into the Pandyan kingdom, and elsewhere. 
The repairing of merchant ships after their voyages is mentioned, 
as also lighthouses. People from different countries gathered in 
the ports, and life in them was truly cosmopolitan. The Yavanas 
sailed their large ships to Musiri (Cranganore) bearing gold, and 
returned laden with pepper and ‘ the rare products of the sea and 
mountain 5 which the Chera king gave. So far the evidence of 
the poems. 

The author of the Periplus (c. a.d. 75) gives the most valuable 
information about this trade between India and the Roman 
Empire. He mentions the ports of Naura (Cannanore), Tyndis 
— the Tondi of the poems, identified with Ponnani — and Muziris 
(Musiri, Cranganore), and Nelcynda very near Kottayam, as of lead- 
ing importance on the west coast. Muziris abounded in ships sent 
there with cargoes from Arabia and by the Greeks. Nelcynda 
was part of the Pandyan kingdom. Bacare (Porakad) was another 
port on the same coast. On the nature of the trade, the words of 
the author are worth citing : ‘ They send large ships to these market 
towns on account of the great quantity and bulk of pepper and 
malabathrum (to be had there). There are imported here, in the 
first place, a great quantity of coins; topaz, thin clothing, not 
much; figured linens, antimony, coral, crude glass, copper, tin, 
lead; wine, not much, but as much as at Barygaza; realgar and 
orpiment, and wheat enough for the sailors, for this is not dealt 
in by the merchants there. There is exported pepper, which is 
produced in quantity in only one region near these markets, a 
district called Cottonara. Besides this there are exported large 
quantities of fine pearls, ivory, silk cloth, spikenard from the 
Ganges, malabathrum from the places in the interior, transparent 
stones of all kinds (principally beryls of the Coimbatore district 
for which there was a constant demand in Rome), diamonds and 
sapphires, and tortoise shell; that from Chryse Island and that 
taken among the islands along the coast of Damirica.’ This trade

the ocean instead of small vessels hugging the coast and exposing 
themselves to many risks. Other ports of South India mentioned 
by the author in order are: Balita (Varkalai), a village by the shore 
with a fine harbour; Comari, a fine harbour and a sacred place of 
pilgrimage; Colchi (Korkai) where were the pearl fisheries of the 
Pandyan kingdom worked by condemned criminals; Camara 
(Kaveri-pattinam), Poduca (Pondicherry) and Sopatma(Markanam). 
There were three types of craft used on the east coast: ships of 
the country coasting along the shore ; other large vessels made 
of single logs bound together, called sangara , and those which 
made the voyage to Chryse and to the Ganges which were called 
Colandia and were very large. He mentions Argaru (Uraiyur) 
as the place to which were sent all the pearls gathered on the 
coast and from which were exported muslins called Argaritic. 
About the ports on the east coast he adds : * There are imported 
into these places everything made in Damirica, and the greatest 
part of what is brought at any time from Egypt comes here.’ He 
notes further that a great quantity of muslins was made in 
the region of Masalia (Andhra country), and that ivory was a 
special product of the country further north, Dosarene (i.e., 
Dasarna, Orissa). 

The large quantities of gold and silver coins struck by all the 
Roman emperors down to Nero (a.d. 54-68) found in the interior 
of the Tamil land testify to the extent of the trade, the presence 
of Roman settlers in the Tamil country, and the periods of the 
rise, zenith and decay of this active commerce. Its beginnings 
may be traced to the reign of Augustus if not to an earlier time, 
as a phenomenally large number bearing his stamp (and that of 
Tiberius) have been found. In that reign, despite ‘ embassies * 
from the Pandya ruler, this commerce was by no means extensive 
or economically important. Soon, however, it assumed new and 
unexpected proportions and ceased to be a mere trade in luxuries. 
After the death of Nero, the traffic was not so much confined to 
the Tamil land as before but spread more evenly along the Indian 
coasts, and was conducted by barter rather than with money — 
the emperors subsequent to Nero not being so well represented in 
the coin finds. Towards the end of the second century a.d. the 
direct trade between the Egyptian Greeks of the Roman empire 
and India declined, the traffic passing into the hands of the 
Arabians and, still more, the Auxumites of East Africa. A new 



136 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


era commenced with the rise of Constantinople in the fourth cen- 
tury a.d. Roman coins reappeared in South India, and embassies 
were received by Constantine from the people of the Maldives 
and Ceylon among others. Ceylon was becoming important in 
the trade of the Indian ocean at this time. But the activities of 
the Byzantine period bear no comparison with those of the earlier 
age which had drained the Roman empire of much of its treasure 
and evoked protests from the financiers of the empire as well as 
its moralists. The trade of the early Roman empire had wide 
ramifications and was bound up with much exploration and 
colonization on the part of Graeco-Romans and Indians. Says 
Schoff: ‘ The numerous migrations from India into Indo-China, 
both before and after the Christian era, give ample ground for the 
belief that the ports of South India and Ceylon were in truth, as 
the Periplus states, the centre of an active trade with the Far East, 
employing larger ships, and in greater number, than those coming 
from Egypt.’ We shall see that when, after a long eclipse, the 
power of the Chola kings revived in the tenth and eleventh 
centuries, the seafaring instincts of the people had not deserted 
them and that, in the favourable conditions then obtaining, they 
attempted tasks more venturesome than anything they had achieved 
in the earlier age. 

Internal trade was also brisk; caravans of merchants with carts 
and pack-animals carried their merchandise from place to place 
and from fair to fair. Sait was an important commodity of trade 
and salt-merchants moved with their families in carts provided 
with spare axles against contingencies. Barter played a large 
part in all transactions; honey and roots, for example, might be 
exchanged for fish-oil and toddy, and sugar-cane and aval (rice- 
flakes) for venison and arrack, while in Musiri fish was sold for 
paddy. Agriculture was the mainstay of the national economy, 
and most of its operations were carried on by women of the lowest 
class (kadaisiyar) whose status appears to have differed little from 
that of the slave. The bulk of the land was owned by veljalar, 
the agriculturists par excellence , who commanded a high social 
rank. The richer among them did not plough the land themselves, 
but employed labourers to do it. Besides owning land, they held 
official posts in the civil and military administration, and the titles 
vel and arasu in the Chola country and kavidi in the Pandya were 
applied to them. They not only enjoyed the jus connubii with 



THE AGE OF THE SANGAM AND AFTER 


137 


royal families, but shared with the king the duties of war and the 
pleasures of the chase and of the table. The poorer velldlar did 
not shun manual labour, but worked on their own small farms, as 
do the peasantry everywhere. Spinning and weaving of cotton, 
and perhaps also of silk, had attained a high degree of perfection. 
Spinning was then, as always, the part-time occupation of women. 
The weaving of complex patterns on cloth and silk is often men- 
tioned in literature and, according to the Periplus , Uraiyur was a 
great centre of the cotton trade. The poems mention cotton cloth 
as thin as the slough of the snake or a cloud of steam, so finely 
woven that the eye could not follow the course of the thread. 
Scissors and needles were known and employed in cutting hair 
and in dress-making; a kind of hair pomade ( t agar am ) is 
mentioned also. 

In the sphere of religion and ethics the influence of Northern 
ideas is most marked. The practice of walking some distance to 
escort a departing guest was observed by Karikala who went on 
foot for a distance of ‘ seven steps ’ (. saptapadi ) before requesting 
him to mount a chariot drawn by four milk-white steeds. The 
slaughter of a cow, the destruction of a foetus, and the killing of 
a brahmin were accounted heinous offences; though ingratitude, 
according to the established code, was held to be even worse. 

No single method was adopted for the disposal of the dead? 
both cremation and inhumation with or without urns are freely 
mentioned. A widow offered a rice-ball to her dead husband on 
a bed of grass (darbha) and the pulaiyan had a part to play in this 
funeral ritual. Sail was fairly common though by no means 
universal. The heroism and devotion of the sail were doubtless 
applauded by public opinion, but the practice was certainly not 
encouraged, much less enforced. The perfect wife was held to be 
-one who, at the death of her husband, entered the burning pyre 
with as little concern as if she were entering cool water for a bath. 

That Yedic religion had struck root in the South must have 
become clear from the references to the costly sacrifices performed 
by the monarchs of the age. Brahmins devoted to their studies 
and religious duties held a high position in society, and a song of 
Avur Mulam Kilar portrays in much detail the fife of Vinnandayan, 
a brahmin of the Kaundinya-gotra who lived in Punjarrur in the 
Chola country. The followers of the Veda had often to engage in 
disputations with rival sectaries, and many are the references to 



138 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


such disputations proclaimed by the flying of flags and carried 
on with much gesticulation of the hands. The rival sects are not 
named, but they were doubtless Jainism and Buddhism which 
became more prominent in the succeeding age. From all accounts 
Hinduism was the dominant creed in this age. The worship of 
Subramanya (Murugan) and the legendary achievements of that 
deity are often alluded to. Other members of the pantheon were 
Siva, Balarama, Vishnu, Krishna, Ardhanarisvara, and Anantasayi. 
The details of Vishnu worship with tulasi (basil) and bell are set 
forth in the Padirruppattu , and the custom is mentioned of people 
starving in the temple to invoke the grace of the god. Women 
went with their children to offer worship in the temples in the 
evenings. Asceticism was honoured and tridandi (triple staff) 
ascetics are particularly mentioned. The worship of Murugan 
was of ancient origin and embodied some indigenous features like 
the velanadal , an ecstatic dance in his honour. Indra also came 
in for special worship on the occasion of his annual festival held 
in Puhar. The epic poems of the post-Sangam period show that 
music and dancing were intertwined with religious rites from early 
times, the worship of Korravai by the hunters, of Krishna by the 
shepherdesses and of Murugan by the kuravas being the most 
striking instances of this. A temple of Sarasvati is mentioned in 
•the Manimekalai which also alludes to the kdpdlikas , an austere 
class of &aiva ascetics. Belief in reincarnation, the effects of karma 
in successive births and the power of fate was the common basis* 
of all religion in India, and this was generally accepted in the Tamil 
country also. The joyous faith in good living that generally ani- 
mates the poems of the Sangam age gradually gives place to the 
pessimistic outlook on life that is, in the last resort, traceable to 
the emphasis laid by Buddhism on the sorrows of life and its 
doctrine that the only way of escape was the repression of the will 
to live. This note of sadness, already noticeable in some poems 
towards the close of the 3angam age, becomes more pronounced 
in the setting of the Manimekalai which contains a round denun- 
ciation of the fools who, not meditating upon the ruthlessness of 
death, spend their time in the blind enjoyment of carnal pleasures. 

A long historical night ensues after the close of the £angam age. 
We know little of the period of more than three centuries that 
followed. When the curtain rises again towards the close of the 
sixth century a.d. we find that a mysterious and ubiquitous enemy 



THE AGE OF THE &ANGAM AND AFTER 139* 


of civilization, the evil rulers called Kalabhras, have come and 
upset the established political order which was restored only by 
their defeat at the hands of the Pandyas and Pallavas as well as 
the Chalukyas of Badami. Of the Kalabhras we have as yet no 
definite knowledge; from some Buddhist books we hear of a certain 
Accutavikkanta of the Kalabhrakula during whose reign Buddhist 
monasteries and authors enjoyed much patronage in the Chola 
country. Late literary tradition in Tamil avers that he kept in 
confinement the three Tamil kings — the Chera, Chola and Pandya. 
Some songs about him are quoted by Amitasagara, a Jaina gram- 
marian of Tamil of the tenth century a.d. Possibly Accuta was 
himself a Buddhist, and the political revolution which the 
Kalabhras effected was provoked by religious antagonism. At 
any rate the Kalabhras are roundly denounced as evil kings 
( kali-arasar ) who uprooted many adhirajas and abrogated brahma - 
deya rights; there was no love lost between these interlopers and 
the people of the lands they overran. The Cholas disappeared 
from the Tamil land almost completely in this debacle, though a 
branch of them can be traced towards the close of the period in 
Rayalaseema — the Telugu-Chodas, whose kingdom is mentioned 
by Yuan Chwang in the seventh century a.d. 

The upset of the existing order due to the Kalabhras must have 
affected the Chera country as well, though there is little evidence 
on this country in this period apart from the late legends of the 
Keralotpatti and Keralamdhatmyam . According to these, the 
rulers of the land had to be imported from neighbouring countries,, 
and they assumed the title of Perumal. Possibly the Vaishnava 
saint Kulasekhara Alvar was one of these Perumals; in his poems 
he claims sovereignty over Chera, Chola and Pandya, besides the 
Kongu country and Kolli mountain. His age cannot be deter- 
mined with any certainty, though a date as early as the sixth 
century has been suggested for him, on the ground that at no later 
period could his claim to rule over Pandya and Chola be plausible. 
It seems more likely, however, that this claim was merely 
rhetorical, and that he belonged to a much later time, say the 
ninth century a.d. 

This dark period marked by the ascendancy of Buddhism, and 
probably also of Jainism, was characterized also by great literary 
activity in Tamil, Most of the works grouped under the head 
4 The Eighteen Minor Works * were written during this period as

also the Silappadikaram, Manimekalai and other works. Many of 
the authors were the votaries of the ‘ heretical ’ sects.

For a period of 300 years from the middle of the sixth century 
a.d., the history of South India is virtually the story of mutual 
conflict among three powers each seeking constantly to extend its 
empire at the expense of its neighbours. The three powers were 
the Chalukyas of Badami, the Pallavas of Kanchl and the Pandyas 
of Madura. All of them rose into prominence in the sixth cen- 
tury; but the Chalukyas quit the stage about a century earlier than 
the two other powers, their place on the political map being more 
or less exactly filled from the middle of the eighth century by their 
successors, the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta (Malkhed). Besides 
the main house of Badami, the Chalukyas established themselves 
in two other branches, more or less independent of the main line: 
the Chalukyas of Lata, and the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi. 
Together with the Gangas of Mysore, the Eastern Chalukyas took 
sides in the conflicts of the three kingdoms, sometimes with decisive 
results. The Cholas of the Tamil country had practically dis- 
appeared except that a line of Telugu rulers bearing their name 
and claiming a traditional connexion with their capital at Uraiyur 
ruled in the area now known as Rayalaseema. 



it 


142 A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 

Political conflict was, however, no obstacle to cultural growth. 
A vast and many-sided religious revival checked the spread of 
Jainism and Buddhism, created a great volume of soul-stirring 
devotional literature and advanced philosophic speculation. Under 
the stimulus of this religious impulse, remarkable advances were 
registered in architecture, sculpture, painting and music. All these 
influences overflowed into the numerous Hindu colonies across 
the sea. 



SOUTH INDIA: a.d. 500-850 

The founder of the Chalukya line was Pulakesin I. The name 
probably means ‘ the great lion \ He fortified the hill near Badami 
into a strong fortress in 543-4, and declared his independence by 



CONFLICT OF THREE EMPIRES 


143 


performing a horse sacrifice. The new fortress stood on a defen- 
sible eminence within three miles of the Malaprabha river. Among 
the hills to the east is Mahakuta; five miles farther in the same 
direction and on the river is Pattadakal, and another eight miles 
down the river is Aihole — all witnessing to the age of Chalukyan 
ascendancy by their temples and inscriptions. Pulakesin’s son 
Kirtivarman I (566-7) expanded the kingdom by wars against the 
Kadambas of Banavasi, the Mauryas of Konkan, and the Nalas 
who probably ruled over a fair-sized kingdom in the region of 
Bastar and the Jeypore Agency. The conquest of Konkan brought 
the important port of Goa, then known as Revatidvipa, into the 
growing empire. At KIrtivarman’s death (597-8), his son Pulakesin II 
was too young to rule, so his uncle Mangalesa, KIrtivarman’s 
brother, held sway as regent. Mangalesa continued the policy of 
expansion and invaded the territory of Kalachuri Buddharaja whose 
dominion extended over Gujarat, Khandesh and Malwa. This 
campaign was more of the nature of a raid, so that, while it brought 
in much booty, it made but little addition of territory. He sup- 
pressed a rebellion on the part of the Governor of Revatidvipa 
{Goa) and re-established Chalukyan power in the Konkan. Instead 
of surrendering the throne when Pulakesin II came of age, 
Mangalesa sought to prolong his rule with a view to handing over 
the kingdom to his own son in due course. Pulakesin therefore 
left the court and by his own martial prowess waged war on 
Mangalesa with the support of loyal friends, killed him in battle 
and proclaimed himself king (609-10). This civil war shook the 
young kingdom of the Chalukyas and enemies began to appear 
on all sides. Pulakesin II soon proved himself one of the ablest 
monarchs of the line. He defeated the rebel Appayika in a battle 
north of the Bhimarathi river and received his confederate Govinda 
into favour when he offered submission. He attacked and over- 
threw the Kadamba capital Banavasi, while the Alupas of South 
Canara and the Gangas of Mysore were compelled to acknowledge 
his suzerainty. The Ganga ruler Durvinlta gave one of his 
daughters in marriage to Pulakesin, and she became the mother 
of Vikramaditya I. The Mauryas of northern Konkan were once 
more reduced to submission by a successful attack on their capital 
Puri (on the island of Elephanta), the Lakshml of the western 
ocean. The fame of Pulakesin’s arms and fear of the growing 
power of Sri Harsha in Northern India induced the Latas, Malavas 



144 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


and Gurjaras to offer their submission one after another to 
Pulakesin. The northern frontier of the Chalukyan empire -was- 
thus extended at one bound to the river MahL When Harsha 
sought to invade the Deccan, Pulakesin met and heavily defeated 
him on the banks of the Narmada, capturing many elephants — 
the only check in Harsha’s otherwise victorious career. All these 
achievements were in the first three or four years of Pulakesin’s 
reign. 

Pulakesin then made his younger brother Vishnuvardhana yuva~ 
raja and, leaving him in charge of the capital, he started on an 
extensive campaign of conquest in the eastern Deccan. Southern 
Kosala and Kalinga made their submission first. Pishtapura was- 
then attacked and reduced. In a hard-fought battle on the shores 
of the Kunala (Colair) lake, the power of the Vishnukundins was 
broken and subdued. Then came the turn of the Pallavas whose 
rise we must now trace before proceeding further. 

The political confusion that reigned in the Tamil country after 
the incursion of the Kalabhras was ended in the last quarter of 
the sixth century by the activities of two monarchs, the Pallava 
Simhavishnu and the Pandya Kadungon with their capitals at 
Kanchl and Madura respectively. Simhavishnu not only sup- 
pressed the Kalabhras but conquered the whole country up to the 
Kaveri and even came into conflict with the Pandyas and the ruler 
of Ceylon. He was a worshipper of Vishnu and had the title 
Avanisimha (lion of the earth). His portrait and that of his son 
Mahendravarman I are found sculptured in relief in the Varaha. 
cave at Mamallapuram (Mahabalipuram). He may be taken to 
have ruled between 575-600. He was followed by Mahendra- 
varman I, a many-sided genius, great alike in war and in peace. 
He had many titles such as Mattavilasa, Vicitra-citta and Guna- 
bhara. He was a great builder, a poet and a musician. He 
professed Jainism for a time but discarded it in favour of Saivism 
under the influence of Appar. At the beginning of his reign 
(600-30), as in that of his father, Pallava rule extended in the north 
up to and perhaps a little beyond the river Krishna and bordered 
on the kingdom of the Vishnukundins. 

After their overthrow, Pulakesin II sought to measure his 
strength against Mahendravarman I whose growing power rivalled 
his own. His forces penetrated far into the Pallava territory and 
were not stopped until they reached Pullalur, only fifteen miles 



CONFLICT OF THREE EMPIRES 


145 


north of the Pallava capital. There a pitched battle was fought, 
and although Mabendravarman was able to save his capital he 
lost the northern provinces to his enemy. This was the beginning 
of the long-drawn-out conflict between the Chalukyas and 
the Pallavas. 

After his return (c. 621) Pulakesin sent Vishnuvardhana to rule 
over the Andhra country as viceroy and complete the process of 
conquest, which he did by about 631. Then, with his brother’s 
approval, he founded a dynasty of rulers who held sway in the 
Telugu country for over five centuries thereafter. 

Pulakesin sent an embassy to the Persian court of Khusru II in 
625-6 and perhaps this courtesy was returned. 

Pulakesin’s ambition prompted him to undertake another ex- 
pedition against the Pallavas in the hope of achieving more decisive 
results. Mahendravarman had quitted the stage and his son Nara- 
simhavarman I Mahamalla (630-68) had begun his rule. Pulakesin 
began his campaign by an attack on the Banas who were ruling in 
Rayalaseema as feudatories of the Pallavas. After overrunning 
their kingdom he invaded the Pallava territory proper and once 
more threatened the capital. But Narasimhavarman defeated the 
Chalukyas in several battles including one at Manimangala about 
20 miles to the east of Kanchipuram. In these battles Narasimha 
was ably assisted by a Ceylonese prince, Manavarma, whom he 
afterwards helped to gain the throne of Ceylon. Pulakesin’s ex- 
pedition was thus a failure and was soon followed by terrible 
retribution. Narasimhavarman, encouraged by his successes, in- 
vaded the Chalukya country in force and, rapidly advancing to 
the capital, Badami, made himself master of the city and its 
fortress. Pulakesin II must have fallen fighting, and following 
upon his death his kingdom was threatened with disruption. 
Narasimha’s occupation of the Chalukya capital is attested to by 
his title Vatapikonda and by an inscription engraved on a rock 
behind the teikple of Mallijcaijunadeva in Badami during the 
thirteenth year of his reign. 

This was indeed a crisis in the history of the Chalukyan king- 
dom. The feudatories of the empire declared their independence 
and even two of Pulakesin’s sons who were ruling as viceroys 
sought to follow the same course. Another son, however, Vikra- 
maditya — aided by his maternal grandfather, the Ganga Durvinita, 
set himself the task of repelling the Pallava invasion and restoring

the unity of his father’s empire. He compelled Narasimhavarman 
to retire from Badami and defeated his brothers and those other 
feudatories who wanted to divide the empire among themselves. 
He then proclaimed himself king of the restored kingdom in 654-5 
and rewarded his younger brother, Jayasimhavarman, who had 
stood by him all along, with the viceroyalty of Lata or southern 
Gujarat. 

The Pallava monarch must have returned to his capital soon 
after 642. Thereafter he sent two naval expeditions to Ceylon to 
aid Manavarma. Though the second expedition was successful 
and Manavarma put the rival king to death and captured 
Anuradhapura, he was later once more driven into exile and he 
sought refuge in the Pallava court — probably after the death of 
N arasimhavarman . 

Narasimhavarman is said to have vanquished the Cholas, Cheras 
and Kalabhras as well as the Pandyas, but no details of these battles 
are known. There can be no doubt, however, that under him the 
Pallava power attained a strength and prestige which it had not 
known since its revival under Simhavishnu (575-600). He was a 
great builder, and Mamallapuram, the chief port of the kingdom, 
was greatly embellished in his day. Yuan Chwang travelled in his 
kingdom as well as in that of Pulakesin II a little before his expe- 
dition against Badami and has left us an interesting account of 
what he saw. Narasimhavarman died about 668, and was succeed- 
ed by his son Mahendravarman II, who in his short reign came 
into conflict with Vikramaditya I. Mahendravarman was followed 
in his turn by his son, Paramesvaravarman I, in whose reign 
Chalukya Vikramaditya renewed his conflict, having secured the 
alliance of the contemporary Pandya ruler Arikesari Parankusa 
Maravarman I (670-700). 

A word must now be said about the rise of the Pandya kingdom. 
It started on its career about the same time as the Pallava, but we 
know little of the history of its first two monarchs, Kadungon 
(590-620) and his son Maravarman Avanisujamani (620-45). There 
is no doubt, however, that they put an end to Kalabhra rule in 
their part of the country and revived the Pandya power. The 
third, Sendan or Jayantavarman, imposed his rule on the Chera 
country and took to himself the title Vanavan. His son Arikesari 
Maravarman (670-700) was a great soldier who fought many battles 
for the extension of Pandya power, some of them against his Pallava 



CONFLICT OF THREE EMPIRES 147 

contemporary. It is very probable that he entered into an alliance 
with the Pallavas’ enemy on the other side, namely Chalukya 
Vikramaditya I. 

That ruler, after rescuing his country from the invasion of Nara- 
simhavarman I and consolidating his power, turned to the task of 
avenging the fate of his father. Hostilities began even in the reign 
of Mahendravarman II, who sustained defeat somewhere in the 
Mysore country; and early in the reign of Paramesvaravarman, 
Vikramaditya advanced to the neighbourhood of Kanchipuram, so 
that Paramesvaravarman had to seek refuge in flight. Vikra- 
maditya marched to the banks of the Kaveri and encamped at 
Uraiyur where he probably effected a junction with his ally, the 
Pandya king. From his exile Paramesvaravarman gathered a large 
army and offered battle at Vilande to Bhuvikrama, the Ganga ally 
of Vikramaditya. The battle went against him and he lost to his 
enemy a valued crown jewel, the necklace which contained the gem 
* Ugrodaya \ Nothing daunted, he managed to send a counter- 
expedition into the Chalukya kingdom in order to divert the 
attention of his enemy. He then met the invading forces in battle 
at Peruvalanallur, two miles north-west of Uraiyur, and inflicted a 
decisive defeat on them. The expeditionary force returned with 
much booty after encounters with Vinayaditya and Vijayaditya, 
the son and grandson of Vikramaditya who had to leave the 
Pallava territory and retire to his own kingdom. 

There was a lull in the conflict between the Chalukyas and 
Pallavas during the generally peaceful and prosperous reign of 
Vikramaditya’ s son, Vinayaditya (681-96). Vinayaditya led an 
expedition into Northern India, in which his son Vijayaditya greatly 
distinguished himself, but that is all. Vijayaditya’s was the longest 
reign (696-733) of the Badami period and perhaps also the most 
prosperous and peaceful. It was marked by great activity in 
temple-building. He was followed by his son Vikramaditya II 
{733-44) in the first years of whose reign the Arabs who had 
established themselves in Sind and conquered the neighbouring 
lands made a push into the Deccan, but were stopped effectively 
by Pulakesin, a son of that Jayasimhavarman who had stood by 
his brother, Vikramaditya I. Vikramaditya II so appreciated the

Chalukya emperor, also co-operated in the war against the Arabs 
and earned the appreciation of his suzerain. 

The chief interest of the reign of Vikramaditya II lies in his wars 
with the Pallavas. He is said to have overrun Kanchi three times 
— which brings us back to the Pallavas. 

After his victory against Vikramaditya I, Paramesvaravarman I 
continued to rule in Kanchi until his death which occurred about 
680, and was succeeded by his son Narasimhavarman II Rajasimha 
(680-720). His long reign, like the reigns of his Chalukya con- 
temporaries, was marked by peace and prosperity and by the 
construction of large and beautiful temples like the Kailasanatha 
at Kanchipuram and the Shore temple at Mamallapuram. It was 
also marked by literary activity, the great rhetorician Dandin 
probably spending many years at his court. Rajasimha sent 
embassies to China and maritime trade flourished greatly in his 
time. He was followed by his son Paramesvaravarman II (720-31),. 
who perhaps built the Siva temple at Tiruvadi which bears an 
inscription of his reign but has been repaired many times over. 

Towards the end of his reign Paramesvaravarman’s capital was 
attacked by the Chalukya crown prince Vikramaditya II assisted 
by the Ganga prince Ereyappa, son of Sripurusha. The Pallava 
ruler had to purchase peace at a heavy price. His attempt at 
retaliation against Sripurusha ended in disaster; he was killed in 
battle at Vijande by the Ganga ruler, who seized the royal Pallava 
umbrella together with the title Permanadi. 

The death of Paramesvaravarman led to a crisis in the kingdom. 
There was no one to succeed him in the direct line and the officials 
of the capital acting with the ghatikd (college of learned brahmins) 
and the people chose a prince from a collateral branch, Nandi- 
varman II, the son of Hiranyavarman. This becomes clear 
from the labels beneath the sculptured panels in the Vaikuntha 
Perumal temple which narrate the history of the Pallavas from their 
legendary origin to the accession of Nandivarman. They base the 
choice of Nandivarman on the fact of his being of pure descent 
both on his father’s and mother’s side. There were apparently 
other princes of sorts ready to contest Nandivarman’s accession. 
One of them apparently lost his life opposing Nandivarman’s entry 
into Kanchi, while another Chitramaya, as seen from other inscrip- 
tions, gained some support not only within the kingdom, but of the 
Pandya ruler as well. 



CONFLICT OF THREE EMPIRES

In the Pandya kingdom, Arikesari Parankusa was succeeded by 
his son Koccadaiyan, also called Ranadhlra ( c . 700-30). This 
monarch waged aggressive wars against his neighbours and extend- 
ed the Pandya power into the Kongu country. He also suppressed 
a revolt of the mountain chieftain Ay who occupied the hilly 
country between Tirunelveli and Travancore. His reign ended 
about 730, and his son Maravarman Rajasimha I succeeded him. 
Early in his reign Rajasimha espoused the cause of Chitramaya, and 
after inflicting a number of defeats on Nandivarman Pallavamalla 
besieged him in a place called Nandigrama, i.e., Nandipuram, 
near Kumbakonam. The able Pallava general Udayacandra, who 
encountered the Pandya forces in many battles, raised the siege of 
Nandigrama, beheaded Chitramaya, and thus made the Pallava 
throne secure for his monarch. He also dealt with other enemies 
of Pallavamalla like the Sahara king Udayana and the Nishada 
chieftain Prithivlvyaghra who were probably acting in collusion 
with the Chalukya, Vikramaditya II. The invasion of Vikramaditya 
(c. 740), in which his Ganga feudatory Sripurusha co-operated, was 
indeed the greatest danger that threatened the kingdom of Pallava- 
malla in the early years of his long reign. But Vikramaditya 
behaved on the whole very considerately; though he defeated 
Nandivarman and occupied his capital for a time, he did no damage 
to the city, pleased the people by his liberal gifts and returned to 
the Kailasanatha and all other temples the heaps of gold that 
belonged to them. After recording these transactions in a Kannada 
inscription engraved on a pillar in Kailasanatha and thus wiping 
out the disgrace that had befallen the Chalukyas by the occupation 
of Badami by Narasimhavarman I, Vikramaditya withdrew to his 
own country leaving the Pallava ruler to resume charge of his 
kingdom. Towards the end of his reign Vikramaditya sent out 
another expedition against the Pallava under his son KIrtivarman, 
who carried out a successful raid and returned with many elephants 
and much gold and jewellery captured from the enemy. 

Vikramaditya’s reign was also marked by the construction of 
new temples, an activity which was continued by his son KIrti- 
varman II who succeeded him in 744-5. KIrtivarman II and his 
Ganga feudatory Sripurusha came into conflict with the Pandya 
ruler Maravarman Rajasimha I who was extending the Pandya 
power over the Kongu country and beyond. Rajasimha crossed 
the Kaveri and subjugated Malakongam on the borderland between

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


the Tiruchirapalli and Tanjore districts, defeated the Chalukya ruler 
and his feudatory in a big battle at Yenbai and made peace with 
them, accepting the hand of a Ganga princess for his son. 

Klrtivarman II was the last ruler of the Chalukya line of Badami. 
His power was steadily undermined by the activity of the Rashtra- 
kuta prince Dantidurga who was in occupation of Eilora in 742. 
But the main scene of Dantidurga’s early activities lay on the 
banks of the Mahl, Narmada and Mahanadi. He subdued the 
Gurjaras of Malwa, the rulers of Kosala and Kalinga and the 
Telugu-Chodas of the Srisailam country. Above all, he went 
down to Kanchl and, after a demonstration of force, struck up an 
alliance with Nandivarman Pallavamalla to whom he gave his 
daughter Reva in marriage. Having thus deprived Klrtivarman of 
his outlying provinces and strengthened his political position, 
Dantidurga delivered the final assault on Klrtivarman sometime in 
752 or 753 and proclaimed himself the sovereign power in Deccan. 
Klrtivarman continued to rule in an obscure way for two or three 
years more but, as the later inscriptions say, * In his reign the 
rajyasrl of the Chalukyas disappeared from the face of the earth \ 

To return to the reign of Nandivarman II: he led an expedition 
against the Ganga kingdom, defeated Srlpurusha and forced him 
to surrender much wealth and restore the necklace which contained 
the precious gem called ‘ Ugrodaya \ Some territory was also 
taken from the Ganga and handed over to Jayanandivarman, the 
Bana feudatory of Nandivarman. This was perhaps about 775. 
Nandivarman also came into conflict with Jatila Parantaka 
Nedunjadaiyan, alias Varagunamaharaja I (765-815), the son and 
successor of Pandya Rajasimha I. The Pallava forces sustained a 
defeat at Pennagadam on the south bank of the Kaveri river 
(c. 775). 

Pallavamalla sought to restrain the growing power of the Pandya 
king by organizing a confederacy against him. He entered into an 
alliance with the rulers of Kongu and Kerala as well as the Adigai- 
man of i agadur (Dharmapuri). But the Pandya king was equal 
to the occasion, won victories in several battles, put the Adigaiman 
to flight, and captured the king of western Kongu, with many 
elephants, and sent him into confinement at Madura, annexing the 
whole of the Kongu country to the Pandya empire. In the course 
of the war, he also penetrated far into the Pallava country and 
fixed his camp at Arasur on the banks of the Pennar in Tondainad. 



CONFLICT OF THREE EMPIRES 


151 


The coalition against him thus failed utterly, and Nandivarman 
did not succeed in his attempts to check the Pandya. 

Varaguna I had still other successes to his credit. He led an 
expedition into Venad, South Travancore, attacked the strongly 
fortified port of Vilinam and brought the country under his rule. 
He also waged successful war against the Ay chieftain of the inter- 
vening mountainous country who had perhaps been friendly to the 
ruler of Venad. As a result of these wars, Pandya sway extended 
well beyond Tiruchirapalli into the Tanjore, Salem and Coimbatore 
districts, and all that lay south was under him. The expansion 
continued under his son and successor Srimara Srivallabha (815-62) 
who invaded Ceylon in the reign of Sena I (831-51), ravaged the 
northern province and sacked the capital. Eventually Sena made 
terms with the conqueror and the Pandya forces quitted the island. 
Srimara had next to deal with a formidable combination formed 
against him again under the leadership of the Pallavas. We must 
now turn for a while to Pallava history. 

After the failure of his plans against Varaguna, Nandivarman 
Pallavamalla continued to rule till about 795. Pallavamalla was a 
worshipper of Vishnu and a great patron of learning. He renovated 
old temples and built several new ones. Among the latter was the 
Vaikuntha-Perumal temple at Kanchipuram which contains in- 
scribed panels of sculpture portraying the events leading up to the 
accession of Pallavamalla to the throne. The great Vaishnava 
saint Tirumangai Alvar was his contemporary. 

Nandivarman was succeeded by his son Dantivarman 
(c. 795-845). The northern expansion of the Pandya power under 
Varaguna I and Srimara deprived Dantivarman of a considerable 
part of his territory in the south; and in addition, he had to face 
the hostility of the rising power of the Rashtrakutas. It is now 
necessary to trace the history of that power. 

Dantidurga died childless and was succeeded about 756 by his 
uncle Krishna I. He completed the overthrow of the Chalukya 
power and expanded the new kingdom in all directions. He con- 
quered southern Konkan and established the Silara family there as 
a feudatory power. He invaded the Ganga territory, defeated 
Sripurusha (768) and compelled him to acknowledge his suzerainty. 
Against the Eastern Chalukya kingdom of Vengi he dispatched an 
expedition under the crown prince Govinda II to whom Vijayaditya I 
(755-72), ruler of Vengi, made his submission without a fight 



152 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


(769-70). Krishna who built the celebrated Kailasa temple at 
Ellora, was succeeded by Govinda II some time between 772 and 
775. In 777-8, Govinda co-operated with Nandivarman Pallava- 
maila in assisting Sivamara II to gain the Ganga throne against 
the opposition of his brother, Duggamara Ereyappa. Govinda 
was an easygoing monarch and his ambitious brother Dhruva 
planned to seize the throne for himself. Govinda sought the aid 
of the Pallava and the Ganga, and the rulers of Vengi and Malwa; 
but Dhruva defeated them and thus became king. How exactly 
Govinda ended his life is not known. Dhruva’s accession took 
place about 780 and his first task was to punish Govinda’s allies. 
He caught and imprisoned Sivamara II, and levied a tribute of 
elephants from Pallavamalla. He crossed the Vindhyas and drove 
the Gutjara king of Malwa, Vatsaraja by name, into the desert. 
He proceeded against Vengi, and Vishnuvardhana IV had to pur- 
chase peace by parting with some territory besides offering the 
hand of his daughter Silamahadevi to Dhruva. Dhruva followed 
up his success in Malwa by a raid into the Ganges-Jumna doab 
where he met and defeated Dharmapala of Bengal. Towards the 
close of his reign, Dhruva abdicated and made Govinda III, the 
ablest of his sons, emperor. This led to trouble soon after 
Dhruva’s death in 793-4, when Govinda III had to face the hostility 
of his disinherited brothers, particularly that of Kambha, the eldest. 
To gain support, Govinda released Sivamara II from prison, but 
contrary to expectations that monarch threw in his lot with 
Kambha. Single-handed, Govinda defeated the confederacy of 
twelve rulers but used his victory with moderation, even reinstating 
Kambha as viceroy over Gangavadi; while Indra, a younger brother 
of Govinda who had stood by him, was rewarded with the 
viceroyalty of Lata. Sivamara II, however, was again put in 
prison. After putting down opposition at home Govinda III 
carried his arms into Northern India. He inflicted a decisive defeat 
on the Guijara ruler of Malwa, Nagabhata II, and on his ally 
Chandragupta, of unknown identity. Malwa was annexed for a 
time to Lata. Govinda proceeded farther north and received the 
submission of Chakrayudha of Kanauj and his protector Dharma- 
pala. On his return (802) he fixed his camp at Sribhavana on the 
banks of the Narmada where a son was bom to him, the future 
Amoghavarsha I. From Sribhavana, he dashed across the Deccan 
into the Pallava country (803-4). He defeated Dantivarman, entered 



CONFLICT OF THREE EMPIRES

liis capital Kanchi and there received the submission offered by 
an embassy from Ceylon before he retired to the banks of the 
Tungabhadra and fixed his camp at Ramesvara-Z/rr/?#. The rulers 
of Vengi, Vishnuvardhana IV, and his successor Vijayaditya II 
{808), felt the impact of Govinda’s power. Vijayaditya was a 
great fighter who earned for himself the title Narendramrigaraja 
(Lion among Kings). Govinda III created trouble for him by 
supporting his half-brother Bhima Saluki’s rival claims to the 
throne of Vengi. One of the greatest monarchs of the line, 
Govinda’s achievements go far to justify the claim of his court- 
poets that after his birth the Rashtrakutas became as unassailable 
us the Yadavas after the birth of Sri Krishna. 

To return to affairs farther south; during his fairly long reign, 
the Pallava Dantivarman found himself unable to resist the aggres- 
sion of the Pandyas from the south or even hold his own against 
the Rashtrakutas in the north. He was followed by his son 
Nandivarman III (844-66), a much abler monarch than his father, 
who organized a strong confederacy against his aggressive Pandya 
-contemporary Srimara Srivallabha, and early in his reign inflict- 
ed a severe defeat on the Pandya at Tellaru in the Wandiwash 
taluk of the North Arcot district. His allies were the Gangas, the 
Cholas, and even the Rashtrakutas. The location of the field of 
battle shows the extent to which Pandya aggression had developed, 
and this doubtless made it easy for Nandivarman to find support. 
The victory of Tellaru was a turning point. It gave Nandi the 
permanent title 4 Teflarerinda * and was followed up by further 
successes as a result of which the Pandya forces were rolled back 
into their home country, and the Pallava army advanced as far as 
the banks of the Vaigai, in the heart of the Pandya kingdom. 

Later, however, Srimara recovered his strength and about 859 
was able to defeat Nandivarman and his confederates in a battle 
near Kumbakonam. 

Nandivarman III was undoubtedly too great a monarch to suffer 
by this defeat. Not only did he restore the Pallava power to its 
former glory, but he was also a liberal patron of literature and the 
arts in general. He is also said to have maintained a powerful 
fleet: a Tamil inscription at Takua-pa in Siam, on the opposite 
-coast of the Bay, attests to his overseas connexions by mentioning 
a Vishnu temple and a tank called Avaninaranam after one of his 
titles. Nandivarman was succeeded by his son Nripatunga who 



154 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


had become yumraja about 860, and whose mother was a Rashtra- 
kuta princess. Soon after his accession, the young Pallava ruler 
avenged the defeat of his father at Kumbakonam by a decisive 
victory against the Pandyas in a battle on the banks of the river 
Arisil, a branch of the Kaveri which enters the sea at Karaikkal. 

Srimara’s defeat at Arisil was not an isolated event. His aggres- 
sive campaigns which had earned for him the title Paracakrakolahala 
(Confounder of the Circle of his Enemies) naturally roused the 
hostility of his neighbours. Sena II (851-85) of Ceylon, nephew 
and successor of Sena I, had allied himself with the Pallavas and 
with a pretender to the Pandya throne. He sent an expedition 
into the Madura kingdom at about the same time as the battle of 
Arisil and the invasion was a complete success. The capital was 
sacked, Srimara died of his wounds, and his son Varagunavarman II 
was enthroned in his place by the Sinhalese commander-in- 
chief (862). 

In the Rashtrakuta kingdom Govinda III was succeeded (814),, 
by his young son Amoghavarsha, also called Nripatunga. The 
early years of the boy-king’s reign were full of trouble. There 
was a widespread rebellion of the officials supported by the Eastern 
Chalukya Vijayaditya II and the Ganga Racamalla I. Amogha- 
varsha, however, found a loyal ally and strong protector in his 
cousin Karka of Lata ; the rebellion was suppressed and Amogha- 
varsha was secure on his throne before 821. At no time during 
his long reign of 64 years can peace be said to have prevailed all 
over his extensive dominions. With the Eastern Chalukyas war 
broke out again about 850 when Gunaga Vijayaditya III, the 
grandson of Vijayaditya II and one of the ablest monarchs of his 
line, made a strenuous effort to free the Vengi kingdom from the 
Rashtrakutas. Amoghavarsha won a decisive victory in the 
sanguinary battle of Vlngavalli near Stambhapuri (Kambham) in 
the Kurnool district, whereafter Gunaga Vijayaditya submitted and 
remained loyal for the rest of Amoghavarsha’s reign. The Ganga 
Eraya, known as also Nitimarga and Ranavikrama (837-70), son of 
Racamalla I, revolted soon after and was joined by other feuda- 
tories. Amoghavarsha’s general Bankesa dealt with them success- 
fully; but before he could complete his task Amoghavarsha recalled 
him to the capital where other disturbances had arisen, in which 
the crown prince Krishna himself was involved, as well as the ruler 
of Lata, Dhruva I, son of that Karka who had so ably protected 



CONFLICT OF THREE EMPIRES 


1 55 


Amoghavarsha earlier. Bankesa killed Dhruva I in battle and 
continued the war with his son Akalavarsha and his grandson 
Dhruva II. Dhruva II was, however, threatened in his rear by 
the Gurjara ruler Mihira Bhoja, and some of his own kinsmen had 
turned hostile to him at home. He thus thought it wise to compose 
his quarrel with Amoghavarsha in 860, and was thereby enabled to 
thwart the designs of the Gurjara and his hostile kinsmen, so that 
we find him secure on his throne again in 867. 

After the recall of Bankesa, the war against the rebels in the 
Ganga kingdom was entrusted to Gunaga Vijayaditya who led an 
expedition into the Nolamba kingdom as its ruler Nolambadhiraja I, 
also called Mangi, had joined the rebellion. Mangi was slain in 
battle and the road to Gangavadi opened up. Then the Ganga 
army was beaten in its turn and NItimarga obliged to make peace. 

By temperament Amoghavarsha was a religious man who loved 
literature more than fighting. He is said to have retired from his 
court more than once to spend time in the company of Jaina 
monks. It is doubtful, however, whether he formally renounced 
Hinduism, though a small Jaina catechism entitled Prasnottara - 
ratna-mdlika is attributed to him. He was himself an author and 
a liberal patron of authors. He is also celebrated as the maker of 
the city of Manyakheta, the city built to excel that of Indra. His 
palace was full of fine workmanship and included an extensive 
apartment for the royal princesses and a tank. Amoghavarsha 
was succeeded by Krishna II (880). 

The history of the Chera country during this period is still 
obscure. Apparently the land continued under the Perumals,. 
though several rulers of different dynasties claim to have overrun 
Kerala, generally a vague assertion not supported by tangible 
evidence. We have seen that Pallava Narasimhavarman I claimed 
victory over the Cheras as also the Pandya Sendan. Nandivarman II 
Pallavamalla allied himself with the ruler of Kerala against his 
Pandyan contemporary, Varaguna I. Other Pallava rulers like 
Simhavishnu and Nandivarman III also claim suzerainty over 
Kerala. Cultural contact between the Chera country and the 
Pallava court is rather well attested. The Mattavilasa of Mahendra- 
varman became one of the favourite theatricals of the Chakkiyar, 
the hereditary play-actors of Malabar. In his Avcmtisundari 
Kathasara Dandin reveals a vivid knowledge of Kerala and refers 
to several learned brahmins of Kerala who visite^i Kanchi while 


156 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


he was in the Pallava Court. Among the Pandyas, besides Sendan, 
almost every other ruler claims success against the Chera, as do 
also Pulakesin II, Vikramaditya I, Vikramaditya II and Kirti- 
varman II among the Badami Chalukyas, and Dantidurga, 
Cfovinda III and Krishna III among the Rashtrakutas. 

One of the latest Perumals of the period was the celebrated 
Cheraman Perumal, end of the eighth and early ninth century, 
whose history is much overlaid by legend. We may doubt the 
authenticity of the story of his conversion to Islam and his 
pilgrimage to Mecca. He must have been a devoutly religious 
man as the Jains, Christians, and &aivites, besides Muslims, 
claim him as one of their fold. His relation to Sundaramurti, 
according to Saiva legend, will be noticed later. He may 
have renounced the world, and effected a partition of his realm 
among his relatives or vassals before doing so. He seems to have 
vanished somehow about a.d. 825, the epoch of the Kollam era. 
But whether that era commemorates Cheraman’s partition of 
Kerala or Sankaracharya’s imposition of his religious prescriptions 
on that country, or the establishment of the Jewish merchant 
community in Kollam (Quilon) — other possibilities have also been 
suggested — cannot be determined yet. There are epigraphical 
references which connect the era both with the appearance and the 
destruction of Kollam. 

In concluding the political history of the period we may note 
that Kalinga was throughout under the rule of the line of Eastern 
Gangas, who in spite of their name have no apparent connexion in 
this period with the Gangas of Mysore. They dated their inscrip- 
tions in an era of their own, beginning with the equivalent of 
a.d. 498. Their external contacts were few, though sometimes the 
politics of the Telugu country to the south under the Vishnu- 
kundins and their successors, the Eastern Chalukyas, occasionally 
forced itself on their attention. They made their submission to 
Pulakesin II ( c . 620) when he invaded the eastern Deccan and later 
perhaps also to the Rashtrakuta Dantidurga (c. 750). But to 
judge from their grants they generally led a peaceful existence 
without disturbing their neighbours or being troubled by them. 

In proceeding to sketch the polity of the period, emphasis should 
be laid, at the outset, on certain fundamental characteristics in the 
Indian attitude to political organization in ancient times. First, 
they looked to ^the state for very little. The ruler was expected 



CONFLICT OF THREE EMPIRES 


157 


to uphold the existing social order and protect it from internal 
trouble and foreign invasion, and receive as his wage the taxes 
paid by the people, particularly a sixth part of the produce of the 
land. The social order itself had its roots elsewhere — in revelation 
(sruti) y tradition (smriti), and the practice of the elite (dear a). The 
ruler had ordinarily little control over the numerous social, 
economic and religious concerns of the people, except by way of 
dispensing justice when disputes were brought before him or his 
courts. The details of the daily life of the people were looked 
after by numberless autonomous groups and associations bound 
by ties of locality, caste, occupation, or religious persuasion. These 
groups generally followed custom and ancient practice though they 
were by no means unwilling to try new methods should occasion 
demand it. Each group had its own constitution, generally well- 
understood by its members, and flexible enough for meeting new 
situations. There was usually a general assembly which met rarely* 
except perhaps once a year on some definite festive or ceremonial 
occasion, and an executive body in charge of the daily routine. 
The executive was often chosen by lot from among persons possess- 
ing certain prescribed qualifications. Decision by majority of 
votes was not unknown, but usually the aim was to reach 
unanimous and integrated decisions by reconciling the different 
interests and points of view. Guilds of merchants like the Nana- 
desis, the Manigramam and the Five Hundred of Ayyavole* 
associations of craftsmen, artisans and manufacturers like the 
braziers, oil-mongers and weavers, and of students, ascetics, temple 
servants, priests, and so on, besides the territorial assemblies of 
the village and higher divisions — all functioned more or less inde- 
pendently of the government of the ruler. 

Secondly, the duty of protecting society was cast by theory on 
a special class, the Kshatriyas, and by a natural and easy transition 
anyone who felt equal to the task of undertaking the rule of a 
particular area and did not hesitate to do so was more or less 
readily accepted as the ruler. Each successful adventurer became 
a king and gained respectability by maintaining a liberal court* 
patronizing learning and the arts, and causing prasastis (praises) 
to be composed in honour of himself and his family. Moreover, 
aggrandizement was the recognized duty of the ruler; he had to- 
be a vijigfshu (one who wishes to conquer) and the general accept- 
ance of this ideal led to frequent wars and skirmishes resulting iu 



158 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


■changes in the relative precedence of the different powers involved. 
Lastly, and as a consequence of these two factors, political changes 
did not have in India such profound effects on the structure of 
society and civilization as elsewhere, although the establishment 
and the continued prosperity of an empire often, indeed, meant an 
era of high endeavour and achievement in literature and the arts. 

The organization which made for the continuity of life and 
tradition, held society together, and carried it safe through the 
storms and turmoils of political revolution was the autonomous, 
self-sufficient village. It was the primary cell of the body politic, 
and the vitality of its institutions is well-attested by hundreds of 
inscriptions from all parts of the country. Usually, it comprised 
a number of families, each occupying a house of its own in the 
residential quarter of the village, owning its own share of the arable 
land, and enjoying privileges like the right to graze cattle and 
gather firewood in the waste land and forest lying round about 
and held in common by the villagers as a body. A Pallava grant 
mentions some land in a village as the property of the king, which 
goes directly against the view sometimes expressed that all land 
belonged to the king in the ancient Indian State. A careful record 
of the boundaries of a village and of the individual estates in it was 
maintained. The villagers met periodically to consider matters of 
-common concern and for the settlement of disputes and the 
administration of justice. Everywhere rural administration grew 
from timid and tentative improvisations to the more elaborate and 
complicated machinery of committees and officials that we find 
described in the Chola inscriptions of the tenth and eleventh 
centuries, and in this evolution the Tamil country appears to have 
been more progressive than the rest of South India. The village 
had a headman, variously called mutuda , kilan , gramabhojaka and 
so on, who was its leader and mediator with the royal government. 
How he was appointed and whether the office was hereditary 
cannot be determined. The village elders are also particularly 
mentioned besides the headmen and the assembly. 

From the eighth and ninth centuries a.d. three types of village 
assemblies are traceable in Tamil inscriptions, namely, the ur , the 
sabha, and the nagaram. The ur was the common type which 
included all classes of people who held the land in the village. 
The sabha was an exclusively brahmin assembly of villages given 
as gifts to brahmins where all the land belonged to them. The 


CONFLICT OF THREE EMPIRES 


159 


nagaram was quite another type pertaining to localities where 
traders and merchants were in a dominant position. In many 
instances the different types existed side by side in the same locality. 
Whenever necessary, there was mutual consultation among these 
different assemblies and other local associations, and the general 
rule was to consult all the interests concerned in a matter before a 
decision was taken on it. The village assembly regulated irrigation 
rights, administered charitable endowments, maintained tanks 
and roads and managed the affairs of temples, either directly or 
by means of executive officers and committees working under it. 
It also made rules for regulating its own procedure. 

In the Deccan we come across many references to the mahdjanas 
of villages who were in charge of the local administration under 
the leadership of gamundas (headmen). The royal officials stood 
in closer relation to the working of the village assemblies here than 
in the more autonomous townships of the Tamil country. 

Unless specially exempted, the villages were liable to visits from 
royal officers for digging for salt, the manufacture of sugar and 
the arrest of culprits. They also had to supply draught bulls to 
help the progress of touring officers, besides other amenities such 
as accommodation, beds, boiled rice, milk, curds, grass, fuel, and 
green vegetables, besides free labour on specified public works. 
In addition to the land tax and these occasional demands from 
officials, the people were subjected to a variety of imposts, direct 
and indirect. Houses and professions were taxed, market dues 
and tolls on merchandise moved from place to place were collected, 
besides judicial dues and fines. Arab writers who knew western 
India well thought that the people of India were heavily taxed, so 
that their monarchs might have their treasuries full. To complete 
the picture, we must note that besides these compulsory levies, 
central and local, a number of voluntary imposts for particular 
purposes such as the maintenance of a tank, temple, feeding house, 
college or hospital were undertaken by particular corporations, 
mostly of merchants. 

Above the grama was the administrative division called ahara , 
rashtra , nadu, kottam , or vishaya at different times and places. 
Rashtra and vishaya often figure as two categories, one larger than 
the other. In the Tamil country the larger division was often 
called valanadu or mandalam. The size of these units often 
depended on accidents of history, e.g., Banaraja-vishaya of the 



160

Badami period. In this division also there was an assembly of 
elders and a chief executive official known as desabhdjaka y 
ndttukkon and so on. 

Provincial offices were often held by princes of the royal family. 
This was an advantage when there was unity in the family but 
when differences arose it easily led to civil war and disruption, as 
for instance in the Chalukya empire of Badami during the interval 
between the death of Pulakesin II and the accession of Vikra- 
maditya I. There were groups of officers charged with tho 
maintenance of the peace and securing the safety of life and 
property who went by different names in different kingdoms. 
Local policing was to some extent done by village officials. There 
were also bailiffs {sasana sancarin) who went about the country 
enforcing the execution of the orders of government and the decrees 
of law-courts, and they were aided in the discharge of their duties 
by a constabulary ( bhatas ). We hear also of a superintendent of 
the treasury ( kosadhyaksha ) and officers engaged in the survey and 
assessment of cultivated lands ( nilakkalattdr and adhikari). Lastly 
there were the vdyil ketpar , i.e., hearers of oral orders issued by the 
king, also called rahasyddhikrita. They were the secretaries wha 
attended on the king, listened to his orders, and subsequently wrote 
them out in proper form and had them communicated to the 
officials concerned for proper action. Such orders were called 
rajasravitam under the Chalukyas and the Rashtrakutas. Besides 
village courts and caste and guild panchdyats for the settlement of 
disputes, there were law-courts called adhikaranas or dharmdsanas 
maintained by the central government for the administration of 
justice. They were presided over by state officials assisted by 
advisers learned in the law (, dharmasanabhattas ). A scene in the 
farce Mattavilasa by King Mahendravarman suggests that the 
courts were not altogether free from corruption. In the absence 
of other evidence ordeals ( divya ) were resorted to for proof. 

There is no clear proof of the existence of a regularly constituted 
council of ministers although the mantrimandala (group of 
ministers) took part in the events preceding the coronation of 
Nandivarman II Pallavamalla. 

The king was the head of the state, the fountain of honour,, 
judge, and leader of the armed forces. The early kings in this 
period called themselves dharmamahdrajddhirdjas , in token of their 
active promotion of Vedic dharma as against Buddhism and Jainism 



CONFLICT OF THREE EMPIRES 


161 


which had made much headway in the country in the earlier period, 
but there were Jaina monarchs also, particularly among the Gangas. 
The kings specially favoured the particular religious creed they 
professed but never sought to impose it on all their subjects; rather 
they patronized as a matter of policy all the other creeds. After 
a political revolution, social and economic stability was ensured by 
express proclamations that all pre-existing rights of property and 
the charitable foundations would be respected by the new rulers. 

Succession to the throne was usually hereditary in the eldest 
male line. Princes were educated according to the best standards 
of the time in literature, law, philosophy and the martial arts, and 
trained in administrative positions suited to their capacities and 
tastes. The attempt of Mangalesa to shut Pulakesin II, for whom 
he acted as regent, permanently out of his rights met with a deserv- 
ed failure as public opinion supported Pulakesin. The success of 
Vikramaditya in checking the disruption of the Chalukya empire 
after the death of Pulakesin II has also been noticed above, and 
Vikramaditya was not the eldest son of Pulakesin. The choice of 
Nandivarman II as king from a collateral branch when succession 
failed in the main line may also be recalled. The history of the 
Rashtrakutas and of the Eastern Chalukyas was marred by a 
number of disputed successions and civil wars. Among the latter 
this was accentuated by the interference of the Rashtrakutas. The 
choice of Govinda III for succession by Dhruva led inevitably to 
a civil war started by his eldest son Kambha whose claims had 
been passed over, but the event justified the choice of Govinda 
for rule. 

Each royal family had its own banner ( dhvaja ) and seal ( lanchana ) 
mentioned prominently in their inscriptions. The royal palace was 
maintained in great state, and elephants and horses captured in 
war were exhibited at the palace gate. Queens occupied a position 
of equal importance with the king. Sllabhattarika, Dhruva’s wife, 
bore the imperial titles Paramesvari and Paramabhattarikd, made 
grants of land at her own will, and issued her own orders to the 
executive officers of government. Rangapataka, the wife of 
Pallava Rajasimha, interested herself in the construction of the 
Kailasanatha temple. 

Though the king was in theory an autocrat, there were several 
modifying factors in practice. All the members of the royal 
family shared in the administration as far as possible and had 
II

opportunities of influencing the king’s policy. Then there were the 
high officials of the state, some of whose offices were hereditary and 
who commanded the respect of the monarch by their descent, 
ability, and character. The presence of numerous feudatory 
monarchs and the domination of social life by the numerous 
corporate organizations spoken of above went far to mitigate the 
bad consequences of the rule of incapable or misguided sovereigns.

The emergence of the Chola power from obscurity, its rise to an 
imperial position and its conflicts — first with the Rashtrakutas 
from beyond the Tungabhadra and later with their successors, the 
Chalukyas of Kalyani — form the dominant features of the history 
of the next 350 years (850-1200). The whole country south of the 
Tungabhadra was united and held as one state for a period of two 
centuries and more. The power of the new empire was proclaimed 
to the eastern world by the celebrated expedition to the Ganges 
which Rajendra I undertook and by the overthrow after an 
unprecedented naval war of the maritime empire of Sri Vijaya, as 
well as by the repeated ‘ embassies ’ to China. In their wars with 
their enemies across the Tungabhadra, the Cholas were generally 
aided by the Eastern Chalukyas, a dynasty which drew closer and 
closer to the Cholas by marriage alliances until at last, in 1070, 
one ruler occupied both the Chola and the Vengi thrones. The 



THE BALANCE OF TWO EMPIRES 


167 


result of this union was an intensification of the hostility of the 
Western Chalukyas. Towards the close of the twelfth century, the 
two major powers had become thoroughly exhausted by their con- 
flicts and were on their decline. Smaller powers standing in a 
subordinate relation to them were beginning to show new vigour 
and getting ready to take advantage of the weakening of their 
suzerains and proclaim their independence — the Pandyas in the 
extreme south, the Hoysalas in Mysore, and the Yadavas and the 
Kakatlyas in the northern Deccan. 

The Cholas built up a remarkably efficient administrative system 
which combined vigorous central control with a very large measure 
of local autonomy. The great temples of Tanjore and Gangai- 
kondasolapuram as also those of Darasuram and Tribhuvani, 
not to speak of numerous smaller temples elsewhere, attest to 
this day the grandeur and the excellence of Chola architecture 
and sculpture. Other fine arts like painting, music, and dancing 
were liberally patronized. Literature flourished much more than 
ever before. 

The capture of Tanjore by Vijayalaya, some time before 850, 
and his founding of a temple there to the goddess Nishumbha- 
sudinl (Durga) were the first steps in the rise of the Chola power. 
He was perhaps a Pallava feudatory at the time, and he must have 
wrested Tanjore from the Muttarayar who had transferred their 
allegiance from the Pallava to the Pandya. The success of Vijaya- 
laya meant the weakening of Pandya influence north of the Kaveri 
and the strengthening of the power of Nripatunga who by the 
victory of Arisil had already retrieved the Pallava power from the 
disgrace it had suffered from Srimara Srivallabha (see p. 154). 

Now his successor, the Pandya Varagunavarman II, invaded the 
Chola country to check the growing Pallava influence. This 
invasion began well enough, and Idavai, a village on the north 
bank of the Kaveri in the Chola country, was reached (c. 879). 
But Varagunavarman soon came up against a formidable combi- 
nation. The forces that opposed him were led by Aparajita, the 
son of Nripatungavarman, who had become yuvaraja , the Chola 
Aditya I, who had succeeded Vijayalaya about 871, and the Ganga 
Prithvipati I who responded to the call from the Pallava monarch. 
A decisive battle was fought at Sri Purambiyam near Kumbakonam 
in 880, and the Pandyan monarch suffered a crushing defeat, 
although Prithvipati I lost his life in the battle. Aditya I was not 



168 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


only allowed to keep what his father had taken from the Mutta- 
rayar, but some new territory was added to it by his grateful 
Pallava overlord. Aditya I, however, did not rest content with a 
subordinate position. He planned and carried out the overthrow 
of the effete power of his suzerain. He invaded Tondaimandalam, 
and in a battle that ensued he pounced upon Aparajita when he 
was mounted on an elephant and slew him. That was the end of 
Pallava rule in Tondainad, and the whole of the Pallava kingdom 
now became Chola territory which henceforth bordered on that of 
the Rashtrakutas (897). The Ganga Prithvipati H, grandson of 
Prithvlpati I, soon afterwards acknowledged the suzerainty of 
Aditya. Aditya next conquered the Kongu country also, perhaps 
from the Pandya ruler Parantaka Viranarayana (880-900), the 
younger brother and successor of Varagunavarman. Aditya was 
on friendly terms with the contemporary Chera ruler Sthanuravi, 
whose daughter was married to his son Parantaka. He is said to 
have built tall stone temples of §iva on both banks of the Kaveri 
from the Sahyadri to the sea. He died at Tondaimanad near 
Kalahasti, and a temple was erected over his remains by his pious 
son Parantaka, who succeeded him on the throne in 907 and ruled 
for forty-eight years. The best part of his reign was marked by 
increasing success and prosperity, although it ended in disaster and 
gloom brought about by the hostility of the Rashtrakutas which 
began to pursue him almost from the beginning. Soon after his 
accession, as early as 910, he invaded the Pandyan country and 
assumed the title Maduraikonda (‘ Capturer of Madura ’). The 
Pandyan ruler at the time, Maravarman Rajasimha II (900-20), the 
son of Parantaka Viranarayana, appealed for help to Kassapa V, 
ruler of Ceylon, who sent an army to his aid. In due course, 
however, Parantaka defeated the combined armies at the battle of 
Vejlur. Rajasimha had to flee to Ceylon and the Chola conquest 
of the Pandya country was completed soon after. After staying 
in Ceylon for some years, Rajasimha left his crown and all his 
wealth behind, and betook himself to Kerala, the home of his 
mother. Some years later, in the reign of Udaya IV of Ceylon 
(940-53), Parantaka made an unsuccessful attempt to capture the 
insignia of the Pandyan king. His failure was remembered and 
made up for several years later by his powerful descendant Rajendra I. 

While the Pandyan conquest was in progress, Parantaka had to 
encounter an invasion from the Rashtrakuta Krishna II who had 



THE BALANCE OF TWO EMPIRES 


169 


succeeded Amoghavarsha in 880. With the aid of his Lata feuda- 
tory and kinsman, Krishna II successfully resisted an invasion by 
the Gurjara ruler Bhoja I and soon after abolished the viceroyalty 
of Lata, extending his own direct rule into that country. His 
attempt to subjugate the powerful Vengi ruler Gunaga Vijayaditya III 
ended in disaster. He had to seek refuge in the court of his 
father-in-law, the Chedi king Kakkala, whither the Eastern 
Chalukya general Pandaranga pursued him. The war ended when 
Krishna submitted to Vijayaditya, in return for which his capital 
and kingdom were restored to him. He renewed the conflict, 
however, after the death of Gunaga Vijayaditya III, in 892, and 
invaded Vengi before the new ruler Chalukya Bhima I, a nephew 
of Vijayaditya, could celebrate his coronation. Chalukya Bhima 
was defeated and taken prisoner, but soon regained his freedom, 
cleared the country of the Rashtrakuta forces and duly crowned 
himself king. Some years later Krishna made another unsuccess- 
ful attempt to reduce Vengi, but was beaten in two battles 
at Niravadyapura and Peruvanguru. 

One of Krishna’s daughters married the Chola monarch Aditya I 
and bore him a son called Kannaradeva. When Parantaka became 
king, at the death of Aditya I, and prince Kannara was kept from 
the throne, Krishna espoused the cause of his grandson and invaded 
the Chola territory with the assistance of the Banas and Vaidumbas. 
Parantaka was assisted by the Ganga ruler Prithvipati II, and a 
decisive battle was fought at Vallala, modem Tiruvallam in the 
North Arcot district, which ended in disaster for Krishna and his 
allies. The Banas lost their territory, which was handed over to 
Prithvipati II, and the Vaidumbas also suffered for the support 
they had offered. The Rashtrakuta war took place before 916. 

From about 940 Parantaka began to experience increasing diffi- 
culty in defending his empire. His loyal feudatory, Prithvipati II, 
was no more; and as Butuga II, the ruling Ganga monarch, had 
married a Rashtrakuta princess (the sister of Krishna III) the 
alliance between Gangas and Rashtrakutas became closer. Those 
Banas and Vaidumbas whom the Chola had uprooted were also 
by the side of the Rashtrakuta ruler. To meet the expected trouble 
from the north-west frontier of his kingdom, Parantaka stationed 
his eldest son Rajaditya there with a large army including an 
elephant corps and some cavalry, and sent another son, Arikula- 
kesari, to assist him. 



170 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


We must now turn once more to Rashtrakuta history. Krishna II 
was succeeded by his grandson Indra III about 915. Even as yuva- 
raja , Indra had checked an invasion from the North by the 
Paramara ruler Upendra of Malwa. Upendra sought to take 
advantage of the preoccupation of Krishna II in the Chola war 
and invaded the Rashtrakuta kingdom. Indra defeated him, and 
compelled him to acknowledge Rashtrakuta suzerainty. After his 
accession, Indra waged successful war against the Pratihara ruler, 
Mahipala I of Kanauj (913-43). Mahipala lost his kingdom for a 
while though he recovered it later, with the aid of the Chandela 
ruler, Harshadeva. Towards Vengi, Indra followed the usual 
policy of setting up opposition to the ruling king Amma I who, 
however, held his own and ruled the kingdom for seven years till 
926. But his death was followed by a period of confused succession 
disputes which gave Indra III occasion to bring the bulk of the 
Vengi country under the occupation of his officers and nobles for 
a period of seven years. Indra was succeeded by his son Amogha- 
varsha II in 927. After a reign of only three years, he fell a victim 
to the foul play of his ambitious younger brother Govinda IV, 
a dissolute and incompetent ruler, who in his turn was removed 
from the throne by his feudatories who bestowed the kingdom on 
Baddega Amoghavarsha III, a half-brother of Indra III. Amogha- 
varsha III was a gentle and peaceful monarch, but not so his young 
and energetic son Krishna III, whom he made yuvaraja. By waging 
war against Racamalla, Krishna enabled his brother-in-law, 
Butuga II, to attain the Ganga throne. He became king at the 
death of his father in 939. Within a few years thereafter he 
naturally thought of paying off old scores against the Chola power 
and was urged to the task by the insistence of the Banas and 
Vaidumbas and perhaps also of Butuga II. With Butuga he 
invaded the Chola kingdom and won a decisive victory (949) in a 
battle at Takkolam, six miles to the south-east of Arkonam, in 
which Butuga killed Rajaditya with a well-aimed arrow when he 
was on elephant-back. Even this decisive battle did not mean the 
collapse of all resistance to Krishna’s advance, however, and he 
still had some years of hard fighting before he could establish himself 
in the South. Eventually he succeeded in occupying a large part 
of the northern half of the Chola empire and established his 
own men in the rule of that country. He assumed the title ‘ Con- 
queror of Kacci (Kanchi) and Tanjai (Tanjore) and thus caused 



THE BALANCE OF TWO EMPIRES 171 

the Chola empire a rude shock at the close of Parantaka’s reign. 
Indeed, it almost ceased to exist as its vassals in the south took advan- 
tage of its disasters in the north and proclaimed their independence. 

Like most of his predecessors Krishna III fomented trouble in 
Vengi by setting up against Amma II, his elder half-brother, 
Danamava and two princes of a collateral branch, Badapa and 
Taja II. With many interruptions Amma continued to hold on to 
his kingdom until 970 when he was slain in a battle by Danamava. 

Towards the close of his reign, about 963, Krishna invaded 
Northern India and compelled the Paramara ruler, Harsha Siyaka 
of Malwa, once more to acknowledge Rashtrakuta suzerainty. In 
this expedition Krishna was ably assisted by the Ganga Marasimha, 
son of Butuga II. An able soldier and generous friend, Krishna 
would appear to have lacked statesmanship, for his policy stored 
up trouble for his successors. He unduly encouraged the Gangas 
and irritated the Paramaras without being able to subjugate them. 
He was reckless in awarding fiefs ( anuga jlvita) to his lieutenants 
as when he gave the province of Tardavadi in the heart of the 
empire to Ahavamalla Tailaparasa of the Satyasraya family, some 
time before 965. 

Krishna III was succeeded by his half-brother Khottiga early 
in 967. In his reign, the Paramara Harsha Siyaka invaded the 
Rashtrakuta kingdom after defeating its forces on the banks of 
the Narmada and sacked the capital Manyakheta (Malkhed) in 
972-3. Once more Marasimha II assisted his overlord in regaining 
the capital after the Paramara forces withdrew. Khottiga died 
soon after the Paramara raid, and was followed by his nephew 
Karka II (973). He was dethroned within a few months by the 
Chalukya, Taila II, who had been biding his time ever since he got 
Tardavadi for his fief from Krishna III. Later tradition hailed 
Taila as an incarnation of the Lord Sr! Krishna who fought 108 
battles against the race of Ratta demons and captured 88 fortresses 
from them. Taila’s success was the beginning of the Chalukyan 
empire of Kalyani. Marasimha II made a futile attempt to revive 
Rashtrakuta power by setting up Indra IV, the issue of a son of 
Krishna III by a sister of Marasimha himself. Marasimha killed 
himself by starvation ( sallekhana ) in 975. His feudatory Pancala- 
deva who claimed sovereignty over the whole country south of the 
Krishna river was also killed by Taila in battle. Indra IV also 
performed sallekhana in 982. 



172 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


In the Choia kingdom, the thirty years (955-85) that followed 
the close of Parantaka’s reign formed a period of weakness and 
confusion. His immediate successor was his son Gandaraditya, 
who with his queen Sembiyan-mahadevi claims a bigger place in 
the domain of religion than of politics. At his death in 957, the 
Choia kingdom had shrunk to the size of a small principality, and 
Krishna III still continued in occupation of Tondaimandalam. 
Gandaraditya’s brother Arinjaya had a short reign (956-7) and 
was succeeded by his son Sundara Choia Parantaka II (957-73). 
His young son Aditya II was made yuvardja almost at the begin- 
ning of the reign. Sundara Choia turned his attention to the south, 
where Vira Pandya claimed independence after defeating a Choia 
king, probably Gandaraditya. As usual, the Pandya had MahindalV, 
ruler of Ceylon, as his ally. In the war that followed, Sundara 
Choia defeated Vira Pandya in two battles; Aditya II killed Vira 
Pandya on the second occasion. Sundara Chola’s forces also 
invaded Ceylon (959). These wars in the south did not result in 
the re-establishment of the Choia power there, but better success 
seems to have attended Sundara’s attempts in the north. He is 
said to have died in 973 in his golden palace at Kanchi while still 
engaged in directing campaigns in the north. His last years were 
clouded by a tragedy. Uttama Choia, son of Gandaraditya, con- 
spired to murder the yuvardja Aditya II (969), and then compelled 
the aggrieved father to recognize him as heir-apparent in preference 
to his own younger son Arumoli (afterwards Rajaraja I). Uttama 
Choia accordingly became king at Sundara’s death (973). By then the 
bulk of Tondaimandalam had been recovered from the Rashtrakutas 
for the Choia empire. The Rashtrakutas had given place to Taila II 
Chalukya who claims a victory against Uttama Choia about 980. 

The real greatness of the Choia empire dates, however, from the 
accession of Arumolivarman, who crowned himself as Rajaraja in 
the middle of 985. The thirty years of his rule constitute the 
formative period of Choia imperialism. A relatively small state 
at his accession, hardly recovering from the effects of the Rashtra- 
kuta invasion, the Choia kingdom grew under him into an extensive 
and well-knit empire efficiently organized and administered, rich in 
resources, and possessed of a powerful standing army and navy, 
well tried and equal to the greatest enterprises. 

Rajaraja began his conquests by attacking the confederation 
between the rulers of the Pandya and Kerala kingdoms and of 



THE BALANCE OF TWO EMPIRES 


173 


Ceylon. In two campaigns he destroyed the Pandyas and conquer- 
ed the haughty Kerala kings by attacking Kandalur and Vilinam. 
In a third campaign, a naval expedition, he overran the northern 
part of Ceylon, forcing Mahinda V to take refuge in the hill country 
in the south-east of the island. Anuradhapura was destroyed, and 
Polonnaruva became the capital of a Chola province. Elsewhere 
Gangapadi, Nolambapadi, and Tadigaipadi, all parts of modern 
Mysore, were conquered and annexed, which intensified the con- 
flict with the new power of the Chalukyas under Taila II. The 
first battle fought in 992 went against the Cholas. Rajaraja’s 
chief enemy, however, was Satyasraya, the son and successor of 
Taila H. Before recounting their trial of strength we must now 
turn for a while to Chalukyan history. 

After the overthrow of the Rashtrakuta power, Taila II, who 
ruled from Manyakheta, spent several years consolidating his sway 
in the western Deccan over the whole area between the Narmada 
and the Tungabhadra. When Paramara Munja of Malwa invaded 
his kingdom from the north, he defeated him and put him to death 
after some years of confinement during which he developed a 
liaison with Mrinalavati, the sister of Taila II, and was subjected 
to many humiliations. In all his wars Taila was assisted by his 
elder son Satyasraya who became king after his death in 997. 
Satyasraya continued the aggressive policy of his father, his chief 
enemy being the rising Chola power under Rajaraja who was 
establishing a strong hold on the eastern Deccan by active inter- 
vention in the affairs of the Vengi kingdom. 

In Vengi, Danamava had a short and troubled rule for three 
years, at the end of which he was slain in battle (973) by the Telugu 
Choda chief, Jata-Choda Bhima, probably a grandson of Chalukya 
Bhima II. Danamava’s sons sought refuge in exile while Jata- 
Choda Bhima ruled the Vengi kingdom for twenty-seven years 
(973-1000), the period described as an interregnum in later Eastern 
Chalukya inscriptions. Bhima imposed his suzerainty on the 
Eastern Gangas of Kalinga and the Vaidumbas. He finally invaded 
Tondaimandalam and started a war against Rajaraja I because he 
had received Danamava’s exiled sons, given his daughter Kundavai 
in marriage to the younger, and promised to restore the elder 
(3aktivarman I) to his ancestral throne. Jata-Choda Bhima was 
defeated and taken prisoner, so that the way became clear for 
Saktivarman to start his rule in the Vengi kingdom, though only

as a subordinate of the great Chola monarch who had helped 
him._ 

Unable to brook this extension of Chola power into the eastern 
Deccan, Satyasraya invaded Vengi in 1006, his general Bayala- 
nambi reducing the forts of Dhanyakataka (Dharanikota) and 
Yanamadala to ashes, and established himself in Chebrolu in the 
Guntur district. Acting on the principle that attack is the best 
form of defence, Rajaraja ordered his son Rajendra to invade 
Western Chalukya at the head of a strong army (1007). Rajendra 
marched up to Donur in the Bijapur district and, in the words of a 
Chalukya inscription, ‘ plundered the entire country, slaughtering 
women, children and brahmins He also captured Banavasi and 
a good part of the Raichur doab, and sacked Manyakheta. At 
the same time another section of the army operating from 
Vengi advanced on Kollipakkai (Kulpak), 45 miles north-west of 
Hyderabad, and captured its fortress. Satyasraya was thus com- 
pelled to withdraw his forces from Vengi and only with difficulty 
succeeded in freeing his country of the Chola army, which retired 
behind the Tungabhadra with much booty. 

Towards the close of his reign Rajaraja conquered and annexed 
the Maldives. He formally installed Rajendra as yuvaraja in 1012. 
The magnificent Siva temple Rajarajesvara at Tanjore, completed 
in 1010, fittingly commemorates the glory of his reign which came 
to an end with his death in 1014. Rajaraja encouraged Sri Mara 
Vijayottungavarman, the Sailendra ruler of Sri Vijaya (Palembang) 
and Kataha (Kedah) across the Bay, to build a Buddhist vihara at 
Negapatam. The vihara was called Cudamani vihara after the 
father of the ruler of Sri Vijaya. \ 

- Rajendra fjyvas a worthy son'of his father, andjraised the Chola 
empire to the position of being the most extensive and most 
respected Hindu state of his time. Early in his reign (1018) he 
installed his son Rajadhiraja I as yuvaraja. He invaded Ceylon 
and completed the conquest of the island begun by his father. 
Mahinda V was taken prisoner and transported to the Chola 
country where he died twelve years later. Thereafter his son 
Kassapa became the centre of Sinhalese resistance against the Tamil 
power, and after a war of six months in which a great number of 
Tamils were killed by the Sinhalese forces, he made himself king 
of the southern half of the island, Rohana, and ruled as Vikrama- 
bahu I for twelve years from 1029.

Rajendra made a triumphal march at the head of his army 
through the Pandya and Kerala countries, and appointed one of 
his sons as viceroy over both with the title Chola-Pandya, Madura 
being the headquarters of the new vice royalty. About 1020-1, 
Rajendra had to turn his attention once more towards the Western 
Chalukya. 

Satyasraya was succeeded in 1008 by his nephew Vikramaditya V 
who after a short and uneventful reign was followed by his brother 
Jayasimha II in 1015. Jayasimha had to light on many fronts. 
The Paramara Bhoja of Malwa, wanting to avenge the fate of 
Munja, invaded the Chalukya kingdom from the north and for 
some years occupied Lata and portions of Konkan. After hard 
fighting Jayasimha succeeded with the aid of his loyal feudatories 
in recovering the territory occupied by Bhoja. But it was the 
Chola Rajendra who was his most formidable enemy. Soon after 
his accession, Jayasimha tried to retrieve the losses sustained in 
the wars of Satyasraya and for a time circumstances seemed to 
favour him, Rajendra being busy with the conquest of Ceylon and 
the settlement of Pandya and Kerala.^ In Vengi, Vimaladitya, who 
had succeeded his brother Saktivarman I in 1011, either retired 
from the throne or died in 1018. Jayasimha II supported the 
claims of Vijayaditya VII to succeed him against those of Rajaraja, 
another of Vimaladitya’s sons by his Chola queen Kundavai. In 
the pursuit of this plan Jayasimha crossed the Tungabhadra and 
occupied Bellary and possibly even a part of Gangavadi. In Vengi, 
Vijayaditya captured Vijayavada (Bezwada) and made it impossible 
for his rival Rajaraja to celebrate his coronation. But then 
. Rajendra soon turned his attention actively against Jayasimha and 
put two forces simultaneously in the field, one marching into the 
Raichur doab and the other into Vengi for the relief of Rajaraja. 7 
In the west Jayasimha was defeated in a battle at Maski, but this 
led to no further aggression on the part of Rajendra, the Tunga- 
bhadra being recognized tacitly as the boundary between the two 
kingdoms. In Vengi the Chola forces defeated Vijayaditya in 
several battles, took possession of the country on behalf of Rajaraja 
and proceeded farther north into Kalingai probably because the 
Eastern Ganga ruler of that country, Madhukamamava (1019-38), 
had sided with Jayasimha. * After punishing him the army went 
still farther north for a grand military display in the form of an 
expedition to the valley of the Ganges. But with the departure of 



176 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


the Chola army to the north, trouble broke out in the rear and 
threatened its communications. To meet the situation Rajendra I 
marched towards the north and encamped on the banks of the 
Godavari. He tried to secure the line of return for his army which 
had advanced to the Ganges, and celebrated the coronation of his 
nephew Rajaraja with due pomp on 16 August 1022. The victorious 
army from the north joined him soon after, and he returned to the 
new capital that was rising_in the wilds of the Tiruchirapalli district 
-.-Gangaikondasolapuram^ 

^ Very soon after, Rajendra sent a large naval expedition against 
the kingdom of Sri Vijaya Jp Sri Vijaya was the powerful maritime 
state which ruled the Malayan peninsula, Sumatra, Java and the 
neighbouring islands and controlled the sea routes from India to 
China/ The relations between Sri Vijaya and the Chola empire 
had been quite friendly in the time of Rajaraja and in the early 
years of Rajendra’s reign. The Chola monarchs sent embassies, 
partly diplomatic and partly commercial, to China which reached 
that country in 1016, 1033, and 1077. ^Rajendra’s war against 
Sri Vijaya (1025) occurred between the dates of the first and second 
embassies to China. Whether it was rendered necessary by an 
attempt on Sri Vijaya’s part to obstruct the Chola intercourse 
with China or was simply the result of Rajendra’s desire to win 
glory by extending his digvijaya to the countries across the sea, we 
cannot say. Whatever the reason/the expedition was a complete 
success. Kadaram (Kataha) and the capital Sri Vijaya itself were 
sacked "and king Sangrama Vijayottungavarman, Mara Vijayot- 
tungavarman’s successor, was taken captive. \_The campaign 
apparently ended with the restoration of the kingdom to its ruler 
subject to his acknowledging Chola suzerainty. A fragmentary 
Tamil inscription from Sumatra bearing the date 1088 shows that 
active intercourse between the Chola kingdom and Sri Vijaya was 
maintained continuously for several generations/ 

Rebellions in the Pandya and Kerala kingdoms called for strong 
action in the course of a fairly extensive campaign conducted by 
the yuvardja Rajadhiraja, and several princes of the two rebel royal 
families were either put to death or forced to seek refuge in flight. 
There was trouble in Ceylon also, where Vikramabahu kept up 
the war against the Tamils, and forced Rajadhiraja to lead an 
expedition against him in 1041. After Vikramabahu’s death, 
which occurred about that time, anarchy supervened outside the

Chola province, and Sinhalese adventurers, dispossessed Indian 
princes from the Pandyan country and a certain JagatTpala from 
distant Kanauj asserted authority over portions of the island. They 
all had this in common however, that they led risings against the 
Chola power and suffered for it. 

In the closing years of Rajendra’s reign war broke out once 
more with the Western Chalukyas and the affairs of Vengi were, 
as usual, involved in it. In the Chalukyan kingdom Jayasimha II 
was succeeded by his son, Somesvara I Ahavamalla (1042). He 
removed the capital from Manyakheta to Kalyani, adorning it 
with many new buildings and generally adding to the amenities 
of the new capital. He continued the war begun by his father 
against the Bhoja of Malwa, and received his submission after a 
raid on his capital Dhara. He extended his power across 
Vidarbha and part of modern Madhya Pradesh, into Kosala 
and Kalinga, and imposed his sovereignty on the Nagavamsi ruler 
Dharavarsha of Cakrakuta. It deserves to be noted that the 
Kakatiya chieftain Prola I and his son Beta assisted Somesvara in 
his wars, and received from him as fief the Anumakonda Vishaya. 
In another direction Somesvara attacked Vengi and thus challenged 
the Chola power. In Vengi Rajaraja had no peace after his coro- 
nation in 1022. His half-brother Vijayaditya renewed his struggle 
for the throne, perhaps with the aid of Chalukya Jayasimha II, 
drove Rajaraja out of Vengi, and made himself king (1031) with 
the title Vishnuvardhana Vijayaditya VII; but by 1035 Rajaraja 
had regained his kingdom. Vijayaditya sought refuge in the 
Western Chalukya court where he was received with open arms 
and entertained royally. Somesvara’s invasion of Vengi was under- 
taken ostensibly in furtherance of the claims of Vijayaditya and 
news of it quickly reached Rajendra I. The king was too old to 
take the field himself, his son Rajadhiraja was engaged in the 
south, so a trusted Brahmin general, assisted by three able 
lieutenants, was ordered to go to Rajaraja’s relief. The Chola 
army engaged the enemy in a sanguinary but indecisive battle at 
Kalidindi. Meanwhile ! Rajendra I died and was succeeded by 
Rajadhiraja I (1044).! He was eager to restore Chola power in 
Vengi, and himself led an expedition into the Telugu country soon 
after he ascended the throne. He defeated the Western Chalukya 
forces in a battle at Dannada (Dhanyakataka) on the Krishna 
and compelled Vikramaditya, Somesvara’s son, and Vijayaditya,

Rajaraja’s rival, to retreat in disorder. He then entered Western 
Chalukyan territory and set fire to the important fort of Kollipakkai 
(Kulpak). These successes enabled Rajaraja to breathe freely 
for a time. They were followed by campaigns on the western front 
where the Chola forces captured several generals and feudatories 
of the Chalukyas, demolished the Chalukya palace in the city of 
Kampili, and inflicted a defeat on the enemy in a pitched battle at 
Pundur on the banks of the Krishna. Crossing that river, the 
victorious camp of the Chola was fixed at Yetagiri (Yadgir), where 
a pillar of victory with the tiger emblem on it was planted. After 
more fighting, the Chalukya capital Kalyani was itself sacked, and 
Rajadhiraja performed the virabhisheka (coronation of victor) in the 
enemy capital and assumed the title ‘ Vijayarajendra \ A fine image 
of a dvarapalaka which used to be at the entrance to the Darasuram 
temple (Tanjore district) and has since been removed to the Tanjore 
Art Gallery, bears the Tamil inscription: 4 the dvarapalaka brought 
by Udaiydr Sri Vijayarajendradeva after burning Kalyanapuram \ 

Before 1050, Somesvara succeeded in driving the Chola forces 
out of his territory. He also re-established his influence in Vengi 
and compelled Rajaraja to acknowledge his suzerainty in the place 
of that of the Cholas. Lastly, he sent a counter-expedition into 
Chola territory which returned after making a dash against Kanchi. 
These successes were only spurs to further effort on the part of 
Rajadhiraja, although, for reasons not now clear, he did not make 
any attempt to recover Yengi or Kalinga where Somesvara had 
established himself. Rajadhiraja, assisted by his younger brother 
and yuvardja Rajendra II, led another expedition against Somesvara 
(1053-4) and a battle was fought at Koppam (Kopbal), a place of 
great natural strength on the river Krishna. It was hotly con- 
tested and Rajadhiraja fell mortally wounded. Rajendra who had 
held himself in reserve then pressed forward and turned the defeat 
into victory. He put several Chalukyan generals to death and forced 
their army to retreat in disorder leaving many elephants, horses, 
camels, and much booty to fall into the hands of the Cholas along 
with several women, including some of the queens. Rajendra II 
crowned himself king on the battlefield and advanced to Kolla- 
pura where he planted a pillar of victory (jayastambha) before he 
returned to his capital, Gangaikondasoiapuram. 

Anxious to wipe out the disgrace of Koppam, Somesvara soon 
renewed the war. The death of Rajaraja in Vengi (1061) enabled

179 


him to put Saktivarman II, the son of Vijayaditya VII, on the 
throne and send a strong force to his assistance under Chamunda- 
raja. He also sent his sons Vikramaditya and Jayasimha into 
Gangavadi to invade that part of the Chola territory. Rajendra II 
met the challenge on both fronts aided by his son Rajamahendra 
and his brother VIrarajendra. In Vengi Chamundaraja was defeated 
and killed, Saktivarman II also meeting his end in the same engage- 
ment. The Chalukya invaders of Gangavadi were driven back in 
disorder and heavily defeated in a battle at Kudal-Sangamam, 
that is, Kudali at the junction of the Tunga and Bhadra in the 
Mysore country. Somesvara’s attempt to reverse the verdict of 
Koppam thus ended in failure (1061-2). Soon after occurred the 
deaths of the Chola yuvaraja Rajamahendra and his father 
Rajendra II, and VIrarajendra became king (1063). 

The death of Rajendra II necessarily meant a lull in Vlra- 
rajendra’s campaigns against the Chalukya. But Somesvara I 
knew that the attack would be renewed and prepared to meet it 
on both fronts. In the east he counted on help from his vassals, 
the Nagavamsi ruler Dharavarsha and the Eastern Ganga Vajra- 
hasta III. He also stationed in the neighbourhood of Bezwada a 
strong army under Jananatha of Dhara, a Paramara prince in his 
service. In the west, he sent Vijayaditya to carry the war into the 
enemy country. VIrarajendra soon returned to the charge as 
expected. The Chalukya forces suffered small defeats in Vengi, 
but at first the Cholas did not have any decided success. In the 
west, Somesvara’s forces were defeated with heavy loss on the 
banks of a river, perhaps Tungabhadra, in 1066. But he soon 
reorganized his forces and sent a message to VIrarajendra challeng- 
ing him to another contest, fixing Kudal-Sangamam as its venue. 
The Chola monarch gladly accepted the challenge and took the 
field. But Somesvara did not turn up though his forces had 
assembled at the appointed spot. After awaiting Somesvara’s 
appearance in vain for a month, VIrarajendra attacked the 
Chalukya army, inflicted a crushing defeat on it, and set up a pillar 
of victory on the banks of the Tungabhadra. He then proceeded 
with his forces to Vengi whither Vijayaditya had also gone earlier 
to organize the defence on the opposite side. A great battle ensued 
near Bezwada which ended in defeat for the Chalukya. VIra- 
rajendra crossed the Krishna and marched into Kalinga, where 
much fighting followed, and in the neighbouring Nagavamsi

principality of Cakrakuta. There, besides Vijayaditya, and Rajaraja, 
the son of Vajrahasta III, Vikramaditya also took part on the 
Chalukyan side, and prince Rajendra, the future Kulottunga I, on 
that of the Cholas. Meanwhile, unable to endure the illness which 
had prevented his keeping his martial engagement with Vlra- 
rajendra, Somesvara I met his end and performed parama-yoga by 
drowning himself in the Tungabhadra river at Kuruvatti on 
29 March 1068. Thus departed one of the greatest rulers of the 
Chalukya line. He succeeded in keeping Vengi under his control 
practically throughout his reign and reducing to temporary subjec- 
tion two major powers of Northern India, the Paramaras and 
Pratlharas. In spite of many reverses he maintained the wearisome 
struggle with the Cholas with undiminished vigour to the end of 
his life. He was greater as diplomat than as warrior, else he could 
not have succeeded in making his influence felt by so many states 
and for so long, and that with a military record none too bright. 
He had great faith in himself and succeeded in imparting it to his 
many able generals, including his famous son Vikramaditya. He 
was not unmindful of the arts of peace; the noble city of Kalyani 
was his creation. 

Somesvara I was succeeded by his eldest son of the same name, 
but the ambition of his younger brother Vikramaditya began to 
assert itself almost from the beginning. Hardly had Somesvara II 
come to the throne than Virarajendra led a vigorous attack against 
him, laid siege to Gutti and attacked Kampili. Vikramaditya 
turned the troubles of his brother into his opportunity. He 
seduced his feudatories from loyalty to their lawful monarch, and 
with their aid entered into negotiations with Virarajendra. The 
result was a total revolution in the diplomatic relations among the 
states and a virtual partition of the Chalukyan kingdom. Vijaya- 
ditya made his submission to Virarajendra and consented to rule 
the Vengi kingdom as his feudatory. Two of Virarajendra’s 
daughters were given in marriage, one to Vikramaditya himself and 
the other to the Kalinga Ganga prince Rajaraja; and within the 
Chalukyan kingdom Vikramaditya VI was installed as yuvaraja 
with almost independent rule over the southern half of the empire. 
Thus it looked as if the eternal feud between the Cholas and the 
Chalukyas had at last come to an end. 

But the death of Virarajendra early in 1070 altered the situation. 
But before explaining this we must mention some events of the 



THE BALANCE OF TWO EMPIRES 181 

reign of Virarajendra. Some time before 1067 he sent an expedi- 
tion against Ceylon, where the Sinhalese king Vijayabahu I was 
making a strong effort to put an end to the Chola power on the 
island. Vijayabahu was defeated and his queen taken captive, he 
himself being forced to seek shelter at Vatagiri (Wakirigala in 
Kegalla district). We shall see that better success attended Vijaya- 
bahu within the next few years. Virarajendra also sent another 
naval expedition for the conquest of Kadaram on behalf of a prince 
who had come in search of his aid and protection (1068). 

After the death of Virarajendra, Vikramaditya found his Chola 
alliance no longer an asset but a liability. He had to divide his 
attention between the pursuit of his differences with his brother at 
home and the protection and maintenance of his young brother- 
in-law Adhirajendra on the Chola throne against the designs of 
the Eastern Chalukya prince Rajendra (Kulottunga I). The inter- 
marriages between the Eastern Chalukya and Chola families and 
the position of Rajendra Kulottunga in both may be seen from 
the following table:

Saktivarman II 

The bestowal of the Vengi kingdom on Vijayaditya VII by 
Virarajendra had kept Rajendra (Kulottunga) out of the throne 
that was rightfully his, and that able prince naturally took 
advantage of the death of Virarajendra to press his claims both 
to Vengi and to the Chola throne. Vikramaditya proceeded to 
Kanchi, nipped a rebellion in the bud, installed Adhirajendra 
formally on the throne at Gangaikondasojapuram and returned 
after a month to the banks of the Tungabhadra. Soon after, he 
heard that the Chola king had lost his life in a popular rising and 
that Rajendra, the ruler of Vengi, had captured the vacant Chola 
throne. It is thus clear that Rajendra made excellent use of the 



182 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


short interval after the death of Virarajendra to expel Vijayaditya 
from Vengi and capture the Chola throne as well. 

Vikramaditya thus found himself placed between two enemies, 
his brother Somesvara at home and Kulottunga I in the Chola and 
Vengi countries. It was the task of Vikramaditya during the next 
six years to extricate himself from this dangerous situation. He 
continued to undermine the position of his brother Somesvara 
by inducing the feudatories of the empire to desert his cause. 
Among them were, besides his younger brother Jayasimha, and 
Vijayaditya, who were already on his side, the Kadamba ruler 
Jayakesi of Konkan, Vinayaditya and his son Ereyanga of the 
Hoysala family just coming into prominence, the Pandya ruler of 
Uccangi and even the distant Yadava ruler Seuna II of Devagiri. 
Somesvara had a difficult time, but he did his best with the support 
of a few loyal lieutenants to maintain himself at the head of the 
state and entered into an alliance with Kulottunga I. The prepa- 
rations on both sides, military and diplomatic, were completed by 
about 1075 when the war began with a clash at Nangili in the Kolar 
district between the forces of Vikramaditya and Kulottunga. 
Vikramaditya was defeated and pursued by the Cholas up to the 
Tungabhadra with heavy fighting all the way. Kulottunga made 
himself the master of Gangavadi. But Somesvara who co-operated 
with Kulottunga by attacking Vikramaditya’s rear was the worst 
sufferer. He fell into the hands of Vikramaditya who threw him 
into prison, proclaimed himself king (1076) and started' a new era 
— the Chalukya-Vikrama era — to commemorate his accession. 

While Kulottunga was engaged in the war with Vikramaditya, 
the kingdom of Vengi was raided in 1072-3 by Yasahkarnadeva, 
the Haihaya ruler of Tripuri. This, however, was an episode with 
no permanent results, military or political, although in another 
direction Kulottunga sustained a permanent loss of territory. 
In Ceylon Vijayabahu resumed his efforts to rid the island of its 
Tamil rulers and succeeded. From the extreme south of the 
island he put three armies in the field all of which advanced 
simultaneously. Polonnaruva fell, and Anuradhapura surrendered 
in about 1070. Vijayabahu’s coronation as monarch of Lanka, 
which was delayed by a rebellion, took place in 1072-3. Kulot- 
tunga had to reconcile himself to the loss, and Vikramaditya 
hailed Vijayabahu as his natural ally and sent him a friendly 
embassy with rich presents. 


THE BALANCE OF TWO EMPIRES 


183 


Kulottunga could not afford to neglect the revolt of the Pandya 
and Kerala countries on the mainland. He led a strong expedition 
to the south, and after some hard-fought battles at Semponmari, 
Kottaru, Vilinam, and &alai he subjected the whole country once 
more and compelled the numerous Pandya and Kerala princes who 
had opposed him to acknowledge his supremacy. He established 
a number of military colonies along the important routes of 
communication in both countries, but the old administrative 
arrangements of Rajaraja I and Rajendra were not revived and the 
local rulers were left in charge of internal affairs. About 1084-5 
Vijayabahu of Ceylon declared war on the Cholas when he heard 
that the envoys he had sent to Vikramaditya VI had been mutilated. 
While he was preparing the expedition, the velciikkara mercenaries, 
* unwilling to fight their Tamil kinsmen, mutinied, and burnt the 
royal palace. The king fled to Wakirigala, but returning crushed 
the insurrection, the ringleaders being burnt at the funeral pyre of 
the royal generals whom they had murdered. The yelaikkara forces 
learnt the lesson, and at the end of the reign set up the fine Tamil 
stone inscription, still extant at Polonnaruva, in which is recorded 
their agreement to protect the Tooth Relic temple.’ 1 Kulottunga 
apparently made his peace with Vijayabahu, for one of his 
daughters, ^uttamalli, married Virapperumal, the Sinhalese prince. 

A Chola embassy of seventy-two merchants reached China in 
1077 and received 4 81,800 strings of copper cash, that is, about as 
many dollars in return for the articles of tribute comprising glass- 
ware, camphor, brocades, rhinoceros horns, ivory, incense, rose 
water, putchuck, asafoetida, borax, cloves, etc.’ There was active 
trade with Sri Vijaya during this period, so much so that in 1090 
its king sent an embassy to Kulottunga I to consult about the 
regulation of the affairs of the two viharas his ancestors had erected 
at Negapatam. 

After the death of Vijayaditya VII (1076) Kulottunga sent his 
sons to rule as viceroys in Vengi: Rajaraja Mummudi Chola 
(1076-8), Vlra Choda (1078-84), Rajaraja Chodaganga (1084-9), 
Vira Choda again (1089-92), and lastly, Vikrama Chola (1092-1118). 
About 1097 the chieftain of Kolanu entered into a league with 
Anantavarman Choda Ganga of Kalinga and rebelled against the 
viceroy. Among those who assisted Vikrama Chola was Parantaka 
Pandya from the extreme south. Kolanu was sacked, and southern

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Kalinga invaded. The rebel chieftain made his submission, and 
Anantavarman himself had to follow suit. Some years later, about 
1110, Anantavarman Choda Ganga withheld tribute and brought 
about a second Chola invasion of Kalinga. This was led by the 
famous general of Kulottunga, Karunakara Tondaiman. The 
invading army spread destruction throughout Kalinga and defeated 
Anantavarman, who had to seek safety in flight. The victorious 
Chola army returned with vast booty but the campaign was devoid 
of any permanent results, though it formed the subject of a 
celebrated poem, Kalingattupparani of Jayangondar. 

Up to 1115 the extent of the Chola empire remained undiminish- 
ed under Kulottunga, except for the loss of Ceylon, and included 
the entire country south of the Krishna and Tungabhadra, extend- 
ing at least up to the Godavari on the east coast. The emperor 
maintained diplomatic relations with distant kingdoms like Kanauj 
in Northern India, Kambhoja (Cambodia) in Indo-China, and with 
Kyanzittha (1084-1112), the ruler of Pagan. But towards the end 
of his reign troubles arose in the Mysore and Vengi countries owing 
to the renewal of the hostility of Chalukya Vikramaditya to whom 
we must now turn our attention. 

After the accession of Vikramaditya, he as well as his great 
antagonist Kulottunga recognized their limitations, and suspended 
active hostilities against each other. Vikramaditya’ s reign was, in 
general, peaceful and his court was adorned by learned poets and 
authors like Bilhana and Vijnanesvara. About 1083, however, his 
younger brother Jayasimha rebelled but was defeated in a hard- 
fought battle and taken prisoner. Jayasimha had appealed to 
Kulottunga for help but in vain. 

More serious danger threatened Vikramaditya from the Hoysalas. 
Hoysala Vinayaditya and his son Ereyanga, as we have seen, served 
Vikramaditya in the war against Kulottunga. After Vinayaditya, 
Ereyanga ruled for less than two years and was succeeded by 
Ballala I (1100-10). These rulers professed allegiance to Chalukya 
rule but steadily built up their power and extended their territory. 
The results of this policy declared themselves in the reign of 
Ballala’s younger brother, Bittiga, better known as Vishnuvardhana. 
He was a great soldier and an ambitious monarch. He attacked 
the Chola province of Gangavadi and after defeating Adigaiman, 
the Chola governor of Talakad, annexed the province (1116). He 
then turned against Vikramaditya himself and at first attained 


THE BALANCE OF TWO EMPIRES 185 

much success. He won over to his side the Pandya ruler of Uccangi 
and Kadamba Jayakesi* II of Goa and advanced to the Krishna in 
the north. But Vikramaditya dealt firmly with the situation with 
the assistance of loyal feudatories, particularly Sinda Acugi II of 
Yelburga. Vishnuvardhana was expelled from the Chalukyan 
territory he had attempted to occupy, Goa was sacked and burnt, 
and the Pandya was pursued and pressed with great vigour. The 
Hoysala had to seek safety in the mountain fortresses of his home- 
country, and thither he was pursued in strength by the imperial 
forces. There were many battles and the campaign was a long 
one, but in the end (1122-3) Vishnuvardhana made his submission 
and returned to his allegiance. 

While still engaged in suppressing the Hoysalas, Vikramaditya 
renewed his designs against Kulottunga; possibly the success of 
the Hoysalas against that monarch in Gangavadi encouraged him 
to do so. We cannot say whether he had anything to do with 
the revolt of the Kolanu chieftain and the contumacy of Anantavar- 
man Choda Ganga which led to two wars during the viceroyalty of 
Vikrama Chola. But he did interfere in Vengi from about 1115 and 
much more actively after 1118 when, at the instance of Kulottunga, 
Vikrama Chola left Vengi for the Chola country as yuvaraja. In 
1118, Anantapala, Vikramaditya’ s famous general, is described as 
ruler of Vengi, other Chalukyan commanders are found established 
in other parts of the Telugu country, and the Chola power practically 
disappears for a number of years thereafter. 

Thus Kulottunga sustained another curtailment of his empire 
which by the end of his reign was practically confined to the Tamil 
country and a relatively small area of the adjoining Telugu districts. 
All the same Kulottunga must take rank among the great Chola 
monarchs. His long reign was, for the best part, characterized by 
unparalleled success and prosperity. He avoided unnecessary wars, 
and the permanent results of his policy appeared under his 
successors. Until the end of Kulottunga Ill’s reign (1216), for 
about a century, the empire, though not so extensive as in the 
eleventh century, held well together, and there was on the whole 
less of the chronic warfare of the period before the accession of 
Kulottunga I. The wisdom of Kulottunga’s statesmanship lay in 
adjusting his aims to his resources and in preferring the well-being 
of his subjects to the satisfaction of his personal vanity. Tradition 
and epigraphy alike give him the title ‘ Sungam tavirtta ’ (He who 



186 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


abolished the tolls), but there is no account of the nature and scope 
of this reform. 

Vikrama Chola dates his rule from 1118 though his father 
Kulottunga I continued to live four years longer. The seventeen 
years of his reign were on the whole a period of peace. He made 
extensive additions to the temple at Chidambaram to which the 
Chola monarchs were particularly attached — at least from the days 
of Parantaka I — and to the shrine of Ranganatha at ^rirangam. 
The death of Chalukya Vikramaditya VI (1126) and the accession 
of his son, the mild Somesvara III, enabled Vikrama Chola to 
re-establish Chola power in Vengi. It was a gradual process which 
began about 1127 and reached its completion in a battle on the 
banks of the Godavari about 1133 at which Somesvara was present. 
Fighting on the Chola side, Velananti Choda Gonka II routed the 
army of the Western Chalukyas and their Eastern Ganga ally 
Anantavarman Choda Ganga, taking captive some prominent 
generals and capturing much booty in gold, horses, and camels. 
In Gangavadi Vikrama Chola’s attempt to restore Chola power 
was not so successful, though he did recover parts of the Kolar 
district. 

He was followed on the throne by his son Kulottunga II who 
was formally installed in 1133. He had a peaceful reign till 1150 
and associated his son Rajaraja II with the actual conduct of the 
administration from 1146. Kulottunga II continued the renova- 
tion and extension of the temple at Chidambaram begun by his 
father and in the course of this work he removed the image of 
Govindaraja from the courtyard of the Nataraja shrine and cast it 
into the sea. Ramanuja is said to have recovered it and enshrined 
it at Tirupati. It was restored to its original place long after by 
Ramaraya of Vijayanagar. 

Rajaraja II ruled generally in peace till about 1173. Having no 
son, he chose Rajadhiraja II, the grandson of Vikrama Chola by 
a daughter, for the succession and appointed him yuvaraja in 1166. 
Rajaraja IPs empire extended over the whole of the Telugu country 
up to Daksharama (Draksharama) and over large sections of 
Kongunad and the eastern part of Gangavadi. The hold of the 
central administration over the outlying parts of the empire was 
becoming less firm; and even at the centre, the administrative 
system was beginning to betray signs of weakness. Everywhere 
feudatory chieftains were becoming more and more assertive. 


THE BALANCE OF TWO EMPIRES 


187 


Soon after the installation of Rajadhiraja II, a fierce succession 
dispute in the Pandya country led to the intervention of the Chola 
and Sinhalese rulers on opposite sides which brought no good to 
either. Out of the ashes of this civil war arose the Pandya power 
which in its renewed strength soon swallowed both the Chola and 
Ceylonese kingdoms. After the conquest of the Pandya country 
by Kulottunga I, the princes of the local royal family were allowed 
to rule as they liked, subject to the vague suzerainty of the Cholas. 
Parantaka Pandya, as we have seen, took part in the first Kalinga 
war of Vikrama Chola. But hardly any Chola inscriptions are 
found in the Pandya country after the reign of Kulottunga I. 
About 1166, Parakrama Pandya of Madura and Kulasekhara 
quarrelled about the succession, and Kulasekhara invested the city 
of Madura. Parakrama appealed to Parakramabahu I (1153-86) 
of Ceylon, but before aid could reach him from Ceylon, Kula- 
sekhara took Madura and killed Parakrama, his queen and some 
of his children. In spite of this, Parakramabahu sent word to his 
general Lankapura that he should continue the war until the king- 
dom of Madura was taken and bestowed on a prince of the house 
of Parakrama Pandya. Kulasekhara put up a brave resistance: 
the war was so protracted that Lankapura had to get reinforce- 
ments from Ceylon. Kulasekhara then appealed to the Chola 
monarch, and a large force was sent to his aid under the command 
of Paliavaraya. Nevertheless the war went at first against Kula- 
sekhara who was defeated in a number of battles in the Ramnad 
district, and the Ceylonese commander installed Vira Pandya, a 
son of Parakrama Pandya, on the throne. Soon, however, the 
Chola army under Paliavaraya began to make itself felt and the 
Sinhalese troops were beaten. The heads of their commanders, 
including that of Lankapura, were nailed to the gates of the city 
in literal fulfilment of the orders of the Chola monarch. Kula- 
sekhara re-entered Madura, and the conversion of the Pandya 
country into a province of Ceylon was thus averted. 

Hearing that Parakramabahu was preparing another attack on 
the mainland, Paliavaraya espoused the cause of Srlvallabha, a 
nephew of Parakramabahu and a rival claimant to the throne of 
Ceylon. An expedition was sent with Srlvallabha at its head and 
many places in Ceylon were captured and destroyed. Seeing that 
his attempt to support the line of Parakrama Pandya had brought 
on him nothing but disaster, Parakramabahu now recognized 



188 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Kulasekhara as the rightful king, and entered into an alliance with 
him against the Cholas. Kulasekhara’s treachery was discovered 
by the capture of Parakramabahu’s letters and presents. The 
Chola policy at once changed. After further fighting, some of 
which took place in Chola territory proper, Pallavaraya, set up 
Vira Pandya on the throne of Madura and drove Kulasekhara 
into exile. Thus Parakramabahu’s designs were frustrated and 
his candidates steadily kept out of the throne of Madura. All 
these events may be placed between 1169 and 1177 but that date 
by no means fixes the end of the struggle. 

The growing independence of the central power on the part of 
feudatories noticed in the reign of Rajaraja II became more pro- 
nounced under Rajadhiraja. The Sambuvaraya, Kadavaraya, 
Malaiyaman chieftains and the Telugu-Chodas of Nellore were 
making wars and alliances among themselves in the northern half 
of the Chola kingdom without any reference to the ruling monarch. 
^ Rajadhiraja II’s successor was Kulottunga III whose exact rela- 
s tionship to the main line is not clear. He began his reign in July 
1178, though Rajadhiraja lived up to 1182. By his personal ability, 
Kulottunga delayed the disruption of the Chola empire for about 
a generation, and his reign marks the last great epoch in the history 
of Chola architecture and art as he himself is the last of the great 
jZhola monarchs. 

Pandya affairs first claimed his attention. The tireless Para- 
kramabahu renewed his efforts against the Cholas and even 
persuaded Vira Pandya to make common cause with him, and the 
ruler of Venad also probably joined the combination. A certain 
Vikrama Pandya, perhaps some relation of Kulasekhara, who 
must have died in the interval, sought Kulottunga’ s help against 
Vira Pandya. There followed an invasion of the Pandya kingdom 
as a result of which the Pandya and Sinhalese forces were defeated 
in battle, Vira Pandya being driven into exile, and Vikrama Pandya 
installed on the throne of Madura. This campaign must have 
come to an end before 1182. From his exile, with the aid of his 
allies, Vira Pandya made another effort to retrieve his fortune, but 
the attempt was crushed on the battlefield of Nettur. Thence he 
fled to Ceylon. But there was no further fighting as both the 
ruler of Venad and Vira Pandya made up their minds to submit 
to Kulottunga, and offered obeisance to him in his open durbar 
at Madura. On the same occasion, according to (probably 



THE BALANCE OF TWO EMPIRES 189 

exaggerated) Chola inscriptions, Kulottunga 4 placed his foot on 
the crown of the king of Ceylon \ This second campaign occurred 
sometime before a.d. 1189. Vira Pandya was treated better than 
he had a right to expect. His life was spared and he was allowed 
some land and other wealth suited to his new station. 

After the second Pandya war, Kulottunga undertook a cam- 
paign in Kongu to check the growth of Hoysala power in that 
quarter. He re-established Chola suzerainty over the Adigaimans 
of Tagadur, defeated a Chera ruler in battle: and performed a 
vijayabhisheka in Karuvur (1193). His relations with the Hoysala 
Ballala II seem to have become friendly afterwards, for Ballala 
married a Chola princess. 

Some time later Jatavarman Kulasekhara, who came to the 
Pandyan throne after Vikrama Pandya in 1190, provoked Kulot- 
tunga by his insubordination. About 1205 Kulottunga led a third ex- 
pedition into the Pandya country, sacked the capital and demolished 
the coronation hall of the Pandyas — conduct which may be taken 
to prove Kulottunga’s consciousness of the increasing weakness 
of his own position. As the war ended with the restoration of 
Kulasekhara, the success of Kulottunga was by no means complete 
and the seed was sown for a war of revenge. 

Kulottunga waged other wars in the north before the Pandya 
war of reprisal overwhelmed him towards the close of his reign 
and the situation was saved to some extent by the intervention of 
the Hoysalas. These events can only be understood in the light of 
occurrences outside the Chola empire. 

To begin with the Western Chalukyas of Kalyani, Somesvara III 
was a peaceful monarch and in his reign Hoysala Vishnuvardhana 
not only threw off his allegiance to the Chalukyan power, but 
sought to extend his dominions at their expense, particularly in 
the regions of Nolambavadi, Banavasi and Hangal. Vishnu- 
vardhana continued his aggression in the reigns of the two sons 
of Somesvara III, Jagadekamaila II (1138-51) and his younger 
brother Taila III (1150-6). By 1149 Vishnuvardhana stationed 
himself at Bankapura in Dharwar and left his son Narasimha in 
charge of his capital Dorasamudra. The Chalukya empire was 
beginning to dissolve, although its trappings continued intact and 
even the Hoysalas occasionally paid nominal allegiance to the 
emperor, not to speak of the Kalacuris who had held a fief in 
Tardavadi, in the heart of the empire, from the time of Somes vara III. 



190 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


So also the Kakatiyas, who had received the district of Sabbi 1000 
from Vikramaditya VI, and were making other additions to their 
original fief of Anumakonda; and the Yadavas of Devagiri who 
had been generally loyal to the Chalukyas from the days of Taila II. 
Taila III was a feeble and incompetent ruler, and the Kalacuri 
chieftain Bijjala of Tardavadi won his confidence and arrogated to 
himself more and more power in quick stages. By 1157 Bijjala 
assumed imperial titles and a new era may be said to have started; 
but almost to the end of his reign Taila continued to retain his 
nominal suzerainty which even powerful monarchs like Hoysala 
Narasimha I acknowledged, though fitfully. Taila waged war 
against the Kakatlya Prola II and attacked the city of Anuma- 
konda, but Prola captured him and only released him out of loyalty 
and mercy. The hostilities, however, outlasted the reign of Prola, 
and Taila is said to have died of 4 dysentery caused by his fear of 
Rudra the son of Prola (1163). 

The Kalacuri revolution now ran its course and Bijjala set up 
rule in the Chalukya capital. He attacked Hoysala Narasimha I 
and took Banavasi. He was still ruling in 1168 although a certain 
Jagadekamalla III was also ruling with full imperial titles at the 
same time. According to some doubtful legends Bijjala lost his 
life on account of the hostility of the newly risen sect of Lingayats 
whom he persecuted. Three of his sons ruled in quick succession 
up to 1183, but none of them had the ability to turn Bijjala’ s usurpa- 
tion to good account, though they continued to war against the 
Hoysalas under Ballala II (1 173-1220), son of Narasimha I, and met 
with some initial successes. In 1183 Somesvara IY, the son of 
Taila III, became ruler after sweeping away the last remnants of 
Kalacuri power and thus putting an end to the confusion they had 
caused. This he was enabled to do by general Brahma or Barmideva 
who deserted the Kalacuris and went over to the service of Somesvara. 

The Yadava feudatory of Somesvara IV, Bhillama (1187-91) 
was the first to realize the utter weakness of Somesvara’ s position 
and take advantage of it. He invaded the Chalukya kingdom and 
seized its northern districts before 1189. But the Yadavas, like 
the Kalacuris, experienced difficulty in gaining recognition as an 
imperial power from those who had stood to the Chalukyas in the 
same relation as themselves. The Rattas, Silaharas, and Kadambas 
never gave them their allegiance, and the Hoysalas were stimulated 
to a fresh effort by the example of the Yadavas. Bhillama spent 


THE BALANCE OF TWO EMPIRES 191 

some years in the south organizing his new conquests. His pressure 
compelled Somesvara and his general Brahma to shift their head- 
quarters to Banavasi. Kalyani passed into the hands of the 
Yadavas. Meanwhile Ballala II struck a blow on his own account 
and defeated Somesvara and Brahma in a series of battles, the last 
of which occurred in 1 190. That was the end of theChalukya power. 
Somesvara continued to live in obscurity for less than a decade. 
There naturally ensued a contest between Ballala II and Bhillama 
for possession of the empire. Several battles were fought and in 
the final engagement near Soratur and Lakkundi near Gadag, 
Bhillama was killed (1191), and Ballala advanced the northern 
frontier of his empire to the Malaprabha and the Krishna rivers, 
while the Yadavas retained most of the territory that lay further 
north. Bhillama founded the city of Devagiri and made it his 
capital. The Kakatlyas also gained some territory as a result of 
the final dissolution of Chalukyan hegemony. 

Ballala II was not left in undisturbed possession of his northern 
conquests. Bhillama was succeeded by his son Jaitugi who 
declared war against Kakatlya Rudra, killed him and took his 
nephew Ganapati captive (1196). Rudra was followed by his 
younger brother Mahadeva on the Kakatlya throne. Mahadeva’s 
short reign was marked by a rebellion and perhaps also by another 
war with the Yadavas. After Mahadeva’s death (1199), Jaitugi 
released his son Ganapati from prison and set him on the throne. 
Jaitugi’s son and successor Singhana resumed the war against the 
Hoysala soon after his accession (1210) and was assisted by the 
Kadambas of Konkan and other feudatories who had been resisting 
Ballala already for some years. As a result of Singhana’s cam- 
paigns, Ballala lost almost all the territory he had gained by his 
wars against Somesvara IV and Bhillama (1216). 

In Vengi, from about the end of the reign of Rajaraja II, the 
Chodas of Velanadu declared their independence. They were 
followed by the Nellore branch of the Telugu-Chodas which began 
with Beta, a feudatory of Vikrama Chola. There is no evidence 
of the rule of Rajadhiraja II in Nellore or the Northern Circars. 
But there was a recovery under Kulottunga III whose sway was 
acknowledged by the Telugu-Choda rulers, Nallasiddha and his 
brother Tammu Siddha, from 1187 to the end of Kulottunga’s 
reign. There was, however, an interlude during which Nallasiddha 
occupied Kanchl in 1192-3 and was driven out of the city by 



192 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Kulottunga III in 1196. The Telugu-Chodas made another and a 
more successful bid for independence towards the close of Kulot- 
tunga’s reign when he was hard pressed by a Pandya invasion of 
the Chola country, as we shall see in the following chapter. 
Kulottunga waged war once again in the north in 1208 when he 
claims to have subdued Vengi and entered the Kakatlya capital, 
Warangal, perhaps an exaggeration because the Kakatlya kingdom 
was ruled at the time by the powerful monarch Ganapati. 

There is little steady light on the history of the Chera country 
in this period. There are inscriptions of the several kings of the 
ninth century of whom Sthanuravi, the contemporary of Aditya I 
noticed above, was the most important. He ruled in the last 
quarter of the ninth century, and the Syrian Christian Kottayam 
copper plates are associated with him. These grants record the 
settlement of workmen on the church called Tarisapalli erected at 
Kollam by one Iso Tapir. Sthanuravi was perhaps succeeded 
by Vijayaragadeva, described as manager of the temple or palace 
(kdyil adigarigal) in the Kottayam plates, and as Kerala raja in the 
Tiruvorriyur epigraph. Among the kings that followed, Bhaskara 
Ravivarman (c. a.d. 1047-1106) deserves mention. Srivallabhan 
Kodai and Govardhana Martandavarman of Venad were his con- 
temporaries. A copper plate grant now in the possession of the 
Jews of Cochin was issued by Bhaskara Ravivarman: it records a 
royal gift to Isuppu Irappan (Joseph Rabban) of the rights of the 
Anjuvannam together with the 72 proprietory rights, such as the 
collection of tolls and other revenue as also the perpetual right to 
use a palanquin, for him and his successors. The inscriptions of 
Bhaskara Ravivarman have been found spread over a relatively 
large area from Changanasseri in the south to Tirunelli temple in 
Wynad taluq in the north. Under Rajaraja I and his successors, 
the Chola rule extended over the bulk of Chera country. The 
country revolted during the troubles preceding the accession of 
Kulottunga I whose reconquest of and establishment of military 
colonies in south Chera country have been noticed above. In 
the twelfth century there are inscriptions of the rulers of Venad, 
identified with Cheranadu on the one hand, and Kupakadesa on 
the other; one of these rulers was conquered by Parantaka Pandya, 
a feudatory of Vikrama Chola. 

In this age as in the last the form of government was hereditary 
monarchy. But there was little in common between the simple. 



THE BALANCE OF TWO EMPIRES 


193 


personal rule of the earlier time and the Byzantine royalty of this 
age with its numerous palaces, officials, and ceremonials, and its 
majestic display of the concentrated resources of extensive empires. 
The coronation was an important and impressive ceremony and 
the occasion of great liberality. The Chalukyas held the ceremony 
usually at Pattadakal (literally 4 the coronation-stone ’), the Cholas 
at different places — Tanjore, Gangaikondasojapuram, Chidam- 
baram and sometimes Kanchipuram. Succession disputes were 
not unknown, but generally the rule of succession in the eldest 
male line was respected, and the choice of the yuvaraja during the 
lifetime of the reigning monarch diminished the chances of dispute. 
The murder of Chola Aditya II by his uncle Uttama Chola was an 
extreme and unusual assertion of political ambition, viewed with 
more leniency than it deserved by the ruling king Parantaka II and 
his son Rajaraja I. Vikramaditya VI, whose ability was equal to 
his ambition, trumped up charges of misrule against his elder 
brother before waging war on him and deposing him. Chola 
Rajaraja I initiated the system of prefacing the stone inscriptions 
of the reign with an account in set terms of its chief events kept up 
to date by additions from time to time. The relations between the 
emperor and his feudatories varied with time and circumstance. 
The administration of the Chola empire was stricter and more 
centralized than that of the Chalukyas, who employed a staff of 
highly trained diplomats (sandhivigrahis) to serve as liaison officers 
between the emperor and the feudatories in the various parts of 
the empire. Princes of the royal family were often employed as 
viceroys over important sections of the empire. 

The royal household comprised numerous servants of varied 
descriptions including bodyguards of sorts. The coronation hall 
and kitchen establishments comprised mostly women. The palace 
servants of the Cholas were organized into velams and settled in 
separate quarters in the capitals. Chau Ju-kua, a Chinese author 
of the early thirteenth century, observed of the Chola kingdom: 
4 At state banquets both the prince and four court ministers salaam 
at the foot of the throne. Then the whole company present break 
into music, song and dancing. He (the prince) does not drink 
wine but he eats meat, and, as is the native custom, dresses in cotton 
clothing and eats flour cakes. For his table and escorts he employs 
fully a myriad dancing girls, 3,000 of whom are in attendance daily 
in rotation.’ The Chalukya palace had a manevergade (chamberlain) 
13 



194 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


and zbhdnasaxergade (steward) besides other officials. The princes 
of the royal family and the nobles all maintained similar 
establishments suited to their own tastes and means. 



The monarch disposed of business by means of oral orders, but 
an elaborate procedure was observed both before securing them 
and in putting them into execution. The Chola monarch had an 
udankuttam, immediate attendants, a group of ministers represent- 
ing all the chief departments of administration to advise him on 
the disposal of business, besides a chancery (olai). There were 
corresponding officials in the Chalukya court. 

The Chola administrative machinery was an elaborate and 



THE BALANCE OF TWO EMPIRES 


195 


complicated bureaucracy comprising officials of various grades. The 
officials tended to form a separate class in society, organized in 
two ranks, an upper perundanam and a lower sirudanam. Offices 
tended to become hereditary and there was no clear distinction 
between civil and military employment. We know little of the 



methods of recruitment or the principles that governed promotion. 
The officials were often remunerated by assignments of land ( jivitas ) 
suited to their station. Titles of honour and shares in booty taken 
in war formed other rewards of public service. 




196 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


For purposes of administration the empire was divided into 
convenient areas with lower subdivisions in the Chola empire, the 
divisions in descending order being valanadu or mandalam , nadu> 
and kurram . Large townships formed a separate kurram by 

themselves, being known as taniyur or tankurram. Land revenue 
being the mainstay of public finance, great care was bestowed on 
the recording of land rights and revenue dues. AH land was care- 
fully surveyed and classified into tax-bearing and non-taxable lands. 
In every village and town, the residential part of the village 
(ur nattam), temples, tanks, channels passing through the village, 
the pciracceri (pariahs’ hamlet), kammanacceri (artisans’ quarters), 
the burning ground (sudugadu) were exempt from all taxes. The 
total extent of such areas was subtracted from the gross area of 
the village to ascertain the net area of taxable land. In its turn, 
taxable land was classified into different grades according to its 
natural fertility and the crops raised on it. The existence of 
immunities and exemptions in favour of individuals and institutions 
was also carefully noted in the accounts. The village as a whole 
was responsible for the payment of the entire revenue due from it 
to the king’s officers. The process of collection was sometimes 
harsh, and villages had reason to complain of their treatment by 
royal officers even in the best days of the Chola empire. When 
central control weakened, local oppression became more unres- 
trained, and instances are known of people from villages in an 
entire district meeting together and deciding upon common action 
to resist arbitrary and unusual imposts. The revenue was collected 
in cash or kind according to convenience. Besides land revenue 
there were tolls on goods in transit, taxes on professions and 
houses, dues levied on ceremonial occasions like marriages, and 
judicial fines. Besides these public dues of a general nature, 
sections of the people often agreed to tax themselves voluntarily 
for some particular object they had in view. 

Justice was administered by regularly constituted royal courts in 
addition to village courts and caste panchayats . Usage, documents 
and witnesses were admitted as evidence, and where no human 
evidence was forthcoming, trial by ordeal was resorted to; some- 
times titles to property were proved by the self-immolation of 
people who were ready to prove the title with their lives. Treason 
(rdjadroham) was dealt with by the king himself and involved 
confiscation of property besides death as punishment. Fines and 


THE BALANCE OF TWO EMPIRES 


197 


imprisonment were the common punishment for ordinary crimes, 
and Chau Ju-kua notes: 4 When any one of the people is guilty of 
j an offence one of the court ministers punishes him; if the offence 

\ is light the culprit is tied to a wooden frame and given fifty, 

seventy, or up to an hundred blows with a stick. Heinous crimes 
are punished with decapitation or by being trampled to death by 
an elephant.’ 

The most striking feature of the Chola period was the unusual 
vigour and efficiency that characterized the functioning of the 
autonomous rural institutions. A highly developed committee 
. system ( variyams ) for the administration of local affairs was evolved 

and the sab ha of Uttiramerur which revised its constitutional 
arrangements twice at short intervals in the reign of Parantaka I 
is only the leading example of a number of similar attempts going 
on everywhere to evolve improved methods of administration in 
the light of experience. Besides the staff of village officials engaged 
in the routine affairs of village administration, there were special 
arrangements by which a local chieftain or a powerful official 
undertook to protect life and property in a particular area in return 
for a separate police tax ( padlkaval kuli) paid to him and the need 
and importance of this system increased with the weakening of the 
central government. 

This sketch of administration in its details has had particular 
s reference to the Chola empire, but the conditions elsewhere in 

South India were generally similar though the administrative terms 
differed in the different kingdoms. 

Speaking generally, the medieval polity has the appearance of 

I being designed specially for the benefit and comfort of the upper 

classes of society and would seem to have neglected the common 
man. But the excesses to which the system was liable corrected 
themselves more or less automatically by the social uses to which 
wealth was put. The rich generally sought distinction by com- 
peting in the service of the gods and of the poor. To build a 
temple, endow a matha and to attach a school or a hospital to 
t either, to reclaim land and to promote irrigation, such were the 

most common roads to social eminence and public recognition. 
The king, the nobles and the temples drew largely in various ways 
upon the products of the industry of the common people. But 
much of this wealth was returned to them in ways that advanced 
\ their common good. It was a wonderful social harmony based

not on equality of classes or individuals but on a readiness to give 
and take, a mutual goodwill that had its roots deep down at the 
foundations of communal life.

CHAPTER X 


THE AGE OF THE FOUR KINGDOMS 

General outline — Pandya revival under Maravarman Sundara — Chola 
Rajaraja III aided by Hoysalas against Pandya and Kadava Kopperunjinga — 
Chola recovery under Rajendra III shortlived — Jatavarman Sundara Pandya 
and his wars — Maravarman Kulasekhara and Hoysalas — Pandya conquest of 
Ceylon — end of Kulasekhara’s reign — Hoysala Ramanatha, Narasimha III 
and Ballala III — Kerala — Yadava Singhana, Krishna, Mahadeva and Rama- 
chandra — Kakatlya Ganapati, Rudramba and Prataparudra II — Gangas of 
Kalinga. 

Marco Polo on Ma’bar, Kayal, horse-trade, pearl-fishing, and social con- 
ditions — on Ceylon and west coast. 

The Chalukya empire disappeared at the end of the twelfth century 
and the Chola tottered at the beginning of the thirteenth. For a 
century thereafter, the history of South India is the history of the 
four kingdoms that rose on the ruins of the vanished empires and 
filled the annals of the century with their mutual antagonisms. 
The kingdoms were the Pandya and the Hoysala in the south, and 
the Kakatlya and Yadava in the north. Minor powers like the 
Telugu-Chodas of Nellore played their part as auxiliaries to the 
chief powers. The period was marked by no striking developments 
in polity or society although industry, trade and the arts continued 
to flourish with their normal vigour. Marco Polo who visited 
many parts of the country in 1292-3 gives a vivid account of pre- 
vailing conditions. The Muslim invasions of the Deccan which 
began towards the end of the century upset all the four kingdoms 
and caused a period of confusion terminated by the rise and 
expansion of the BahmanI and Vijayanagar kingdoms in the second 
quarter of the fourteenth century. 

Jatavarman Kulasekhara, the Pandya ruler whom Kulottunga III 
humiliated in a signal manner in 1205, was followed on the throne, 
more than ten years later, by his younger brother, Maravarman 
Sundara Pandya (1216). Sundara wanted to avenge the wrongs 
he had shared with his brother and invaded the Chola territory 
soon after his accession. Kulottunga’s age and the swiftness of 
the attack rendered Chola resistance feeble. After sacking Uraiyur 
and Tanjore, Sundara Pandya drove his suzerain into exile along 
with his yuvaraja , Rajaraja III. Sundara performed a vlrabhisheka 



204 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


in the coronation hall of the Cholas at Ayirattali, Tanjore district, 
and marched up to Chidambaram where he worshipped at the 
famous shrine of Nataraja. On his way back he fixed his camp 
at Pon Amaravati (Pudukkottai). Meanwhile Kulottunga had 
appealed for aid to Hoysala Ballala II who promptly sent an army 



SOUTH INDIA: a.d. 1200-1325 


under his son Narasimha to Srirangam. Sundara Pandya therefore 
had to make peace and restore the Chola kingdom to Kulottunga 
and Rajaraja after they made formal submission at Pon Amaravati 
and acknowledged him as suzerain* This was the beginning of 






THE AGE OF THE FOUR KINGDOMS 205 

the second empire of the Pandyas though it was not yet quite the 
end of that of the Cholas. 

Kulottunga III died soon after (1218) and Rajaraja III proved 
to be an incompetent ruler under whom confusion increased and 
the dissolution of the Chola kingdom was hastened. In some 
unknown way a company of Odda (Oriya) soldiers penetrated to 
the heart of the Chola country (c. 1223) and created disturbances 
in Srirangam until they were dislodged by Sundara Pandya (1225). 
In the north, Hoysala forces were present in Kanchl, perhaps 
pursuing hostilities with the Telugu-Chodas of Nellore and their 
suzerains, the Kakatlyas. The Kadava chieftain Kopperunjinga 
became more and more powerful and entered into an alliance with 
Sundara Pandya against the Cholas and their Hoysala protector. 
Little realizing the increasing difficulty of his position, Rajaraja III 
defied Sundara Pandya by withholding the annual tribute due to 
him and starting hostilities. Sundara Pandya repelled the feeble 
Chola invasion and took the offensive. Rajaraja was defeated 
with much loss of wealth and his chief queen was taken prisoner. 
Sundara Pandya performed a vijayabhisheka at Mudikondasola- 
puram (Ayirattali). Rajaraja made an attempt to join his allies, the 
Hoysala forces of Narasimha II in the north, but he was intercepted 
and, after a battle at Tejlaru, was taken prisoner by the Kadava 
Kopperunjinga and confined in the fortress at Sendamangalam. 

Hearing of the disasters that had befallen the Chola monarch, 
Narasimha II promptly moved to his aid. He attacked and over- 
powered the ruler of the Magara kingdom (Salem and South 
Arcot), an ally of the Kadava, and marched towards Srirangam. 
From there he sent an army under his generals Appanna and 
Goppayya with instructions to carry destruction into the country 
of Kopperunjinga and to reinstall the Chola emperor. The 
generals carried out their instructions to the letter. They captured 
many important places held by Kopperunjinga and, after a battle 
at Perambalur, advanced by way of Toludur to Chidambaram, 
punishing on the way some officers of Rajaraja and Parakrama- 
bahu, a prince of Ceylon, who had joined the enemy. After 
worshipping the god of Chidambaram, they devastated the country 
south of the river Gadilam and east of Sendamangalam. Finally 
they made preparations to invest that fortress when Kopperunjinga 
sent word to Narasimha that he was ready to restore the Chola 
emperor to liberty and his throne, and Narasimha transmitted the 



206 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


offer to his commanders. They then received the Chola emperor 
with honour and accompanied him back to his country (1231). 

Meanwhile Narasimha himself had met Sundara Pandya in 
battle at Mahendramangalam on the Kaveri and defeated him. 
Sundara Pandya had to acquiesce in the restoration of Rajaraja. 
The war with the Kadava went on for some more years, but peace 
was finally made among the Hoysalas, Pandyas, and Cholas and 
sealed by dynastic marriages. Somesvara (1233-4), the son and 
successor of Narasimha II, is called uncle (mamadi) by the 
successors of both Sundara Pandya and Rajaraja III. 

Rajaraja continued to rule until 1256, the extent of his empire 
outside the Pandya country nominally being the same as at the 
beginning of his reign in spite of reverses. But instances of treason, 
disorder, and alliances for mutual defence among local chieftains 
and of defiance of express orders issued by the king were be- 
coming more and more numerous, while Hoysala influence over the 
whole area of the Chola kingdom and even in the Pandya country 
increased steadily from about 1220 to 1245, a period which may 
be well described as that of Hoysala hegemony in the south. This 
was due to Somesvara leaving the administration of his home 
territory in the hands of his ministers and devoting all his time 
to the consolidation of the Hoysala position in the Tamil country. 

Rajendra III, who was installed as yuvaraja in 1246, was a much 
abler prince than Rajaraja III. He made a strenuous effort to revive 
Chola power and would have succeeded even better than he did 
but for Somesvara’s interference. Rajendra attacked the Pandyas 
and defeated two Pandyan princes, one of whom was Maravarman 
Sundara Pandya II (acc. 1238). Somesvara now took the side of the 
Pandyas to prevent the complete restoration of Chola authority, 
defeated Rajendra in battle and then made peace with him. In 
the north Rajendra commanded the alliance of Choda Tikka of 
Nellore, also called Gandagopala, who had been attacked by 
Somesvara in 1240. Tikka by his wars checked the power of the 
Sambuvarayas and Kadavarayas and thereby strengthened that of 
Rajendra. He even fought against Somesvara though he took 
Kanchi for himself as a reward for his services and had another 
allegiance, namely that to Kakatlya Ganapati of Warangal, also 
an enemy of the Hoysalas. 

The alliance between Rajendra and Somesvara became closer 
after the accession to the Pandya throne of the celebrated Jatavarman 


THE AGE OF THE FOUR KINGDOMS 


207 


Sundara Pandya in 1251, one of the most famous warriors and 
conquerQrs of South India under whom Pandyan power attained 
its greatest splendour. In the first years of his reign Sundara 
Pandya fought many wars and rapidly extended his sway to Nellore 
and beyond, and to Ceylon, confining the Hoysalas to the Mysore 
plateau. Kanchipuram became a secondary Pandya capital, while 
Ceylon and Kerala were firmly held and administered for a time. 
In his wars, Sundara commanded the active co-operation of other 
princes of the royal family, Jatavarman Vira Pandya (1253) being 
most prominent among them. 

Sundara Pandya proceeded with a small force against the Chera 
king Ylraravi Udaya Martandavarman, and destroyed him and 
his forces after ravaging the Malainadu. He compelled the warlike 
Chola Rajendra to acknowledge his suzerainty and pay him tribute. 
He invaded Ceylon and exacted a vast quantity of pearls and many 
elephants from its ruler. He then attacked the Hoysalas in the 
region of the Kaveri and captured the fortress of Kannanur Koppam. 
Several Hoysala generals were killed, including the brave Singana, 
while numerous elephants and horses were captured together with 
a large amount of treasure and a number of women. Sundara 
only stopped fighting when Somesvara withdrew into the plateau; 
but shortly afterwards Somesvara renewed the war in which he 
was to meet his death at Sundara Pandya’s hands (1262). Sundara 
then attacked the rich city fortress of Sendamangalam and fought 
several engagements 4 which struck terror into the heart of the 
Kadava ’ (Kopperunjinga). Having thus become master of his 
territory, forces and treasure, Sundara restored him to the rulership 
of his land and left for Chidambaram where he worshipped 
Nataraja before proceeding to Srirangam. 4 Here he wore the 
garland of victory, performed many tulabharas , which pleased the 
eyes and hearts of all spectators and evoked blessings from learned 
poets and in that temple which he roofed with gold he sat upon 
a splendid throne with his queen, wearing a golden crown and 
‘ emulating the morning sun rising on the top of the mountain \ 

Sundara Pandya ’s conquests included the Magadai (Bana) and 
Kongu countries which must have been taken during the wars against 
the Hoysalas and Kopperunjinga. Finally, he led an expedition 
further north in which he killed Gandagopala in battle and occupied 
Kanchi. He also came into conflict with Kakatiya Ganapati and 
his other feudatories, defeated a Telugu army at Mudugur (Nellore 



208 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


district) and drove a Bana chief into exile. At the end of the 
campaign he performed a virabhisheka at Nellore. 

Between 1262 and 1264, on an appeal for help from a minister 
of Ceylon, Jatavarman Yira Pandya invaded the island, defeated 
and killed one Ceylonese prince and received the submission of 
another as also that of a son of Chandrabhanu of the Malay 
peninsula who ruled over a principality in the north of Ceylon. 
Both the Pandya invasions of the island fell in the reign of Para- 
kramabahu II who appears never to have gained mastery over the 
northern half of the island but left its fate to be settled by local 
adventurers and foreign invaders. 

The vast treasure that fell into the hands of Sundara as a result 
of his wars was used to beautify and enrich impartially the great 
shrines of §iva and Vishnu at Chidambaram and Srirangam. 

Sometime before his death, Hoysala Somesvara, being pressed 
by enemies from both north and south, had effected a virtual 
division of his kingdom, assigning the northern half to his elder 
son Narasimha III and the southern Tamil area to his younger 
son Ramanatha. After his father’s death, Ramanatha recovered 
Kannanur and held his own against Sundara Pandya who died 
in 1268 and was succeeded by Maravarman Kulasekhara I, also 
a great ruler. 

During this period the rule of the Pandya kingdom was shared 
among several princes of the royal family, one of them enjoying 
primacy over the rest. Such an arrangement seems to have been 
of long standing in that country; even Kulottunga I is said to have 
subjugated five Pandya princes together. Kulasekhara pressed 
the war against Hoysala Ramanatha, who had allied himself 
closely with Chola Rajendra III, and defeated both in 1279. That 
is the last we hear of Rajendra III and the Cholas. Kulasekhara 
became unquestioned master both of the Chola country and of 
those Tamil districts of the Hoysala empire over which Ramanatha 
had ruled. He also fought in Kerala (Travancore) where, perhaps, he 
suppressed a local rising. Sometime later he took advantage of a 
famine in Ceylon to send his minister Aryachakravarti to invade 
the island where he ‘ laid waste the country on every side entered 
the fortress of Subhagiri (Yapahu), and carried away to the Pandya 
country ‘ the venerable Tooth Relic and all the solid wealth that 
was there \ This was at the close of the reign of Bhuvanaikabahu I, 
and there followed a period of some twenty years during which 


THE AGE OF THE FOUR KINGDOMS 


209 


the island formed part of the Pandya empire. The next ruler of 
Ceylon Parakramabahu III (1303) adopted peaceful methods with 
Kulasekhara, went on a personal embassy to the Pandya court, 
and persuaded Kulasekhara to surrender the Tooth Relic. Ceylon 
regained her independence only during the civil war and the 
Muslim invasion that followed Kulasekhara’s death (1308-9). His 
last years were embittered by quarrels between his sons. He 
wanted his younger son by a favourite mistress, Vlra Pandya, to 
succeed him. The result was that the elder son, Sundara Pandya 
started a war after the death of his father, for which, according to 
some writers, Sundara was himself responsible. The war went in 
favour of Vlra Pandya, and Sundara had to invoke the aid of the 
Muslim invader Malik Kafur (1310). 

After the loss of his Tamil territory Hoysala Ramanatha started 
a civil war against his brother Narasimha III who was hard 
pressed by other enemies like the Yadavas of Devagiri and the 
Kakatlyas. Ramanatha succeeded in capturing some territory for 
himself in the Bangalore, Kolar, and Tumkur districts, and ruled 
it with Kundani as his capital. Narasimha III died in 1292 and 
was succeeded by Ballala III. His accession was not disputed by 
Ramanatha who, however, kept up a hostile attitude till his death 
three years later, as did his son Visvanatha also for a few years 
until he too disappeared from the scene. Ballala then once more 
ruled over a united Hoysala kingdom before 1300. He took 
advantage of the civil war in the Pandya country that followed 
the death of Kulasekhara, and went out to the aid of one or other 
of the parties in the hope of regaining the territory lost by 
Ramanatha. But his plans were thwarted by the sudden appear- 
ance of Malik Kafur in his rear. 

In the thirteenth century in Kerala, some kings of Venad known 
chiefly from their donative records claim to belong to the Yadu- 
kula, thus tracing their descent from the Ay Kings of the eighth 
century who in turn connected themselves with Ay Andiran of 
£angam literature. In the last quarter of the century Ravivarman 
Kulasekhara who calls himself Chera emperor shot into a short- 
lived eminence by raiding extensive territories including the Pandya 
country and right up to Kanchipuram and Poonamallee; he was 
an accomplished ruler and liberal patron of letters. Kollam 
(Quilon) was his capital. His exploits will be referred to again in 
the next chapter. Not far removed from him in time was 
14

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Viraraghava Chakravarti, author of the Kottayam plates conferring 
the title of Manigramam and certain other honours on Iravikorran; 
the grant is attested among others by the authorities of Venad, 
Odanad, Emad and Valluvanad, important divisions of the Kerala 
country. 

After this period, the history of Kerala remains as fragmental 
and obscure as ever, and becomes mixed up with the rivalries of 
the Portuguese and the Indian powers and those among the 
European powers themselves later. It does not lie within the 
scope of this book to study these developments which link up 
mediaeval with modern times in India, and in the following 
chapter the history of Kerala particularly the wars between Calicut 
and Cochin and the activities of the European Companies together 
with their consequences will be left on one side. 

To turn now to the northern states, the Yadava Jaitugi was 
succeeded by his son Singhana (1210-47) under whom the Yadava 
empire attained its greatest extent. He invaded Gujarat twice in 
1231-2 and 1237-8, while in the south he waged war first against 
Hoysala Ballala II and deprived him of considerable territory to 
the south of the Krishna and Malaprabha. He still kept up the 
pressure against the Hoysalas in the reign of Narasimha II, who 
had to abandon the Sagar taluk and the Bellary district. Nara- 
simha’s successor Somesvara, however, succeeded in retrieving the 
position sufficiently for him to be able to encamp near Pandarpur 
in 1236 and to endow the Vitthala temple of that place by the 
grant of a village. Singhana’s general Vicana, the governor of the 
southern province, not only drove him back but carried his arms 
into Hoysala country up to the banks of the Kaveri (1239). Indeed, 
so disastrous were Somesvara’s sallies against the Yadavas that by 
the end of his reign he had lost even more territory to them than 
his predecessors had. Singhana’s empire, on the other hand, was 
extended and established by Vicana all over what had been the 
central, western, and south-western regions of the Western 
Chalukya empire. Singhana also waged rather indecisive wars 
against Kakatlya Ganapati and the ruler of Malwa. 

Singhana's chief astrologer was Changadeva, the grandson of 
the famous astronomer Bhaskaracarya, and son ot Lakshmldhara, 
the chief pundit of Jaitugi I. He founded a college at Patna 
for the study of his grandfather’s Siddhantasiromani and other 
works. 


THE AGE OF THE FOUR KINGDOMS 


211 


The Yadava throne descended to Singhana’s grandson Krishna 
<1247-60) — his son Jaitugi II having died in his father’s lifetime. 
Although he lost some territory in the south-western Andhradesh 
to Kakatlya Ganapati, he may be said in general to have passed 
on undiminished the extensive empire he had inherited. His reign 
is chiefly remarkable for its literary activity: his minister and general 
Jalhana compiled an anthology of Sanskrit verse, and Amala- 
nanda’s Vedantakalpataru also dates from this time. Krishna 
himself seems to have been a religious man who performed many 
sacrifices. 

Krishna was succeeded by his brother Mahadeva (1260-71). 
He fought a successful war against Kakatlya Rudramba, capturing 
her elephants and some of her insignia but sparing her life as she 
was a woman. He invaded northern Konkan, defeated its Silara 
xuler Somesvara in a naval battle and annexed his territory to the 
Yadava empire. The celebrated Hemadri was minister ( srikarana - 
dhipa ) under him and his successors. A voluminous writer himself, 
Hemadri encouraged many other writers by his patronage, and 
built so many temples that a style of architecture came to be 
associated with his name. 

Krishna’s son Ramachandra succeeded to the throne in 1271 
after a short war with Amana, the son of Mahadeva, who tried to 
usurp his place. Ramachandra also waged other wars, by no 
means decisive in their results, against the ruler of Malwa and the 
Kakatlya Prataparudra II, Rudramba’s successor. About 1276-7, 
his famous general Saluva Tikkama invaded the Hoysala territory 
of Narasimha III and laid siege to the capital Dorasamudra. He 
returned with much booty from a victorious campaign, but left 
Narasimha in full possession of his territory. Narasimha’s brother 
Ramanatha was also attacked but with no decisive results. 
Hostilities against the Hoysalas continued into the reign of 
Ballalalll, who attempted to extend the kingdom northward, but the 
advance of Muslim power in the Deccan during the last decade of 
this century considerably curbed Ramachandra’ s activity. The 
great Maratha saint Jnanesvara flourished during his reign and 
completed his great Marathi exposition of the Gita on the banks 
of the Godavari in 1291. 

Turning to the Kakatlya, perhaps the ruler with most claim to 
greatness was that Ganapati whom Jaitugi had released from prison 
and set on the throne. In his long reign of over sixty years 



212 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


(1199-1262) he earned the reputation of being a good adminis- 
trator. In the Andhra country, the power of the Velananti Chodas 
had disappeared after 1186, and its distracted political condition 
was an invitation to a ruler like Ganapati to enter and exploit its 
fertile lands, its iron and diamond mines and its ports. This 
conquest he completed between 1209 and 1214 and made the 
Telugu-Chodas of Nellore acknowledge his suzerainty. Their 
wars with Kulottunga III, after their capture of Kanchl, involved 
him, as we have seen, in hostilities with that monarch also. He 
also fought against Ananga Bhlma III (1211-38) of Kalinga, who 
was hard pressed by his Muslim enemies from the north and by 
the Chedi rulers of Tummana, and in another indecisive war about 
1231 with the Yadava Singhana. More decisive was his defeat 
(1239) of the Kayasthas in Cuddapah and Kurnool, represented by 
Gangaya Sahini and his nephews Tripurantaka and Ambadeva. 
Soon after this, Ganapati proclaimed his daughter Rudramba 
heir-apparent, even calling her by the masculine name Rudradeva 
Maharaja, and associated her actively in the administration. He 
also issued a charter of security to foreign merchants trading in 
Motupalli. Jatavarman Sundara Pandya’s aggressive wars, that 
brought him into conflict with the Telugu-Chodas and their 
suzerain Ganapati, have been narrated already. When Sundara 
Pandya withdrew, Ganapati, at the instance of the poet Tikkana, 
assisted Manuma Siddhi, the son of Choda Tikka, against his 
domestic enemies and seated him firmly on the Nellore throne. 
Even that turbulent Kadava chieftain Kopperunjinga acknowledged 
Ganapati’s overlordship. 

Ganapati’s daughter Rudramba was his successor. The early 
years of her reign were marked by troubles created by Kopperun- 
jinga and other rebellious feudatories, but these were firmly 
suppressed by the loyal Kayastha chieftain Ambadeva. Yadava 
Mahadeva invaded Rudramba’s kingdom with results already 
noted. The hostility of the Yadavas continued after Mahadeva’s 
reign, and the young prince Prataparudradeva, grandson of 
Rudramba, won his spurs as a warrior in these conflicts. He was 
made yuvaraja about 1280, and when, eight years later, Ambadeva 
rebelled and got support from the Hoysalas and Yadavas, the 
yuvaraja succeeded in suppressing the revolt by about 1291. 

Prataparudra II succeeded his grandmother in 1295 and ruled 
till 1326. Early in his reign one of his generals led an expedition 


THE AGE OF THE FOUR KINGDOMS 


213 


into Kuntala, capturing the forts of Adavani (Adoni) and Raichur, 
among others, after driving out the Yadava garrisons, and brought 
the territory under Kakatiya rule. Prataparudra reformed the 
administrative system by dividing the kingdom into 77 nayakships, 
confining recruitment thereto to the Padmanayaka community and 
thoroughly overhauling the staff of nayakas. Some of the great 
ndyakas , like Kapaya Nayaka, who later played a great part in 
resisting the Muslims, were the products of this system which, 
incidentally, was later adopted and elaborated by the rulers of 
Yijayanagar. 

Throughout the thirteenth century, and later, the Gangas con- 
tinued to rule the kingdom of Kalinga. In the reign of Rajaraja III 
(1198-1211), grandson of Anantavarman Choda Ganga, occurred 
the first Muslim invasion of Orissa. The army sent by Ikhtiyar- 
ud-din Muhammad-i-Bhaktyar Khilji (1205) against Jajnagar was 
successfully repulsed. Similar results attended another effort 
against Orissa by the Bengal Muslims between 1211 and 1224 in 
the reign of Rajaraja’s successor Ananga Bhlma III. Ananga 
Bhlma also fought against Kakatiya Ganapati, and his troops went 
as far afield as Kanchipuram and possibly even Srirangam. His 
son Narasimha I (1238-64) took the offensive against the Muslim 
rulers of Bengal and fought three campaigns against them, though 
they were not uniformly successful. Bhanudeva II (1306-28) was 
definitely defeated by the Tughlak invasion under Ulugh Khan 
and had to surrender a number of elephants to the victor. In 
his turn, Bhanudeva III (1352-78) had to face Firoz Tughlak to 
whom he had to submit as a condition of peace. The last great 
Ganga ruler was Narasimha IV (1378-1414), in whose time the 
Muslim ruler of Malwa tried to invade Orissa but without gaining 
any advantage. This long-lived dynasty ended with Bhanu- 
deva IV (1414-32) who died childless, leaving the throne to be 
occupied by his commander-in-chief Kapilesvara Gajapati. 

We may stop for a while for an account of the impressions 
gathered by Marco Polo, that ‘ prince of medieval travellers \ who 
spent several months in South India and used them very well. 
The name by which the country was known to foreigners was 
Ma’bar, a word which in Arabic signifies ‘ passage ’ or ferry, and 
was applied to the part of the Indian coast most frequented by 
travellers and merchants from Arabia and the Persian Gulf. Ma’bar 
* extends in length from Kulam (Quilon) to Nilawar (Nellore) 



214 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


says a contemporary Muslim chronicler. Writing on Kayal, the 
chief emporium of the Pandya kingdom, Marco Polo says that 
the king to whom the city belongs * possesses vast treasures and 
wears upon his person a great store of rich jewels. He maintains 
great state and administers his kingdom with great equity and 
extends great favour to merchants and foreigners so that they are 
very glad to visit his city.’ ‘ It is at this city that all the ships 
touch, that come from the west as from Hormos and from Kis 
and from Aden, and all Arabia, laden with horses and with other 
things for sale. And this brings a great concourse of people from 
the country round about, and so there is great business done in 
this city of CaiL’ Marco Polo notes that a great part of the wealth 
of the country was wasted in purchasing horses, a statement fully 
confirmed by the observations of contemporary Muslim chorniclers 
who say that the unfavourable climate of South India and the 
ignorance of Indian horse-keepers necessitated large annual imports 
of fresh animals. From the earliest times, the Pandya country has 
been famous for its pearls, and Marco Polo gives a substantially 
correct account of the fisheries, adding that the king derived great 
revenue from them. * Moreover nobody is permitted to take out 
of the kingdom a pearl weighing more than half a sciggio unless he 
manages to do it secretly.’ Marco Polo describes at some length 
the institution of the King’s Trusty Lieges, the band of bodyguards 
sworn to defend the king with their lives. Amazed at the scantiness 
of the dress worn by the common people, Marco Polo exaggerates 
their nakedness and denies the existence of tailors in the country, 
though tailors are mentioned in inscriptions long preceding Marco 
Polo’s visit. He mentions the custom of sati and refers to the 
practice of allowing a condemned criminal who was sentenced to 
death to sacrifice himself to some god or other of his choice. He 
says quaintly: And let me tell you the people of this country have 
a custom of rubbing their houses all over with cowdung. More* 
over all of them, great and small, king and barons included, do sit 
upon the ground only. ... It is their practice that everyone, male 
and female, do wash the body twice every day; and those who do 
not wash are looked on much as we look on the Patarins. You 

must know that in eating, they use the right hand only So also 

they drink only from drinking vessels, and every man hath his 
own; nor will anyone drink from another’s vessel. And when 
they drink they do not put the vessel to the lips but hold it aloft 


THE AGE OF THE FOUR KINGDOMS 


215 


and let the drink spout into the mouth. . . . They are very strict in 
executing justice upon criminals and as strict in abstaining from 
wine. Indeed they have made a rule that wine-drinkers and 
seafaring men are never to be accepted as sureties.’ He mentions 
the custom by which a creditor drew a circle round his defaulting 
debtor and 4 the latter must not pass out of this circle until he shall 
have satisfied the claim, or given security for its discharge He 
mentions the presence of experts in the arts of physiognomy, 
astrology and sorcery, and the readiness of people to consult them. 
He refers to temples as 4 certain abbeys in which are gods and 
goddesses to whom many young girls are consecrated ’ ( devadasis ). 
He notices the widespread use of betel leaves with camphor and 
other aromatic spices mixed with quicklime. He notes that ‘ the 
nobles and great folks slept on beds made of very light cane work, 
hanging from the ceiling by cords for fear of tarantulas and other 
vermin; while the common folk slept on the streets \ 

He mentions the richness of Ceylon in precious stones and 
narrates the legends he heard about Adam’s Peak. He records the 
embassy sent to Ceylon in 1284 by Kublai Khan to get from there 
some of the hair and teeth of Adam. He sets down in detail the 
legends narrated to him of St Thomas the Apostle, and the manner 
of his death in the neighbourhood of Mylapore. He knew that 
the Andhra country was ruled by a queen (Rudramba), a lady of 
much discretion, and he describes the different methods by which 
diamonds were gathered from the mines in her kingdom. He 
adds: 4 In this kingdom also are made the best and most delicate 
buckrams and those of the highest price; in short, they look like 
tissue of spider’s web! There is no king nor queen in the world but 
might be glad to wear them. The people have also the largest sheep 
in the world, and great abundance of all the necessaries of life ’. 

He notices the presence of Jews and Christians in the kingdom 
of Quilon and says that the king was tributary to no one. Pepper 
and indigo were abundant in the country which was visited regularly 
by merchants from China, Arabia, and the Levant. 4 Cora they have 
none but rice. So also their wine they made from (palm-) sugar; 
capital drink it is, and very speedily it makes a man drunk. All other 
necessaries of a man's life they have in great plenty and cheapness/ 
In the kingdom of Eli (Mount D’Ely), pepper and ginger and 
other spices in quantities were to be had, but any merchant ship 
touching its ports by stress of weather was seized and had its cargo

plundered. Piracy was rampant throughout the Malabar coast. 
* The ships that come from the East bring copper in ballast. They 
also bring hither clothes of silk and gold and sandals: also gold and 
silver, cloves and spikenard, and other fine spices for which there 
is a demand here and exchange them for products of these 
countries/

din — Firuz — Ala-ud-din II Ahmad — Humayun — Nizam Shah — Muhammad 
III — Mahmud — end of the Bahmanl kingdom — nominal rule of the four sons 
of Mahmud. 

The sultanate of Delhi was established towards the close of the 
twelfth century, and for a hundred years thereafter its attention 
was confined to Northern India. The idea of subjugating the 
Deccan and the land beyond began with the Khiljis, although the 
first Muslim attack on a Deccani kingdom was a quasi-private 
enterprise planned in secret and carried out with suddenness. The 
story is that Garshasp Malik, the future Ala-ud-din, nephew and 
son-in-law of Sultan Jalal-ud-din, resented the supercilious conduct 
of his wife towards him and wanted to punish her. Before he 
could do so, however, he had first to gather strength and resources 
enough to be able to oppose the sultan and his sons. First he 
obtained the sultan’s permission to lead an expedition against 
Maiwa, but in fact went much farther south and advanced rapidly 
against the Yadava kingdom of Devagiri (February 1296) at a 
time when its army was engaged on a distant expedition. The 
reigning king, Ramadeva, was overwhelmed by the swiftness of 
the onslaught, and sued for peace at the end of a week’s siege of 
his capital. He surrendered much treasure and many elephants 
and horses, and even gave one of his daughters in marriage to the 
conqueror. When Sangama, his son, heard of the threat to the 
capital, he hastened back with his army and wanted to resume 
hostilities. By the time he arrived, however, peace had been 


BAHMANlS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 219 


concluded, Ramadeva was in the hands of the enemy, and Sangama 
himself also had to make his submission, at least for the time. 
Ramadeva’s kingdom was restored and he and Ala-ud-din ex- 
changed vows of lifelong friendship. The treasure he took from 
Devagiri played no small part in paving Ala-ud-din’s way to the 
throne which he seized soon after by murdering Jalal-ud-din. 

As sultan, Ala-ud-din pursued a policy of plunder and loot in 
the South in preference to the extension of his territories. In 
1303-4 he sent an expedition against Warangal by way of Bengal. 
It was led by Malik Fakhr-ud-din Juna (later Muhammad bin 
Tughlak) and ended in failure; the Telugu army met the invader 
before he could reach Warangal, inflicted severe losses on him, 
and compelled him to retreat. This disaster so lowered the prestige 
of the sultanate in the Deccan, that Sangama of Devagiri withheld 
the tribute his father had agreed to pay and gave shelter to the 
refugee king of Gujarat and his daughter who had fled their country 
to escape falling into the hands of the sultan’s forces. Either out 
. of loyalty to Ala-ud-din or pursuit of a deeper policy, Ramadeva 
denounced his son, and asked Ala-ud-din to take steps to restore 
his authority before it was too late. An army was sent immediately 
(1307) under the sultan’s favourite slave Malik Kafur; Sangama 
was defeated near Devagiri and fled. Malik Kafur plundered the 
city, took possession of the kingdom in the name of his master 
and carried off Ramadeva and his family as prisoners to Delhi. 
But the sultan treated Ramadeva with great kindness; he kept him 
by his side for six months before sending him back, loaded with 
money and presents, to rule over a kingdom extended by the addi- 
tion of portions of Gujarat. The sultan’s generosity was rewarded, 
for Ramadeva remained loyal to him for the rest of his life and 
gave valuable aid to his forces in their operations in the South. 

Late in 1309 Malik Kafur was sent against Warangal to wipe 
out the disgrace of the last defeat sustained by the imperial armies 
at that place. He first proceeded to Devagiri where Ramadeva 
was all attention to his requirements. Thence he crossed the 
Yadava territories and entered the Telugu country, reaching the 
neighbourhood of Warangal by rapid marches early in 1310. The 
siege of the double-walled city lasted a month; the outer fortress 
was taken by storm, and the consequent overcrowding in the inner 
fort made it imperative for Prataparudra to open negotiations with 
the invader. The sultan’s price for raising the siege was the 



220 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


surrender of a vast amount of treasure, many elephants and horses, 
and an annual tribute. Malik Kafur returned to Delhi with the booty 
in June 1310 where he was received with honours by his master. 

Early next year, Malik Kafur again set out on another expedi- 
tion to the South, this time against the kingdoms of Dorasamudra 
and Ma’bar, i.e., the Hoysala and Pandya kingdoms in the far 
South. Devagiri again became the base of operations, where 
Ramadeva was glad to offer help, for the Hoysala ruler, Ballala III, 
was no friend of his, having at one time seized some of his territory. 
Kafur’s army waited to attack the Hoysalas until Ballala was away 
on an expedition in the Pandya country. That land was disturbed 
by quarrels among Kutasekhara’s sons, and Ballala hoped to turn 
the situation to his advantage and to regain territory that 
Kulasekhara had seized some time before. Kafur’s advance was 
therefore practically unchecked and he spread destruction and panic 
throughout his journey to the Hoysala capital. Ballala returned 
in haste, but saw that resistance was hopeless, and overruled his 
nobles and officers who wanted to fight. He consented to become 
a tributary (zimmi) to the sultan and to surrender his wealth, 
elephants and horses. 

Kafur spent less than a fortnight in Dorasamudra, and then 
started towards Ma’bar. Ballala accompanied him and guided 
the army along the difficult mountain routes that led from the 
tableland to the plains. Though divided among themselves, the 
Pandya princes were at one in resisting the invader, harassing him 
incessantly, but avoiding pitched battles and taking care not to 
shut themselves in fortresses that might easily be reduced. Malik 
Kafur first marched against Bir Dhul, the capital of Vira Pandya 
in the neighbourhood of Uraiyur. The king escaped before the 
city fell into the enemy’s hands, and Kafur’s further operations 
were hampered by rains. He braved the weather, however, and 
pursued Vira Pandya who was reported to have fled to Kandur 
{not identified). On the way he seized a convoy of treasure from 
the backs of a hundred and twenty elephants, but even when he 
reached Kandur, and took it, there was no sign of Vira Pandya. 
He therefore marched to Kanchipuram (or Marhatpuri to the 
Muslim historians) where he plundered and desecrated the temples 
before returning to Bir Dhul. Thence he planned a sudden descent 
upon Madura, the Pandya’s main capital, where Sundara Pandya 
was king; but Sundara was forewarned and abandoned the city. 


BAHMANlS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 221 


taking his family and treasure into the country. At this stage 
Vikrama Pandya, Sundara’s uncle, came out of retirement to lead 
the Pandyas against the Muslims and inflicted a decisive defeat on 
them. Malik Kafur was * obliged to retreat and bring back his 
army but he managed to keep the vast booty he had taken from 
Vira Pandya and convey it safely to Delhi. He reached the 
imperial capital in October 1311 and later presented Ballala Ill’s son 
to the sultan, speaking highly of the help the invaders had received 
from his father. The Hindu prince was treated with kindness 
and then sent back to his father whose kingdom was also returned 
to him. The Ma’bar expedition was thus only a military raid, and 
not a very successful one at that; it had no permanent results, 
though indeed South India was drained of a vast amount of 
treasure: 4 six hundred and twelve elephants, ninety-six thousand 
wans of gold, several boxes of jewels and pearls, and twenty 
thousand horses according to Barni. 

About a year later, in 1312, Ramadeva died and his son Sangama 
came to the throne of Devagiri. His hostility to the sultanate was 
well known, and Malik Kafur was sent out with an army once 
again, this time to seize and annex the Yadava kingdom to the 
empire of Delhi. This was easily accomplished, without any fight- 
ing, as Sangama fled. Kafur behaved with moderation to convince 
the people that they had nothing to fear from their new rulers. He 
regulated administrative affairs with commendable wisdom, though 
in one respect he was inexorable; he insisted on pulling down 
temples and erecting mosques in their place. A great mosque was 
built at Devagiri itself and named after the sultan in accordance 
with his wishes. Nevertheless, considerable areas of the Yadava 
kingdom did not submit to the new rule, and the kingdom of 
Kampili proclaimed its independence under Singeya Nayaka and 
his more famous son Kampiladeva. This new kingdom included 
the present Beliary, Raichur and Dharwar districts, and three 
important forts — Kampili itself, Kummata and Hosadurg (Ane- 
gondi ?) — all on the Tungabhadra. Malik Kafur led one indecisive 
expedition against Kampili; and before he could make another 
attempt he was recalled to Delhi where he died in the political 
revolution that intervened between the death of Ala-ud-din (1316) 
and the accession of Kutb-ud-din Mubarak Shah. 

The same revolution led to the voluntary withdrawal of the 
Muslim government from Devagiri because Kafur recalled the 



222 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


lieutenant he had left behind. Harapala Deva, Ramadeva’s son- 
in-law, was thus able to re-establish the Yadava power for a time, 
but soon after his accession, Mubarak Khilji again marched south 
in 1318, with an army led by his favourite slave Khusrau Khan, 
resolved to retake Devagiri. The reduction of Harapala involved 
some hard fighting in mountainous country; he was wounded in 
the final encounter, taken prisoner and put to death — flayed alive, 
according to Barni. The sultan’s return to Delhi was delayed by 
rains, so during his enforced stay in Devagiri he reorganized the 
administration. Malik Yak Lakhy was made governor of Deva- 
giri; subordinate officers and collectors of revenue were stationed 
at different places, and garrisons posted at strategic points. An 
attempt to force a garrison on the Hoysala capital Dorasamudra 
failed. When the sultan returned to Delhi (August 1318) he left 
Khusrau Khan behind to deal with Prataparudra II of Warangal 
who had not sent his annual tribute after the death of Ala-ud-din. 
Khusrau therefore marched in, collected all the arrears due and 
easily restored the sultan’s supremacy. 

Shortly afterwards, however, Khusrau had to march south again 
to suppress the rebellious governor of Devagiri and then to bring 
the country of Ma’bar under Muslim rule. Malik Yak Lakhy had 
set up independent rule under the title Shams-ud-din and began to 
mint coins in his own name; but his easygoing and profligate 
nature made him thoroughly unpopular, so that the nobles of his 
court joined together to capture him and hand him over to Khusrau 
when he advanced towards Devagiri. The unfortunate rebel was 
sent, bound hand and foot, to Delhi, while Khusrau proceeded 
further southward. 

The civil war between VIra Pandya and Sundara Pandya con- 
tinued after Malik Kafur’s return (1311). Sundara fared so badly 
in the struggle that at first he sought Muslim aid which was given 
only in very small measure and availed him little. The ruler of 
south Travancore, Ravivarman Kulasekhara, who professed alle- 
giance to Sundara till about 1312, took advantage of the confusion 
to invade the Pandya country and marched as far north as Kanchi- 
puram. Vira Pandya seems to have joined him, and Sundara 
Pandya appealed to the Kakatlya ruler Prataparudra II for aid. 
A large army was sent in his support in 1317, under the leadership 
of Muppidi Nayaka, the governor of Nellore, who defeated 
Ravivarman Kulasekhara and Vira Pandya, compelled the former 



BAHMANlS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 223 


to withdraw into his own kingdom, and installed Sundara Pandya 
on the throne at Yiradhavalapattanam (BIr Dhul). Then came 
Khusrau’s invasion. The Pandya followed his usual policy of 
evading battle by evacuating his capital, taking his family and all 
his wealth with him. A rich Muslim merchant who stayed behind 
hoping his religion would protect him was robbed and insulted by 
Khusrau, and finally committed suicide. Nevertheless, Khusrau’s 
expedition was not a success. Rains hampered his movements; 
and, what is more, he himself seems to have contemplated rebellion. 
When this was discovered and disapproved of by his followers, he 
had to submit to being carried back in fetters to Delhi. 

The political revolution in Delhi which ended Khilji rule and 
ushered in that of the Tughlaks gave Prataparudra II the oppor- 
tunity of declaring himself free once again. His example spread 
and caused disaffection even in that part of Maharashtra which 
was under a governor of the sultanate. Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlak 
resolved, therefore, to do away with the Hindu kingdoms of the 
South one after another until the sway of Islam extended to Cape 
Comorin. He began in 1321 by sending against the kingdom of 
Warangal an expedition led by his son and heir, Ulugh Khan. The 
army marched as usual by way of Devagiri, laying waste the country 
and investing fortresses as soon as it entered Telengana. Pratapa- 
rudra retreated and shut himself and his forces up in the well 
stocked and strongly fortified capital city. The siege that followed 
lasted six months, at the end of which dissensions arose in the 
camp of the invaders, his lieutenants turned against Ulugh Khan 
and entered into negotiations with Prataparudra. The Hindu 
monarch agreed to let them go back in peace, and when they did 
so, he fell upon the rump of the army under Ulugh Khan and 
compelled it also to retreat. Nor was it left in peace until Ulugh 
Khan entered into negotiations with the rebel section of his army 
and succeeded in interposing it between himself and the Warangal 
forces, so that his further retreat to Devagiri might be unhampered. 
On his way, however, he came by another section of the army which, 
under the command of Majir Abu Rija, was engaged in the vain 
attempt to reduce the fortress of Kotgir. Majir was cordial to 
Ulugh Khan and offered to help him in dealing with his rebel 
lieutenants; he sent instructions round that zamindars and heads 
of districts were to attack the rebels, seize them and send their 
chiefs to the court of the king. He then accompanied Ulugh Khan 



224 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


back to Devagiri. His way of dealing with the rebels proved 
effective; some of them fell fighting, others fled and hid themselves, 
and others were caught and sent to Delhi to be executed under the 
orders of the sultan. 

Elated by his success against the invader, Prataparudra dispersed 
the troops and provisions he had gathered in his capital, and acted 
as if he had secured perpetual immunity from further attack. To 
Ghiyas-ud-din, on the other hand, the failure of his son in Telen- 
gana was but a spur to a further and stronger effort to reduce that 
country. He sent large reinforcements to Devagiri, and Ulugh 
Khan soon led a second expedition against the Kakatiya kingdom. 
Bidar on its western frontier and several other forts including 
Bodhan were captured by the invading troops, and Warangal itself 
invested. Ill-prepared as Prataparudra was, he held out for five 
months after which famine compelled him to sue for peace. He 
delivered himself and his family into the hands of Ulugh Khan 
(1323) who sent him under a strong escort to Delhi, but he seems 
to have put an end to his own life on the way. Ulugh Khan 
plundered and devastated Warangal, and subjugated the rest of 
the country by fighting where resistance was offered, but generally 
by accepting the submission of the Hindu chieftains in the different 
localities. 

Ulugh Khan also sent an army into Ma’bar. The country was 
conquered and, for a time, brought under the sway of Delhi, 
whither the Pandya king, Parakramadeva, was taken as a prisoner. 
Ma’bar, in fact, was still counted as a province of the Delhi empire 
when sultan Muhammad bin Tughlak made Devagiri its capital 
in 1326. Ulugh Khan led yet another expedition against Jajnagar 
in the Ganga kingdom of Orissa. Here his aim was not so much 
to conquer that kingdom as to secure the frontier of Warangal on 
that side. 

Thus at the accession of Muhammad bin Tughlak considerable 
portions of the Deccan and South India acknowledged the sover- 
eignty of the Delhi sultanate. Devagiri and Warangal were under 
the effective control of imperial officers, and a viceroy was set over 
distant Ma’bar charged with the duty of consolidating the new 
conquests and firmly establishing and extending imperial authority. 
Prominent among the Hindu states that still continued to enjoy 
their independence were Kampili and Dorasamudra. The famous 
king of Kampili, himself called Kampiladeva, rose to prominence 



BAHMANIS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 225 


in the first years of the fourteenth century when he rendered 
valuable service to his suzerain Ramadeva of Devagiri in the wars 
against Hoysala Ballala III. He was a consistent opponent of the 
growing power of Islam in the South, but was much hampered by 
his feuds with the neighbouring states of Dorasamudra and 
Warangal. All the same, he built up a kingdom of considerable 
size which included parts of the present-day Anantapur, Chitaldrug 
and Shimoga districts besides Raichur, Dharwar and Bellary; the 
Krishna river separated it from the Maratha province of the Delhi 
empire. He treated with contempt a demand for tribute from the 
officers of the Tughlak sultanate, and entered into friendly negotia- 
tions with Baha-ud-din Garshasp, a cousin of Muhammad bin 
Tughlak and governor of Sagar, in the neighbourhood of Gulbarga, 
who had some grievance against his cousin, laid claim to the Delhi 
throne, and set up the standard of revolt. Thereupon the sultan 
ordered Malik Zada, governor of Gujarat, and Majir Abu Rija, 
governor of Devagiri, to deal with the rebel: A battle on the banks 
of the Godavari ended disastrously for Garshasp who fled to Sagar 
pursued by the victorious imperial army. He soon left Sagar^with 
his women and children and took refuge with Kampiladeva. i Mean- 
while the sultan had taken the field in person and come down to 
Devagiri where he got news of the defeat of Garshasp and of his 
flight to Kampili. The task of reducing the defiant Hindu ruler 
who harboured the defeated rebel engaged his attention at once, 
but it proved more troublesome than he had anticipated, and two 
expeditions failed to take the strong fortress of Kummata. The 
third attempt led by Malik Zada ended in success; Kummata was 
overthrown, and Kampiladeva was forced to shut himself up in 
Hosadurg (Anegondi?), which was invested on all sides by the 
sultan’s troops. Lack of provisions made it impossible for the 
besieged to hold out longer than a month; but meanwhile, Kampila- 
deva succeeded in sending Garshasp and his family to the court of 
Dorasamudra, commending them to the care of Ballala III. 
Kampiladeva met his end with courage and determination. He 
announced to his women that he had made up his mind to die 
fighting, and advised them to burn themselves in advance to escape 
falling into the hands of the enemy. They did so cheerfully, and 
their example was followed by the wives and daughters of the 
ministers and nobles of the kingdom. Thereupon Kampiladeva 
and his followers sallied out of the fort, fell upon the enemy and 
15 



226 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


wrought havoc in their ranks before they fell in the fight. Kampila- 
deva’s head was stuffed and sent to the sultan to announce the 
victory, and a garrison was posted at Hosadurg to hold the country 
round about (1327). 

Malik Zada then began to plan an invasion of the Hoysala king- 
dom in pursuit of Baha-ud-din. Ballala HI had no mind to risk 
his kingdom and fortune by sheltering a rebel Muslim sent to him 
by Kampila, with whom he had never been friendly. He therefore 
seized Baha-ud-din when he presented himself and sent him to 
Malik Zada, at the same time acknowledging the supremacy of the 
sultan of Delhi. This pleased Malik Zada who withdrew his forces 
and returned to Devagiri. 

For some time after the fall of Kampili, Muhammad bin Tughlak 
remained in Devagiri, making arrangements to complete the transfer 
of the imperial capital to that place. Also, after a siege of eight 
months, he captured the strong fortress at Kandhyana (Sinhagad) 
near Poona, and forced its Hindu chieftain, Naga Nayaka, ruler 
of the Kolis, into subjection. Naga Nayaka was treated with 
honour when he made his submission and the fort passed into the 
hands of the sultan who returned north very shortly afterwards. 

With pardonable exaggeration, Muslim historians include the 
whole of the Deccan and South India in the empire of Delhi in 
this period (1324-35). They divide it into the five provinces of 
Devagiri, Tiling, Kampili, Dorasamudra and Ma’bar; some adding 
Jajnagar (Orissa) as a sixth, although there is less justification for 
this. Each of these provinces had a governor ( naib ) set over it 
who was assisted by a military coadjutor in charge of the provincial 
army, and a kotwal who policed the capital of the province. Except 
in Devagiri, however, the power of the sultan was nowhere firmly 
established. Dorasamudra, for example, owed nothing more than 
nominal allegiance, and the bulk of the people — especially in the 
rural areas— was not reconciled to the new rule. The system of 
iqtas (military fiefs) by which the land was parcelled out among 
Muslim chieftains who had to maintain a quota of troops and pay a 
stipulated amount to the treasury did not make for peace or smooth 
administration. No wonder that this loose fabric crumbled quickly 
at the first touch of revolt which came naturally not long after. 

The movement for the liberation of the Deccan from the Muslims 
may be said to have begun immediately after the sultan left for 
Northern India in 1329. The people had never willingly accepted 



BAHMANIS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 227 


Muslim rule. At this time, moreover, they and their leaders were 
under the influence of a strong revival of Saivism and in no mood 
to submit passively to the profanation and destruction of their 
temples and to the corruption and overthrow of their long- 
established usages. In its single-minded devotion to Siva, its 
fanatical intolerance of the followers of any other creed, whom it 
stigmatized as bhdvis (infidels), and in its ideal of perfect equality 
among the bhaktas , the new Saivism was a worthy rival of Islam, 
and the impetus it gave to politics had not a little to do with the 
failure of Tughlak rule to take root in many parts of the Deccan. 
The abrogation of religious and charitable endowments, and the 
extortions to which the farmers and artisans were subjected by the 
sultan and his provincial governors, added the stimulus of material 
interest and strengthened the movement for liberation. Promi- 
nent among its leaders were Prolaya Nayaka and his cousin Kapaya 
Nayaka, the Kanhaya Nayaka of Muslim historians. Tradition 
affirms that no fewer than seventy-five lesser Nayakas heartily 
assisted them in their enterprise, the celebrated Prolaya Verna, 
founder of the Reddi kingdom of Addanki and Kondavldu, among 
them. By 1331, or a little later, the entire coastal region from the 
Mahanadi to the Gundlakamma in Nellore district had been freed 
from the Muslims, and Hindu chieftains had entered upon the 
task of restoring and reconstructing the civic life of the people on 
its old lines. At the same time, Somadeva, who claimed descent 
from the ancient line of the Chalukyas and became the progenitor 
of the later Aravidu kings of Vijayanagar, led the Hindus of the 
western Telugu country in revolt against their Muslim overlord 
Malik Muhammad, governor of Kampili. With the centre of his 
power in the neighbourhood of Kumool, he seized the forts of 
Anegondi, Raichur and Mudgal. As the Hoysala Ballala III also 
threw off his allegiance to the sultan and invaded the province of 
Kampili, Malik Muhammad was helpless. He told the sultan 
(as Nuniz records) that ‘ the land was risen against him 4 everyone 
was lord of what he pleased, and no one was on his side’; the 
people came to * besiege him in the fortress, allowing no provisions 
to go in to him, nor paying him the taxes that had been forced on 
them \ On the advice of his councillors that order could only be 
restored by someone connected with the late Raja of Kampili, the 
sultan sent Harihara and his brother Bukka to govern the province 
of Kampili after taking oaths and pledges of loyalty from them. 



228 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Harihara and Bukka belonged to a family of five brothers, all 
sons of Sangama. They were at first in the service of Pratapa- 
rudra II, but after the Muslim conquest of his kingdom in 1323 
they went over to Kampili. When Kampili also fell in 1327, they 
became prisoners and were carried off to Delhi where, because 
they embraced Islam, they stood well with the sultan. Now, once 
again, they were sent to the province of Kampili to take over its 
administration from Malik Muhammad and to deal with the revolt 
of the Hindu subjects. What really happened after their arrival 
in the South does not emerge clearly from the conflicting versions 
of Muslim historians and Hindu tradition. Both are agreed, how- 
ever, that the two trusted lieutenants of the sultanate very soon 
gave up Islam and the cause of Delhi, and proceeded to set up an 
independent Hindu state which soon grew into the powerful empire 
of Vijayanagar. They started by doing the work of the sultan, 
their former connexion with Anegondi making their task easy, 
though their Muslim faith set some people against them. They 
followed a policy of conciliation which pacified the people, and 
only used force where it was absolutely necessary. 

Gutti and its neighbourhood appear to have acknowledged 
Harihara earlier than the rest of the country, but a war undertaken 
against Ballala III was not very successful at first. Then, Hindu 
tradition avers, the brothers met the sage Vidyaranya and, fired by 
his teaching, returned to the Hindu fold and accepted the mission 
of upholding the Hindu cause against Islam. A second expedition 
against Ballala had better results, and left Harihara free to pursue 
his schemes of conquest and consolidation. 

Meanwhile important political changes elsewhere proclaimed the 
approaching doom of the Tughlak empire in the South. Jalal-ud-din 
Hasan Shah, the governor of Ma’bar, asserted his independence 
after doing away with the loyal lieutenants of the sultan, and began 
to issue gold and silver coins in his own name from Madura 
(1333-4). Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlak got news 'of the revolt 
and marched to Warangal, where the outbreak of an epidemic 
decimated his army and the sultan himself caught the infection. 
He therefore had to retrace his steps, having achieved nothing, 
and thus destroyed what remained of the prestige of the Delhi 
sultanate in the South. A false rumour that the sultan had died 
of the plague added to the confusion, and the rebels, both Hindu 
and Muslim, felt greatly heartened. 


BAHMANlS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 229 

Prolaya Nayaka was dead, but his work was continued by his 
cousin Kapaya. He saw that the considerable number of amirs 
and their slaves, the Muslim merchants and the numbers of Hindu 
converts to Islam scattered all over the country, might throw effect- 
ive obstacles in the way of his attempts to restore Hindu rule and 
Hindu dharma in the Deccan. He set about his work with caution 
and entered into an understanding with Ballala III of Dora- 
samudra, who was the most powerful Hindu ruler in the South at 
that time. Ballala strengthened the northern marches of his king- 
dom and prepared to meet any attacks from Devagiri. He also 
sent aid to Kapaya Nayaka in his struggle against the Muslims in 
Telengana where a defeat was inflicted on Malik Maqbul, the 
governor of Warangal, who fled to Devagiri, and thence to Delhi, 
leaving Telengana free from Muslim rule (1336). Soon after, 
Kapaya and Ballala together entered the northern districts of 
Ma’bar, the area known as Tondaimandalam. They ousted the 
Muslim garrisons from the forts of that country and entrusted the 
task of its administration to a scion of the line of Sambuvarayas, 
the native rulers of the region at the time. Other Hindu kingdoms 
came up elsewhere. The Koppula chiefs of Pithapuram made 
themselves masters of the coastal region from the Godavari to 
Kalin ga; the Reddis of Kondavldu formed a principality which 
extended from Srisailam to the Bay of Bengal; and the Velamas 
raised a small state round Rajakonda in the hilly tract of the 
Nalgonda district of Andhrapradesh. The power of the Tughlak 
sultans was thus completely broken all over the Deccan except 
in the Maratha provinces. In Ma’bar half the territory had been 
recovered for Hindu rule, and although the rest was held by a 
Muslim ruler, he was a rebel against the sultan. 

We may well believe that this general anti-Islamic movement 
did much to disturb the loyalty of Harihara and Bukka to the 
sultan and to kindle in their minds a longing to serve their country 
and their ancestral religion in the old way. Their meeting with 
Vidyaranya (‘ Forest of Learning ’) thus probably furnished them 
with the best and perhaps the only means of following the prompt- 
ings of their hearts; it needed a spiritual leader of his eminence to 
receive them back from Islam into Hinduism and to render the act 
generally acceptable to Hindu society. Thus it happened that the 
trusted Muslim agents of the sultan of Delhi, who were sent to 
restore his power in the Deccan, turned out to be the founders of 



230 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


one of the greatest Hindu states of history which later distinguished 
itself pre-eminently in the defence of ancient Hindu culture against 
the onslaughts of Islam. After establishing their sway over 
Kampili at first for the sultan, and conquering more territory in 
the same manner, the two Sangama brothers returned to the Hindu 
fold, proclaimed their independence, and founded a new city 
opposite to Anegondi on the south bank of the Tungabhadra to 
which they gave the significant names Vijayanagara (‘ City of 
Victory ’) and Vidyanagara (‘ City of Learning ’), the second name 
commemorating the role of Vidyaranya in these momentous events. 
Here, in the presence of God Virupaksha, Harihara I celebrated 
his coronation in proper Hindu style on 18 April 1336. He under- 
took the rule of the kingdom as the agent of the deity to whom 
all the land south of the Krishna river was supposed to belong, 
and his successors kept up the practice he started of authenticating 
all their acts of state by the sign manual of §ri Virupaksha. 

Ballala’s part in the establishment of Sambuvaraya power in the 
northern districts of Ma’bar involved him in continuous hostilities 
with the newly-established sultanate of Madura and this led very 
soon to the absorption of the Hoysala kingdom in the rising state 
of Vijayanagar. At Madura, Jalal-ud-din Hasan Shah fell by 
assassination (1340) after a rule of five years, and was succeeded 
by one of his amirs , Ala-ud-din Udauji, a warlike prince who 
planned an expedition against Ballala. The Hoysala monarch 
stationed himself at Tiruvannamalai in 1340; Udauji’s invasion 
came in 1341; but in the hour of victory an arrow shot by an un- 
known hand struck him and he died at once. Ballala converted 
defeat into victory, and for a time it looked like the end of the small 
Muslim state of Madura. The late sultan’s son-in-law was put on 
the throne by the nobles, but being found tin satisfactory he was 
murdered. The next ruler was Ghiyas-ud-din Damghani, a blood- 
thirsty monster not, however, devoid of ability. At the time of his 
accession, Ballala was investing the strong fortress of Kannanur- 
Koppam, after a decisive victory against the Muslim forces in the 
open field. The siege lasted for six months at the end of which 
Ballala acted with unaccountable folly and brought on his own 
doom. When the besieged forces opened negotiations, he consented 
to allow them to get into touch with the sultan at Madura to settle 
the terms of surrender; this naturally led to Ghiyas-ud-din’s march- 
ing quickly to the relief of the beleaguered garrison with some 


BAHMANlS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 231 


4,000 troopers, all he could gather in the straits to which he found 
himself reduced. Ballala was taken completely by surprise when 
his camp was attacked by the Madura army. Nasir-ud-din, the 
sultan’s nephew and afterwards his successor, overtook an old man 
and was about to kill him when one of his slaves identified him as 
the Hindu sovereign ; he was then made prisoner and taken before 
the sultan. Treating him at first with apparent consideration, 
Ghiyas-ud-din persuaded him to part with all his riches, horses 
and elephants; and then had him killed and flayed. 4 His skin 
was stuffed with straw and hung upon the wall of Madura, where/ 
says Ibn Batuta, 4 1 saw it in the same position * (1342). 

Ballala III was succeeded by his son Virupaksha Ballala IV who 
held his coronation in August 1343; but this is all we know of 
him, for his kingdom was overrun and annexed by the newly risen 
kingdom of Vijayanagar. Bukka had seized Penugonda while 
Ballala III was still alive, and his tragic end enabled Bukka to 
complete the work of conquest. He was firmly established in the 
vicinity of Hosapattana and Harihar in the middle of 1344, and 
4 the circle of earth belonging to the Hoysala family ’ had become 
4 an ornament to his arm \ The conquest of Tulu-nad on the 
west coast followed soon after; that country had been conquered 
by Ballala III and made part of his kingdom, but had regained its 
independence at the end of his reign. In 1345, or perhaps 
even earlier, it acknowledged the supremacy of Harihara whose 
brothers, in the decade that followed the foundation of Vijaya- 
nagar, were engaged in expanding their power over other territory 
and in bringing the smaller kingdoms under their suzerainty. 
As early as 1340, Badami had become part of the new 
empire. 

If the new danger from Islam was to be effectively combated, it 
was necessary that the power of the various Hindu states should 
be consolidated by welding them into one strong state, and that 
they should be prevented from continuing in their normal condi- 
tion of mutual hostility. Harihara had gone a long way towards 
securing this so that, in 1346, the entire family of five brothers and 
their chief relatives and lieutenants could meet at Sringeri, the 
seat of the Hindu pontiff, to celebrate the conquest of dominions 
extending from sea to sea by holding a great festival ( vijayotsava ) 
in the presence of the most eminent spiritual leader of the Hindu 
community. 



232 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


But the very next year (1347) witnessed the birth of the Muslim 
sultanate of the Deccan which made the danger from Islam to the 
Hindu culture of the South much more immediate and constant. 
Harihara and his brothers had not entered upon their work a day 
too soon. In the rest of this chapter we shall trace the rise and 
history of the Bahmani sultanate, reserving the further history of 
Vijayanagar for the next. 

The Bahmani kingdom arose out of one of the many revolts 
that broke up the Tughlak empire towards the close of the reign 
of Muhammad bin Tughlak. The numerous foreign officials of 
the revenue department in the province of Daulatabad fell under 
the suspicion of the sultan because they had failed to collect the 
enormous revenue which they were required to make up; these 
‘ amirs of the hundred * or ‘ centurions ’ were sent under escort by 
the governor of Daulatabad to Broach in accordance with the 
sultan’s orders. But news of the sultan’s merciless killing of the 
centurions of the neighbouring province of Malwa reached them, 
and they were by no means inclined to submit tamely to such 
treatment. They therefore revolted at the end of the first day’s 
march, returned to Daulatabad, imprisoned its weak governor, and 
proclaimed one among themselves, Ismail Mukh, the Afghan, king 
of the Deccan under the title Nasir-ud-din Shah. An imperial 
army led by Muhammad himself soon made its appearance on the 
scene from Broach, defeated the rebels and shut them up in the 
citadel of Daulatabad. Some of them, including Ismail Mukh’s 
brothers, contrived to make their escape to Gulbarga under the 
leadership of Hasan Gangu alias Zafar Khan. After about three 
months, Hasan gathered a considerable army, including some 
contingents from Kapaya Nayaka of Warangal, and marched to 
Bidar. Meanwhile, Muhammad was called away by a rebellion 
in Gujarat, and Hasan easily defeated and dispersed an imperial 
army after slaying its commander. As he approached Daulatabad, 
the royal troops gave up the siege and retired to Malwa. 
The aged and ease-loving Nasir-ud-din Ismail Shah, the new 
king of the Deccan, now readily abdicated his troublesome 
charge in favour of Hasan who proclaimed himself ruler of the 
Deccan on 3 August 1347 under the name Sultan Abu’l Muzaffar 
Ala-ud-din Bahman Shah. He is said to have traced his descent 
from a half-mythical hero of Persia, Bahman, the son of Isfandiyar. 
Ferishta, however, records that he called himself Gangu Bahmani, 



BAHMANlS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 233 

in honour of the Brahmin Gangu whose slave he had formerly 
been. 

Sultan Ala-ud-din Bahman Shah reigned for eleven years till his 
death in February 1358. He spent most of his time waging war 
or conducting negotiations calculated to extend the territory under 
his sway. He had to encounter much opposition at first from 
nobles who were or professed to be loyal to their Tughlak suzerain. 
By a judicious mixture of force and clemency, Ala-ud-din changed 
the situation in a few years. Even Kapaya Nayaka of Warangal 
had to surrender the fort of Kaulas and promise him tribute. As 
early as 1349 he attacked the territory of Vijayanagar and captured 
Karaichur. Five years later, as a result of an understanding with 
the new sultan of Madura who was a relative of his, Ala-ud-din 
attacked Vijayanagar a second time. While Muslim accounts 
claim for him the conquest of all territory up to the Tungabhadra, 
Hindu sources say that Harihara I inflicted a defeat on the sultan. 
However that may be, Ala-ud-din had become master of an exten- 
sive kingdom when he died. It extended up to the sea on the west 
and included the ports of Goa and Dabhol, the eastern limit was 
marked by Bhongir, while the Penganga and Krishna rivers bound- 
ed the kingdom on the north and the south. He gained recognition 
from the caliph, and his coin legend, ‘ A second Alexander shows 
that he had further designs of conquest. He made Gulbarga his 
capital, and began adorning it with fine buildings. He organized 
the administration of the kingdom by dividing it into four provinces 
(tarafs) each under a governor; three were named after their chief 
cities — Gulbarga, Daulatabad, and Bidar — and the fourth was 
Berar. 

Ala-ud-din was followed on the throne by his eldest son, 
Muhammad I (1358-77), a diligent and methodical administrator 
whose institutions long survived him and influenced the polity of 
later kingdoms. He established a council of eight ministers includ- 
ing the Peshwa, and greatly decentralized the provincial adminis- 
tration — a step that made for efficiency and sound government so 
long as the king was strong and undertook frequent tours of the 
realm, but led ultimately to its dismemberment. He reorganized 
the bodyguard into four reliefs ( naubats ), each doing duty by turns 
for four days at a time. He took strong measures for the 
suppression of highway robbery, and no fewer than 20,000 brigands 
lost their lives before the sultan was satisfied that the safety of the 



234 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


roads had been secured. The great mosque of Gulbarga was 
completed in 1367. It is perhaps the only mosque in India which 
has no open courtyard and has been described as ‘ a noble building 
impressive in its massive solidity \ He secured recognition from 
the puppet caliph of Egypt as a result of his mother’s journey to 
Mecca (1361). 

Muhammad waged wars with Telengana and Vijayanagar and 
had to suppress a revolt in Daulatabad. The neighbouring Hindu 
rulers sent hostile messages to Muhammad — Kapaya Nayaka 
demanded the restoration of Kaulas, and Bukka the cession of the 
Raichur doab, both conquered from them by his predecessor, and 
threatened to join Delhi in taking measures against him. Muham- 
mad merely detained their messengers for eighteeen months, during 
which time he completed his preparations. He then sent back 
haughty answers calling upon his ‘ vassals 5 to explain their failure 
to make the customary offerings at his accession, and to make it 
good by sending him all their elephants laden with gold, jewels and 
other treasure. Kapaya Nayaka’s reply was to send an army under 
his son Vinayak Deo (or Nagdev according to some accounts) 
against Kaulas, aided by a body of 20,000 horse sent by Bukka. 
Vinayak Deo, however, was beaten back by Bahadur Khan who 
advanced to Warangal and collected 100,000 gold hurts and 26 
elephants before he left Telengana. This resulted in permanent 
estrangement between the two kingdoms and continued hostilities. 
For example, in 1362 a caravan of horse-dealers reported that 
horses meant for Gulbarga had been forcibly purchased by Vinayak 
Deo, whereupon Muhammad captured and executed the Hindu 
prince and caused the devastation of much of the Telengana 
country, though not without serious losses to himself. 

Nor was Muhammad without other troubles, for during his 
excursion into Telengana, his cousin Bahram Khan Mazandarani, 
governor of Daulatabad, revolted. He made common cause with 
Kapaya Nayaka and sent a futile message to Delhi seeking the aid 
of Firuz Tughlak. Muhammad sent an army against Daulatabad, 
while he himself took the field once more against Telengana. 
Warangal and Golconda were besieged; Kapaya Nayaka had to 
flee to the jungles and was only able to purchase peace by the pro- 
mise of fealty and the cession of the town of Golconda, much gold 
and many elephants. He also yielded a throne studded with 
turquoises meant originally for Muhammad bin Tughlak. On 



BAHMANlS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 235 


21 March 1365, Muhammad sat on the throne at Gulbarga, and 
celebrated the occasion with great eclat . He ordered, according 
to Ferishta, that the singers and dancers who entertained him on 
this occasion should be paid by a draft on the treasury of Vijaya- 
nagar, and despite his ministers’ remonstrances he insisted on the 
literal execution of this rash order. When his messenger took the 
draft to Vijayanagar, Bukka (Ferishta calls him Krishnaraya) had 
him paraded on an ass in his city, and then crossed the Tunga- 
bhadra and seized Mudgal. Muhammad was furious and inconti- 
nently marched against Bukka though only with a moderate force. 
Bukka withdrew with his cavalry to Adoni, leaving the infantry to 
face the enemy and defend the country. Muhammad plundered 
and killed the defenceless inhabitants in the villages before he 
retired into Mudgal for the rains. The rest of his army then joined 
him; he marched in the direction of Adoni and, early in 1367, a 
battle was fought at Kauthal, south of the Tungabhadra. The 
Muslims gained the victory, thanks to their guns and their cavalry, 
the Hindu artillery not coming into play till it was too late, and 
their commander Mallinatha being mortally wounded. Ferishta 
is very definite that guns were used by both sides on this occasion 
and that the gunners were generally Europeans and Ottoman 
Turks. After his defeat, Bukka eluded Muhammad’s pursuit for 
three months, and finally shut himself up in his capital. Not 
having the strength to besiege the vast city, Muhammad feigned 
sickness and retreated. Bukka ventured to attack him, but he had 
to retire into the city again after losing many men and some 
treasure. Muhammad then took to the promiscuous slaughter of 
all the inhabitants of the country and proclaimed his intention of 
not stopping until his draft was honoured by the ruler of Vijaya- 
nagar; the war was then ended by Bukka consenting to this. Four 
hundred thousand Hindus, ten thousand Brahmin priests among 
them, lost their lives in the massacre. So shocked were both sides 
by the dimensions of the slaughter that an agreement was made to 
spare non-combatants in future wars. Though violated on occa- 
sions, this agreement did do something to mitigate the horrors of 
the perpetual contest between the two states. 

Ferishta’s account of Muhammad’s wars with Vijayanagar can- 
not be accepted at face value. He retails as a cause of the first 
war an improbable story of a large issue of gold coins by Muham- 
mad which were melted down by the Hindu bankers of his kingdom 



236 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


at the instance of the Hindu rulers of neighbouring kingdoms. In 
his account of the second war he calls the Vijayanagar ruler 
Krishnaraya and mentions his general Bhojmal of whom history 
knows nothing. Again, according to Ferishta himself the Krishna 
river was recognized as the boundary between the two kingdoms 
by the terms of the treaty which ended the war: this virtually con- 
ceded the claim of Vijayanagar to the territory between the Krishna 
and Tungabhadra, which would not have been the case if 
Muhammad had been so uniformly successful in the war as Ferishta 
would have us believe. 

After the end of the war with Vijayanagar, Muhammad easily 
suppressed the revolt in Daulatabad; Bahram Khan fled and was 
pursued to the frontiers of Gujarat. 

Muhammad gets a good character from Ferishta to whom cruelty 
to infidels was, if anything, a commendation. The author of the 
Burhan-i-Ma'asir says that he died as a result of an ‘ irreligious 
manner of living ’, meaning perhaps indulgence in drink. The 
internal affairs of the kingdom during the reign were managed by 
Saif-ud-din Ghori, who had served the first sultan well and con- 
tinued in service till the accession of the sixth sultan when he died 
at an age of more than 100. 

Muhammad was succeeded by his eldest son Mujahid, who pro- 
voked a quarrel with Vijayanagar by demanding territory and then 
invaded that kingdom. Bukka adopted the plan of wearing out 
his enemy by avoiding battle and finally retired into his capital. 
Although its outer defences were carried by the enemy, they soon 
afterwards sustained a decisive defeat. A futile siege of Adoni for 
nine months was followed by peace. Mujahid rebuked his uncle, 
Daud Khan, for the inefficiency of his operations against the city of 
Vijayanagar. Daud Khan retaliated by conspiring to procure 
Mujahid’s murder on 15 April 1378 and made himself king. Within 
a month, however, Mujahid’s sister contrived to have Daud mur- 
dered, and Muhammad II, son of the youngest son of Ala-ud-din I, 
was proclaimed king. 

Muhammad II was a man of peace, devoted to religion and 
poetry. He sent large presents to Hafiz of Persia together with an 
invitation to visit him, but the poet was frightened by a storm in 
the Persian Gulf and would not continue his journey to India. A 
less amiable side of his character, however, is to be seen during the 
years of famine between 1387 and 1395, when the relief measures 



BAHMANIS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 237 


he organized were confined to his Muslim subjects. Muhammad II 
died of a fever in April 1397 and was succeeded by his elder son — 
Ghiyas-ud-din, a strong-willed and indiscreet youth of seventeen. 
Within two months (June 1397) he was dethroned and blinded by 
an angry Turkish slave, Tughalchin, who raised to the throne 
Shams-ud-din Daud, Ghiyas-ud-din’s younger half-brother, and 
made himself regent. Firuz and his brother Ahmad, sons-in-law 
of Muhammad II and grandsons of Ala-ud-din I, wanted to redeem 
the royal line from domination by a slave, and, after an initial 
failure, succeeded in overpowering Tughalchin and his master in 
the palace in November 1397. Firuz became king under the title 
Taj-ud-din Firuz Shah. 

Firuz had a vigorous body and a keen mind. Ferishta consi- 
dered him the greatest of the Bahmani kings, and the author of 
the Burhan-i-Ma' asir speaks of him as a ‘ good, just, and generous 
king who supported himself by copying the Quran, and the ladies 
of whose harem used to support themselves by embroidering gar- 
ments and selling them \ But these are exaggerated estimates, 
and there is no doubt that Firuz drank hard and his character 
degenerated as his reign advanced; he ruined his vigorous body 
by excessive indulgence in the company of women. He built a 
new city Firuzabad on the Bhima where he set up a harem of 800 
women of various nationalities; he was reputed to be a master of 
many languages and able to converse with each of his mistresses 
in her own tongue. Firuz made his brother Ahmad chief minister, 
and regulated the administration efficiently, not hesitating to 
employ Brahmins in important posts. 

In 1398, Harihara II invaded the Raichur doab, and there was 
at the same time a rebellion of the Kolis on the north bank of the 
Krishna led by a Hindu chief. The Koli rebellion was crushed, 
but the armies of Berar and Daulatabad that came to aid Firuz 
against Harihara II had to go back to deal with the Gond raja of 
Kherla who had invaded Berar. Firuz only had 12,000 horse 
with him as he advanced on the Krishna, while Harihara was 
encamped on the southern bank with a vast but ill-organized array. 
Firuz saw the difficulty of crossing the river for the attack in the 
face of the enemy, and Quazi Siraj-ud-din suggested a stratagem 
and offered to carry it out himself; he disguised himself and a 
number of his friends as a company of strolling performers and 
went into the enemy camp. In a few days they made a reputation 



238

for themselves and gained permission to perform before the son 
of Harihara when in the course of a dance with naked swords they 
suddenly fell upon the prince and killed him on the spot. Such 
confusion arose in the Hindu camp that Firuz was able to cross 
the river unopposed and Harihara fled to Vijayanagar, carrying 
with him the corpse of his ill-fated son. Firuz pursued him and 
took large numbers of prisoners, including 10,000 Brahmins, but 
released the captives on payment of a big ransom, and the war 
came to an end. Firuz now separated the Raichur doab from the 
home province of Gulbarga, and appointed Fulad Khan as its first 
military governor. 

Soon after, Firuz led a successful expedition against Narsingh 
of Kherla who had to surrender 40 elephants, much money and 
a daughter into the hands of Firuz as the price of peace. In 1401 
Firuz sent a mission with presents to Timur, and Timur issued a 
decree bestowing the Deccan, Malwa and Gujarat on Firuz. The 
rulers of Malwa and Gujarat were alarmed and entered into nego- 
tiations with Harihara II who now began to withhold tribute and 
defy Firuz successfully; fearing an attack from the north, Firuz let 
Harihara alone. Harihara died in 1404, and two years later his 
son Devaraya I started a war, according to Ferishta, on account of 
a pretty girl, the daughter of a goldsmith of Mudgal, who had 
caught his fancy. Devaraya’s attempt to seize her by force mis- 
carried, and he laid waste some villages in the neighbourhood of 
Mudgal. This act of aggression provoked Firuz who invaded 
Vijayanagar and attacked the city; being wounded himself, he had 
to withdraw to a fortified camp some distance away, from where 
he sent his lieutenants to ravage and conquer the country to the 
south of the city up to Adoni. Devaraya had to make peace on 
the sultan’s terms which included the gift of a daughter in marriage, 
the surrender of Bankapur as her dowry, besides pearls, 50 elephants, 
2,000 boys and girls skilled in song and dance, and a large cash 
indemnity. The marriage was celebrated with due pomp, but as 
the king did not accompany Firuz far enough out of the city 
when he left it, they parted in anger. Firuz secured for his son 
Hasan Khan the girl whose charms had brought on the war. The 
story of the goldsmith’s daughter is, however, unknown to other 
writers. ^ „ * 

In 1412, the Gond governor of Mahur rebelled against Firuz 
who marched into Gondwana but had to return without suppressing 



BAHMANlS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 239 


the revolt. About this time Firuz began to suspect his brother 
Ahmad of plotting against him, as the saint Jamal-ud-din Husaini 
prophesied his accession to the throne. Two slaves became the 
sultan’s favourites and received the titles Ain-ul-Mulk and Nizam- 
ul-Mulk. In 1417, an expedition against Telengana was successful 
in killing Katayavema Reddi of Rajahmundry in battle and 
enforcing subordination in that country. But in 1420 the attack on 
Pangal, which had been taken by Vijayanagar, ended in disaster; 
the siege of the fortress lasted for two years at the end of which 
disease began to decimate the ranks of the Bahmani forces. The 
success of Vijayanagar was complete on this occasion, and Firuz 
had to retreat leaving the southern and eastern districts of his 
kingdom in the occupation of the enemy. Firuz was completely 
shaken by this defeat and was henceforth a broken man; he spent 
the rest of his life in works of piety, according to his light, 
and left the alfairs of state more and more to the two favourite 
slaves. 

Ahmad’s position was endangered by their ascendancy, and he 
fled from the capital with some adherents, including a rich 
merchant from Basra by name Khalaf Hasan. On his advice, 
Ahmad assumed the royal title in his camp near Kalyani, defeated 
troops sent against him, and pursued them to the capital. Firuz 
was too ill to do anything, and his army deserted him in favour of 
Ahmad, who accepted his brother’s abdication and took charge of 
his two sons Hasan Khan and Mubarak Khan (September 1422). 
Firuz died within a few days, it was said, strangled or poisoned 
under Ahmad’s orders. 

Ahmad Shah (1422-35) richly endowed the saint who had pro- 
phesied his accession and had advised him on several occasions 
when he was in difficulty; he also rewarded his other friends, like 
the merchant of Basra, with offices and rank. He ordained that 
each provincial governor was to rank as a commander of 2,000; but 
this did not mean that the troops under him were restricted to this 
number. 

Ahmad proceeded against Vijayaraya of Vijayanagar to avenge 
the disasters of the last reign; a battle on the banks of the Tunga- 
bhadra was followed by the most ruthless devastations of Vijaya- 
nagar country. Indiscriminate slaughter and enslavement of the 
civil population, destruction of temples and the slaughter of cows 
were the special features of this campaign. 



240 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


In March 1423, while out hunting, Ahmad pursued an antelope 
until he was separated from his bodyguard. At this disadvantage, 
he was spotted by a body of Hindu cavalry, but was saved by the 
timely arrival of a detachment of his own troops under a faithful 
officer Abdul Qadir. The latter was rewarded with the title of 
Khan Jahan and the governorship of Berar, and his brother, Abdul 
Latif, became Khan A’zam and governor of Bidar. Foreign 
mounted archers played a great part in the rescue and were hence- 
forth a strong corps in the BahmanI army. The war against 
Vijayanagar was only concluded when Vijayaraya agreed to pay 
the ‘ arrears of tribute ’, a vast amount; his son Devaraya accom- 
panied the sultan on his way back as far as the Krishna. The 
sultan carried away many prisoners with him, among them two 
able Brahmin youths who became Muslims, one of them later 
becoming the first independent sultan of Berar, and the other the 
father of that Ahmad who founded the Nizam Shahi line of 
Ahmadnagar. 

In both 1423 and 1424 the rains failed and there was famine. 
Ahmad prayed for rain publicly on the top of a hill outside the 
capital and when his prayer was apparently answered, he was 
hailed a saint ( wali ). This, however, did not prevent him, at the 
end of 1424, from invading Telengana, where he captured 
Warangal, and slew its king. The governor of Bidar was left to 
reduce the rest of the country and extend the kingdom to the sea. 
This was the end of that Hindu kingdom. 

In 1425 Ahmad proceeded against Mahur, whose rebellious raja 
was enticed by a promise of pardon and then slain along with 6,000 
of his followers. Ahmad next led a raid into Gondwana and spent 
a year in Ellichpur, rebuilding the forts of Gawilgarh and Namala 
on his northern frontier, as a preparation for the conquest of 
Gujarat and Malwa which had been granted by Timur to his 
brother. To the same end, he entered into a close affiance with 
Khandesh, a small state over which both Gujarat and Malwa had 
claims of suzerainty. In his turn, Hushang Shah of Malwa had, 
by 1422, compelled Narsingh of Kherla, a vassal of the BahmanI 
sultan, to swear fealty to Malwa. In 1428 he invaded Kherla to 
collect tribute, and on Narsingh’s appeal for aid, Ahmad marched 
to Ellichpur. Hushang pressed on with the siege of Kherla, but 
Ahm ad was assailed by doubts about the morality of attacking a 
brother Muslim in defence of an infidel, and gave up the cause of 


BAHMANl AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 241 

Narsingh and retired to his own country. Hushang attributed 
Ahmad’s retreat to c#wardice, and pursued him with a considerable 
force, whereupon Ahmad defeated him decisively on the banks of 
the Tapti; 200 elephants and all the baggage in Hushang’s camp 
along with the ladies of his harem fell into the hands of the victor. 
Narsingh issued from Kherla and pursued Hushang’s beaten troops 
into Malwa, while Ahmad advanced to Kherla. There he was well 
entertained by Narsingh. He sent the women back to Hushang 
under a strong escort. 

On his return from this campaign, Ahmad stayed in Bidar for 
some time, where he was so struck by its situation and climate 
that he decided to build a new city near its ancient fortress and 
called it Ahmadabad-Bidar. This became the new capital where 
he settled in 1429. About the same time his eldest son, Ala-ud-din 
Ahmad, married the daughter of Nasir Khan of Khandesh. In 
1430, Ahmad ordered a wanton attack on Gujarat, then under 
Ahmad I ; the Deccan army was twice defeated, and an attempt on 
Mahim on the island of Bombay also resulted in great losses. 
But Ahmad BahmanI obstinately persisted in his effort so that 
there was much fighting in 1431 on the southern frontier of 
Gujarat, although the Deccan troops gained no advantage. In 
1432, Ahmad put his sister’s son Sher Khan to death, suspecting 
him of designs upon the throne. Sher Khan had been among 
those who had advised Ahmad earlier in his life to end his brother’s 
feeble rule and make himself king. 

The Gujarat war exhausted Ahmad, and Hushang of Malwa, 
who knew this, captured Kherla and killed Narsingh. Ahmad 
marched north to avenge this insult, but Nasir Khan intervened 
and made peace between them on terms by no means favourable 
to Ahmad. Kherla was acknowledged to be a fief of Malwa, while 
the rest of Berar remained a province of the Deccan. Ahmad then 
punished some of the petty chieftains of Telengana and restored 
order (1424-5) in the province ruled by one of his sons. He died 
in 1435 aged about sixty-four. Unlike his brother Firuz, whose 
learning had imparted a touch of scepticism to his outlook on life, 
Ahmad was a superstitious Muslim, with a tinge of fanaticism, apt 
to show too much reverence to any long-haired * saint ’. But he 
was not altogether incapable of enjoying wit and learning, and at 
his instance the poet Azari of Isfarayin in Khurasan composed the 
Bahman-nama, a versified history of the dynasty, now lost. ■ From 
16

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


such quotations as have survived, we know it to have been a rather 
poor imitation of the Shah-nama. Azari retinrd to his native place 
before Ahmad’s death, but continued writing his history up to his 
death in 1462; it was added to regularly by other hands till the end 
of the dynasty. 

The regular employment of foreigners — Turks, Arabs, Moguls 
and Persians — in the civil and military offices of the state gave 
rise to rivalry between them and the local Muslims, the Deccanis, 
who were backed by African negroes as well as by the offspring of 
African fathers and Indian mothers. The 4 foreigners * alleged 
that the disasters of the Gujarat war were due to the cowardice of 
the Deccanis, and the quarrels between the rival factions often led 
to pitched battles and bloody massacres. The 4 foreigners ’ were 
generally Shiahs while the Deccanis were Sunnis, and this added 
acerbity to their disputes which had no small share in weakening 
the BahmanI sultanate and its succession states. 

Ahmad the Saint was succeeded by his eldest son Ala-ud-din II 
(1436-58). He surrounded himself with foreigners and the jealousy 
and intrigues of the Deccanis were the source of mqch trouble 
during his reign. He sent his brother Muhammad to recover 
4 arrears of tribute ’ from Devaraya II of Vijayanagar, which he 
did. This success turned Muhammad’s head, and he demanded 
equal power with the sultan or one half of the kingdom for 
himself. The result was a war in which he was beaten, but he 
was pardoned and made governor of the Raichur doab and 
remained loyal to his brother ever after. 

Parts of Konkan were conquered in 1437, and the raja of Sanga- 
mesvar gave his daughter in marriage to the sultan, who preferred 
her to his first wife, the daughter of Nasir Khan of Khandesh. To 
avenge this slight, Nasir Khan invaded Berar, induced many 
officials of the province to take his side, and confined its governor, 
Khan Jahan, to the fortress of Namala. At this juncture, the 
Deccani party recommended caution to the sultan, while the Malik- 
ut-Tujjar Khalaf Hasan Basri, the governor of Daulatabad and 
leader of the foreigners, declared his readiness to take the field if 
he was given foreign troops and no Deccanis. He had his way and 
won a splendid success as a result of which the supremacy of the 
foreign party seemed assured; they took the place of honour on 
the right side of the throne, while the Deccanis were relegated to 
die left. 



BAHMANlS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 243 


Meanwhile Devaraya II had reorganized his army and made it 
an efficient striking force of all arms. In 1443, he invaded the 
Raichur doab, captured Mudgal, besieged Raichur and Bankapur, 
and laid waste the country up to Bijapur and Sagar. On the 
approach of Ala-ud-din, he withdrew to Mudgal, and Malik-ut- 
Tujjar was able to raise the sieges of Raichur and Bankapur. 
Three battles between the two armies followed in as many months. 
In the first, the Hindus won the day, while the Muslims won the 
second; in the third, Devaraya’s elder son was killed and his troops 
driven headlong back to Mudgal. Two important Muslim officers 
of the BahmanI army were captured and imprisoned ; but when the 
sultan sent word that the lives of 200,000 Hindus would be the 
price of these officers, Devaraya agreed to make peace and to pay 
4 tribute ’ regularly in future. 

Ala-ud-din’s character degenerated with age and he began to 
indulge in gross sensual pleasures to the neglect of public business. 
The Deccanis took advantage of this to compass the destruction of 
the foreigners’ party. In 1446-7, an expedition against the Konkan 
was organized, with Malik-ut-Tujjar Khalaf Hasan appointed to 
the command. The intrigues of the Deccanis with two Hindu 
princes, one of them the raja of Sangamesvar, brought about the 
defeat of the army and the slaughter of large numbers of 
the foreigners including Malik-ut-Tujjar himself. The survivors 
gathered in the fort of Chakan to the north of Poona, but the 
Deccanis followed up their game by bringing false accusations of 
treason against them and persuading the sultan to agree to their 
assassination. They then contrived to murder all the officers at a 
banquet, and to slaughter 1,200 Sayyids and 1,000 other foreigners 
besides numerous children, appropriating to themselves the wives, 
daughters and goods of their victims. The few who escaped, 
Quasim Beg and two other officers among them, managed, to 
convey to the sultan a true account of what had happened. 
Ala-ud-din was overcome by remorse, executed the leaders of the 
Deccani party, and reduced their families to penury. Quasim 
Beg became governor of Daulatabad, and his two companions 
were promoted to high rank. The foreign party regained its 
ascendancy, and in 1451 the king got a letter from the poet Azari 
of Isfarayin urging him to abandon the use of wine and dismiss all 
Deccani officials. He did both and began to take more interest in 
state affairs. 



244 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


During 1453 the sultan was confined to his palace for a time by 
an injury to his leg, and rumours of his death began to spread, 
Sikandar, governor of Telengana, rebelled and invited Mahmud I 
of Malwa to invade Berar and joined him there in 1456. When 
Ala-ud-din took the field in person, Mahmud, who had been led 
to believe that he was dead, retired to Malwa. Sikandar and his 
father were defeated and captured after a siege by Mahmud 
Gawan, a foreigner who was just rising to power, but the sultan 
pardoned them. 

Ala-ud-din died in 1458. While he drank wine himself, he 
sternly discouraged its use among his subjects. He built a free 
hospital at Bidar and displayed his piety by sitting through long 
sermons, and by building mosques with the material acquired from 
the Hindu temples he destroyed. Before he died he designated his 
eldest son Humayun as his successor. 

Humayun (1458-61) had an evil reputation for cruelty and the 
savage deeds that marked his reign earned for him the title of 
zalim or ‘ tyrant \ At the start of his reign, some officers made 
attempts to enthrone Humayun’s brother, Hasan Khan, and paid 
for it by death, imprisonment or flight; Hasan Khan himself was 
both blinded and imprisoned. Humayun favoured the foreigners 
and made Mahmud Gawan lieutenant of the kingdom ( malik naib ) 
and governor of Bijapur. The Deccanis, however, were not alto- 
gether excluded from office. There were two rebellions: one in 
Telengana led by Sikandar Khan and his father Jalal Khan, and 
another in the capital when the king and his minister were absent 
in Telengana. Both were suppressed with a maniacal ferocity 
unexampled even in the bloodstained annals of BahmanI rule. 
Neither the able minister Mahmud Gawan nor the talented queen 
Makhdumah Jahan (who distinguished herself greatly during the 
minority of her sons after her husband’s death) seems to have been 
able to restrain the excesses of the sultan. His subjects heaved a 
sigh of relief when Humayun died in September 1461, 4 assassinated 
during a fit of intoxication by his own servants, who were tired out 
by his inhuman cruelties 

Humayun’s son, Nizam Shah, was only a lad of eight at his 
accession, so his mother managed the affairs of state with the help of 
Malik Shah Turk, sumamed Khvaja Jahan, and Mahmud Gawan, 
Underrating the efficiency of the new regime, the Hindu ruler 
of Telengana and Orissa invaded the kingdom as did Mahmud J 


BAHMANiS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 245 


of Malwa also. The former was met and turned back twenty 
miles from the capital, Bidar; but the invasion of Mahmud I was 
a more serious danger. The Bahmani forces sustained a defeat 
near Kandhar, the capital had to stand a siege, and the queen- 
mother retired to Firuzabad with her young son. Relief came 
when Mahmud Begarha, the ruler of Gujarat, responded to 
Mahmud Gawan’s appeal for help. The Gujarat and Bahmani 
forces joined and together threatened the rear of the Malwa army 
which was thus compelled to retreat. Another raid from Malwa 
in the following year did not advance beyond Daulatabad thanks 
once again to the timely intervention of the ruler of Gujarat. 

The young sultan died suddenly on 30 July 1463, and was 
succeeded by his brother Muhammad III, then only nine years of 
age. The regency council carried on the government during the 
king’s minority, as in the previous reign, but Khvaja Jahan’s 
ambition disturbed the harmony. The queen-mother suspected 
his designs when she found that Mahmud Gawan was, in effect, 
banished from the capital and kept constantly employed on the 
frontier. She arranged for her son to order the execution of 
Khvaja Jahan as a traitor. She then recalled Mahmud Gawan, 
who had bestowed great care on the education of the king, to the 
capital where he became chief officer with the title Amir-ul-Umara. 
The queen-mother retired when her son was fifteen, and retained 
his affection and respect throughout her life. 

A campaign against Kherla, then in the possession of Mahmud I 
of Malwa, was undertaken in 1467; but nothing was gained by 
this, peace was made, and Kherla continued to be a fief of Malwa 
as in the reign of Ahmad the Saint. Mahmud Gawan, who still 
retained the government of Bijapur, undertook an expedition 
against the Hindu rajas of the Konkan, a country that was never 
completely subjugated by the Bahmani sultans. In particular, 
Mahmud Gawan wanted to prevent the rajas of Khelna (Visalgarh) 
and Sangamesvar from using their fleets off the west coast to harass 
Muslim merchants and pilgrims. By patience and the calculated 
employment of force and corruption he gained several successes, 
and finally captured Goa, then the best port of the Vijayanagar 
empire. This last victory was important not only as an achieve- 
ment against the permanent enemy of the Bahmani kingdom, but 
as giving to that kingdom a virtual command over the west coast 
trade, besides guaranteeing the safety of Muslim pilgrims to Mecca. 



246 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Mahmud Gawan returned to the capital in 1472 after an absence 
of over three years and was received with high honours. 

Before Mahmud Gawan’s return, news of a war of succession 
in Orissa, following the death of Kapilesvara Gajapati, reached 
Muhammad III in the form of an appeal for aid from Kapilesvara’ s 
son Hambar (Hamvira) against an usurper named Mangal, by 
whom Purushottama Gajapati, another of Kapilesvara’s sons* 
seems to be meant. Malik Hasan, one of the two Brahmin youths 
brought from Vijayanagar by Ahmad the Saint, was sent against 
the usurper whom he was successful in defeating and thus secured 
the throne for Hambar. Hambar was to repay Malik Hasan later 
on when he helped him to reduce the Reddis of Rajahmundry and 
Kondavidu. Malik Hasan’s achievements received due recognition 
when he returned to the capital, but Purushottama soon displaced 
Hambar and won the throne of Orissa for himself, Hambar 
consenting to rule in Kimedi as a subordinate vassal. 

The BahmanI kingdom now for the first time extended from sea 
to sea, and honours were fairly divided between the foreigners and 
Deccanis. Of the four provinces, two — Gulbarga with Bijapur* 
and Daulatabad — were held by Mahmud Gawan and Yusuf Adil 
Khan, both foreigners, and two others — Telengana and Berar — by 
Malik Hasan and Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk, the other Brahmin 
youth from Vijayanagar. Fathullah was friendly with the foreigners* 
but not so Malik Hasan; Mahmud Gawan was relatively free from 
party spirit. The leader of the foreigners was Yusuf, and round 
him gathered many foreigners who enabled him to complete the 
conquest of northern Konkan. This earned for him higher 
honours than Hasan’s who thus became more hostile than ever 
to the foreigners. 

At the end of 1472 the rajas of Belgaum and Bankapur were 
urged by Virupaksha of Vijayanagar to recover Goa for the Hindu 
empire. Muhammad III and Mahmud Gawan marched against 
Bankapur, whose ruler Birkana withstood a siege for some time 
and then surrendered; his territory was annexed and added to the 
charge of Mahmud Gawan. Soon after, the queen-mother, whose 
advice had been sought almost every day by her son even after her 
retirement, died in camp, and her body was sent to Bidar for burial* 
while Muhammad III halted at Bijapur as the guest of Gawan. 
She had been a steady supporter of Mahmud Gawan who felt her 
loss even more keenly than her son did. 


BAHMANlS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 247 


About 1476 the people of Kondavidu rose against their oppres- 
sive Muslim governor, put him to death and delivered the town to 
Hamir, an Oriya nobleman. The person so described by the 
Muslim historians was doubtless Dakshina Kapilesvara Kumara 
Hamvira Mahapatra, a son of Hambar (Hamvira) who had con- 
tested the throne of Orissa with Purushottama. Hamir sent word 
that the time had come for Purushottama to recover his lost 
territory, so he invaded Telengana and besieged Malik Hasan in 
Rajahmundry. Muhammad, however, marched across the country 
and relieved him, the Orissan king retired to his country whither 
Muhammad followed him in 1478, when he had to make peace at 
the cost of many elephants and other rich presents to the sultan. 
Hamir, who had shut himself up in Kondavidu, eventually surren- 
dered and was spared his life. Muhammad destroyed the great 
temple at Kondavidu, built a mosque on its site, and earned for 
himself the title of ghazi by killing with his own hand the Brahmin 
priests of the temple. 

Muhammad now spent over three years in Telengana, completing 
its subjugation. The province, which had grown administratively 
unwieldy because of the addition of so much newly-conquered 
territory, was divided into two, east and west, with capitals at 
Rajahmundry and Warangal. This was part of a general scheme 
of administrative reform planned by Mahmud Gawan; but Malik 
Hasan, who had hoped to become governor of undivided Telen- 
gana, resented the new scheme and resolved on the destruction of 
its author. 

Muhammad also planned an expedition against the eastern 
Carnatic ruled over by Saluva Narasimha, viceroy of Vijayanagar, 
who had helped Purushottama in the recent war. Malik Hasan 
offered to go with him, leaving his son Ahmad as his deputy in 
Rajahmundry. Ahmad, the better soldier, was then holding a 
fief in the Mahur district in Berar, evidently because it was felt 
necessary to keep father and son separated. He was now summoned 
from Mahur and installed in Rajahmundry. The invasion began, 
and Kondapalli became the headquarters of the BahmanI army. 
Here Muhammad left his son Mahmud with Mahmud Gawan, 
while he personally led a daring raid against Kanchipuram, 
plundered its rich temples, and slew a number of priests. The 
Muslim chronicler of this episode wildly exaggerates its results 
and writes that the BahmanI troops 4 levelled the city and its 



248 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


temples to the ground and overthrew all the symbols of infidelity \ 
On his way back to Kondapalli, Muhammad lost much of his booty 
to Narasimha’s troops, but succeeded in capturing Masulipatam. 

At Kondapalli, Mahmud Gawan completed his scheme of 
administrative reform. Each of the four overgrown tarafs was 
divided into two under separate governors. At the same time, the 
power of the tarafdars (governors) was much curtailed, because 
‘ several places in each of the eight divisions were reserved espe- 
cially to meet the king’s private expenses, and district collectors 
were appointed from the court to manage them \ Again, the new 
order was that only one fort in each province was left in the 
governor’s hands, 4 the remainder being entrusted to officers and 
troops distinctly appointed by the king and paid from head- 
quarters \ This was calculated to make rebellion difficult if not 
impossible. Thirdly, the allowances for the maintenance of troops 
were increased, but stricter supervision and control was introduced 
and pro rata reductions made for missing numbers. Mahmud 
Gawan also improved the administration of land revenue by 
organizing a proper survey and proper assessment. These reforms 
made him very unpopular with the Deccanis who held five out of 
the eight governorships. 

The hostile party carried to the sultan many tales against 
Mahmud Gawan, and as proof of their allegations, they contrived 
to get his seal affixed to a blank sheet of paper on which they wrote 
a letter purporting to be from Mahmud Gawan to the king of 
Orissa telling him that the people of the Deccan were weary of 
Muhammad’s tyranny and perpetual drunkenness and urging him 
to invade the country. They placed the letter in the sultan’s hands 
pretending that they had intercepted the messenger who was 
carrying it. Mahmud Gawan was sent for at once; disregarding 
the remonstrances of friends who sought to dissuade him from 
obeying this unusual call and advised him to flee to Gujarat, the 
minister presented himself before the king. Muhammad Shah 
sternly asked him what punishment was proper for one whose 
treason against his sovereign was proved. * Death ’ was the 
unhesitating answer. The sultan showed him the forged letter; 
the mini ster admitted that the seal was indeed his, but protested 
that he had not written the letter. The sultan paid no attention 
but 4 ordered his Abyssinian slave Jowhur to put the minister to 
death on the spot’, and so it was done (5 April 1481). Thus died 



BAHMANIS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 249 

the only counsellor of the Bahmanis who combined loyalty with an 
ability which entitled him to the rank of a statesman, and who served 
his masters with unswerving devotion for thirty-five years. In private 
life, Mahmud Gawan was simple, generous, charitable, learned and 
blameless, and he might have healed the feud between the 6 foreign- 
ers’ and ‘Deccanis’ but for the implacable rancour of Malik Hasan. 

Mahmud Gawan’s camp was plundered by the troops and the 
mob, and his followers fled, together with the other ‘ foreigners 
to Yusuf Adil Khan who was in the field. When questioned, 
Gawan’s treasurer told the king that his master had distributed all 
his earnings in charity and had left no hoard; he further accused 
the sultan of having shed innocent blood and challenged him to 
prove the guilt of Mahmud Gawan or at least get at the messenger 
who was supposed to have carried the letter to the king of Orissa. 
Too late the sultan discovered the truth and sent the body of 
Gawan for burial with honour at Bidar. But the king was now 
feared and distrusted by all the foreigners and the respectable 
section of the Deccanis, who declined to have anything more to do 
with him, refused to attend court or camp and saluted him from a 
distance when they did so at all. 

The king was thus thrown into the hands of the betrayers of his 
late minister and had to make it up with them, instead of punishing 
them as he had intended. Malik Hasan became lieutenant of the 
kingdom and his son Ahmad governor of Daulatabad in the place 
of Yusuf, who took the fiefs formerly held by Mahmud Gawan — 
Belgaum and Bijapur. Muhammad went to Belgaum hoping to 
conciliate Yusuf Adil Khan. When he heard that Narasimha of 
Vijayanagar was preparing to attack Goa, he wanted to go there, 
but his nobles would not accompany him. He therefore sent 
Yusuf Adil Khan to its relief, and himself returned to Firuzabad 
where he drowned his humiliation in drink. He formally nomi- 
nated his young son Mahmud as his successor and died at Bidar 
on 22 March 1482, crying out that Mahmud Gawan was slaying 
him. He was only twenty-nine at the time. 

Ferishta says that, next to Firuz Shah, he was the most learned 
prince that ever filled the BahmanI throne. He was a high-spirited, 
energetic monarch and a good soldier; and he had a number of 
competent ministers, Mahmud Gawan being the best among them. 
But drink was his arch-enemy which ruined his reputation by 
betraying him into rash acts and brought him to a premature end. 



250 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


He was in fact the last king of the line worth the name; five more 
followed him on the throne, but they were little more than puppets 
in the hands of unscrupulous ministers. 

Muhammad Ill’s son Mahmud was enthroned, at the age of 
twelve, by Malik Hasan, at a mean ceremony from which the 
nobility deliberately stayed away. Yusuf Adil Khan came back 
from Goa to Bidar to pay his respects to the new monarch, but 
suspicion and intrigue and the open fights between the Deccanis 
and his followers induced him to retire to Bijapur, leaving Malik 
Hasan supreme in the capital. An attempt by the boy-sultan to 
gain his freedom by having Malik Hasan assassinated failed, and 
he was more closely guarded ever after. It became well known 
that the king was a helpless prisoner, and the governors of 
provinces began to defy the orders of Malik Hasan, the malik naib. 
In 1486, for instance, the governor of Telengana rebelled, and there 
were also revolts in Goa and Chakan supported by Yusuf Adil 
Shah. It was not long before the king openly expressed his disgust 
with Malik Hasan who thereupon left for Bidar with the intention 
of capturing the treasury and winning the army over to his side. 
He was caught, however, and, under the king’s orders, strangled by 
Dilpasand Khan, the governor of the city. But his removal came 
too late; the king returned to Bidar and plunged into idleness and 
debauchery, neglecting public affairs. A conspiracy of the Deccanis 
to dethrone him in November 1487 was foiled by the intercession of 
the foreign troops, and the Deccanis and Africans suffered a terrible 
reprisal in the form of a general massacre which lasted three days. 

In 1490, at the suggestion of Malik Ahmad Nizam-ul-Mulk, the 
late Malik Hasan’s son, Yusuf Adil Khan of Bijapur and Fathullah 
Imad-ul-Mulk of Berar joined him in assuming the royal title and 
announced themselves free from the suzerainty of Bidar. Their 
example was followed later by Qutb-ul-Mulk of Golconda (1512) 
and Barid-ul-Mulk of Bidar itself. Such was the origin of the five 
kingdoms of the Nizam Shahis of Ahmadnagar, Adil Shahis of 
Bijapur, Imad Shahis of Berar, Qutb Shahis of Golconda, and 
Barid Shahis of Bidar. Ahmad’s motive was almost certainly 
disloyalty to the sultan who had ordered the murder of his father; 
but the others set up their independence because they could no 
longer tolerate a king who allowed himself to be swayed by which- 
ever ambitious minister held his favour at the moment. That 
post was then held by Quasim Barid who soon reduced Sultan 


BAHMANlS AND THE RISE OF VIJAYANAGAR 251 

Mahmud to greater impotence than ever, and some are inclined to 
date the rise of the Barid Shahis from 1490. 

Quasim Barid sought to bring the provincial governors under 
control, and proceeded against Bijapur after inciting Narasa 
Nayaka, the regent of Vijayanagar, to attack it by invading the 
Raichur doab. He also expected Ahmad Shah to aid him, but 
was disappointed, and Yusuf gained a success against him. 
In 1493, Mahmud Begarha of Gujarat complained to the king of 
the Deccan against the piratical acts of his vassal Bahadur Gilani 
of Goa. In his attempts to reduce him, Quasim had the help of 
Yusuf, Ahmad and Fathullah, all of whom were interested in saving 
the Deccan from a Gujarati invasion. Bahadur was killed and his 
lands were bestowed on Ain-ul-Mulk Kanani, specially chosen by 
Quasim as likely to hold his own against Yusuf Adil. 

There is no need to pursue in detail the intrigues, rebellions and 
faction fights that marked the remaining years of Mahmud’s 
nominal rule. In 1504, Quasim Barid died and his place was taken 
by Amir Ali Barid who, in the midst of many vicissitudes, managed 
to retain control of the king and foil his efforts to secure his 
freedom. Mahmud died in December 1518, and was followed on 
the throne by his four sons: Ahmad (1518-21); Ala-ud-din (1521) 
who was deposed, imprisoned, and put to death for his attempt 
to get free of the control of Ali Barid; Wali Ullah (1521-4) who 
met the same fate after a nominal rule of three years; and 
Kalimullah. The last ruler sent a messenger to Babur promising 
to surrender the provinces of Daulatabad and Berar to him if he 
would rid the king of the Deccan of his jailor and restore to him 
the rest of his kingdom. No answer came; but Amir Ali Barid got 
scent of the mission, and Kalimullah fled to Bijapur in 1527. He 
was received coldly there, and so went to Ahmadnagar where he 
died soon afterwards. His body was sent to Bidar for burial. 

Such was the end of Bahmani rule, by no means an attractive 
chapter in the history of the country. Among the eighteen sultans 
of the line, there were few who were not drunkards and debauchees 
surrounded by informers and self-seekers. Faction and party 
strife dominated court-life and sometimes led to terrible blunders 
like the murder of Mahmud Gawan. Some of the kings were 
bigots, and none of them had any genuine sympathy for their 
subjects who were Hindus. Something was done to promote irri- 
gation and agriculture, and though this was largely to increase the 



252 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


revenue to the crown, still it did good to the people as well. The 
Russian merchant Athanasius Nikitin who lived in Bidar for some 
time (1470-4) records: ‘The land is overstocked with people; but 
those in the country are very miserable, whilst the nobles are 
extremely opulent and delight in luxury. They are wont to be 
carried on their silver beds, preceded by some twenty chargers 
caparisoned in gold, and followed by 300 men on horseback, and 
by 500 on foot, and by horn men, ten torchbearers and ten 
musicians.’ The army and its leaders often sucked the country 
dry, and the people were helpless against them. The wars with 
the neighbouring Hindu states, particularly Vijayanagar, were 
marked by sickening horrors, and there were occasions when 
several hundreds were made ‘ converts \ Numbers of foreigners 
—Persians, Turks, Arabs and Moguls — came in search of trade or 
office, settled in the country and formed unions with the women 
of the land. All the same, the bulk of the population continued 
Hindu, and the number of Muslims in the former ‘ Hyderabad 
state * never exceeded fifteen per cent. 

The Bahmani sultans erected a number of well-designed for- 
tresses, and the cities of Gulbarga and Bidar owe their chief 
monuments to them and their ministers. The architecture of these 
buildings will be discussed in chapter XVI on ‘ Art 
The history of the five separate kingdoms that arose out of the 
Bahmani kingdom need not be pursued in detail, and will only be 
touched on in the next chapter in so far as it concerns their relations 
with Vijayanagar. Golconda and Bijapur were the most important 
among them, and had a longer history than the rest. Muhammad 
Kasim, better known by his surname Ferishta, wrote his celebrated 
history to the command of Ibrahim II of Bijapur (1580-1626).

The last chapter traced the rise of Vijayanagar prior to 1346 
and gave some account of the joint activities of the five sons of 
Sangama — Harihara, Bukka and their brothers. Mention was 
also made of the earliest conflicts between the Bahmani and 
Vijayanagar kingdoms which started from the time of the very 
founders of those two states. Now, in this chapter, we shall trace 
the subsequent history of that great empire which, by resisting the 
onslaughts of Islam, championed the cause of Hindu civilization 
and culture in the South for close upon three centuries and thus 
preserved the ancient tradition of the country in its polity, its 
learning and its arts. The history of Vijayanagar is the last 
glorious chapter in the history of independent Hindu South India. 

Harihara I who founded the empire also did much to shape its 
administrative system. Following the Kakatlya model, he organized 
the country into sthalas and nadus , and began to employ numbers 
of Brahmins as karnams (in preference to goldsmiths and velamas 
who had held the positions before). He also reclaimed to the 
plough large areas of land in the Ceded Districts. His reign must 
have come to an end shortly after 1357 as that is the last 
date occurring in the known inscriptions of his reign. Before he 
died he had already nominated Bukka, the ablest of his brothers, 


THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 


255 


to succeed him; indeed this ‘prop of the throne’ became joint 
ruler as early as 1346, with Gutti as his capital. 

Bukka I’s reign as sole sovereign lasted for exactly twenty years 
to 1377. In the field of foreign affairs his most notable act was 
to send an embassy to China, as is recorded under the year 1374 



SOUTH INDIA IN VIJAYANAGAR TIMES 


in the annals of the Ming dynasty. At home, there were frequent, 
and mainly disastrous, wars against the BahmanI sultans, Muham- 
mad I and Mujahid, as recorded in the last chapter. The accession 
of Muhammad II to the throne of Gulbarga in 1378 brought a 
welcome lull in the perpetual hostilities, for the new sultan was 
essentially a man of peace. 





256 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


In importance, however, the most notable event of Bukka’s 
reign was the overthrow of the Madura sultanate by his son, 
Kumara Kampana. Kampana had ruled the southern part of 
the empire as viceroy from the beginning of his father’s reign, and 
was ably assisted in this work by such famous generals as Gopana 
and Saluva Mangu. Kampana first made his power felt by the 
§ambuvarayas of North and South Arcot, and when he had reduced 
them to subjection he succeeded in enlisting their co-operation in 
his enterprise against the Muslims of Madura. The details of this 
campaign are not forthcoming, but an epic version of it is to be 
found in the exquisite Sanskrit poem Madhurd Vijayam (‘ The 
Conquest of Madura ’) by Kampana’s wife Ganga Devi. This tells 
us that while sojourning at Kanchipuram after his conquest of the 
Sambuvaraya, Kampana dreamt that the goddess of the Pandya 
country described the pitiful state of that land under the Muslims 
and gave him a sword dispatched by Agastya — the sword of 
Pandyan sovereignty which the Pandyan kings were no longer 
capable of wielding. The Pandya’s failure to recover Madura is 
the historic justification for Kampana’s campaign against the 
Madura sultan which history places in the years from 1365 to 1370. 
The image of Ranganatha, which had been carried away from 
Srirangam for safety during the time of the Muslim inroads, 
was restored to its original place in 1371. Kampana died in 
1374. 

The work begun by Harihara I was thus continued under 
Bukka I, and his sovereignty came to be recognized over large 
regions. The empire was divided into several rdjyas ruled over 
by princes of the royal family or by highly favoured generals. 
Such were the Udayagiri rajya (Nellore and Cuddapah), Penu- 
gonda rajya (Bellary, Anantapur and parts of Northern Mysore), 
Mulvayi rajya (parts of Mysore, Salem and South Arcot districts), 
Araga or Maleha rajya (Banavasi, Chandragutti and Goa) and the 
Tulu rajya also called Barakur-Mangaluru rajya , besides the Raja- 
gambhlra rajya and others in the south. 

Bukka I was followed on the throne by his son Harihara II who 
ruled for twenty-seven years (1377-1404) and consolidated the 
supremacy of Vijayanagar all over Southern India. The celebrated 
Sayana-acarya, the brother of Madhava, was his chief minister. 
Harihara replaced his cousins by his own sons as governors of 
provinces and sought thus to forestall the tendencies to disruption 



THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 257 

due to the ambitions of his more distant relatives. Thus Devaraya 
was made the governor of Udayagiri. 

In Telengana an important change had followed the invasion of 
Anapota, the Velama chieftain of Rajakonda, which had resulted 
in the defeat and death of Kapaya Nayaka sometime about 1369. 
Anapota was friendly to the Bahmanls, and this alliance spelt 
danger to Kondavidu and Vijayanagar. Prince Bukka II, son of 
Harihara II, led two expeditions into Warangal territory before 
the end of 1390, but failed to achieve any decisive results. Seven 
years later, Pangal was taken. This should have been an important 
gain, since it gave Bukka a forward base for future operations in 
Telengana; but it seems to have been lost soon after. 

Extensions of territory were achieved in other directions as well. 
In the north-west, the ports of Goa, Chaul and Dabhol were taken 
from the Muslims, as also Kharepatan; and the Krishna became 
the northern frontier of Vijayanagar for a time. The Reddis of 
Kondavidu were deprived of their possessions in Kurnool, Nellore 
and even parts of Guntur (1382-5); and the power of the empire 
in the southern country was strengthened by an expedition led by 
prince Virupaksha which even reached Ceylon and laid it under 
tribute. These successes, particularly those in the north, were 
doubtless due, at least in part, to the peaceful character of 
Muhammad II BahmanI and the confusion caused after his death 
by the mischievous activity of the ambitious Turkish slave 
Tughalchin. 

In 1398-9 another fierce war raged between the Vijayanagar 
and BahmanI kingdoms in which Firuz pursued the army of 
Harihara II from the banks of the Krishna to the capital. He 
inflicted great slaughter on the Hindu population, and only agreed 
to an armistice after collecting a heavy ransom for the numerous 
prisoners he had taken. The treaty which both sides then signed 
contained such vague declarations as that the boundaries of the 
two kingdoms were to be the same as before the war, and that 
each party was to refrain from molesting the subjects of the other. 
Widespread famine over a great part of the Deccan added to the 
sufferings of the people during this period. The tribute which 
Harihara promised to pay annually was withheld two years later 
when the Sultans of Malwa and Gujarat became his allies. 

When Harihara II died in August 1404 the succession was 
violently disputed between his surviving sons. At first Virupaksha 
17 



258 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


succeeded in securing the throne, but was soon ousted by Bukka II 
who ruled for two years (1405-6). Finally, Devaraya I became 
king and celebrated his coronation on 5 November 1406. 

According to the Portuguese chronicler Nuniz, Bukka II and 
Devaraya greatly extended the city of Vijayanagar, raising fresh 
walls and towers, and building further lines of fortification. But, 
says Sewell, their ‘ great work was the construction of a huge dam 
in the Tungabhadra river, and the formation of an aqueduct fifteen 
miles long from the river into the city. If this be the same channel 
that to the present day supplies the fields which occupy so much of 
the site of the old city, it is a most extraordinary work. For several 
miles this channel is cut out of the solid rock at the base of the 
hills, and is one of the most remarkable irrigation works to be seen 
in India. 5 

Early in his reign Devaraya was at war with Firuz Shah Bahmani 
— as a result, according to Ferishta, of the Hindu monarch’s 
infatuation for a beautiful girl who lived in Mudgal; but another 
account attributes it to Firuz’s determination to wage a jihad 
(holy war) against the Hindu monarch. The war went badly for 
Firuz at first but ended in a peace humiliating to the Hindu 
monarch who had to surrender the strategic fort of Bankapur, 
which commanded an important route from Vijayanagar to the 
Arabian Sea, and to give one of his daughters in marriage to the 
sultan. 

The Reddis of Kondavidu, who were possibly in league with 
Firuz, took their chance to attack Udayagiri and captured territory 
belonging to that province from which they were not expelled 
until 1413. 

Anadeva, a Telugu-Choda chief of the region between the 
Krishna and Godavari, was another ally of Firuz. To counteract 
liis influence, Devaraya entered into an alliance with his brother- 
in-law Katayavema, the Reddi chief of Rajamahendravarman 
^Rajahmundry). Fighting began in 1415 and at first went against 
Anadeva until Firuz came to his rescue and Katayavema was 
killed. Devaraya’s forces were also beaten so that Firuz was able 
to maintain his suzerainty in Telengana. Devaraya retaliated by 
capturing Pangal, thus threatening Firuz’s line of communication; 
the town was then subjected to a siege lasting two years. The 
defection of the Velamas of Rajakonda, who joined Devaraya, 
weakened the Bahmani forces, so that when plague further reduced 


THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 


259 


their strength, Devaraya won an overwhelming victory (1419). 
The Reddi kingdom of Rajahmundry recovered under Allada, 
Katayavema’s general, who upheld the cause of his master’s son 
Kumaragiri. KondavTdu, however, was partitioned between 
Devaraya and the Velamas of Rajakonda (1420) and suffered 
•extinction. In all these battles and wars, Devaraya was notably 
assisted by his son Vlra Vijaya Raya and his minister Lakshmi- 
dhara who is said to have saved the king from a plot to murder 
him. When Devaraya died in 1422, his son Ramachandra occupied 
the throne for a few months, and was then followed by his brother 
Yira Vijaya Raya. Towards the close of Devaraya’s reign the 
Italian Nicolo Conti visited Vijayanagar and his description of the 
city has survived to this day. 

The duration of Vlra Vijaya Raya’s reign has been variously 
estimated; tentatively it may be said to have lasted for about five 
years (1422-6). Nuniz says he ‘ did nothing worth recording \ 
His son, who in due course succeeded him as Devaraya II, was 
associated with him in the administration almost from the begin- 
ning. The traditional enmity with the Bahmanls continued, so it 
was not long before Ahmad Shah began a war against Vijaya and 
inflicted a defeat on his forces and great slaughter and destruction 
on the civil population of the country. The armies met on the 
banks of the Tungabhadra; Vijaya’s camp was surprised in the 
early morning and the king hurriedly made his escape to a 
sugarcane plantation. He was found by the Muslim soldiers; but 
they mistook him for a common labourer and, when they came to 
know of the sultan’s victory, they left him and hastened to join 
their friends. Ahmad Shah then overran the open country, and 
‘ laying aside all humanity, whenever the number of the slain 
amounted to twenty thousand, he halted three days, and made a 
festival in celebration of the bloody work. He broke down the 
idol temples, and destroyed the colleges of Bra hmin s/ Before 
peace could be had, Vijaya had to pay a vast sum as arrears of 
tribute, and to acquiesce in the conqueror carrying many of his 
subjects, including several learned Brahmins, into captivity. 

Vijaya Raya was succeeded by his son Devaraya II in about 
1426. Devaraya’s title gajabetekara (‘ Hunter of Elephants ’) has 
been explained in two ways — as a metaphor referring to his 
victories over enemy kings who were strong as elephants, and more 
literally as indicating the monarch’s addiction to the sport of 



260 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


hunting elephants. By about 1428 Devaraya effected the conquest 
and annexation of the Kondavldu country which had been in a 
weak and disorganized state after the death in 1420 of the intrepid 
Peda Komati Vema. He followed this up by invading the Gajapati 
kingdom of Orissa, possibly because the conquest of Kondavldu 
brought Devaraya into conflict with Gajapati’s subordinates; but 
before hostilities could proceed, Allada Reddy of Rajahmundry 
intervened and brought about peace between the combatants. 
Allada died shortly after this and was succeeded by his sons Allaya 
Vema and Vlrabhadra who followed their father’s general policy 
of aggrandizement at the expense of Kalinga. The accession of 
Kapilesvara, an energetic ruler in Kalinga, in 1435, naturally 
resulted in a Gajapati invasion of the kingdom of Rajahmundry. 
The rulers of Rajahmundry sought help from the Vijayanagar 
ruler connected with them by ties of political and dynastic alliance. 
Devaraya II responded, and his troops drove the Kalinga army 
back and secured a temporary respite for the kingdom of 
Rajahmundry until it was swallowed up by Kapilesvara after 
Devaraya II’s death. 

Devaraya also carried his arms into Kerala, subjugating the 
ruler of Quilon and other chieftains. The Zamorin of Calicut* 
however, seems to have continued to retain his independence. 
Abdur Razzak, the Persian ambassador who visited South India 
in this reign, states that although the Zamorin was not under 
Devaraya’s authority, he lived in great fear of him, and when he 
received a letter from the Vijayanagar monarch that the Persian 
ambassador should be sent to his court without delay he instantly 
carried out the order. The same writer bears testimony to the 
supremacy of Devaraya over the whole of South India, saying 
that his dominions extended from Ceylon to Gulbarga and from 
Bengal (Orissa) to Malabar. Nuniz asserts that Devaraya also 
exacted tribute from the rulers of Quilon, Ceylon, Pulicat, Pegu 
and Tenasserim and elsewhere. 

With the Bahmani kingdom, however, Devaraya’s relations 
continued to be hostile. Soon after his accession in 1436, sultan 
Ala-ud-din II sent his brother Muhammad against Vijayanagar to 
recover ‘ the arrears of tribute ’, and Devaraya had to pay a large 
amount. The Vijayanagar armies were so consistently defeated 
in their contests with Bahmani forces that Devaraya held a council 
of his nobility to explore the causes of Muslim successes and devise

means of counteracting them. As a result, Mussalmans were 
thenceforth eligible for service in his army and allowed the free 
exercise of their religion; a Koran was placed before his throne 
that they 4 might perform the ceremony of obeisance in his presence, 
without sinning against their laws \ Further, the Hindu soldiers 
received better training, particularly in archery. After this 
reorganization the army became a more efficient striking force. 

Abdur Razzak relates that while he was staying at Calicut in 
1443, a brother of Devaraya II attempted to murder the king at 
a banquet. The plot was a failure, however, because the king 
excused himself on the score of health, though many nobles fell 
into the trap and lost their lives. Ala-ud-din Bahmani II evidently 
knew of the conspiracy, and tried to take advantage of the con- 
fusion by demanding from Devaraya the payment of 4 seven lakhs 
of varahas 9 (pagodas). Devaraya returned a defiant answer which 
he soon followed up by an invasion of the Raichur doab. The 
campaign began very well; Mudgal was taken, Raichur and 
Bankapur were besieged and the country up to Bijapur laid waste. 
But the Bahmani forces soon rallied and compelled Devaraya to 
fall back on Mudgal. In the last of three engagements that 
followed, Devaraya’s elder son was killed, and his troops were 
driven back into the fortress of Mudgal. Two important Bahmani 
generals, however, were taken prisoners until the sultan threatened 
a wholesale massacre of the Hindu population if they were not 
released; and Devaraya did not feel strong enough to refuse the 
Sultan’s terms. 

Devaraya was a great builder and a patron of poets. Himself 
a scholar and author, he is reputed to have presided with con- 
spicuous success over many literary disputations. In one such, 
the Telugu poet Srinatha was held to surpass the poet-laureate who 
belonged to the celebrated Dindima family, and is said to have 
been bathed in a shower of golden tankas. 

Devaraya’s long, and generally prosperous, reign came to an 
end with his death in May 1446. He was succeeded by a Yijaya 
Raya II and then, very shortly after, by his own son Mallikaijuna 
who was crowned some time before May 1447. 

Mallikaijuna was weak and incompetent so that, from his acces- 
sion, there began a period of dissension, decline and confusion 
until the strength of the empire was restored, over forty years 
later, by the martial ability and statesmanship of Saluva Narasimha* 



262 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


The interval is marked by much agitation, discontent, and opposi- 
tion to the members of the old royal family, several of whom met 
with violent deaths. At the start of his reign, the Velamas made 
a new home for themselves in Velugodu (Kumool district) when 
their capital Rajakonda was seized by the Bahmanis and the neigh- 
bouring princelings then disturbed the peace and weakened the 
realm — a situation of which both Ala-ud-din II and Kapilesvara 
Gajapati took advantage. They laid siege to Vijayanagar; but, 
true to its name, that city defied all their efforts to capture it and 
the invading armies had to retire without accomplishing much. 

Kapilesvara, however, kept up the war, capturing Rajahmundry 
and Kondavidu before 1454, being aided in his enterprise by the 
Kshatriya and Velama chieftains of Telengana. His conquests 
extended up to Srisailam and included a large part of the Kumool 
district. He sent his son Hambar against Mahmud Gawan, whom 
he defeated, to capture Warangal in Telengana, and later, on 
Humayun’s death in 1461, Bidar. He then conquered Udayagiri 
in Nellore, and Kanchipuram and Trichinopoly in the southern 
provinces of the empire of Vijayanagar (1463). 

The Odda empire reached its greatest extent at this time, its 
influence being felt from the Ganges to the Kaveri. But unlike 
the Telugu districts, which became part of the empire of Orissa 
for some years, the southern lands did not pass out of the control 
of Vijayanagar, and the Oriya invasion of the South was only a 
sudden raid followed by speedy withdrawal. The sovereignty of 
Vijayanagar was upheld by its powerful nobles ruling in almost 
complete independence of the emperor Mallikarjuna; such were 
Saluva Gopa Timma, also known as Tirumalaideva Maharaja who 
held Trichinopoly, Tanjore and Pudukkottai, and Saluva Nara- 
simha, equally prominent in the centre and in the eastern parts of 
the empire. The latter was assisted by Isvara, an able soldier of 
Tuluva extraction. Mallikarjuna died some time between June 
and October 1465. 

He left behind an infant son, Rajasekhara, but the throne was- 
occupied by his cousin Virupaksha H. Virupaksha was the son 
of Pratapadevaraya, a younger brother of Devaraya II, and had 
been ruler of Penugonda for several years before he assumed the 
imperial crown. Nuniz records that 6 he was given over to vice,, 
caring for nothing but women, and to fuddle himself with drink." 
It is not surprising, therefore, that large tracts of land were lost 


THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 263 

to the Muslims including Goa, Chaul and Dabhol. The authority 
of the central government continued to decline, and total disrup- 
tion was, once again, only prevented by the initiative of powerful 
provincial governors. Most prominent among these was Saluva 
Narasimha, ruler of Chandragiri rajya , whose inscriptions begin 
as early as 1456. His dominions must have suffered during the 
Odda invasion of 1463, and he now began a war against the 
Gajapati and captured Udayagiri after a siege (1470). He sup- 
pressed a rebellion in the Tamil districts and, taking advantage of 
the civil war in Orissa that followed Kapilesvara’s death, he 
expelled the Oriyas from the eastern districts of the empire and 
made himself master of all the territory up to the Godavari. 
Kondavldu and Masulipatam fell into his hands before 1477. It 
seems probable that Narasimha helped Purushottama Gajapati to 
regain the throne of Orissa from which he had been expelled by 
Hambar with the aid of the Bahmarn sultan Muhammad IIL 
Narasimha and Purushottama had to face the hostility of that 
sultan, and the war that followed, in 1478-81, has been described 
in the last chapter. The Tuluva general Isvara particularly 
distinguished himself by recapturing much of the booty which the 
sultan had gathered by his daring raid on Kanchipuram. 

Virupaksha II continued to rule till the middle of 1485 when he 
was murdered by his eldest son. The parricide, however, declined 
the throne and had his younger brother, Padearao (Praudha- 
devaraya), crowned king. The first act of the new king, however, 
was to procure the assassination of the brother to whom he owed 
the throne, and then to plunge into debauchery and neglect the 
affairs of state. Saluva Narasimha saw that the only way to save 
the kingdom was to put an end to the old dynasty and to assume 
the royal title himself. He therefore commanded his general 
Narasa Nayaka to proceed against Vijayanagar and capture the 
city. 4 Nuniz gives us a graphic account of the last scenes ; how 
Narasimha’s captain arrived at the city gates and found them 
undefended; how he penetrated the palace and found no one to 
oppose him; how he even went as far as the harem 44 slaying some 
of the women”; and how at last the craven king fled.’ There- 
upon Narasimha was 4 raised to be king ’ (1486) and the kingdom 
came to be called after him. There can be no doubt that by this 
act of 4 usurpation * Narasimha and his supporters saved the empire 
from disruption. All the same, there was much opposition to 



264 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Narasimha’s elevation and he had to spend time and energy in 
fighting and subduing recalcitrant chieftains like the Sambetas of 
Peranipadu (Cuddapah district), the palayagars of Ummattur near 
Mysore, and others. He certainly overcame his internal troubles 
but they greatly weakened his capacity to resist his foreign enemies. 
For instance, when Purushottama Gajapati took advantage of the 
weakness of the Bahmani kingdom after the death of Muhammad III 
and conquered all the eastern coastal country south of Orissa 
up to the Gundlakamma river in the Nellore district by about 1489 
and even advanced to Udayagiri and laid siege to it; Narasimha’s 
attempt to raise the siege proved disastrous. Defeated in battle 
and taken prisoner, he only secured his release by agreeing to 
surrender the fort and the surrounding country. 

The loss of the western ports in the reign of Virupaksha II had 
^dislocated the horse trade of the Arabs on which the Vijayanagar 
army depended for its cavalry. Narasimha, however, revived the 
trade by conquering the Tulu country and manning the ports of 
Honavar, Bhattakkula (Bhatkal), Bakanur and Mangalore. ‘ He 
caused horses to be brought from Ormuz and Aden into his 
kingdom, and thereby gave profit to the merchants, paying them 
for the horses just as they had asked ’ (Nuniz). He also took 
steps to strengthen the efficiency and the martial spirit of his 
troops. 

He did not long survive his defeat at Udayagiri, however, and 
died in 1491. He left behind two young sons whom he commended 
to the care of his loyal general Narasa Nayaka, the son of Tuluva 
Isvara. Narasa at first made the elder prince Timmabhupa king, 
but Tymmarasa, a rival of Narasa Nayaka, had him murdered. 
The crown then descended to the younger prince, Immadi Nara- 
simha (1491); but Narasa Nayaka retained all real power in his 
hands as regent, and even assumed the royal style along with his 
Saluva titles. Friction thus naturally arose between him and the 
king which was increased when Immadi Narasimha refused to 
punish Tymmarasa, the murderer of his elder brother, as Narasa 
Nayaka wanted, but received him into favour. The breach between 
them reached such a pass that Narasa Nayaka marched with his 
troops from Penugonda to lay siege to Vijayanagar (1492), and, as 
the price of peace with the regent, Immadi Narasimha had to 
abandon Tymmarasa who was punished with death. The king 
was now removed to Penugonda where he was kept under close

265 


surveillance. It was indeed a second usurpation, which necessarily 
led to a crop of fresh internal troubles which hampered Narasa 
Nay aka throughout the twelve or thirteen years he was the virtual 
ruler of the kingdom. 

At his death, Saluva Narasimha had besought Narasa Nayaka 
to capture the forts of Raichur and Udayagiri, which had rebelled 
against him but 4 which he could not subdue because time failed 
him \ In 1492-3 Quasim Barid, the BahmanI minister, offered 
Narasa Nayaka the forts of Raichur and Mudgal in return for an 
attack on Yusuf Adil Khan of Bijapur, now an independent 
monarch. Narasa accepted the terms and sent into the Raichur 
doab an army which 4 having crossed the river Tungabhadra, laid 
waste the country as far as Mudgal and Raichur * (Ferishta). Adil 
Khan was in no position to resist the invader immediately as he 
had also to contend with other enemies whom Quasim Barid had 
set up against him at the same time. As soon as he had succeeded 
in repelling them, and found himself free to attempt the recovery 
of Raichur, Narasa Nayaka had to defend his recent conquests. 
Yusuf Adil Khan met with little success, however; he was defeated 
and forced to seek refuge in the fortress of Manvi, north of the 
Tungabhadra in the neighbourhood of Adoni. He then pretended 
submission and invited Narasa to a peace conference where the 
Bijapur ruler treacherously attacked him and his followers and put 
seventy persons of rank to death. The Hindu army fled and gave 
Adil Khan the victory; but the doab continued to remain part of 
the Vijayanagar empire till 1502 when, as the result of a jihad 
undertaken by the BahmanI nobles at the instance of Mahmud II, 
it passed into the hands of Yusuf Adil Shah along with the 
fortresses of Raichur and Mudgal. 

In the south there had been no effective assertion of the authority 
of the empire after the raid of Kapilesvara Gajapati in 1463-4. 
Saluva Narasimha had been too busy nearer home, and it is doubt- 
ful if his authority was acknowledged south of the Kaveri. About 
1496, or perhaps a little earlier, Narasa Nayaka marched south, 
controlled the tyrannical oppression of officials like Konetiraja, 
Governor of Trichinopoly and Tanjore, against whom the Vaish- 
navas of Srirangam had many complaints, and subjugated the 
whole land up to Cape Comorin, compelling the local Chola and 
Chera rulers, and Manabhusha of Madura, to acknowledge the 
suzerainty of Vijayanagar. He also attacked Srirangapattana 



266 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


(Seringapatam) after throwing a bridge across the Kaveri, and its 
Heuna chieftain Nanjaraja had to submit. Further conquests on 
the west coast and a march to Gokama (1497) closed this extensive 
and successful campaign. 

Narasa Nayaka again came into conflict with the Gajapati king 
towards the close of his rule. Purushottama died in 1496 after 
a reign of thirty years and was succeeded by his son Prataparudra. 
He attacked Vijayanagar territory with a view to conquering the 
South ( c . 1499). Narasa was quite equal to holding his own and the 
campaign ended without any marked gains to either side, and the 
boundary of the Gajapati kingdom continued to be to the south of 
the Krishna river. 

When Narasa Nayaka died in 1503, he could truthfully claim to 
have continued the work of his master Saluva Narasimha and to 
have imparted fresh strength to the empire. * He had established 
its authority effectively over the whole of its extensive dominions 
and had reorganized the army. Indeed he may be said to have 
laid the foundations on which his talented son, Krishnadeva Raya, 
built the glorious age that followed. 

Immediately after his death, however, his place as regent was 
taken by his eldest son Immadi Narasa Nayaka, better known as 
Vira Narasimha. The lawful sovereign, Immadi Narasimha, 
continued to be kept under tutelage, though he must in fact have 
been old enough to look after affairs. He was finally assassinated 
early in 1505, and was shortly afterwards succeeded by Vira Nara- 
simha, who thus inaugurated the third, or the Tuluva dynasty of 
the Vijayanagar kingdom. Nuniz notes that after Narasa’s death 
4 the whole land revolted under its captains *, and the murder of 
the king and the following usurpation could not have made the 
position of Vira Narasimha any the easier. His six-year reign was 
almost wholly spent in fighting and success did not always attend 
him. Yusuf Adil Khan again sought to extend his dominion 
beyond the Tungabhadra which he crossed to lay siege to Kumool. 
Ramaraja of the Aravidu family and his son Timma stood by Vira 
Narasimha, forced Adil Khan to retire and, by pursuing the re- 
treating army, inflicted a defeat upon it. They expelled the treacher- 
ous captain of Adoni, which they occupied and later received, along 
with the fortress of Kurnool, as fiefs from their grateful emperor. 

Meantime, the Heuna chiefs of Ummattur and Srirangapattana 
had set up the standard of revolt, and Vira Narasimha left his

half-brother Krishnaraya in charge of the capital while he marched 
to the south to lay siege to Ummattur. Failing to take the place 
after three months, he raised the siege and proceeded to attack 
&rirangapattana but with no better results. Some minor successes* 
however, attended him in the Tulu country. He also entered into 
friendly relations with the Portuguese who were just establishing 
themselves on the west coast, and sent an embassy to Almeida at 
Cannanore with a view to the better training of his armed forces 
and the procuring of horses for his cavalry. When Almeida 
wanted to build a fortress at Bhatkal, however, he sent him 
no answer. He tried to make his people more warlike by 
encouraging his nobles to settle their disputes by duelling, and he 
rewarded skill in swordsmanship by presenting the winners with 
beautiful girls. 

Vira Narasimha also tried to recover Goa. The Italian traveller 
Varthema recorded that the Muslim governor of that place was at 
war with the king of Vijayanagar (1506); but the result of the 
campaign is not known. He was concerting measures to renew 
his attack on Ummattur when he died in 1509. Munificent gifts 
to all the important*shrines of South India, such as Ramesvaram, 
&rirangam, Kumbakonam, Chidambaram, Srisailam, Kanchipuram, 
Kalahasti, Mahanandi and Gokama, are recorded in his name in 
the inscriptions of his time. Nuniz records that, while on his 
death-bed, he sent for his minister Saluva Timma and ordered him 
to put out the eyes of Krishnadeva Raya in order to secure the 
throne for his eight-year-old son, and that the mini ster satisfied 
the dying king by producing before him the eyes of a she-goat. 
There is, however, no evidence that the relations between the two 
half-brothers were anything but friendly, and indigenous tradition 
avers that Vira Narasimha himself chose Krishnadeva Raya for 
the succession. 

The earliest inscription of Krishnadeva is dated 26 July 1509. 
His coronation was celebrated about a fortnight later on the birth- 
day of Sri Krishna, to convey the suggestion that the king was an 
incarnation of the Lord. The reign of Krishnadeva Raya was 
‘ the period of Vijayanagar’ s greatest success, when its armies were 
everywhere victorious, and the city was most prosperous \ Krishna- 
deva was between twenty and twenty-five years of age at his 
accession. Paes, who saw him about ten years later, said: ‘ The 
king is of medium height and of fair complexion and good figure* 



268 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


rather fat than thin; he has on his face signs of smallpox. He is 
the most feared and perfect king that could possibly be, cheerful 
of disposition and very merry; he is one that seeks to honour 
foreigners, and receives them kindly, asking about all their affairs 
whatever their condition may be. He is a great ruler and a man 
of much justice, but subject to sudden fits of rage \ Krishnadeva 
kept up his bodily strength by hard physical exercise, he was a fine 
rider and his noble presence made a pleasant impression on all 
who came into contact with him. He often led his armies in 
person and exhibited great steadfastness and courage in the face 
of danger. He had great care for the welfare of the rank and file 
of the forces, and visited the wounded after each engagement and 
arranged for their proper care. He was loved and respected by 
all and was, says Paes, ‘ gallant and perfect in all things 

At the time of Krishnadeva’s succession, however, the condition 
of the empire was by no means reassuring. The rebel chieftain of 
Ummattur was contesting the lordship of the best part of the 
Mysore country; the Gajapatis of Orissa were in occupation of 
the north-eastern districts and Prataparudra was openly hostile 
and aggressive; and though the Bahmam kingdom had virtually 
split up into five separate states, still the Muslim pressure from the 
north, especially from Bijapur, continued unabated in its strength. 
There was also the newly-risen power of the Portuguese to contend 
with — a power which was rapidly establishing control over the 
routes and the maritime trade of the west coast and seeking profit- 
able political contacts with ‘ the country powers Nevertheless, 
within ten short years Krishnadeva succeeded in firmly establishing 
the authority of Vijayanagar all over the country; there was no 
thought of revolt and no great discontent anywhere within his vast 
realm, and the Portuguese became his friends. 

His first task was to repulse the Bahmam forces which invaded 
his territory in pursuit of the policy of annual jihad resolved upon 
by Mahmud II in 1501. As usual, prominent Bahmam nobles 
assembled in Bidar and started with the Sultan Mahmud II on 
their annual raid into the Raya’s kingdom (1509); but they soon 
discovered that they were no longer free to plunder and ravage. 
The progress of the Muslim armies was checked at the unidentified 
town of Diwani where they were decisively defeated in the battle 
that followed. The sultan himself was thrown olf his horse and 
sustained serious injuries from which he recovered only slowly. 



THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 


269 


whereupon his nobles 4 folded up the carpet of contention and 
war’, and returned to Bidar. Krishnadeva pursued the retiring 
armies, particularly that of Yusuf Adil Khan, who turned round 
to oppose him near Kovilkonda and lost his life in the battle 
that followed. The citadel of Kovilkonda became Krishnadeva’s 
before he returned to his capital. 

At the start of this war, the Portuguese governor, Albuquerque, 
sent an agent to offer aid to Krishnadeva in return for Vijayanagar 
support against the Zamorin of Calicut; he also promised to supply 
Arab and Persian horses only to Vijayanagar, and not to send any 
to Bijapur. Eager as Krishnadeva was to secure a monopoly in 
the horse trade, he did not immediately accept the offer. The 
second Portuguese embassy to Krishnadeva renewed Almeida’s 
request to erect a fort at Bhatkal and gained its object. This was 
after Albuquerque had attacked and captured Goa at the end of 
1510 — the result of many months’ fighting during which the town 
changed hands several times between the Portuguese and Bijapur 
troops. 

After this preliminary canter against his foes, Krishnadeva spent 
some time in his capital reorganizing his army and converting 
the motley feudal levies into an effective fighting force. He then 
invaded the Raichur doab and took the Raichur fort, finding his 
opportunity in the differences that had arisen between Bijapur and 
the Bahmani sultan. Yusuf Adil Khan had been succeeded by 
his young son Ismail Adil Shah as nominal ruler in Bijapur, but 
Kamal Khan was all powerful and had his own designs on the 
throne; Kamal Khan also knew that Krishnadeva was friendly with 
the Portuguese, and so the opposition from Bijapur to Krishna’s 
invasion on this occasion was very feeble. Kamal Khan was 
assassinated in May 1511 by a hireling employed by Ismail’s 
mother, which led to fresh troubles for Bijapur from Persian and 
Khurasani nobles who were the friends of the murdered regent. 
Krishnadeva, however, was entirely free to pursue his designs, so 
that after the capture of Raichur he marched on Gulbarga, 
defeated Amir Barid, the minister and gaoler of Mahmud II, and 
took the city. From there he marched on Bidar, captured it after 
a short siege, released Mahmud II and assumed the title ‘ establisher 
of the Yavana (Muslim) kingdom 

At the same time, Krishnadeva was also fighting his other 
enemies: the rebellious chieftain of Ummattur and the Gajapati 



270 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


ruler of Orissa, The war against Gangaraya of Ummattur who 
had been in revolt since the last years of Vlra Narasimha’s reign 
was undertaken soon after the repulse of the Bahmani invasion, 
and may be said to have lasted from August 1510 to the end of 
1512. It began with an attack on Penugonda, which had passed 
into the hands of the rebel; the capture of this strong fortress was 
followed by attacks on Ummattur and 3ivanasamudram (the head- 
quarters of Gangaraya). The latter took over a year to reduce; 
Gangaraya fled and was drowned in the Kaveri, and his seat was 
razed to the ground. The conquered territory became a new 
province with Srirangapattana as its capital; Saluva Govindaraya 
was appointed its first governor, while the local administration 
was entrusted to three local chieftains, the famous Kempe Gauda 
of Bangaluru (Bangalore) being one of them. 

A third front was opened against the Orissa ruler, who had 
been in occupation of the coastal districts in the east from the 
days of Saluva Narasimha, soon after the king’s accession. It was 
only pressed with vigour, however, after the close of the campaign 
against Gangaraya. An army was then sent to lay siege to Udaya- 
giri in 1513, and soon Krishnadeva himself joined it and conducted 
the operation. The fort was taken after the siege had lasted for a 
year and a half during which Krishnadeva had many new paths 
cut up the rocky hills to enable his troops to reach the walls of the 
inaccessible citadel. 

On his way back to his own capital Krishna and his queens 
Tirumala Devi and Chinna Devi visited Tirupati and gave thanks 
to Venkatesvara (July 1514). His religious orthodoxy was also 
shown by the capture from Udayagiri and re-erection in Vijaya- 
nagar of a fine image of Balakrishna. The sage Vyasaraya com- 
posed songs celebrating the occasion. 

Prataparudra’s attempt to raise the siege of Udayagiri resulted 
in defeat and the pursuit of the retiring forces up to Kondavldu. 
To the Vijayanagar army it was a triumphal march all the way, 
the smaller forts either submitting or being easily captured. Then 
began the siege of Kondavldu, first by Saluva Timmarasa and later 
by the king. Being the chief city of the Gajapati dominions south of 
the Krishna river, it was strongly guarded and many chiefs of the 
kingdom were stationed in it. Only after many months, when 
many of its inmates had died of starvation, were the walls scaled 
and the garrison overcome. Many Oriya nobles, including a son 



THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 


271 


and the wife of the Gajapati ruler, were taken captive, and the 
prisoners sent by road to Vijayanagar. 

Krishnadeva Raya entrusted the administration of the district of 
Kondavidu to Saluva Timma before he and his queens proceeded 
to Amaravati to offer worship to Amaresvara. From there he 
went back to the capital after visiting £rlsailam to make magnificent 
gifts to Mallikarjuna. 

Soon he was on the march once more to join his army in the 
field, but he found time to visit the shrine of Narasimha at 
Ahobalam on his way to Vijayavada, which was taken and made 
the advanced base for further operations. A few miles to the 
north-west was Kondapalli, a strong and well-defended fort with 
lofty walls. Krishnadeva laid siege to it; an army sent for its 
relief by Prataparudra was met on the banks of the Krishna and 
thoroughly defeated. The siege was then pressed for two months 
longer until the fortress surrendered. The seizure of many other 
forts in Telengana, and the occupation of large parts of the 
Nalgonda and Warangal districts then under the suzerainty of the 
Gajapati, speedily followed. 

This campaign effectively completed the conquest of Telengana. 
Krishnadeva next turned his attention to the country of Kalinga 
proper where Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) was one of the 
first cities to be taken. A few feeble attempts were made to stop 
its progress, but the Vijayanagar army continued its triumphal 
march, devastating the territory of the Gajapati all along the road, 
up to Potnur-Simhadri. There Krishnadeva set up a pillar of 
victory and then returned to his capital by way of Rajahmundry 
(1516). His invading and victorious army pressed on, however, and 
marched further into Kalinga until its capital, Cuttack, was reached. 
Reduced to extremity, Prataparudra sued for peace and offered the 
emperor the hand of his daughter, which was accepted. Krishna- 
deva, indeed, was magnanimous and returned all the territory north 
of the Krishna. 

While Krishnadeva was busy with his Orissa campaign (which 
may be called one of the most brilliant military episodes in the 
history of sixteenth-century India) Ismail Adil Khan recaptured 
Raichur. Krishnadeva’s campaign for its recovery (1520) is 
described by Nuniz. Determined to try conclusions once for all 
with the Adil Shah, Krishnadeva marched against him with an 
army consisting ‘ of about a million of men, if the camp-followers 



272 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


be included * and over five hundred elephants; he pitched his camp 
to the east of Raichur and began a regular siege of the fortress. 
Ismail came to its relief with strong contingents of cavalry and 
advanced to within nine miles of Raichur where he entrenched 
himself, leaving the Krishna river about five miles behind. The 
decisive battle was joined on the morning of 19 May 1520. It 
opened with a frontal attack by the Vijayanagar troops which 
drove the Muslims back to their trenches; but then the artillery 
of the Muslims came into play and wrought much havoc among 
the close ranks of the Hindus who fell back and were charged by 
the enemy. Krishnadeva, who was in command of the second line, 
then mounted his horse and ordered a forward movement of the 
remaining divisions. Their impetuous onslaught overcame and 
scattered the ranks of the Muslim forces who were relentlessly 
pursued right up to the river, and the threatened defeat was con- 
verted into brilliant victory. The Shah’s camp was seized and he 
himself barely escaped with his life on an elephant. ‘ The spoil 
was great and the result decisive.’ The sultan of Bijapur thence- 
forth cherished a wholesome dread of Krishnadeva Raya and did 
not venture to renew the contest during his lifetime. Krishnadeva 
returned to Raichur and shortly afterwards recaptured it. Its fall 
was in large measure due to the assistance rendered by some 
Portuguese soldiers with Christovao de Figueiredo at their head; 
with their arquebuses they ‘ picked off the defenders from the 
walls ’ and enabled the besiegers * to approach the lines of fortifi- 
cation and pull down the stones of which they were formed \ The 
Portuguese commander was specially honoured by the king in the 
next Mahanavami festival in the capital. 

This resounding success against the Adil Shah had important 
political results. Krishnadeva personally became haughty and 
made provocative demands on his defeated foe; he kept his 
ambassador waiting at Vijayanagar for over a month and then sent 
word that if the Adil Shah would come and kiss his foot in 
obeisance, his lands and fortresses would be restored to him. The 
Muslim sultans saw the danger to their position in the rising 
military strength of Vijayanagar and in its capacity to intefere in 
their affairs, which led, by and by, to more concerted action on 
their part against Vijayanagar. Lastly, the Portuguese on the 
coast gained by the result of the battle of Raichur: ‘ Goa rose and 
fell simultaneously with the rise and fall of the third Vijayanagar 


THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 273 

dynasty; and necessarily so, considering that its entire trade 
depended on Hindu support \ 

The machinations of one Asad Khan Lari, a wily courtier of 
Ismail Shah, who had been sent to Vijayanagar to conclude a treaty, 
led Krishnadeva into yet another campaign against Bijapur in 1523. 
According to Asad Khan’s undertaking, the Adil Khan or his 
mother would meet Krishnadeva at a certain point on the northern 
frontier of the kingdom. As he did not find them, however, he 
marched on Gulbarga by way of teaching them a lesson, and razed 
its fortress to the ground. He also captured the fortress cities of 
Firuzabad and Sagar, and led his army up to Bijapur ‘ which for 
a time he occupied and left sadly injured \ At Gulbarga he 
liberated the three sons of Mahmud II Bahmani, made the eldest 
of them sultan, and brought the other two with him to Vijayanagar 
and treated them with much consideration. But this attempt to 
resuscitate Bahmani sovereignty under Hindu patronage lacked all 
possibility of success and perhaps only served to irritate the more 
the sultans of the five succession states. 

Nuniz narrates that Krishnadeva in his own lifetime made his 
six year old son king and himself took up the post of minister. 
This must have been about 1524 when we have the inscriptions of 
prince Tirumalai Raya, who was obviously made yuvaraja at the 
time. Nuniz also states that during the festivities of the corona- 
tion which lasted eight months, Tirumalai Raya took ill and died, 
poisoned by the son of Saluva Timma whose position as chief 
minister had been lowered by the elevation of the prince. When 
Krishnadeva Raya came to know of it, he sent for the minister, 
accused him in open court of the dastardly crime, and cast him 
and his whole family into prison. In this, certain Portuguese 
at his court helped him; and when one of Timma’s sons escaped, 
he was caught and blinded with the remaining prisoners. 

The Adil Shah now advanced again to try to retrieve his broken 
fortunes, but when Krishnadeva Raya took the field against him, 
he retreated in haste. The king was preparing for an attack on 
Belgaum, then in the Adil Shah’s possession, when he took seriously 
ill and died soon after (1529). He nominated his half-brother, 
Achyuta Raya, to be his successor. 

Pre-eminent as a warrior, Krishnadeva Raya was equally great 
as statesman, administrator, and patron of the arts. The grandeur 
of his court excited the warm admiration of many foreign visitors 
18

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


and their description of the great wealth of Vijayanagar, its festivals, 
its military strength and its heroic king make eloquent reading. 
All South India was under Krishnadeva Raya’s sway, and many 
quasi-independent chiefs — like those of Bankapur, Gersoppa, 
Bhatkal, and so on — were his vassals. The empire, although 
under his direct rule, was itself divided into a number of 
governorships under generals, each of whom enjoyed practical 
independence so long as he maintained a certain quota of horse, 
foot and elephants in constant readiness for action and paid his 
annual contribution to the central treasury. For such a system to 
work efficiently, the monarch had to command the universal respect 
of his subjects and exhibit great energy, tact and vigilance in the 
performance of his public duties. Krishnadeva proved himself 
more than equal to this task, and there was no confusion or dis- 
order anywhere in the realm during his reign. He was a scholar 
and poet and the Telugu poem Amuktamalyada passes under his 
name; it contains an exposition, by the way, of the principles of 
political administration practised by the monarch. The illustrious 
Telugu poet Allasani Peddana graced his court as Poet Laureate, 
and many of the foremost scholars of the time were attracted by 
the discriminating liberality of the emperor. 6 King Krishna Raya 
was in no way less famous for his religious zeal and catholicity. 
He respected all sects of the Hindu religion alike, though his 
personal leanings were in favour of Vaishnavism. Krishna Raya’s 
kindness to the fallen enemy, his acts of mercy and charity towards 
the residents of captured cities, his great military prowess which 
endeared him alike to his feudatory chiefs and to his subjects, the 
royal reception and kindness that he invariably bestowed upon 
foreign embassies, his imposing personal appearance, his genial 
outlook and polite conversation which distinguished a pure and 
dignified life, his love for literature and for religion, and his solici- 
tude for the welfare of his people, and, above all, the almost 
fabulous wealth that he conferred as endowments on temples 
and Brahmins, mark him out indeed as the greatest of the South 
Indian monarchs.’ 

Krishnadeva Raya was a great builder and added much to the 
beauty and amenities of the capital. At the beginning of his reign 
he built a new gopura (tower) and repaired another in the temple 
of Virupaksha. In 1513, as already mentioned, he erected the 
shrine of Krishnasvami to house worthily the image of Balakrishna 



THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 275 

he had brought from Udayagiri. With the aid of a Portuguese 
-engineer, whose services he borrowed from the Governor-General 
of Goa, he improved the irrigation of the dry lands round about 
Vijayanagar. He added a beautiful suburb to the capital on its 
southern approaches, and called it Nagalapur in honour of his 
mother Nagala Devi; the new city’s water supply came from the 
new tank which was under construction at the time Paes visited 
the city. The temple of Vitthalasvami on the river bank was also 
embellished by Krishna Raya; it marks the extreme limit in the 
* florid magnificence ’ to which the Vijayanagar style advanced. 
Work on it continued for many years afterwards, and was perhaps 
only stopped when the Mussalmans destroyed the city in 1565. 
The enormous statue of Narasimha, hewn out of a single boulder 
of granite, that lay near the south-western angle of the Krishna- 
svami temple was one of the latest monuments of the reign (1528). 
Though much mutilated, it is still a striking object amongst the 
ruins of the city. 

Nuniz, who spent some time in Achyuta Raya’s court, affirms 
that the new king gave himself over to vice and tyranny, that he 
lacked honesty and courage, and that the people and captains of 
the kingdom were much discontented with his evil life and inclina- 
tions. Achyuta does not, in fact, appear to have been such a bad 
monarch. He was specially chosen by Krishnadeva for the succes- 
sion in preference to his infant son who was only eighteen months 
old. Yet it cannot be denied that his position was difficult at the 
time of his accession (1529). The infant son of Krishna Raya was 
proclaimed king by Rama Raya; but Rama’s attempt to seize 
power in the name of the infant was foiled by Saluva Vira 
Narasimha who kept the throne vacant for Achyuta till he could 
come up from Chandragiri where he had been confined by 
Krishnadeva Raya, along with other princes of the family, in order 
to secure the peace of the realm. On his way to Vijayanagar, 
Achyuta Raya held two coronations, one at Tirupati and the other 
at Kalahasti, in an attempt to forestall Rama Raya’s efforts 
to enthrone another king. 

Krishnadeva’s death was the signal for all the enemies of Vijaya- 
nagar to renew their attacks on that kingdom. Ismail Adil Khan 
once again invaded the Raichur doab and seized Raichur and 
Mudgal, before Achyuta could do any thing to prevent it. (This 
is almost the only occurrence of the entire reign noticed by Nuniz.) 



276 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


The Gajapati ruler, however, who led an Invasion at the same time 
was defeated and turned back; so also the sultan of Golconda, Quli 
Qutb Shah, whose attempt to seize Kondavldu was likewise foiled. 

When he finally reached Vijayanagar, Achyuta came to terms 
with Rama Raya and agreed to share the power with him. This 
greatly displeased Saluva Vira Narasihma who retired from the 
court and set up the standard of revolt in the south with the aid 
of the chieftains of Ummattur and the Tiruvadi rajya in south 
Travancore. Achyuta Raya marched against them, with an army 
commanded by his brother-in-law Salakaraju Tirumala. The 
campaign was one victorious progress up to the banks of the 
Tambrapami where a pillar of victory was set up. The Pandya 
ruler who had suffered at the hands of the rebels was restored to 
his kingdom and his daughter accepted as the emperor’s bride. 
Saluva Vira Narasimha and his allies were not only defeated in 
battle but captured and brought as prisoners to the king’s camp 
at Srirangam. Achyuta returned to his capital via Ummattur to 
receive the submission of local chieftains on the way. 

When Krishnadeva Raya’s infant son died soon afterwards, 
Rama Raya’s position was considerably weakened. It brought 
about a change in Achyuta Raya’s attitude ; he advanced his own 
powers still further by invading that much disputed territory, the 
Raichur doab, and subduing the Bijapur country as far north as 
the Krishna. This was possible because Ismail Adil Khan’s death, 
in 1534, left the Bijapur throne to his unpopular son Mallu Adil 
Khan. The nobility rose against him at the instance of the 
notorious Asad Khan Lari, and Achyuta was not slow to take 
advantage of the situation, with Mallu consenting to make peace 
on Achyuta’s terms. 

The history of the subsequent years is obscure. A rebellion in 
Gutti seems to have been suppressed in 1536-7, after which he 
paid a visit to Tirupati with his officers. Rama Raya was 
strengthening his position by removing old servants and appointing 
his own relatives and friends in their place. He also took into his 
service 3,000 Muslim soldiers whom Ibrahim Adil Khan, the new 
sultan of Bijapur, had dismissed from his service on his accession 
in 1535. He then made bold to seize Achyuta when he returned 
to the capital, kept him imprisoned and proclaimed himself king; 
but the opposition of the nobles forced him to abandon the 
scheme, enthrone Sadasiva, a nephew of Achyuta, and carry on the 



THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 


277 


government in his name. This went on until rebellions in the south 
forced Rama Raya to leave the capital, when he put Achyuta into 
the charge of a trusted servant. The campaign in the south was 
no unalloyed success, and lasted longer than Rama Raya had 
expected. Meanwhile, the trusted servant in charge of Achyuta 
set him free and assumed the office of chief minister. He was soon 
done away with by Salakaraju Tirumala, however, who took the 
direction of affairs into his hands. These occurrences made it 
expedient for Rama Raya to patch up his quarrels with the rebels 
in the south and return to the capital. 

Troubles come not singly and Ibrahim Adil Khan chose this 
moment to march against Vijayanagar and lay siege to it. He 
entered Nagalapur and ‘ razed it to the ground ’ perhaps by way 
of reprisal for the treatment of Bijapur by Krishnadeva Raya. 
Both Achyuta and Rama Raya were afraid of Ibrahim joining 
forces with the other party, while the machinations of the wily 
Asad Khan brought about an invasion of Bijapur by the sultan 
of Ahmadnagar. Ibrahim opened negotiations with both the 
Hindu princes and settled their quarrel before he retired to his 
own territory. It was agreed that Achyuta would be king, but 
Rama Raya was to be free to rule his estate without interference. 
Ibrahim was richly rewarded with large sums of money for his 
service, and the terms of the compact were observed by both parties 
till the death of Achyuta in 1542. 

The whole of Achyuta Raya’s reign was spent in a struggle 
against adverse conditions created by internal revolts, foreign 
aggression and the intrigues and ambitions of Rama Raya. Trade 
everywhere was hampered and pilgrim traffic suffered from the 
activities of bandits who infested, if they did not control, the high- 
ways. Achyuta put up a brave fight against his many difficulties 
and does not merit the harsh judgement passed on him by Nuniz 
and others who have accepted a low estimate of his character. 
His life forms the subject of an ornate poem in Sanskrit, the 
Achyutarayabhyudaya, by the court-poet Rajanatha Dindima, 
written during the lifetime of the monarch: even after making 
all possible allowances for the intemperate eulogies which the 
poem contains, we can still sense that Achyuta had uncommon 
and praiseworthy characteristics. 

Meanwhile, both during the reign of Achyuta Raya and in the 
period that followed, the Portuguese had been busily establishing 



278 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


their empire on the coasts of South India, building forts wherever 
the protection of their trade demanded them. Wars with the 
Zamorin of Calicut and the feudatories of the empire were 
frequent, though they still kept up the appearance of friendly 
relations with the emperor himself. They acted throughout as if 
they had ‘ a divine right to the pillage, robbery, and massacre of 
the natives of India. Not to mince matters, their whole record is 
one of a series of atrocities.’ They delighted particularly in plun- 
dering all rich temples within their reach, even Tirupati not 
escaping their predatory attentions (1545). 

Visvanatha Nayaka, son of Nagama Nayaka, was regarded by 
his descendants in later times as the founder of the celebrated 
Nayak dynasty of Madura. He must have followed Achyuta in 
his southern campaign and fought in the wars against Saluva Vira 
Narasimha, Tiruvadi and others, until he was finally appointed 
representative of the emperor in the Pandya country. He was 
governor of the Madura country from 1533 to the end of Achyuta’s 
reign (1542) when he gave place to another officer. There is 
nothing to show that he established the separate Nayak kingdom 
of Madura; that came later and may have been the work of his 
son Krishnappa. 

Achyuta Raya was succeeded by his son Venkata I, but as he 
was not yet of age, his maternal uncle Salakaraju Tirumala became 
regent despite the opposition of the nobles. The queen-mother, 
Varadadevi, suspected her brother’s motives and sought the assist- 
ance of the Adil Khan; but Tirumala bought off the sultan when 
he was already on his way to Vijayanagar. As a counter-move 
Rama Raya now liberated Sadasiva from prison at Gutti, pro- 
claimed him emperor, and in his turn appealed to Bijapur for aid. 
Nothing loth, the Adil Khan invaded Vijayanagar, but Tirumala, 
who had been proclaimed king by the bewildered citizens of the 
capital, inflicted such a defeat on the Shah that he had to turn 
back. Tirumala’s next step to clear his path of all rivals was to 
cause Venkata I and all the members of the royal family to- 
be assassinated. Thereafter the tyranny became so intolerable 
that the nobles once again invited the Bijapur sultan to come to 
their rescue. He came, but his overweening pride aroused hatred 
all round, and he went back in fear of his own safety. Rama 
Raya moved at last to seize the kingdom in the name of Sadasiva; 
he captured Penugonda, defeated Tirumala in a series of battles. 



THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 


279 


put him to the sword in a final engagement on the banks of the 
Tungabhadra and then proceeded to Vijayanagar to perform the 
coronation of Sadasiva (1543). 

For the first seven or eight years after his coronation Sadasiva 
was the only king; but the real power was always in Rama Raya’s 
hands and in due course Rama Raya assumed the royal titles. 
Sadasiva was kept under close guard, although Rama Raya and 
his brothers Tirumala and Venkatadri ‘ went on one day every year 
and prostrated themselves before their lawful sovereign in token of 
his rights over them \ 

Ferishta says that Rama Raya destroyed many of the ancient 
nobility and raised his own family to the highest rank, a point 
which is confirmed by the evidence of other writers and of the 
inscriptions. Rama Raya also began to admit large numbers of 
Muslims into the army, a practice that had, indeed, been started 
in a small way by Devaraya I. No important offices at that time 
had been entrusted to them, but Rama Raya departed from this 
prudent policy employing Muslims in places which gave them an 
intimate knowledge of the internal affairs of the state. Further, 
he made it a point to avail himself of every opportunity of inter- 
fering in the relations between the Muslim states of Deccan and 
playing them off one against another, hoping thus to keep them 
weak and to increase his own power. The Muslim rulers, needless 
to say, saw clearly what was happening and closed their ranks; 
and Rama Raya paid heavily for his miscalculations. His policy 
opened the direct road to the disaster of Rakshasi-Tangadi 
(Talikota). 

Soon after Sadasiva’s coronation, Rama Raya was once again 
called away to the south. His opponents, who could not bear to 
see him established at the head of the state, sought to defy his 
authority and created confusion in the land to the south of 
Chandragiri, which was under their control. In the extreme south, 
the rulers of the Travancore country were once more in revolt, 
actually driving out the chieftain of Kayattar, the Pandya feudatory 
of the empire. The Roman Catholic missionaries, headed by 
St Francis Xavier, were not only converting to their faith large 
numbers on the pearl-fishery coast of the Gulf of Mannar, but 
induced the fishermen to transfer their allegiance to the king of 
Portugal on the grounds that they could thereby escape from the 
rapacity of the Muslim traders and the oppression of the Hindu 


280 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


governors from which they had been suffering for many years. 
The Franciscan friars and Jesuits were busy demolishing temples 
and building churches in the coastal cities, and the Portuguese 
governor of Goa was reported to be organizing a plundering raid 
against the rich temples of Kanchipuram. The presence of many 
petty local rulers, their mutual jealousies and negotiations with the 
Portuguese further complicated a tangled situation. 

At this juncture Rama Raya ordered his cousin China Timma 
to lead a large army south and evolve order out of this chaos. 
Chandragiri was first wrested from the rebels; then the Chola 
country was entered and the fort of Bhuvanagiri stormed. March- 
ing thence along the coast and crossing the Kaveri, the expedition 
reached the port of Nagore where a temple of Ranganatha which 
had suffered ruin at the hands of the Catholics was restored; 
and the local chiefs of Tanjore and the Pudukkottai territory were 
reduced to subjection and arrears of tribute taken from them. 
Farther south still, the displaced Pandya was restored to his king- 
dom and the pride of Bettumperumal, the chief of Kayattar and 
Tuticorin, crushed. The forces of the ‘ Five Tiruvadis * of Travan- 
core were met at Tovala Pass, beaten and dispersed; the rest of 
Travancore was invaded and its defeated ruler (‘ Iniquitibirim ’) 
was received into favour and set to rule over much of the territory 
that had earlier been his. China Timma worshipped at the shrine 
of Padmanabha at Trivandrum, set up a pillar of victory at Cape 
Comorin and then returned to the capital leaving his brother 
Vitthala, who had rendered yeoman service throughout the 
campaign, in charge of the conquered territory. 

With the Portuguese, Rama Raya’s relations were by no means 
always friendly, and the advent of Martin Affonso de Sousa as 
governor of Goa in 1542 brought about a change for the worse. 
He attacked and plundered the port of Bhatkal soon after he came 
to Goa, and his activities on the Coromandel Coast have been 
noticed above. With his successor, Joao de Castro, Rama Raya 
concluded a treaty in 1547 by which he secured the monopoly of 
the horse trade. There followed some years of friendship and 
peace until, in 1558, Rama Raya made a sudden attack on San 
Thome. He had received complaints of the destruction of 
temples by Roman Catholic monks and, being persuaded that the 
inhabitants were possessed of vast riches, he thought he could both 
defend his religion and refill his treasury at one stroke. He 


THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 


281 


demanded a tribute of 1,00,000 pagodas, half to be paid immedi- 
ately and the rest a year later, for which five hostages were taken 
from among the chief citizens. At about the same time, to prevent 
help reaching San Thome, Goa also was attacked by Vitthalaraya, 
Rama Raya’s cousin, aided by the Ikkeri chieftain Sankanna 
Nayaka. In spite of these setbacks, the Portuguese continued 
their depredations along the Malabar coast in the succeeding 
years. 

We must now turn to the details of Rama Raya’s relations with 
the Muslim states and to the train of events that led to the decisive 
battle of Rakshasi-Tangadi (Talikota) to which passing reference 
has already been made. In 1542-3, Bijapur and Ahmadnagar made 
up their differences and agreed that the former was to have a free 
hand against Vijayanagar, and the latter against Bidar. Ibrahim 
Adil Shah then invaded Vijayanagar, but gained nothing as his forces 
were turned back by the generalship of the Keladi chief Sadasiva 
Nayaka. In 1548 Rama Raya aided Burhan Nizam Shah in the 
capture of the fort of Kalyani from Bidar, and the fort remained 
in Burhan’s possession till his death in 1553. His son, Husain 
Nizam Shah, entered into an alliance with Ibrahim Qutb Shah of 
Golconda, renewed the war with Bijapur and laid siege to Gulbarga 
in 1557. Ibrahim Adil Shah called on Rama Raya for help and 
he promptly responded by marching in person at the head of his 
army. Anxious to avoid bloodshed, Rama Raya brought about a 
meeting of all the parties at the junction of the Bhima and Krishna 
rivers which resulted in a treaty of mutual alliance and protection 
by which, if any one of the contending parties became the victim 
of an unjust attack, the others were to join him against the 
aggressor — a plan of collective security as it would now be 
called. 

Ibrahim Adil Shah died soon after this meeting of the four kings 
and was succeeded by his young son Ali Adil Shah. An unusual 
step was taken by Ali to cement his friendly relations with Vijaya- 
nagar, says Ferishta. Rama Raya lost a son about this time, and 
Ali went to Vijayanagar to offer his condolence in person. He 
was received with the greatest respect, and Rama Raya’s wife 
adopted the sultan as her son. When, however, Ali took his leave 
after a stay of three days, Rama Raya failed to attend him out of 
the city, and Ali ‘ treasured up the affront in his mind ’. Rama 
Raya, perhaps, on his part jelt that the fortunes of Bijapur must 


282 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


have sunk rather low that its sultan should so far humble himself 
to secure his friendship. 

The first of the high contracting parties to disregard the Four 
Kings’ Peace was Husain Nizam Shah who invaded Bijapur in 
1560, Ali fled to Vijayanagar and implored the assistance of Rama 
Raya, who responded to the appeal and also called upon Ibrahim 
Qutb Shah of Golconda to fulfil his part according to the treaty. 
He did so with reluctance, but at the approach of the combined 
forces, the Nizam Shah retreated into his dominions and made over 
the defence of Kalyani to one of his Hindu officers, Bhopal Raj. 
The allied army left behind a division of its forces to invest Kalyani 
and pressed on to Ahmadnagar. The Nizam Shah was beaten in a 
battle at Jamkhed, and the fleeing sultan pursued up to Daulatabad. 
He then realized the futility of further resistance and made peace 
by surrendering Kalyani to Ali Adil Shah, who thus had good 
reason to be grateful to Rama Raya. After this, Rama Raya 
invaded Bidar and inflicted a defeat on the Barid Shah, who had 
thenceforth to take part in Rama Raya’s wars against his enemies. 

As Rama Raya’s career began with a short period of service in 
the Qutb Shahi court of Golconda, he had a first-hand knowledge 
of the internal conditions of that kingdom, and had friends among 
the nobles of that court. With Ibrahim Qutb Shah his relations 
were at first friendly as he had received him with favour when he 
fled to Vijayanagar from his brother’s wrath and helped him to 
gain the throne when that brother died (1550). But gradually 
their conflicting interests drove than apart, and Ibrahim co- 
operated in the war against Ahmadnagar only in a half-hearted 
manner. Later, he openly allied himself with Ahmadnagar, went 
against Bijapur and laid siege to Kalyani. Rama Raya went to 
the relief of the fortress and ordered at the same time an invasion 
of the southern districts of the Golconda kingdom led by his 
brother Venkatadri. Thereupon the allied sultans retreated from 
Kalyani; Rama Raya pursued the Nizam Shah while the Bijapur 
troops chased the Qutb Shah. Ahmadnagar was besieged a second 
time by Vijayanagar forces, but now without success as the flooding 
of the adjacent river compelled the invading army to retire with 
losses. Ibrahim Qutb Shah was defeated in battle, and reached 
his capital with difficulty, where he found everything in disorder 
owing to Venkatadri’s invasion. Soon Rama Raya also returned 
from Ahmadnagar and marched towards Golconda. Ibrahim 


THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 


283 


sought to divert him by attacking Kondavldu, but met with no 
success, being once more beaten in the field. His country was 
thus devastated and the principal forts captured by the enemy. 
In the end he had to purchase peace by surrendering the forts of 
Kovilkonda, Ganpura and Pangal (c. 1563). The war widened 
the breach between Golconda and Vijayanagar, and Ibrahim 
became more than ever determined to destroy the Hindu power 
which had become a source of repeated humiliation to its Muslim 
neighbours in the north, even their ambassadors not being received 
properly. 

The Muslim rulers saw clearly that their disunion gave the 
advantage to Rama Raya. Ibrahim Qutb Shah and Husain Nizam 
Shah, who had suffered most, perhaps took the lead in the forma- 
tion of the confederacy against Vijayanagar. Ferishta avers that 
the excesses committed by the Hindu forces against the Muslim 
population and sacred places in their invasions of Ahmadnagar 
and Golconda had no small share in rousing feeling against Rama 
Raya. Accordingly embassies passed to and fro among the sultans, 
their differences were made up, and steps taken to form a general 
league of the faithful against the Hindu monarch. Dynastic 
marriages cemented the political alliance between Ahmadnagar 
and Bijapur — Ali Adil Shah marrying Chand Bibi, the daughter 
of Husain Nizam Shah, and Husain’s eldest son marrying one of 
Ali’s sisters at the same time. Soon after the marriages, prepara- 
tions began for the holy war. Hindu sources generally speak of 
all the five sultans as the opponents of Rama Raya, though Muslim 
historians leave the sultan of Berar out of account. Aii Adil Shah 
clearly played a double game throughout, professing friendship 
with both the parties. The Muslim armies met on the plains of 
Bijapur and began their march to the south towards the end of 1564. 

Rama Raya knew that the decisive trial of strength was to begin 
soon, and, on Vijayadasami day (15 September 1564), he informed 
the nobles of the impending war and ordered them to gather 
together all their available strength without delay. Though little 
reliance can be placed on the large figures given by several writers, 
there is no doubt that very large numbers of troops were engaged 
on both sides. The Muslims reached Talikota, a small fortress- 
town in the neighbourhood of the Krishna river, on 26 December 
1564. Rama Raya faced the situation with the utmost confidence. 
He first sent his brother Tirumala with a considerable force of all 



284 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


arms to guard the Krishna and prevent the enemy from crossing it. 
Then he sent up his other brother, Venkatadri, and finally himself 
came up with the rest of the forces of the empire. The Hindu 
camp was on the south side of the Krishna, while the Muslims 
occupied both banks. Several partisan accounts have been written 
of the antecedents of the decisive engagement and of that engage- 
ment itself, but it is by no means easy to reconstruct the exact 
course of events. The actual field of battle was on the south bank 
of the Krishna; but as the two villages of Rakshasi and Tangadi, 
ten miles apart on its north bank, lie much nearer the field than 
Talikota, some historians refer to the battle as Rakshasi-Tangadi 
rather than Talikota. 

The rival armies were opposing each other for over a month, 
during which there were preliminary trials of strength. In one of 
these the Nizam Shah and the Qutb Shah sustained a severe defeat, 
and felt the need to resort to a stratagem. They gave out that they 
intended to make peace with the powerful Raya and even started 
negotiations; at the same time they secured the firm adherence of 
Ali Adil Shah to their cause by remonstrating with him, and possibly 
also entered into communication with the Muslim officers in 
Rama Raya’s army. When everything was ready, the main body 
of the Muslim army crossed the river by means of a feint which 
drew off the Hindu forces guarding the ford, and proceeded to 
attack the Hindu camp. Rama Raya, though surprised, was able 
to organize the defence. In the decisive engagement that followed 
— the day was Tuesday, 23 January 1565, according to Sewell and 
Ferishta — Rama Raya and his two brothers all took part. In spite 
of his age Rama Raya insisted on directing operations from a 
litter. He held command of the centre and was opposed by Husain 
Nizam Shah; his left, under his brother Tirumala, was opposed by 
the Bijapur forces under Ali; and his right, under Venkatadri, 
opposed the sultans of Ahmadabad-Bidar and Golconda. At first 
the Hindus fought with success and nearly won the battle; but the 
issue was decided by the desertion of two Muslim commanders of 
Rama Raya’s army, each in charge of seventy to eighty thousand 
men. Says Caesar Frederick: ‘ And when the armies were joined, 
the battle lasted but a while, not the space of four hours, because 
the two traitorous captains in the chiefest of the fight, with their 
companies turned their faces against their king, and made such 
disorder in his army, that astonied they set themselves to flight.’ 



THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR

Rama Raya fell prisoner into the hands of the Nizam Shah who 
immediately decapitated him and had his head raised on a spear 
for the Hindu troops to see. Above a hundred thousand were 
slain in the pursuit that followed. There was great confusion and 
no attempt was made to take up a fresh position or organize the 
defence of the. capital. The road to the great city lay open; first 
to enter it were the dejected soldiers and princes from the field 
bringing the bad news; but Tirumaia made good his escape with 
all the treasures of the emperor loaded on to one thousand five 
hundred and fifty elephants. He left the city and its inhabitants 
to their fate, taking with him only the captive emperor Sadasiva 
and the women of the royal family. 

The victorious army \vas preceded by hordes of robbers and 
jungle-folk who fell upon the helpless people and looted their 
houses and shops. 4 With fire and sword, with crowbars and axes, 
they carried on day after day their work of destruction. Never 
perhaps in the history of the world has such havoc been wrought, 
and wrought suddenly, on so splendid a city, teeming with a 
wealthy and industrious population in the full plenitude of pros- 
perity one day, and on the next seized, pillaged, and reduced to 
ruins, amid scenes of savage massacre and horrors beggaring 
description.’ Vijayanagar never recovered from the blow, and the 
attempt made by Tirumaia shortly afterwards to revive the city 
appears to have met with only indifferent success. 

He took up his abode in Penugonda and began rebuilding an 
army by all possible means; in his dire need, he is said to have 
taken several horses from Portuguese merchants and refused to 
pay for them. He gave up Vijayanagar partly because opinion in 
that city favoured the claims of Rama Raya’s son Peda Tirumaia, 
alias Timma, for the regency. Six years of anarchy and confusion 
intervened before Tirumaia actually became king. Rama Raya’s 
evil policy of breaking up the trained civil service for the sake of 
promoting relatives now added to the troubles of the realm in the 
crisis; there were rebellions everywhere; crime increased and the 
tyranny of palay agars and dacoits also grew apace. The effective 
independence of the Nayaks of Madura, Tanjore and Gingee may 
be traced to this period. 

Even from so great a disaster as this defeat, Peda Tirumaia 
seems to have been able to learn nothing; he invoked the aid of 
Ah Adil Shah against his uncle. The sultan first marched to 



286 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Vijayanagar, and thence sent an army to lay siege to Penugonda; 
but the fort held its own under its able general Savaram Chennapa 
Nayaka, and Tirumala in his turn appealed to the Nizam Shah who 
invaded Bijapur and brought about the retreat of the Adil Shah 
from Vijayanagar (1567). Soon Tirumala was called upon to join 
the Nizam Shah and Qutb Shah against Bijapur and did so; but 
the Adil Shah made peace with his Muslim neighbours, and fell 
upon Tirumala and invaded his territory with all his strength in 
1568, laid siege to Adoni and dispatched a force against Penugonda 
to prevent any relief going to Adoni. Penugonda again put up a 
successful resistance, but Adoni fell. 

Yet Tirumala seems somehow to have held the bulk of the 
empire together: he tacitly approved the new status of the Nayaks 
of the south and made them his friends. The Vodeyars of Mysore 
and the Nayaks of Vellore and Keladi still owned allegiance as 
before. He set up each of his three sons as viceroy over a linguistic 
area for general control and supervision: Sriranga, the eldest, over 
the Telugu area with Penugonda as his capital; Rama, his second 
son, over the Kannada country, to rule from Srirangapattana; and 
Venkatapati, the youngest, to rule over the Tamil country from 
Chandragiri. He assumed the title ‘ Reviver of the Decadent 
Karnataka Empire ’ and had himself crowned emperor in 1570. 
But he was already an old man, and seems to have retired after a 
short rule, and been succeeded by Sriranga in 1572. Tirumala’ s 
work restored the empire, though in a truncated form, and 
prolonged its life for about a century. 

The fate of Sadasiva is uncertain. Caesar Frederick heard in 
1567 that he was assassinated by one of Tirumala’s sons, but this 
may only have been scandal spread against the new ruling house 
of Aravidu by its enemies. It seems as probable that Sadasiva, 
being a docile prince whom no one would have troubled to kill, 
t may have languished in prison until he died in natural death. His 
name occurs in inscriptions till 1576. 

Sriranga I began to rule in 1572 though his father continued to 
live in retirement for some six years longer. He carried on the 
work of restoration, but there were many obstacles in his way. In 
addition, two of his Muslim neighbours continued their invasions, 
resulting in loss of territory. In 1576, Ali Adil Shah sent out an 
army from Adoni to lay siege to Penugonda. Sriranga entrusted 
the defence of his capital to his able general Chennapa and went 



THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 


287 


off to Chandragiri with the treasures. Penugonda stood a three 
months’ siege, which gave Sriranga time to appeal successfully for 
help to Golconda and he himself took steps to send relief to 
Chennapa. He bought over one of the Adil Shah’s Hindu 
lieutenants and thus enabled Chennapa to inflict a defeat on the 
sultan on 21 December 1576, after which he retired into his own 
territory. But within three years, Ibrahim Qutb Shah forgot his 
recent alliance with Sriranga and invaded his territory: quite likely 
he was in league with some of the discontented nobles of Vijaya- 
nagar and chose his opportunity for aggrandizement. The rich 
temple of Narasimha at Ahobalam was plundered in 1579 by 
Murhari Rao, a Maratha Brahmin in the service of Golconda, 
and much territory was captured and ravaged although it was later 
recovered. 

The Golconda ruler returned to the charge and invaded the 
Kondavidu territory. There were struggles round the forts of 
Vinukonda, Kondavidu and Udayagiri, and though inscriptions 
say that Sriranga took these forts, the truth seems to be that 
Ibrahim gained considerable success and took much territory from 
Vijayanagar on this occasion which the Hindu empire never 
recovered. Sriranga’s failure was due to the virtual division of 
the empire which limited the resources at his command, since his 
brothers gave him little aid. The dissensions among the nobles, 
which led to many petty fights and wars and intrigues with the 
enemy, weakened the defence still further. When Sriranga died 
without issue in 1585, his younger brother Venkata succeeded him, 
superseding the two sons of his elder brother Rama who had been 
viceroy of Srirangapattana under Tirumala. These two boys were 
young at a time when strong rule was needed. The nobles, therefore, 
headed by Jaggadevaraya, chose Venkata to rule, and he fulfilled 
their expectations in an ample measure. He celebrated his coro- 
nation in 1585-6 and his reign of twenty-eight years was marked 
by a revival of strength and prosperity in the empire. He dealt 
successfully with the perennial trouble from the Muslim rulers of 
the Deccan, controlled the internal disorders effectively, and 
promoted the economic revival of the country. 

Venkata’s first act was an effort to get back the territory lost to 
Golconda by his predecessor. In that kingdom, Ibrahim had 
been succeeded at his death in 1580 by his son Muhammad Quli 
Qutb Shah. Venkata stirred up trouble against him in the Kondavidu 



288 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


territory, and Quli retaliated effectively by seizing the whole of 
Kurnool and parts of the Cuddapah and Anantapur districts, 
and by marching on and laying siege to Penugonda itself. Venkata 
thereupon sued for a truce, and the sultan, satisfied with the results 
attained, retired from the vicinity of Penugonda. Venkata made 
good use of the respite thus gained, and in a few days equipped the 
city to stand a long siege, and once more began to defy the 
Muslims. Sultan Quli discovered his mistake when he renewed 
the siege; he was defeated; and the approach of the rains, with the 
prospect of floods in the Krishna cutting off his retreat, forced him 
to raise the siege and go back, after making some hasty arrange- 
ments for the administration of the territory newly taken by him. 
But Venkata soon recaptured Gutti and then laid siege to Gandi- 
kota; he intercepted and scattered the forces sent to its relief from 
Kondavidu, while another Golconda army, led by Rustam Khan, 
was defeated and cut to pieces on the banks of the Penner, and 
Gandikota fell. This was followed by the seizure of other forts, 
and the Golconda garrisons were chased across the Krishna which 
later came to be recognized officially by Quli as the boundary of 
Vijayanagar. Farther east, Udayagiri became part of Venkata's 
dominions before 1589, but the Kondavidu territory was still the 
sultan's. Internal troubles prevented the completion of Venkata’s 
designs against Golconda. 

His accession brought about no change in the quarrelsome ways 
of the nobles, and much of his time and energy was taken up with 
calling them to order. For instance, Tammaya Gauda rebelled in 
the Kolar region; he was soon quelled and tribute levied from him. 
A more serious revolt, however, occurred in Rayalasima, or the 
Ceded Districts, to give them their modern name. In 1597-8, 
Nandela Krishnamaraya and a number of other chieftains defied 
imperial authority; Krishnama was defeated in a battle at Jambula- 
madugu and shut himself in the fort of Nandela (Nandyal). 
Venkata invested it for three months, after which Krishnama 
surrendered, to spend the rest of his life in prison in Chandragiri. 
Kandanavolu Gopalaraju, the grandson of Venkatapati, the brother 
of Rama Raya, and other rebels, were dealt with suitably at the 
same time with the aid of loyal lieutenants who were adequately 
rewarded from the rebels’ estates after they had been put down. 
There were troubles also in the Tamil country where Lingama 
Nayaka of Vellore headed the revolt. Yachama Nayudu, son of 



THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 


289 


Velugoti Kasturi Rangappa, was set up in the amaram (fief) of 
Perumbedu sima (Chingleput and Madurantakam taluqs) to act 
as a check on Lingama. Yachama took the important stronghold 
of Uttiramerur from Naga, a subordinate of Linga, who now 
summoned to his aid not only his own subordinates from the 
neighbouring fortresses, but the Nayaks of Gingee, Tanjore and 
Madura. They were not loath to aid in curbing the reviving power 
of the emperor. A huge army was collected and sent in May 1601 
against Uttiramerur under the lead of Davula Papa Nayudu, 
brother-in-law of Naga. Nothing daunted, Yachama took up the 
challenge, ably seconded by his younger brother Singa; in the 
battle that followed Papa was slain and the others fled or became 
captives. Yachama’ s success was complete and was warmly 
recognized by the emperor. But Linga and his allies did not give 
in. Venkata defeated Linga near Vellore, advanced into the Chola 
country where he inflicted another defeat on the rebels, and cross- 
ing the Kaveri laid waste the lands of the Madura Nayak. This 
series of victories broke the back of the Tamil rebellion, and all 
the rebels submitted, except Linga, who trusted to the strength of 
the fortress of Vellore. In due course this fortress also was taken 
and thereafter made the seat of the empire, while Linga was 
deprived of his estate. 

Venkata did much to restore the prosperity of the villages in 
the northern districts which had suffered greatly from repeated 
Muslim inroads after 1565. Easy conditions of land tenure were 
offered to the farmers by the king and the nobles, who followed 
his example, so that the ryots returned to their wonted occupation. 
He also strove to sustain the failing strength of the village 
assemblies, and to administer impartial justice. Venkata’s rule 
of nearly thirty years undoubtedly saved the empire from im- 
minent dissolution. He died in 1614 after nominating Sriranga, 
his nephew, as his successor. 

It was during the reign of Venkata that the Dutch and the 
English began to establish themselves on the east coast. In 1605 
the Dutch opened negotiations with Golconda and established 
factories in Nizampatam and Masulipatam. They soon felt the 
need for * a footing in the Hindu territory further south in order 
to obtain the patterned goods demanded so largely in the spice- 
markets In 1608, therefore, they got permission from the Nayak 
of Gingee to open a factory at Tegnapatam (Fort St David), and 
19 



290 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


two years later Venkata allowed them to have a factory at Pulicat 
with exclusive privileges of trade. Pulicat was open to attack from 
the Portuguese at San Thome, and when the Queen of Venkata 
delayed building a fortress for its protection, the Dutch completed 
the fortress at their own cost — a step which stood them in good 
stead in the period of civil war and confusion that followed the 
death of Venkata. The English made a futile attempt to land at 
Pulicat in 1611, but succeeded soon after in opening trade at 
Nizampatam and Masulipatam. Their negotiations with Vellore 
had led to no result at the time of Venkata’s death; they were 
admitted to trade in Pulicat in 1621 by a treaty with the Dutch, 
but the English factory moved soon after, first to Armagon a short 
distance to the north, and ultimately to Madras (1639-40). The 
Danes settled at Tranquebar in 1620. 

Although Venkata II had several wives he had no son. His love 
for one of them made him wink at a fraud she practised on him of 
borrowing a baby from one of her maids and calling him her own. 
Hoping to stop the mischief from going further, Venkata nominated 
Sriranga to the succession. But the presence of the putative ‘ son ’ 
was a complication, and Sriranga was no paragon of strength or 
wisdom. He alienated the sympathies of the nobles by making 
injudicious appointments and avaricious demands for lands, money 
and jewels. The nobles fell into two c<jmps : the son’s party headed 
by Gobburi Jagga Raya, the brother of Venkata’s favourite queen; 
and Sriranga supported by Velugoti Yachama Nayaka. With the 
co-operation of Timma Nayaka and Makaraja, two of his lieute- 
nants, Jagga Raya seized and threw Sriranga and all the members 
of his family into prison, crowned the putative * son * as emperor, 
and persuaded some of the nobles to do him homage. Yachama 
defied Jagga Raya and gathered forces to rescue the lawful 
emperor; he also had prince Rama, Sriranga’s second son, smuggled 
out of the prison by a washerman. An attempt to rescue Sriranga 
by means of an underground tunnel, however, was discovered and 
led to stricter incarceration. Yachama made yet another effort to 
rescue the emperor and his family. He took advantage of Jagga 
Raya’s absence to arrange with a captain of Vellore fort, one 
Ite Obalesa, to slay the guards. On hearing that they were dead, 
Yachama was supposed to come and take possession of the fort. 
Unfortunately the news reached Jagga first, and he returned 
before Yachama had time to strike. Sriranga and his whole 


THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 


291 


family were killed within four months of his accession, as the only 
certain way of preventing all future intrigues for their rescue and 
restoration. 

The massacre of the royal family sent a thrill of horror through 
the kingdom, and Jagga Raya and his partisans came to be deeply 
hated. Sympathy grew for Ramadeva, the sole survivor of the 
family. He owed his survival to the forethought of Yachama, who 
now proclaimed him emperor, and there ensued a long-drawn out 
civil war in which the whole empire took part. Yachama defeated 
Jagga Raya in battle and forced him to flee to the jungles for 
refuge. The Gobburi estates in the south-west of the Nellore 
district were captured. But, nothing daunted, Jagga became active 
again, and secured the support of Muttu Virappa Nayaka of Madura 
and Krishnappa Nayaka of Gingee. Yachama on his side paid a 
visit to Tanjore and secured the adherence of Raghunatha Nayaka 
to Rama’s cause. Yachama and his allies gathered their forces in 
the neighbourhood of Trichinopoly; Yachama led his army from 
Vellore in that direction and was joined by Raghunatha’ s forces 
on the way. The decisive engagement took place at Topur, a 
village near the Grand Anicut. Jagga Raya fell in the battle with 
many of his Lieutenants, his army broke up and fled, and Yachama’s 
victory was complete (1616). The putative son of Venkata, the 
cause of all the trouble, was captured, and Krishnappa Nayaka lost 
all his forts except Gingee; his subsequent attempt to recover them 
only resulted in another defeat followed by captivity. The war 
was kept on by Etiraja, Jagga Raya’s younger brother, and by 
differences among the Nayaks. The death of the putative son in 
1619, followed by reconciliation between Ramadeva and Etiraja, 
whose daughter he married, put an end to the war and brought 
about the recognition of Rama in Karnataka, though the Madura 
Nayak went his own way. Etiraja now stood by his son-in-law, 
as did Raghunatha Nayaka who helped to restore the imperial 
authority over contumacious vassals. The reconciliation of Rama 
with Etiraja estranged Yachama, however, who had longed to 
confiscate all the Gobburi lands, including Pulicat and its surround- 
ings, which belonged to Etiraja himself. After much local fighting 
Ramadeva’s authority came to count for something in the remnants 
of the empire by about 1629, and the Nayak of Gingee gave up his 
hostile attitude and became a friendly vassal. Even Yachama’s 
partisans were subdued and Pulicat and its environs firmly secured 



292

for Etiraja and the empire. Thus the struggle of a decade and a 
half ended in a tolerable measure of success for Rama. 

But the civil war had given Bijapur its opportunity. The sultan 
at last realized his ambition of capturing the western Telugu 
country. In 1619-20 he sent Abdul Wahab Khan against Kumool 
where Gopalaraja offered stout resistance in which he was aided 
by Golconda; Abdul Wahab Khan was defeated and forced to 
make peace. But this was only a truce, for in 1624 he came back 
and attacked Kumool once more. Gopalaraja was now aided by 
his friends in the neighbourhood; but the Bijapur forces won the 
battle that followed, and Gopalaraja abandoned the fort and fled. 
Rama was too preoccupied to intervene. His death in 1630 at an 
early age of twenty-eight set the seal on the Muslim conquest of 
Kumool which passed to Bijapur for good. 

With no son or brother, Rama had nominated his cousin, Peda 
Venkata, a grandson of the great Rama Raya, to succeed to the 
throne; but Timma Raja, a paternal uncle of Rama, thought he had 
a better claim, and seized the government, compelling Venkata III 
to remain at his native place Anegondi. Gingee, Tanjore and 
Madura declared for Venkata, and Timma got no support and 
was generally looked upon as a usurper. He was nevertheless able 
to make trouble, and civil strife continued till his death in 1635. 
In the early stages he gained some successes, but prince Sriranga, 
son of Chenna Venkata, the younger brother of Venkata III, took 
the field on behalf of his uncle. With help from the Dutch at 
Pulicat, he beat Timma and compelled him to accept Venkata’s 
claim to the throne. He was, however, allowed to retain some of 
the places he had captured; but when he again stirred up trouble, 
the Nayak of Gingee defeated and slew him in 1635. Peace was 
thus restored. Venkata went and lived in Vellore, entrusting the 
defence of Penugonda (once again threatened by the sultan of 
Bijapur) to Kondi Nayaka who managed to keep it secure till the 
dissolution of the empire some fifteen years later. 

Thinking he was too friendly with the Nayak of Gingee, the 
rulers of Tanjore and Madura plotted to seize Venkata. They 
failed and war began in 1637 but was soon ended by a patched-up 
peace. For reasons that are not clear, Sriranga, once so loyal to 
his uncle, turned against him and actually engineered two invasions 
from Bijapur in 1638 and 1641. On the first occasion the sultan’s 
forces invested Bangalore, and Venkata had to buy peace at the 


THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 


293 


cost of a large indemnity early in 1639. Later in the year, with 
the help of troops sent by the southern Nayaks, he gained a 
moderate success which put a temporary check on Muslim inroads. 
The invasion of 1641 was led by Randhula Khan who was joined 
by £riranga; they marched upon Vellore after capturing some forts 
on the way, and pitched their camp within twelve miles of the 
capital. Once more aid from the Nayaks saved Vellore for a while. 

Watching the course of events in the Carnatic, the sultan of 
Golconda sent an army from the east along the coast in April 1642 
to capture as much territory as possible from the Hindu empires, 
which was now in the last stages of dissolution. Velugoti Timma, 
lord of Armagon in the extreme south of Nellore, and Damerla 
Venkata, ruler of Madras and Poonamallee, offered resistance, but 
it was not effective. Venkata III himself retired to the jungles 
near Narayanavanam in the Chittoor district where he died in a 
helpless condition on 10 October 1641. 

Venkata III had no children and was succeeded by his treacher- 
ous nephew Srlranga III. When he learnt that Venkata lay dying 
on the hills, Srlranga deserted the Bijapur general and put himself 
forward as the defender of his ancestral kingdom and made himself 
king on the 29 October 1642. But he was by no means equal to 
undoing as king the mischief he had started as rebel; and many of 
the nobles — like Damerla Venkata and Krishnappa Nay aka of 
Gingee — were against him. For a time, however, jealousy among 
the Muslim states appeared to give Srlranga a chance, and the 
aid of Bijapur in January 1644 enabled him to check the advance 
of Golconda beyond Udayagiri for a time. He now felt strong 
enough to demand and collect large sums of money from the 
southern Nayaks, part of which he paid over to Bijapur as the price 
of its help. Madura and Gingee soon rose again in rebellion, 
and another Golconda invasion reached Pulicat without opposition 
and was only repulsed by the Dutch commandant of the fort. 
To stop the Nayak of Gingee from joining the Golconda army, 
Srlranga made peace with him; he even gained a success against 
Golconda and pursued the invading army up to Kandukur in the 
north of the Nellore district. When Bijapur and Golconda reached 
an understanding, Srlranga was unable to face their combined 
forces, and had to retire. The Golconda general, Mir Jumla, 
was preparing to advance by way of Kumool, when the sultan of 
Golconda suddenly countermanded the war and compensated 



294 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Bijapur, perhaps as the result of an understanding with Sriranga. 
The danger of invasion ceased for a while until the southern 
Nayaks with Tirumala Nayaka of Madura at their head rebelled and 
appealed to Bijapur which sent Mustafa Khan against Vellore. 
Sriranga, who had gone south to meet the Nayak forces, had to 
huny back to the defence of his capital. Golconda also struck 
at the same time in the direction of Vinukonda and Udayagiri. 
Utterly overwhelmed and helpless, Sriranga made a last appeal to 
Hindu nationalism and exhorted his subjects to rally to the protec- 
tion of the state, temples. Brahmins and religion. The ears of the 
Nayaks were deaf to such appeals, and the great Mogul had asked 
Bijapur and Golconda to attack and partition the Carnatic between 
themselves. Defeated in battle by his own feudatory Nayaks in 
December 1645, Sriranga fell back on Vellore; pressure from 
Bijapur diminished for a time as the commanders went to Bijapur 
to settle disputes that had arisen among themselves; but Golconda 
was active and Mir Jumla came and occupied parts of Nellore and 
Cuddapah. Mustafa Khan of Bijapur came back and prepared to 
attack Vellore. Then the Nayaks realized too late the danger that 
was threatening them all together. Even so Tirumala Nayaka of 
Madura stood aloof. All other resources being spent, the jewels 
of the women of Vellore and the treasures of the Tirupati temple 
were used to maintain the defending forces. A slight success 
against Mustafa Khan won outside Vellore was not followed up by 
Sriranga owing to dissensions among his allies who abandoned him 
and retired inside the fortress. Another big battle followed at 
Virinchipuram (4 April 1646) in which Sriranga was again defeated 
despite aid from Mysore, Madura and Tanjore. Mustafa then 
besieged Vellore. Meanwhile Mir Jumla took all the territory in 
the east coast up to Pulicat; but the Dutch still refused to recognize 
Golconda for a while. Sriranga finally had to abandon all resist- 
ance and seek refuge in Tanjore. Madura and Mysore were unable 
to ward off the Muslim conquest of the Carnatic which was 
completed by 1652. When Tanjore, like Gingee a little before, 
submitted to Bijapur in 1649, Sriranga repaired to Mysore where 
he kept his court with the aid of the Keladi chiefs, dreaming of the 
reconquest of Vellore until death came to him as a relief some time 
about 1672. 

The fall of the Carnatic was not the fall of the Hindu cause, how- 
ever, for even as Bijapur was ravaging it and driving Sriranga into 



THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR

exile, Sivaji commenced his eventful career, and Sriranga did not 
come to his end till a little before Sivaji crowned himself Chatrapati 
(1674). Madura and Mysore continued as independent Hindu 
states well on into the eighteenth century. 

Thus, nevertheless, ended the Karnataka-Vijayanagar empire 
more than three centuries after its foundation. During that long 
period it had maintained a constant struggle against its Muslim 
neighbours on the north, destroyed the sultanate of Madura, and 
kept Southern India free from the inroads of Islam. True, we 
find Hindus in the service of Muslim rulers and Muslim troops 
engaged by the Hindu emperors of Vijayanagar. Diplomatic, and 
even dynastic alliances, also occurred often enough between these 
two continuously contending parties; but they do not alter the 
basic nature of the historic role of Vijayanagar, which was to 
preserve South India as the last refuge of the traditional culture 
and institutions of the country. The great commentary on the 
Vedas composed by a syndicate of scholars with Say ana at their 
head, and the impressive additions made to the structure of almost 
all important temples in the country by the rulers of Vijayanagar, 
form the most typical monuments of the work of the great Hindu 
empire. The Portuguese and Jesuits sought to Christianize the 
population, and to that extent they incurred the displeasure of the 
emperors and their feudatories, and their efforts in this direction 
were not allowed to proceed very far. 

It now remains to say something on the political, administrative 
and military system of the empire before concluding the chapter. 
The empire was in theory a hereditary monarchy; but the times 
were hard, and the hostility of the Muslim states on the one side 
and the instransigence of feudatories on the other made it imper- 
ative that the king should be possessed of high attainments in 
diplomacy and war. No wonder that weak kings were either 
imprisoned or dethroned by able and ambitious ministers, and that 
there was a change of the ruling dynasty on three occasions as the 
result of usurpations in which the nobles of the court played their 
own parts and took sides with rival claimants. On the whole, how- 
ever, political factions in Vijayanagar did not develop the rancour 
that marked the politics of the Bahmani court and of its successors; 
with rare exceptions, the leaders of the Hindu empire showed a 
readiness to recognize facts, and to prefer compromise, whenever 
possible, to open rebellion. 



296 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


The king was advised by a council of ministers whom he often 
consulted; but he was not bound to accept their advice, and was 
free to follow his own bent or the counsel of individual favourites. 
Even the most powerful minister held his office at the pleasure of 
the king, and was liable to be degraded and summarily punished, 
as Saluva Timma was punished by Krishnadeva Raya when he was 
suspected of having procured the murder of the heir apparent. 

It was customary for the emperor to have a plurality of wives 
and to maintain innumerable maids of honour to wait on them as 
well as on himself. They had well-appointed, separate apartments, 
and the maintenance of the harem was no small item in the expen- 
diture of the palace. The royal princes were often employed in 
administrative offices suited to their capacity. A strong monarch 
like Krishnadeva Raya imposed restrictions on the movements of 
those who might have any pretensions to the throne and kept them 
under surveillance. 

The work of the central government was apportioned among a 
number of departments, and there was a well- organized secretariat 
with its office near the palace. There were two treasuries, a smaller 
one for current remittances and withdrawals, and a larger reserve 
to which every king made it a point to add something and of which 
Paes says, it * is kept locked and sealed in such a way that it cannot 
be seen by anyone ’ and is * not opened except when the kings have 
great need \ 

Crown lands, annual tributes from feudatories and provincial 
governors paid at the time of the Mahanavami festival, port and 
customs dues from the commerce passing through the numerous 
ports of the empire, formed the chief sources of revenue which was 
collected both in cash and in kind. The land was carefully 
surveyed and assessed according to its quality, the rates differing 
between wet and dry lands and in accordance with the crops and 
the yield. The proportion of produce claimed as revenue varied 
from the traditional sixth to as much as half the gross yield. The 
state often handed over to temples and learned Brahmins the 
privilege of enjoying its share of the land revenue in accordance 
with prescribed terms. Taxes on professions and houses, fees for 
licences of various kinds, transit and market dues and judicial fines 
were other sources from which the state got its money. Most of 
these taxes were farmed out to the highest bidder both in areas 
directly administered from the centre and in the provinces, and

the impression produced is that of high and even oppressive 
taxation. 

The chief items of expenditure were the upkeep of the palace, 
the upkeep of the army, and charitable endowments. Krishna- 
•deva Raya laid down the theory that income should be divided 
into four equal parts: one quarter went to maintain the palace 
-establishment and to charity, two went to the army, and the 
remaining quarter was deposited in the Reserve Treasury. 
Doubtless this was only the ideal, and practice depended entirely 
on current exigencies. 

Vijayanagar was perhaps the nearest approach to a war-state 
over made by a Hindu kingdom; and its political organization was 
dominated by its military needs. The emperor maintained a large 
standing army consisting of an elephant corps, cavalry and infantry; 
in this force, ‘ the soldiers receive their pay noted Abdur Razzak, 
* every four months, and no payment is ever made by a draft upon 
the revenues of any province \ In addition, military fiefs studded 
the whole length and breadth of the empire, each under a nayak 
or military leader authorized to collect revenue and to administer 
a specified area provided he maintained an agreed number of 
elephants, horses, and troops ever ready to join the imperial forces 
in war. Nuniz counted more than two hundred such nayaks . 
There were regular military schools where men were trained in 
archery, swordsmanship, and so on, and prepared for enlistment 
in the army; the artillery, however, seems generally to have been 
manned by foreigners. A military camp was a moving city, 
4 arranged in streets with many open spaces \ The number of 
non-combatant camp-followers was too large not to impede the 
troops, but this was a common feature of the times. Fortresses 
played a large part in the defence organization, and the arts of 
siege were well known and extensively practised. There must have 
been a navy of some sort for the Rayas had the command of several 
ports and of parts of Ceylon; but we have no definite information 
on its strength or organization. 

The details, of the organization of provincial government de- 
pended on the historical antecedents of each locality. In the 
extreme south and on the west coast, the older rulers of the land 
were allowed to carry on in a subordinate capacity, paying tribute 
and submitting to the general supervision of a high official of the 
empire, usually a prince of the blood-royal; such were the Pandyas, 



298 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


the Tiruvadis, and the chiefs of Gersoppa, Karkal and other places. 
In the Tamil districts the ancient Chola territorial divisions, together 
with the deeply-rooted system of autonomous village assemblies, 
were allowed to continue and no attempt was made to impose 
arrangements perfected by the Rayas elsewhere in the Telugu and 
Kannada areas. The autonomy of villages, however, suffered 
considerable abridgement in this period as their officials came to 
be linked up more and more closely with the central government 
and its representatives. The names of divisions and offices differed 
with the locality; but everywhere the provincial governor appointed 
from the centre was more the military commander of a strategic 
fort than an ordinary civil servant of the crown. The boundaries 
of provinces, or rajyas , were changed from time to time to suit 
immediate administrative needs; and some territories, especially 
in the northern sections of the empire which constantly passed to 
and fro between Vijayanagar and its Muslim enemies, must have 
experienced many changes in their rule. These governors and 
ndyaks were allowed to rule their fiefs by deputy and therefore 
appointed and maintained their agents in the capital when they 
were not present in person. A regular system of espionage per- 
formed the duties of the modern intelligence service and kept the 
emperor informed of the doings of his subordinates all over the 
empire as well as of the designs and movements of neighbouring 
rulers. Captains of fortresses at the frontiers were generally very 
trustworthy men who were specially exempted from attendance at 
the capital. 

The police system was fairly efficient, the rule being that when 
a theft occurred the property was recovered or made good by the 
police-officers. Wherever trouble was expected from jungle tribes, 
palayagars were posted with a considerable body of retainers main- 
tained from jagirs — land assignments — set apart for the purpose. 
In towns the streets were patrolled regularly at nights, and the 
police arrangements of the capital were particularly efficient and 
received the commendation of foreign observers like Abdur 
Razzak. 

Justice was administered by a hierarchy of courts, the emperor’s 
sabhd being the highest appellate authority. Some of these courts 
appear to have been peripatetic, being held wherever the officers 
concerened were encamped. The smriti of Yajnavalkya and 
Madhava’s great commentary on Parasara’s code commanded 


THE EMPIRE OF VIJAYANAGAR 299 

special authority in the decision of doubtful legal points. Minor 
offences and violation of caste and trade rules were dealt with in 
the first instance by village courts and caste and guild organiza- 
tions, and perhaps seldom found their way to the courts of the 
crown. When human evidence failed trial by ordeal was not 
unknown. By modem standards punishments were harsh and 
even barbarous, including as they did, in extreme cases, mutilation, 
impalement, and being thrown to the elephants. 

The emperors of Vijayanagar addressed themselves deliberately 
to the task of preserving the Hindu social and political order from 
being destroyed by Islam, and in this task they were eminently 
successful in spite of repeated reverses in the field of battle. That 
today South Indian society presents a striking contrast in many 
respects to society in North India, that South India is still adorned 
by a large number of great temples that enshrine the artistic 
achievements of successive generations of Hindu master-builders, 
and that the Hindu-Muslim 4 problem ’ was virtually unknown in 
the South furnish some measure of the success that attended the 
efforts of Vijayanagar and its rulers.

SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 

Plan of remaining chapters — territorial divisions— people — court life — king — 
army and navy — war and camp — Brahmins — caste — food and dress — education 
— learning — the temple — sports and pastimes — town and village life — agricul- 
ture and irrigation — industries — transport — merchant guilds and articles of

the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries — currency, weights and measures. 

In this and the succeeding chapters we shall try to sketch the social 
and economic conditions that prevailed in South India from the 
sixth to the seventeenth centuries a.d., and to trace in outline the 
principal movements of culture in the spheres of literature, religion 
and art. The ground is vast and the material abundant; only a 
summary treatment of selected topics will be possible within the 
limits of this book. 

The country was divided into certain well-marked territorial 
divisions, e.g., Kuntala, Andhra, Tondainad, Chola, Pandya and 
Chera, and the people of each division tended to develop and 
cherish separate traditions and habits of their own. These local 
patriotisms did not by any means prove an obstacle to the forma- 
tion of larger political units, as happened under the Chalukyas of 
Badami and Kalyani, the Rashtrakutas, the Cholas and Vijaya- 
nagar; and they played a great part in mitigating the evils which 
resulted from the break-up of the larger units. 

There is no means of forming a reliable estimate of the popula- 
tion at any time during this long period we are now reviewing; 
even the Cholas, although they kept a minute record of property 
in land, never thought of taking a census of the population. In 
the ports on the seaboard, and in the capitals of kingdoms, parti- 
cularly in Vijayanagar, there were undoubtedly considerable 
numbers of foreigners, including Arabs, Jews, Persians, Chinese, 
people from Malaya and the eastern archipelago; and, later, the 
Portuguese and other European nations. The presence of Parsis 
is noticed by Friar Jordanus at the beginning of the fourteenth 
century. Necessarily and obviously, however, the bulk of the 
population was always and everywhere Hindus organized in castes. 
There was some connexion between caste and occupation, but this 



304 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


was by no means unalterable, and the pressure of new factors and 
situations was always bringing about changes, in spite of protests 
from conservatives and even occasional attempts on the part of the 
political power to stop them. 

Then, as now, the service of the state in its civil departments, 
as well as the army and the navy (where one was maintained), 
furnished openings for all classes of the population; and many 
are the instances of Brahmin generals who distinguished themselves 
in war. Krishnadeva Raya had a high opinion of their loyalty 
and considered that they should be put in charge of important 
forts in all strategic places. Forest and hill tribes furnished a 
favourite recruiting-ground for the army, especially in time of 
war. The roads were often infested by robbers, and any sharp 
local quarrel or the turbulence of a chieftain might lead to a village 
being attacked or its cattle being taken away ; in such circumstances 
the people generally had to defend themselves, and numerous 
inscriptions attest the bravery of many village heroes, especially 
near forests and mountains. 

Conquests sometimes led to the large-scale migration of people 
from one part of the country to another, and to new adjust- 
ments in economic and social relations. The most recent instance 
of this, and one whose effects are still clearly traceable, was the 
coming into the Tamil country of numbers of Telugus and 
Kannadigas with the extension of the empire of Vijayanagar and, 
perhaps, of the Hoysala power earlier. They must have come in 
as officers and soldiers upholding the authority of the rulers and 
their migration was doubtless encouraged by grants of land and 
other concessions at the expense of the people of the conquered 
territory. Royal patronage of learning, the arts, and religion 
were other causes of similar movements. 

The king and his court led an extravagant and luxurious life 
in striking contrast to the modest living standard of the rest of the 
population. The pomp and ceremony of the court became more 
and more dazzling in the course of centuries and may be said to 
have reached its culmination under the Rayas of Vijayanagar. 
The palace always had a large establishment attached to it; in 
theory there were seventy-two departments (niyogas) in a palace 
as in a temple. On the establishment there were large numbers of 
women, specially chosen for their youth and beauty. Some were 
imported from abroad while others were captured in war and 


SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 


305 


enslaved. Many, needless to say, were courtesans, skilled in the 
arts of music and dancing, while others were the concubines of 
princes, nobles and courtiers. A mistress of the Chalukya king 
Vijayaditya of Badami, Vinapotigal by name (notice the honorific 
plural), performed the hiranyagarbha at Mahakuta and presented 
to the deity a pedestal ( pitha ), set with rubies, with a silver umbrella 
over it. The Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha regularly employed 
courtesans as his emissaries and his feudatories had to receive 
batches of them from the emperor and entertain them in their 
courts. 

Princesses of the royal family generally received a good educa- 
tion in literature and the fine arts; some were quite equal, on 
occasions, to the tasks of administration and war. The Chalukyan 
princess Akkadevi, elder sister of Jayasimha II, carried on the 
administration of a province and personally and actively engaged 
in fights and sieges. Hoysala Ballala Fs queens were highly 
accomplished in music and dancing, and Sovaladevi, the queen of 
Kalacuri So vide va (1174) used to display her accomplishments 
in these arts in large assemblies attended by nobles, scholars and 
artists from different countries. The Portuguese chronicler Paes 
(1520-2) and other foreign writers often described the number and 
costly establishments of the Vijayanagar queens as well as the large 
numbers of women attendants, the lavishness of their clothing 
and jewellery, and the sundry light duties allotted to them in the 
daily routine of the palace. We learn, for instance, that in the 
provincial court of Raghunatha Nayaka of Tanjore there were many 
learned women poets who were capable of expounding works 
written in various languages. The role of women in high society 
was varied, important, and, generally speaking, pleasant. Satl 
was not unknown, especially among the upper classes, but by no 
means common. 

The king made his appearance in open durbar at least once a 
day, when all high officials and nobles had to be in attendance, 
and nothing was omitted that could increase the splendour of the 
display. It was then that he generally transacted public business, 
heard complaints, received ambassadors from foreign countries 
and tribute from subordinate rulers. Such scenes have been 
repeatedly described by travellers from abroad, and the following 
account by Nicolas Pimenta (1599) of the interview he had with 
the Naick (rtayak) of Gingee at Chidambaram may be considered 
20 



306 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


more or less typical. 4 The Naickus of Gingi was come hither, in 
whose dominion it standeth. He commanded that we should be 
brought to his Presence. Before us two hundred Brachmanes 
went in a ranke to sprinkle the house with Holy water, and to 
prevent Sorcerie against the King, which they use to do every day 
that the King first entreth into any house. We found him lying 
on a silken carpet leaning on two Cushions, in a long silken 
Garment, a great Chaine hanging from his necke, distinguished 
with many Pearles and Gemmes, all over his breast, his long hair 
tyed with a knot on the Crowne, adorned with Pearles; some 
Princes and Brachmanes attended him. He entertained us kindly, 
and marvelled much that we chewed not the leaves of Betele which 
were offered to us, and dismissed us with gifts of precious clothes 
wrought with Gold, desiring a Priest of us for his new Citie which 
he was building.’ In 1443, the king of Vijayanagar interviewed 
the Persian ambassador Abdur Razzak twice a week when he 
stayed in the city, and on one occasion he said to the ambassador 
through his interpreter: 4 Your monarchs invite an ambassador, 
and receive him to their table ; as you and we may not eat together, 
this purse full of gold is the feast we give to an ambassador.’ The 
sultans of the Bahmani kingdom and their nobles were, if anything, 
even more luxurious and extravagant in their mode of life, as the 
Russian merchant Athanasius Nikitin testifies. About Bijapur, 
Varthema (1505) wrote: 4 The king lives in great pride and pomp. 
A great number of his servants wear on the insteps of their shoes 
rubies and diamonds, and other jewels; so you may imagine how 
many are worn on the fingers of the hand and in the ears .... They 
are all Mahommedans .... The ladies go with their faces quite 
covered, according to the custom of Damascus.’ 

In war the king sometimes took the field in person, but more 
often sent his trusted generals. The traditional fourfold division 
of the army is often spoken of, particularly in literary works, but 
there is no tangible evidence of the chariot playing any part in 
battle. Elephants retained their importance to a very late date, 
and Yuan Chwang observed that in Maharashtra they were made 
drunk before an engagement. Cavalry was so important that 
kings often competed with one another in the terms they offered 
to Arab merchants in the busy trade in horses. Firearms came into 
use in the wars between the Bahmani and Vijayanagar kingdoms, 
although the gunners were usually foreigners. Forts played a 


SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 


307 


prominent part in the defence system from very early times, but 
the art of besieging and reducing them was also well understood. 
Details of the recruitment, training and equipment of armies are 
lacking till we come to the period of Vijayanagar. It is clear, 
however, that they included men from all strata of society, and 
that their numbers were increased by the addition of fresh recruits 
and feudal levies when a war was on. A select body of troops 
often served as a king’s chosen bodyguard who shared a meal with 
the king at the time of his accession and were thereafter always 
bound to defend him with their lives. They were called by various 
names — Sahavasis under the Chalukyas, Vehikkarar under the 
Cholas, Garudas under the Hoysalas, and Apattudavigal under the 
Pandyas. The institution seems to have fallen into desuetude in 
later times. Though total war was altogether unknown, war was 
not always confined in its effects to the fighting forces. Although 
instances of clemency, such as Narasimhavarman I sparing 
Badami, and Vikramaditya II the citizens of Kanchl, are indeed 
known, the wars between the Cholas and the Chalukyas of Kalyani, 
and those between Bahmani and Vijayanagar, were undoubtedly 
.marked by much wanton destruction and cruelty. Nuniz describes 
an expeditionary force of the Vijayanagar army in the following 
terms : * All were equally well armed, each after his own fashion, 
the archers and musqueteers with their quilted tunics, and the 
shieldmen with their swords and poignards in their girdles; the 
shields are so large that there is no need for armour to protect the 
body, which is completely covered; the horses in full clothing, and 
the men with doublets, and weapons in their hands, and on their 
heads headpieces after the manner of their doublets, quilted with 
cotton. The war elephants go with their howdahs from which 
four men fight on each side of them, and the elephants are com- 
pletely clothed, and on their tusks they have knives fastened, much 
ground and sharpened, with which they do great harm. Several 
cannon were also taken.’ On the camp, the same writer observed: 
4 All the camp was divided into regular streets. Each captain’s 
division has its market where you found all kinds of meat, such as 
sheep, goats, pigs, fowls, hares, partridges and other birds, and 
this in great abundance; so much, so that it would seem as if you 
were in the city of Bisnaga.’ There were gymnasia in the capital 
and other important centres where the troops were systematically 
trained in military exercises in peacetime. Commanders who were 



308 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


defeated were given women’s clothes to wear, as Yuan Chwang 
observed, and as has been confirmed by Chola inscriptions of the 
eleventh century. 

Not much information is forthcoming about the navy, though 
we hear of naval operations, great and small. The conquest of 
Revatidvipa and Puri on the West Coast by the Chalukyas of 
Badami, and that of Ceylon and the Maldives by the Pallavas, 
Pandyas and Cholas as well as by Vijayanagar, above all the great 
naval expedition of Rajendra Chola against the maritime empire of 
Sri Vijaya could not have been executed without an efficient naval 
organization. Furthermore the maritime trade of the country, 
which was always considerable, must have required protection 
from the depredations of pirates and hostile powers. The opinions 
of Chola mariners expressed in treatises on navigation were quoted 
with approval by their Arab successors in the fifteenth and sixteenth 
centuries. There is no doubt that the kingdoms of South India 
had a fairly continuous maritime tradition which served their 
immediate purposes; but it failed them altogether against the more 
adventurous nations of Europe. 

In civil life the Brahmins occupied a highly respected position. 
With the exception of the few who entered the state service in the 
army and elsewhere, they generally devoted themselves to religious 
and literary pursuits and stood outside the race for wealth and 
power. They lived on voluntary gifts from all classes of people 
from the king downwards. Hundreds of inscriptions proclaim 
the continued solicitude of kings, nobles and merchants for the 
maintenance and encouragement of a class of men who devoted 
themselves exclusively to learning and teaching, who were capable 
of detached thinking on all problems of social welfare, and whose 
presence in every town and village was calculated to provide not 
only patterns of ethical and religious conduct for the rest of the 
population, but active helpers and disinterested arbitrators in the 
numerous concerns of their daily life. ‘ The intellectual superiority 
of the Brahmans as a caste says Sir Charles Eliot, ‘ was suffi- 
ciently real to ensure its acceptance and in politics they had the 
good sense to rule by serving, to be ministers and not kings. In 
theory and to a considerable extent in practice, the Brahmans and 
their gods are not an imperium in imperio but an imperium super 
imperium .’ It cannot be denied that the Brahmin did not always 
live up to the ideals of his vocation, and that some movements. 



SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 309 

like that of the Lingayats, raised a protest against the position 
accorded to the Brahmin in society; but as a rule he proved true 
to his trust, and the rest of the community willingly acknowledged 
the justice of it in every way. 

In fact the institution of caste with all its social and economic 
implications was accepted almost universally, and the upholding 
of the social order organized on its basis was held to be the primary 
duty of the ruler. This accounts at once for the prevalence of 
much social exclusiveness in matters of food and marriage among 
different sections of the people, and for the readiness with which 
they came together and co-operated on matters of common concern 
like the management of a temple and its adjuncts, the regulation 
of land and irrigation rights in the village, and the administration 
of local affairs generally. The emphasis was throughout on the 
performance of duties attaching to one’s station rather than on 
the rights of the individual or group. The general atmosphere 
was one of social harmony and contentment with the existing 
order; differences and disputes there were — there has been no 
society without them— but they were seldom acrimonious. Even 
the quarrels between 4 right-hand ’ and 4 left-hand ’ castes, a dis- 
tinction which has an early start and whose origin is a mystery, 
did not attain the violence that characterized them in subsequent 
times. Both in towns and villages, the castes tended to live in 
separate quarters of their own and follow their own peculiar 
customs and habits. The outcastes who tilled the land and did 
menial work (under conditions little different from slavery) lived 
in hamlets at a distance from the village proper. 

Some curious instances of mixed castes and their trades occur in 
the inscriptions. Towards the close of the reign of Kulottunga I, 
for instance, the bhattas of a village consulted the codes and laid 
down the professions to be followed by the anuloma caste of 
Rathakaras as architecture, coach and chariot-building, the erection 
of gopuras with icons on them, the manufacture of sacrificial instru- 
ments and so on — a decision in conformity with the nearly contem- 
porary manual of law, the Mitdkshara of Vignanesvara. Sometimes 
the privileges of particular castes became, for specific reasons, 
the subject of royal regulation. For instance, the stone-masons 
(kanmalar) of South Kongu and some other areas were granted 
the following privileges by a Chola monarch: the blowing of two 
conches, the beating of drums and so on at domestic occurrences.

good or bad, the use of sandals when they went out of their 
homes; and the plastering of the walls of their residences with lime 
plaster. A barber Kondoja pleased Sadasiva and Rama Raya so 
much that he was able to secure exemption for his entire community 
from taxes and dues like forced labour, land-rent, Mahdnavami 
torches and so on; and a number of inscriptions recording this 
fact contain engravings of razors, strops, mirrors, scissors and 
others of the barbers’ tools of trade. 

Food and dress varied with the time, place and the class of 
people concerned. Much authentic and detailed information on 
these subjects can be gathered from epigraphs, literature, and the 
observations of foreign travellers which become more copious and 
detailed after the foundation of Vijayanagar. Here, for instance, 
is Varthema’s account of what he saw in Vijayanagar early in the 
sixteenth century: ‘ Their dress is this: the men of condition wear 
a short shirt and on their head a cloth of gold and silk in 
the Moorish fashion, but nothing on the feet. The common people 
go quite naked, with the exception of a piece of cloth about their 
middle. The king wears a cap of gold brocade two spans long, 
and when he goes to war he wears a quilted dress of cotton, and 
over it he puts another garment full of golden piastres, and having 
all around it jewels of various kinds. His horse is worth more 
than some of our cities, on account of the ornaments which it 
wears. When he rides for his pleasure he is always accompanied 
by three or four kings, and many other lords, and five or six 
thousand horse. Wherefore he may be considered to be a very 
powerful lord.’ 

Some sections of the population — Brahmins, Jains, and Saivas 
— were strict vegetarians. There was generally a good supply of 
the prime necessaries of life, and scarcity and famine are only 
rarely heard of. 

Of the system of education, we get more positive information 
on higher studies in Sanskrit than on popular education; while the 
former formed the subject of liberal endowments recorded in 
inscriptions of considerable length, we have to make inferences 
about the latter from the mention of the village teacher and his 
share in the arable land of the village and also occasional direct 
endowments, as for the teaching of Tamil, Marathi, and Prakrit in 
the schools in Kuntala. What we should now call technical or 
vocational training was a private affair; the father brought up his 


SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 311 

children in his calling, and learning went side by side with doing. 
The erection of a temple or palace must have been the occasion as 
much for the discovery of fresh talent as for the application of 
known abilities; and, judging from the monuments that have 
survived, we may well conclude that at no time was there a dearth 
of artisans who were also great artists. The beauty and accuracy 
which mark the engraving of most inscriptions on stone and copper 
attest the high degree of the literacy and skill of the engravers, 
while the literary quality of many of the inscriptions, as well as 
the volume of literature produced in all languages, shows that the 
cultivation of the popular speech of each locality and its employ- 
ment in administration and education was by no means neglected. 
All we lack is clear knowledge of the processes by which these 
results were achieved, especially during the earlier period when the 
mathas had not come up in such large numbers as they did later 
to foster vernacular learning and culture. The 4 three Rs ’ were 
taught in village schools which met under the shade of a tree or 
in the verandahs of temples, and the village teacher ( vatti or 
akkariga ) was among the regular village officials who held assign- 
ments of land from the village on the condition that they fulfilled 
specified duties. The Italian traveller Pietro Della Valle (1623) 
has left a vivid account of the village schools and the methods of 
instruction they followed, including the process of learning by rote 
and the use of fine sand strewn on the floor for writing, methods 
which survived in full force till the other day and have perhaps 
not quite gone out yet in remote villages. Ibn Batuta (1333-45) 
records: ‘I saw in Hanaur thirteen schools for the instruction of 
girls, and twenty-three for boys, a thing I have not seen anywhere 
else.’ Robert de Nobili, in a letter of 1610, says that in Madura 
there were 10,000 students who went to the Professor in Theology 
and Philosophy. When the Christian missionaries came, they 
began to start schools which, besides hospitals, formed the main 
channels for the propagation of their gospel. They had schools 
at Madura, San Thome and Chandragiri. 

4 Adult education ’ was provided throughout the country by 
endowments in temples for the recitation and exposition of the 
epics and Puranas. An intelligent and popular expositor seldom 
confined himself to the words of his text, but at once instructed 
and amused his audience by ranging over a variety of topics 
including shrewd comments on current affairs. This form of

popular instruction is not unknown even at the present day. The 
singing of devotional hymns in temples by choirs regularly main- 
tained for that purpose and the training of young men for the 
same purpose in schools generally attached to mathas is another 
side of education that deserves notice. Besides mafhas , Jain pallis 
and Buddhist vihdras played a part in educating the people wherever 
they existed, and they had large libraries of books in all branches 
of learning which were being copied from time to time. 

Sanskrit learning tended to be the monopoly of Brahmins, though 
there were exceptions, and it was particularly encouraged by means 
of large special endowments. Sometimes only four, and some- 
times as many as fourteen or eighteen subjects of study were 
enumerated. The four subjects were: philosophy ( anvlkshiki ), 
Veda ( trayi ), economics ( vdrtta ), and politics ( dandaniti ) — a group 
which was particularly suited to kings and which in fact first occurs 
in Kautilya’s Arthasastra. The fourteen vidyas were: the four 
Vedas ; six angas (auxiliaries) — phonetics, prosody, grammar, 
etymology (of difficult words), astronomy and ritual; purana ; logic 
( tarka ); exegesis (mimamsd); and law (dharmasastra). To these 
were added ayurveda (medicine), dhanurveda (archery), gandharva - 
veda (Music) and arthasastra (politics) to make up the tale of 
eighteen. Brahmins learned in many of these sciences served as 
Rdjagurus (teachers of kings) and spread themselves all over the 
land edifying the lives of the inhabitants of every town and village. 
Gifts of land and houses were frequently offered as inducements to 
Brahmins to come and settle where they were wanted. In several 
places they were organized into corporate colleges called brahma - 
purls and ghafikds , like the brahmapurl at Belgaum or the ghafika 
at Kanchi. A Vaishnava mafha and its scholars are mentioned in 
an inscription of Nripatunga’s reign from Kaveripakkam. Another 
record of the same monarch proves the flourishing condition of a 
college at Bahur, near Pondicherry, where the fourteen vidyas were 
pursued. At Salatgi was another eminent college to which pupils 
came from different Janapadas (countries) and whose vidyarthi- 
sangha was richly endowed in 945 by Narayana, the minister of 
Krishna III, with the revenues of houses, land, and levies on 
marriages and other ceremonies. We also hear (1058) of a ghatika 
at Nagai with ample provision for 200 Veda students, 50 students 
of the sastras, three teachers of the Vedas, and three teachers of 
the sastras — one each for Bha#a, Prabhakara-mlmamsa and Nyaya

— besides a librarian who brings up the strength to 257 in all. At 
Ennayiram in South Arcot the Chola Rajendra I endowed a large 
college of (1) 270 junior students of whom 40 studied the elements 
of grammar according to the Rupavatara , 10 studied the sutras of 
Bodhayana, and the rest learnt the Vedas by rote; (2) 70 senior 
students, 10 studying vedanta , 25 vydkarana , and the rest Prabha- 
kara-mlmamsa ; and (3) a teaching staff of 14. In another college, 
in the same neighbourhood at Tribhuvani, there were 260 students 
and 12 teachers. Full details have been preserved of the food and 
residence of the pupils of a smaller institution at Tirumukkudal in 
Chingleput district in an inscription of the reign of Virarajendra 
(1067) which also gives equally interesting details about the stock 
of medicines maintained in a good-sized hospital in the same place. 
A medical school at Tiruvaduturai where the Ashtangahridaya and 
Car aka Samhitd were taught, and a school for the study of Panini’s 
grammar at Tiruvorriyur, may also be noted. The study of Law 
and Astronomy found special encouragement from the Yadavas 
of Devagiri. Education and learning continued to receive generous 
support from the Rayas of Vijayanagar and their numerous feuda- 
tories. The BahmanI kingdom and its successors naturally devoted 
more attention to Muslim education and Islamic studies, in such 
large and well-equipped colleges as the one at Bidar, established by 
the celebrated minister Mahmud Gawan. 

The apparent geographical isolation of Kerala did not mean any 
cultural aloofness. Kerala appears in many ways in the literature 
of the rest of India. In Kerala itself the Nambudiri Brahmins 
allowed only the eldest son to contract a permanent marriage and 
rear up a family; the younger sons freed from family cares devoted 
themselves generally to study and teaching, and helped in the 
promotion of literacy among the masses. Sanskrit learning was 
patronized by the chiefs as can be seen from a grant of the Ay king 
Karunandadakkan, middle of the ninth century, endowing a college 
and hostel for the maintenance of ninety-five vedic students who 
were admitted after an entrance test in Vydkarana (grammar), 
Mimamsd (exegetics), Paurohitya (priest-craft) and Trairajya - 
vyavahara (Law and usage of the three countries, perhaps Pandya, 
Chola and Kerala). The college was to function in a Vishnu temple 
at Parthivasekharapuram in South Travancore, and indeed, the 
many temples of the land as well as the mathas and sattras tended 
each in its way to become a centre of learning of the gurukula type. 



314 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


The temple was not merely a place of worship; it filled a large 
place in the cultural and economic life of the people. Its con- 
struction and maintenance offered employment to numbers of 
architects and craftsmen who vied with one another in bold 
planning and skilful execution. The making of icons in stone and 
metal gave scope to the talents of the best sculptors of the country; 
some of the larger bronzes cast in the Chola period take their place 
among the wonders of the world for the mass of metal manipulated 
as well as for the grace of form attained in the result. The daily 
routine, especially of the larger temples, gave constant employment 
to numbers of priests, choristers, musicians, dancing-girls, florists, 
cooks and many other classes of servants. The periodical festivals 
were occasions marked by fairs, contests of learning, wrestling- 
matches and every other form of popular entertainment. Schools 
and hospitals were often located in the temple precincts, and it also 
served often as the town hall where people assembled to consider 
local affairs or to hear the exposition of sacred literature. The 
large endowments in land and cash bestowed on each temple by 
successive generations of pious donors tended to make it at once 
a generous landlord and a banker whose aid was always available 
to those that needed it. The practice of decorating images, parti- 
cularly those used during processions, with numerous jewels set 
with precious stones encouraged the jeweller’s art to a considerable 
extent. There can be no better record of the details of the economy 
of a large temple than is provided by the numerous inscriptions of 
the Great Temple of Tanjore. There the gifts of Rajaraja came 
largely from booty captured in successful warfare and included 
well over 41,500 kalanjus of gold, or, taking a kalanju to be about 
70 grains, well over 500 lbs. troy weight. The value of jewels was 
10,200 kasus , equal to half as many kalanjus in gold. Of silver 
he gave 50,650 kalanjus or over 600 lbs. troy weight. He set apart 
lands in villages throughout his dominions, including Ceylon, with 
an annual income of 116,000 kalams of paddy, equal at the then 
prevailing prices to 58,000 kasus , besides a cash income of 1,100 
kasus . For the service of the temple, 400 devaddsis were impressed 
from those attached to other temples in the empire, each one 
receiving a pangu (share) consisting of a house and one veli of land 
yielding a net revenue of 100 kalams of paddy a year. About 180 
further such shares were set apart to maintain 212 male dancing- 
masters, musicians, drummers, tailors, goldsmiths, accountants. 


SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 315 

and so on. These men-servants included three people to sing the 
Ariyam and four others the Tamil , which apparently are the two 
systems of music called ahamdrgam and desi elsewhere. A choir 
of 50, on a daily wage of three kurunis of paddy, recited the 
Tiruppadiyam to the accompaniment of musical instruments. This 
choir had the additional privilege of filling vacancies by co-option 
if any of their number died or emigrated without leaving behind 
a suitable relative to take his place. Rajaraja’s elder sister 
Kundavai was another generous contributor to temple funds. On 
one occasion she presented gold weighing nearly 10,000 kalanjus 
and utensils valued at 18,000 kasus. Others, too — queens, high 
officials and regiments of soldiers — made gifts which have been 
recorded with equal care and precision on the walls and pillars of 
the temple. Cash endowments, which amounted to several 
thousands of kasus, were loaned to numerous village assemblies 
at rates of interest fixed in kind or money, and generally about 12 
per cent per annum. Camphor, cardamom-seeds, champak-buds 
and khus-khus roots were among the products provided for by 
means of cash endowments. 

The inscriptions contain accurate and detailed descriptions of 
numerous icons, some of which were cast in the form of complex 
groups of figures illustrating favourite themes from legends. They 
also contain an equally minute and complete account of the 
ornaments and jewels of the temple, and record periodical inquests 
into the management of temple affairs by officers of state, and 
sometimes even by the king himself — clear proof that the business 
side of the temple administration was properly controlled. All 
systems of public administration were not as efficient as the Chola 
system, and all temples were not so well off as that of Tanjore. As a 
matter of course, however, every temple held more or less the same 
position in relation to its neighbourhood that the Great Temple held 
in the Chola capital; the difference was only one of degree. And 
it is no exaggeration to say that the temple gathered round itself all 
that was best in the arts of civilized existence and regulated them 
with the humaneness bom of the spirit of dharma. As an agency 
of social well-being the medieval Indian temple has few parallels. 

Of the sports and pastimes of the different classes of people, 
the inscriptions do not give us many authentic accounts of a detailed 
nature. The Rashtrakuta Govinda III took part in a boar-hunt 
on the banks of the Tungabhadra when he was camping there 



316 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


after his conquest of Kanchl in 804, and the Ganga Butuga IFs 
hound 4 Kali ’ died after fighting a boar. (A memorial was 
erected over its remains at Atakur and a gorava appointed to offer 
regular worship to it.) A ball game on horseback, much like polo, 
is said to have been the favourite game of the Rashtrakuta prince 
Indra IV. Paes states that, every morning before daylight, Krishna- 
deva Raya drank gingelly-oil and exercised himself with earthenware 
weights and a sword till he had sweated out all the oil. He then 
wrestled with one of his wrestlers and after that went riding before 
his morning bath. There were arenas inside the royal palace in 
Vijayanagar where, for the amusement of the monarch and his 
court, fights between animals and wrestling matches took place, 
the latter sometimes among women. Gambling, racing, cock and 
ram fights were the pastimes of common people, besides the 
festivals and fairs of which there was no lack. Then there were 
peripatetic entertainers like the snake-charmer and troupes of 
acrobatic performers whose visits furnished much genuine amuse- 
ment at very little cost. Picnics and folk-dances offered other 
means of diversion. The following account of what Pietro Della 
Valle saw in the streets of Ikkeri of an evening (in 1623-4) is of 
great interest from several points of view: 

‘We saw going along the streets several companies of young 
girls, well clothed, after their manner, with some of the above- 
mentioned wrought and figured silk from the girdle downwards; 
and from thence upwards either naked, or else very pure linen, 
either of one colour, or striped and wrought with several, besides 
a scarf of the same work cast over the shoulder. Their heads 
were decked with yellow and white flowers formed into a high and 
large Diadem, with some sticking out like sun-beams, and others 
twisted together and hanging down in several fashions which made 
a pretty sight. All of them carry’d in each hand a little round 
painted stick, about a span long, or a little more which they struck 
together after a musical measure, to the sound of Drums and other 
instruments, and one of the skilfullest of the company sang one 
verse of a song, at the end of which they all reply’d seven or eight 
times in the number of their meter with the word Cole , Cole , Cole , 
which signifies I know not what, but, I believe, ’tis a word of joy . . . 
I imagined it was for some extraordinary Festival.’ 

Another citation, from the same observer, relating to Calicut, 
is well worth making for its vivid portraiture of conditions many 



SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

of which were obviously not confined to that city: 6 We went to see 
the Bazar which is near the shore; the Houses or rather Cottages 
are built of Earth and thatched with Palm-leaves, being very low; 
the streets also are very narrow, but sufficiently long; the Market 
was full of all sorts of Provisions and other things necessary to 
the livelihood of that people, conformably to their custom; for, 
as for clothing they need little, both men and women going quite 
naked, saving that they have a piece either of Cotton, or silk, 
hanging down from the girdle to the knees and covering their 
shame ; the better sort are either wont to wear it all blew, or white 
stripped with Azure, or Azure and some other colour; a dark blew 
being most esteemed amongst them. Moreover both Men and 
Women wear their hair long and ty’d about their head ; the women 
with a lock hanging on one side under the ear becomingly enough 
as almost all Indian women do; the dressing of whose head is, in 
my opinion, the gallantest that I have seen in any other nation. 
The Men have a lock hanging down from the crown of the head, 
sometimes a little inclined on one side; some of them use a small 
coloured head-band, but the Women use none at all. Both sexes 
have their Arms adorned with bracelets, their ears with pendants, 
and their necks with jewels; the Men commonly go with their 
Swords and Bucklers, or other Arms, in their hands, as I said of 
those of Balagate.’ 

The vast majority of the population lived in villages and agricul- 
ture was their main occupation. Great prestige attached to 
ownership of land, and everyone, whatever his occupation, aimed 
at having a small plot he could call his own. The village was thus 
primarily a settlement of peasants, and its assembly an association 
of landlords. A periodical redistribution of the arable land of a 
village among its inhabitants prevailed in many parts of the country 
till comparatively recent times. Besides the landowners, great and 
small, there was a fairly large class of landless labourers, an 
agrarian proletariat, who assisted in the operations and shared the 
proceeds of agriculture; some of them were in a condition of 
serfdom, and all of them had less to do with the management of 
local affairs than the landowners. The artisans of the village had 
shares from the co mm on land of the village, which were of the 
nature of retainers or inducements to them to stay in the village, 
ready to take up work as it came to them, the wage of each engage- 
ment forming the subject of separate negotiation between the 



318 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


parties. There was also a staff of menial servants from the 
outcastes who were likewise rewarded by shares in the common 
land. Day labour was usually paid for in grain, and even the small 
peasant was ready to hire himself out in his spare time. Tenancy 
cultivation was quite common, especially on lands belonging to 
temples and other corporate institutions, the terms of the tenancy 
being fixed either by the terms of the original endowment or by 
separate negotiation in each case. Very often such tenants had 
rights which made them more or less part-owners of the land they 
cultivated. The distinction between garden land, including flower- 
gardens and orchards, in the neighbourhood of capital cities, land 
under wet cultivation and that under dry cultivation, and forest 
land was carefully maintained for taxation and other purposes, wet 
lands being further divided into several grades according to their 
natural fertility. Besides cultivating food grains and pulses on 
both wet and dry land, intensive flower and vegetable growing and 
the raising of commercial crops like cotton and sugar-cane were 
also widely practised. Black land and red land are particularly 
mentioned in Chalukya records besides the usual wet land, garden 
land and waste land. Betel and arecanuts, ginger and turmeric, 
fresh fruits and flowers, were the chief items of garden produce. 
Abdur Razzak noticed the number of rose merchants in Vijaya- 
nagar and added that roses seemed as necessary as food to the 
people of that city. The importance of irrigation was well under- 
stood from early times; dams were erected across streams and 
channels taken off from them wherever possible. Large tanks 
were made to serve areas where there were no natural streams, 
and the proper maintenance of these tanks was regularly provided 
for. The extension of agriculture was encouraged at all times by 
granting special facilities and tax concessions for specified periods 
to people who reclaimed land and brought it under cultivation for 
the first time. The prosperity of the cultivator depended to some 
extent on the seasons, but to a larger measure on the conditions 
of his tenure and on the tax-collecting agency. Tenant conditions 
were probably easier on lands set apart for religious and charitable 
uses and of which temples, ma{has and Brahmins were the land- 
lords. But where rights were assigned to high officials and nobles, 
or where, as often happened, the collection of the land tax was 
farmed, both the rate of tax and the manner of collecting it might 
have pressed hard on the cultivator. Even in the heyday of liberal 



SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 


319 


and efficient administration — under the imperial Cholas — there 
were complaints of the tax-gatherer’s oppressive methods; and after 
the weakening of Vijayanagar, under the Nayaks, the ryots were 
generally compelled to purchase the state’s share of the grain at 
prices arbitrarily fixed by the tax-gatherer. Closely allied to agri- 
culture was cattle-raising and dairy farming, and land was set apart 
for pasture; this industry must have been widespread at all times, 
but in the inscriptions we hear more of the cattle belonging to 
temples and eating-houses, of the cowherds in charge of them, and 
of the obligations they owed to the temple or other owner. Ghee 
was not only an important item of food among the upper classes, 
but was used in considerable quantities for burning in lamps in the 
larger temples. 

In most of the common industries the rule was production for 
the local market; but the movements of individual merchants from 
one part of the country to another, and the highly developed 
organization of mercantile corporations in different parts of it, 
provide adequate evidence of a brisk internal trade in certain sorts 
of goods. Spinning and weaving formed a major industry which 
occupied considerable numbers, and guilds of weavers were gener- 
ally in a flourishing condition and took an active part in many 
local concerns. The export of the finer varieties of cloth from 
various parts of the country is proved by records during the entire 
period covered by this survey. Warangal specialized in the manu- 
facture of carpets which were much sought after, and other places 
had other specialities. The metal industries and the jeweller’s 
art had reached a high state of perfection. Household utensils of 
metal were apparently confined to the rich, earthenware being in 
more common use to judge from the frequency with which they 
are mentioned in connexion with cooking and eating in salas 
(or charitable feeding-halls). Iron was used for making arms, and 
some places like Palnad attained celebrity for the excellence of 
their output. The manufacture and sale of salt was generally the 
concern of government which derived a considerable revenue from 
it. This industry was naturally concentrated at important centres 
on the sea-coast, as was pearl-fishing in the Gulf of Mannar — an 
important industry which attracted the notice of foreign visitors 
(including Marco Polo) who have often described it. 

Almost all the arts and crafts were organized in castes and guilds 
of their own, and work was clearly done on a corporate basis, for 


320 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


we hear little about individual artists, not even the names of the 
architects, sculptors and painters who added so much beauty to 
life in the country. One of the very few and notable exceptions to 
this rule is £ri Gundan Anivaritachari, the builder of the Lokesvara 
temple (now called Virupaksha) at Pattadakal, who procured many 
privileges for his class from the contemporary Chalukya ruler of 
Badami besides winning for himself the title Tenkanadiseyasutra- 
dhari, ‘ the architect of the South \ It was he who designed the 
sculptures of scenes from the Ramayana which adorn the walls of 
this temple. Sri Gundan is said to have been an expert in planning 
cities, constructing palaces, vehicles, thrones and bedsteads. 
Several Hoysala sculptors ‘ signed ’ their creations, the most famous 
names among them being Malitamma, Baicoja, Caudaya, Nanjaya, 
and Bama. 

It is not possible to give a detailed account of the conditions 
of internal transport. There was as little scope then (as now) for 
the use of natural waterways for the carriage of merchandise in 
the interior, and there is no evidence that canals were made for 
any purpose other than irrigating agricultural lands. Roads are 
mentioned in inscriptions from all parts of the country, and to 
maintain them, great and small, in good repair was part of the 
duty of local authorities, the villagers being generally expected to 
give their labour free. The breadth of a main road was about 
twenty-four feet; but there were also tracks, only slightly better 
than foot-paths, which were apparently impassable for wheeled 
traffic. There was regular coastal shipping. Up-country, merchan- 
dise was carried in carts, on the heads or shoulders of men 
( kavadis ), and on the backs of animals. The roads were not always 
safe and brigandage increased in unsettled times. Soon after the 
battle of Rakshasi-Tangadi, Caesar Frederick was detained in Vijaya- 
nagar for seven months * until the ways were clear of thieves, which 
at that time ranged up and down \ 

Merchants were generally organized in powerful guilds and 
corporations which often transcended political divisions and were 
therefore not much affected by the wars and revolutions going on 
about them. The most celebrated guilds from fairly early times 
were the Manigramam and the Nanadesis or Ainnurruvar. The 
records of the Kakatlyas speak of merchants of the home country 
( svadesabehdrulu ), merchants of another country (parade sabehdrulu) y 
and merchants from different countries (nanadesis). The first were 



SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 


321 


the local merchants organized in local guilds — nagarams. The 
second were like the first except that they came from another 
country — perhaps combining pleasure with business while on a 
visit to their neighbours, or possibly acquiring religious merit by 
attending ydtras and festivals in famous shrines. The last were 
the powerful guilds already mentioned which included merchants 
from all countries, with established branches in all of them, and 
perhaps playing a prominent part in the foreign trade of the country 
as a whole. The name Manigramam is generally explained as a 
corruption of Vanik-gramam, 4 an association of merchants and 
this may well be correct. They are mentioned in many early South 
Indian inscriptions and in a Tamil inscription at Takua-pa (Siam) 
of the reign of Nandivarman III, Pallava. The fact that this 
merchant guild had established itself on the opposite coast of the 
Bay of Bengal with sufficient permanence for it to be put in charge 
of a Vishnu temple and a tank gives a clue to a yet little-known 
chapter in the annals of our ancient politics and commerce. 

The Ainnurruvar, often styled the Five Hundred Svamis of 
Ayyavolepura (Aihole), were the most celebrated of the medieval 
South Indian merchant guilds. Like the great kings of the age, 
they had a prasasti of their own which recounted their traditions 
and achievements. They were the protectors of the VJra-Bananju- 
dharma , i.e., the law of the noble merchants, Bananju being 
obviously derived from Sanskrit Vanija , merchant. This dharma 
was embodied in 500 vfra-sdsanas , edicts of heroes. They had the 
picture of a bull on their flag and were noted 4 throughout the 
world ’ for their daring and enterprise. They claimed descent 
from the lines of Vasudeva, Khandah and Mulabhadra, and were 
followers of the creeds of Vishnu, Mahesvara and Jina. Among 
the countries they visited were Chera, Chola, Pandya, Maleya, 
Magadha, Kausala, Saurashtra, Dhanushtra, Kurumba, Kambhoja, 
Gaulla, Lata, Barvvara, Parasa (Persia), and Nepala. They traversed 
land-routes and water-routes penetrating all the countries of the 
six continents. They traded in elephants, bloodstock, sapphires, 
moonstones, pearls, rubies, diamonds, lapis lazuli, onyx, topaz, 
carbuncles, emeralds and other precious articles; cardamoms, 
cloves, bdellium, sandal, camphor, musk, saffron, malegaja and 
other spices and perfumes. They either sold them wholesale or 
hawked them about on their shoulders; they paid the sunka 
regularly and filled the royal treasury with gold and jewels, and

replenished the kings’ armoury; they bestowed gifts on pandits 
and sages ‘ versed in the four samayas and six darsanas \ There 
were among them the sixteen settis of the eight nods , who used 
asses and buffaloes as carriers, and many classes of merchants and 
soldiers, viz. gaveras , gat rig as, settis, settiguttas, ankakdras , biras, 
biravanijas , gandigas , gdvundas and gdvundasvamis. A fragmentary 
Tamil inscription from Sumatra (1088) and a temple of Vishnu 
which they erected at Pagan and which was still flourishing in the 
thirteenth century attest the truth of their claim to trade with 
foreign countries beyond the seas. In the Chola country they had 
their own settlements called vira-patfanas where, with the sanction 
of the local powers and the central government, they enjoyed 
special privileges in matters of trade. Historians have generally 
tended to ignore the effect of trade on the outlook of the people 
of those comparatively remote times. There is no doubt, for 
instance, that the continuous meeting and intermingling of people 
of diverse social backgrounds tended to create a liberal and cosmo- 
politan, as opposed to an insular, attitude to life. 

The maritime trade of South India in the early centuries of the 
Christian era has been briefly described in Chapter VII. In the 
Chinese annals of the fifth, sixth and seventh centuries, all the 
products of Ceylon and India are classed, with those of Arabia 
and Africa, as products of Persia. The direct sea-route between 
India and China, however, is known to have come into common 
use by the fifth century; Fa Hien travelled from Ceylon in a 
merchantman which carried no fewer than two hundred Indian 
and Ceylonese merchants; and I-tsing mentions the names of 
thirty-seven of his contemporaries who took this route to India 
at different times. There were Brahmin temples and merchants 
in Canton in a.d. 750. 

By the ninth century a.d. the countries of southern Asia had 
developed an extensive maritime commerce which brought great 
prosperity. The T’ang empire in China, £ri Vijaya under the 
powerful line of the Sailendras, and the Abbasid Khalifat at 
Baghdad were the chief states outside India that flourished on this 
trade. Owing to political troubles China became unsafe for 
foreigners in the latter part of the ninth century, but Chinese ships 
regularly called at the ports of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra 
to buy foreign goods. This was the beginning of Chinese naviga- 
tion of the high seas. From the twelfth to the fifteenth century.

Chinese sea-going junks were frequent visitors to the west coast 
of India. Siraf, on the eastern coast of the Persian Gulf, was the 
chief emporium in the west and the rich merchants of that city 
feasted the numerous merchants from China, Java, Malaya, and 
India who visited their city — every Indian insisting on having a 
separate plate exclusively reserved for him! 

At the end of the tenth century, the political situation in China 
became normal again, and the Sung government of the day showed 
great interest in foreign trade. It became a government monopoly 
and strenuous efforts were made to increase it. Eager to take 
advantage of the new conditions, the Cholas sent 4 embassies ’ to 
China. One such trade delegation left towards the end of 
Rajaraja’s reign and reached China in 1015 after spending over 
three years on the way. Another, sent by Rajendra I, reached 
the celestial court in 1033, and a third went in 1077. The chief 
articles of merchandise in this long-distance trade were necessarily 
goods that carried great value for small bulk. For instance, the 
chief imports of Siraf were aloes wood, amber, camphor, precious 
stones, bamboo, ivory, ebony, paper, sandalwood, Indian perfumes, 
drugs and condiments. The import of horses to India from 
Arabia was important at all times, and grew to great proportions 
after the rise of the BahmanI and Vijayanagar kingdoms in the 
fourteenth century. The Portuguese, as we have seen, sought to 
acquire a monopoly in this trade when they gained command of 
the routes in the Indian waters. Imports into China were of two 
distinct categories of goods: manufactured textile fabrics mostly of 
cotton, spices and drugs; and, by far the more valuable intrinsically, 
jewels and semi-precious substances like ivory, rhinoceros horn, 
ebony, amber, coral, various aromatic products and perfumes. 
This trade was at first welcomed in China; but in the twelfth 
century, the drain of currency and precious metals resulting from 
this expansion of the trade in luxuries caused serious concern to 
the Chinese government. They therefore prohibited the export of 
precious metals and coined money, and put restrictions on the 
trade with 4 Ma’bar ’ and 4 Kulam ’—that is the Coromandel coast 
and Quilon. All the same, the trade continued with more or less 
regularity to the end of the thirteenth century. The testimony of 
the Jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela (1170) on conditions of 
trade in Quilon under Chola rule is worth citing: 4 This nation is 
very trustworthy in matters of trade, and whenever foreign

merchants enter their port, three secretaries of the king immediately 
repair on board their vessels, write down their names and report 
them to him. The king thereupon grants them security for 
their property, which they may even leave in the open fields 
without any guard. One of the king's officers sits in the market,, 
and receives goods that may have been found anywhere, and which 
he returns to those applicants who can minutely describe them. 
This custom is observed in the whole empire of this king.’ 

The Kakatiya monarch Ganapati gave an impetus to the foreign 
trade of the Andhra country in the middle of the thirteenth century 
by his charter of security (abhayasasana). Under this charter the 
cargo of shipwrecked merchants would no longer be seized, as had 
been the custom till then; moreover, the duty on all exports and 
imports would not exceed 1/30 of their value. This edict was 
renewed a century later by Annapota Reddi (1378), and corres- 
ponded to the general practice that prevailed in all the enlightened 
and progressive ports of South India, though Colombo still retained 
the older practice in the fourteenth century. In the last quarter of 
the thirteenth century, the restless ambition and insatiable curiosity 
of Kublai Khan, added to the unsettled political conditions of the 
Pandya kingdom, resulted in a very active exchange of embassies, 
more political than commercial, between the Chinese court and 
the South Indian powers. Again in the fifteenth century, under 
the third Ming emperor (1403-25), large fleets of Chinese junks, 
led by the famous general Cheng Ho, made no fewer than seven 
voyages across the Indian ocean and visited many South Indian 
ports, particularly those on the west coast. 

Our information on conditions of industry, trade and travel 
becomes more copious and precise after the foundation of Vijaya- 
nagar and BahmanI kingdoms, thanks to the many interested 
foreigners who visited these famous kingdoms and left records of 
what they saw. And the establishment of the Portuguese power 
followed by the advent of the trading companies of other European 
nations, whose factors gained intimate knowledge of the industries 
of the country, also resulted in the collection and recording of 
much valuable information on the economic conditions of South 
India in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Much of this 
material still awaits critical study, and here we must rest content 
with a brief reference to some outstanding observations. Abdur 
Razzak (1443) described the kingdom of Vijayanagar as a place 



SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 


325 


extremely large and thickly peopled, and its king as ‘ possessing 
greatness and sovereignty to the highest degree, whose dominion 
extends from the frontier of Serendib (Ceylon) to the extremities 
of the country of Kalbergah \ The country was for the most part 
well cultivated and very fertile. It contained about 300 ports 
and its army included 1,000 elephants and eleven lakhs of troops. 

Calicut, where Razzak landed on his arrival, was a secure 
harbour for ships from Africa and Arabia; considerable numbers 
of Muslims were permanent residents there and had built 
two mosques. Security and justice were firmly established. 
41 Officers of the custom house look after the merchandise, and levy 
duty of 1/40 on sales, no charge being made on unsold articles.’ 
There was a flourishing pepper trade with Mecca, and straying 
vessels were not plundered in this port as elsewhere. More than 
seventy years later, Duarte Barbosa found that the trade of Calicut 
was very large, and on that account natives of divers lands — Arabs, 
Persians, Guzerates, Khorassanians and Daquanis — settled there. 
The Moors had a governor of their own who ruled and punished 
them without interference from the king, except that he was 
obliged to account for certain matters to the king. Shipbuilding 
particularly flourished; keeled ships of 1,000 to 1,200 bahares 
burden were built, without decks and without any nails, the whole 
hull being sewn with thread. Here they loaded goods from every 
place, and every monsoon ten or fifteen ships sailed for the Red 
Sea, Aden and Mecca, whence the goods went through inter- 
mediaries up to Venice. The principal exports were pepper, ginger, 
cinnamon, cardamom, myrobalan, tamarind, canafistula, precious 
stones of every kind, seed-pearls, musk, ambergris, rhubarb, aloes 
wood, cotton cloth and porcelain. The chief imports into Calicut, 
which were loaded at Juda, were copper, quicksilver, vermilion, 
coral, saffron, coloured velvets, rose-water, knives, coloured 
camlets, gold and silver. As early as 1510, the Portuguese had a 
fort and settlement at Cochin where they repaired their ships and 
built new ones ‘ in as great perfection as on the Lisbon strand \ 
The Italian Varthema (1505) noted that an immense quantity of 
cotton was produced near Cambay so that every year forty or fifty 
vessels were laden with cotton and silk to be carried to different 
countries. Camelians and diamonds also came to Cambay from 
mountains at six and nine days’ journey from there. At Cannanore 
—another fine, large city— the king of Portugal had a strong castle; 



326 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


and there horses from Persia disembarked. On every one, customs 
duty of 25 ducats had to be paid before they could proceed on the 
fifteen-day journey to Vijayanagar. Another shipbuilding centre, 
owing to the excellent timber in the neighbourhood, was Dharma- 
patnam, 12 miles from Cannanore. Barbosa (1515) noted that 
wheat, rice, millet and gingelly, besides fine muslins and calicos 
produced in the BahmanI kingdom, were exported from ChauL 
A few miles inland from Chaul was a big market where 4 they bring 
their goods laden on great droves of trained oxen with pack-saddles, 
like those of Castille; a driver drives 20 or 30 oxen before him \ 
Of Malabar, Barbosa makes the very true remark: ‘albeit the 
country is but small, yet it is so fulfilled of people, that it may well 
be called one town from Mount Dely to Coulam ’ (Quilon). 
Caesar Frederick (1567) found much silk imported into Cochin 
from China, and sugar from Bengal. According to Ralph Fitch 
(1583-91) 6 all merchandise carried to Goa in a ship wherein were 
horses paid no custom in; the horses paid custom, and the goods 
paid nothing \ If there were no horses, the goods paid 8 per cent. 

4 The Moores cannot pass except they have a passport from the 
Portugals.’ In Chaul there was great traffic in all sorts of spices 
and drugs, silk and cloth of silk, sandals, elephants’ teeth and much 
4 China work \ Fitch calls the palm tree 4 the profitablest tree in 
the world ’ and notices the existence in Cambay of hospitals to 
keep lame dogs and cats, and for birds. 4 They will give meat to 
the ants.’ 

The accounts of one English and two Dutch factors, who spent 
some years in Masulipatam and its neighbourhood, give an un- 
usually vivid picture of the state of industry and trade on the east 
coast, particularly in the Golconda region. The country was 
mainly agricultural; in lowlands the staple crops were rice, millets 
and pulses, while, on a smaller scale, the dye crops, indigo and 
chay-root, were produced for the weaving industry. Tobacco, 
then recently introduced, was grown largely for export. Cotton 
was not grown extensively, but was brought from the interior. 
The chief minerals were iron and steel of high quality, manufac- 
tured some distance inland, and exported from Masulipatam. 
Diamond-mining on an important scale had developed at Kollur. 
Among industries cotton-weaving stood by itself. It was practised 
all over the area, both for local consumption and for export in 
large quantities. The weavers worked in their own houses, but as 



SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 


327 


they depended on advances of capital from buyers they had to 
produce the quality and quantity of goods prescribed by their 
customers. There were two main classes of cotton goods — plain 
goods like calico and muslin, brown, bleached or dyed; and 
patterned goods of the type now called ‘ prints ’ made of either 
calico or muslin, with coloured patterns produced by the indigenous 
processes. This work was carried out mainly on the coasts and 
carefully adapted to the needs of markets in Java and the Far 
East, each with its own peculiar tastes and requirements. The 
export trade for plain goods was localized on the Golconda Coast, 
while Pulicat specialized in the patterned variety. 

The main exports of Golconda were thus cotton goods, iron 
and steel. Indigo was transported to the west coast and thence 
to Persia ; cotton yam went to Burma, and other minor items con- 
tributed to what was for the time large export trade. The volume 
of imports was smaller; spices, dye-woods, metals other than iron, 
camphor, porcelain, silk and other goods, mainly luxuries, were 
brought for sale on the coast, and the excess of exports was paid 
for in gold and silver. There was also a large coasting trade, 
northward to Bengal and southward to Ceylon. 

Caesar Frederick noted the existence of regular trade from San 
Thome to Pegu. 

There was at all times a great multiplicity of currencies, weights 
and measures — each locality having its own system. At important 
trade centres money-changers assisted trade by settling fair 
exchange-rates. In liquid and grain measures, and particularly in 
the measurement of land, mention is often made in the inscriptions 
of the major dynasties of a 6 royal measure this doubtless implies 
some effort at standardization. The Rashtrakuta inscriptions, for 
instance, mention the dramma besides the suvarna and the gadydna . 
The first recalls the Indo-Bactrian drachma , a silver coin of 65 
grains. In Tamil inscriptions of even the eleventh and twelfth 
centuries occurs the name tiramam as that of a coin, perhaps of 
silver, which was a fifth or sixth of the standard gold coin — the 
kasu of the Cholas. But golden drammas are mentioned in the 
Rashtrakuta records and their value cannot be determined. In 
general two systems of weights are traceable in the ancient coins 
of South India. The gold gadydna of the Deccan averages 58 
grains, the heaviest reaching 60.1 grains; this was the old gadydna 
kaccdnam ) or kalanju (Tamil). But in the Chola period the more 



328 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


usual standard was a heavier kalahju of twenty mahjadis equal in 
theory to 72 grains but sometimes going up to 80. A coin of this 
standard was called pon or madai , and the kasu was exactly half 
of this. But the records contain the names of many varieties of 
madai and kasu , and it does not appear that standardization ever 
attained any tangible measure of success. And in many small 
day-to-day transactions coins seldom played a part, as barter was 
the rule, or grain served as currency. Coinage was never the 
monopoly of a single central power, though this condition was 
very nearly realized for some time under Vijayanagar. Abdur 
Razzak mentions the royal mint, and adds : 4 In this country they 
have three kinds of money, made of gold, mixed with alloy: one 
called varaha weighs about one mithkal , equivalent to two dinars, 
kopeki; the second, which is called per tab , is half of the first; the 
third, called fanom , is equivalent in value to the tenth part of the 
last mentioned coin. Of these different coins, the fanom is the 
most useful. They cast in pure silver a coin which is the sixth of 
the fanom , which they call tar. This latter is also a very useful 
coin in currency. A copper coin worth the third of a tar , is called 
djitel. According to the practice, adopted in this empire, all the 
provinces, at a fixed period, bring their gold to the mint.’ About 
sixty years later, Varthema records other relations among the 
smaller currency units, saying that sixteen tares went to the fanom, 
and sixteen cas to the tare, though he counts twenty fanoms to the 
pagoda ( pardao , varaha) all right. Duarte Barbosa pays a high 
compliment to the integrity of the currency system and says: 

‘ Coins of this place are perfectly genuine, not one of them has 
been ever found false, nor is now so found.’ But the multiplicity 
of currencies persisted and caused inconvenience, and Caesar 
Frederick grumbles that a new governor’s country meant new 
coins, 4 so that the money we took this day would not serve 
the next \

Sanskrit was the language of higher culture throughout South 
India, and a considerable volume of literature in its various 
branches arose from the activity of poets and scholars through the 
centuries. We shall trace the history of this activity in outline 
before proceeding to a study of the literatures in the languages 
of the people, viz. Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam, to 
name them in the probable order in which they developed their 
literary idioms. All these literatures owed a great deal to Sanskrit, 
the magic wand whose touch alone raised each of the Dravidian 
languages from the level of a patois to that of a literary idiom, and 
the influence they exercised on one another was also not incon- 
siderable; but their interaction cannot be adequately considered in 
the brief sketch that follows. 

The beginnings of Marathi literature fall indeed within the period 
dealt with in this book, but they will not be traced here, because 


LITERATURE 


331 


Marathi is more properly regarded as a North Indian vernacular. 
The bulk of the Marathi literature falling in our period was 
primarily devotional in nature and is represented by such authors 
as Jnanesvara (1290), Namdev (1425), Eknath (1608) and Tukaram 
(1608-49), names greater in the field of religion than in that of 
literature. 

Sanskrit 

The Vedic religion of sacrifice had spread all over the country 
by the beginning of the Christian era, if not earlier, and Vedic 
literature and exegesis therefore naturally claim our first attention 
in the domain of Sanskrit. Apastamba, the author of a complete 
set of srauta , grihya and dharma sutras that has luckily been pre- 
served in its entirety, must have flourished somewhere about 300 
B.c. in the Godavari valley. His language seems to be of an age 
preceding that of Panini, and the followers of his school abound 
in the land south of the Narmada. The school of Satyashadha 
Hiranyakesins, whose Dharmasutra shows clear traces of Apas- 
tamba’s influence, came into prominence in the Sahya region 
(Malabar and S. Kanara?) between the first century b.c. and the 
first century a.d, A third school which can also be definitely 
assigned to South India is that of the Vaikhanasas whose Grihya 
sutra shows many influences of the idiom of the Dravidian 
languages. The manuals of these two schools also are complete. 

The foundation of the Chola and Vijayanagar empires was 
marked by notable efforts to elucidate the Vedas. In the reign 
of Chola Parantaka I, Venkata Madhava, who lived in a village 
on the banks of the Kaveri, wrote the Rigarthadlpika. Under the 
patronage of the early Vijayanagar sovereigns, notably Bukka I, 
a large syndicate of scholars, headed by Sayana, undertook and 
completed the stupendous task of commenting upon the Samhitas 
of all the four Vedas and many of the Brahmanas and Aranyakas. 

Coming long after the age of the texts they annotated, these 
scholars obviously did not always succeed in interpreting them 
correctly or convincingly; but the most critical of modern scholars 
cannot deny the debt they owe to the commentaries which recorded 
the traditional interpretations current in the Vedic schools of the 
tenth and fourteenth centuries in South India. Bharatasvamin’s 
commentary on the Samaveda written under Hoysala Ramanatha 
also deserves notice among the pre-Sayana Vedic commentaries. 



332 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


In the interval between Venkata Madhava and Sayana came also 
another great commentator, Shadgurusishya, ‘ the pupil of six 
teachers *, whose personal name has not been handed down to us. 
He commented on the Aitareya Brdhmana and Aranyaka and 
Katyayana’s Sarvanukramam , probably about the middle of the 
thirteenth century. 

Besides Vedic texts proper, ancillary works like the Pratisakhyas 
(manuals of phonetics) and the Kalpa sutras (rituals) were also 
annotated. Shadgurusishya himself wrote a commentary on 
Asvalayana Srauta siitra , and the Apastamba Srauta was annotated 
twice over by Talavrintanivasin and by Caundapacarya (fourteenth 
century); the latter was also the author of Prayogaratnamala , an 
independent treatise on ritual practices. The Bodhdyana Srauta 
also had two commentaries, one by Bhavasvamin (ninth or tenth 
century), and the other by the famous Sayana who was himself a 
follower of the Sutra. Haradatta is another well-known annotator 
of the same school whose commentaries Anavild on the Asvalayana 
Grihya sutra , Anakuld on Apastamba Grihya sutra , and Ujjvald on 
the Dharma sutra are rightly celebrated. He also wrote the 
Mitakshard on Gautama-dharmasutra , and a commentary on 
Bodhdyana Srauta siitra of which only an insignificant fragment 
has been traced so far. 

Devaraja’s Nighantu Vyakhya, written at Srirangam in the fift- 
eenth century, marks an important stage in the history of Vedic 
scholarship as it is a very learned exposition of Yaska’s celebrated 
treatise on Vedic lexicology. 

Among the Puranas, the Bhdgavata was composed somewhere in 
South India about the beginning of the tenth century. It summed 
up the tenets and outlook of the neo -bhakti cult which had been 
developing from the fourth or fifth century in the course of the 
conflict between Hinduism and the non-Vedic creeds of Jainism 
and Buddhism. The Bhdgavata combines a simple surging emo- 
tional bhakti to Krishna with the Advaita philosophy of Sankara 
in a manner that has been considered possible only in the Tamil 
country in that period. The Vishnu Purana , perhaps the shortest 
and the best work of its class, was commented on by Vishnu Chitta 
in the twelfth century from the standpoint of Visishtadvaita. We 
must also notice the more famous commentaries on the Ramayana 
and Mahdbhdrata for the place they hold in literary criticism as 
well as in religious thought. Atreya Varadaraja, otherwise known 


LITERATURE 


333 


as Udali, composed his Vivekatilaka on the Rdmayana in the twelfth 
century ; he came later than Ramanuja and is cited in the Idu , the 
great thirteenth-century commentary on TiruvaymoU . The much 
better-known Bhushana , also the work of a Vaishnava author, was 
produced by Govindaraja, a native of Kanchipuram and contem- 
porary of Krishnadeva Raya and Rama Raya of Vijayanagar. He 
is said to have got his inspiration to write the work during one of 
his visits to the famous shrine at Tirupati. Madhava Yogi was 
the author of Kataka , an important commentary on the Rdmayana ; 
the author put forward many interesting points of textual criticism 
and held Rama to be an avatar of Brahma as the Lord of Gayatri. 
Again, the Vdlmiki-hridaya of Ahobala was based on the comments 
on select verses from the Rdmayana scattered throughout the Idu . 
Isvara Dlkshita of the Kaundinya gotra wrote two commentaries on 
the epic, a laghu and a brihad vivarana in 1517; the work was done 
at Hemakuta in Vijayanagar under the patronage of Krishnadeva 
Raya. All together about a score of commentaries on the Rama - 
yana were produced in South India. On the Mahabhdrata , the 
Lakshabharana of Vadiraja, written some time during the sixteenth 
century, is the best known of the extant commentaries from South 
India; the author has sought in his own way to determine the 
authentic text of the 100,000 verses of the great epic. About the 
same time or a little earlier came the Vydkhydratndvali of Ananda- 
purna Vidyasagara who wrote from Gokarna on the west coast 
and was a contemporary of the Kadamba Kamadeva, father-in-law 
of Harihara II of Vijayanagar. A third commentary by Sarvajna 
Narayana, only fragments of which survive, is perhaps the oldest 
work of its class so far known from the South. 

In belles-lettres, the first work that claims attention is Sattasau 
an anthology in Maharashtri Prakrit passing under the name of 
the Satavahana ruler Hala and comprising about seven hundred 
verses. Each verse is a vignette characterized by an unusual degree 
of realism, and the collection as a whole depicts ‘simple loves set 
among simple scenes, . , . the work of poets who wished really to 
express the feelings as well as describe the externals of the people 
of the land, the cowherds and cowherdesses, the girl who tends the 
garden or grinds com at the mill, the hunter, the handworker \ 
On linguistic grounds the work is assigned by critics to the period 
a.d. 200-450; but it may possibly be a revised version of an earlier 
work. Another notable work of the age of the Satavahanas was 



334 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


the Brihatkatha of Gunadhya, reputed to have been composed in 
the Paisaci dialect but no longer available except through a number 
of later Sanskrit recensions; many legends are told about the com- 
! position and fate of the book, and its widespread influence on later 

j literature in many languages is universally admitted. The tales of 

!i the Brihatkatha had for their hero Naravahanadatta, a son of 

;i Udayana, and borrowed motifs from the Rdmdyana and from 

i Buddhist sources. The work seems to have survived till about 

•1 the eighth or ninth century and is highly praised by such famous 

'! authors as Bana and Dandin. 

ii Sundara Pandya’s Nitidvishashtika must be older than the sixth 
century; the author’s identity remains a mystery, but the work has 

1 1 great merit and its verses deserve a high place in the literature of 

I \ niti (policy). Kumaradasa’s long poem in twenty cantos, Janaki - 

I harana, handles the familiar story of Rama; the author was clearly 

j an admirer of Kalidasa and his work contains many echoes of that 

j great poet. Tradition, late and not very reliable, identifies 

Kumaradasa with a king of Ceylon who ruled in the sixth century, 
ji This poem has had a curious history; till recently it was only known 

J 1 from a Sinhalese paraphrase and a retranslation of it into Sanskrit 

in a poem of fifteen cantos by a certain Rajasundara (c. 1600), but 
the original was recovered recently in Malabar. Much better 
known and of greater literary merit is Bharavi’s Kirdtarjuniyam 
, which describes, in eighteen cantos, the conflict between Siva and 

Aijuna ending in the latter’s attainment of the valuable weapon 
Pasupata astra. The poem is remarkable for its vigour and its 
imagery. In an inscription dated 634 the poet is mentioned as 
having attained great fame already. Tradition connects him with 
Vishnuvardhana, the founder of the line of Eastern Chalukyas, 
and with Simhavishnu of Kanchl; it also affirms that the Ganga 
king Durvinlta annotated the fifteenth canto of the poem: but all 
this is very doubtful. 

In passing it may be observed that the inscription just mentioned 
comes from Aihole and records the achievements of Pulakesin II 
in a short poem of no mean literary quality; its author, Ravikirti, 
affirms that, by his composition, he deemed himself the peer of 
Bharavi and Kalidasa! A somewhat earlier inscription from Maha- 
kuta is composed in ornate prose which could stand comparison 
with Bana. In fact a complete history of Sanskrit literature must 
devote attention to inscriptions as much as to books. This is, in 


LITERATURE 


335 


fact, equally true for all languages; but it is a subject that cannot 
be pursued here. Vijayabhattarika, the wife of king Chandraditya 
who was a son of Pulakesin II, has been plausibly identified with 
the poetess Vijayanka or Vijjika, who describes herself as a dark 
Sarasvati (the Goddess of Learning, usually depicted as white), 
and whom the great critic Rajasekhara placed next only to Kalidasa 
for style. The few verses of this poetess which have been preserved 
in the anthologies go far to justify this high estimate. 

The ‘ curious-minded ’ Pallava ruler of Kanchl, Mahendra- 
varman I, found time to compose two delectable farces (prahasanas), 
Mattavilasa and Bhagavadajjuka, which succeed in turning the 
laugh against the Kapalikas and Buddhist Bhikshus, and afford a 
pleasing contrast to the growing intensity of sectarian feeling in 
his day. The authorship of Bhagavadajjuka is, however, doubt- 
ful, and the work has been attributed to Bodhayana. The relatively 
dry subject of prosody was expounded in Chandoviciti-Janasraya , 
perhaps by Madhavavarman II of the Vishnukundin line (whose 
title was Janasraya). If tradition preserved in the Avantisundarl - 
kathd is true, the illustrious Dandin was the great-grandson of 
Damodara, a friend of Bharavi, and adorned the Pallava court of 
Narasimhavarman I (630-68). The kathd just mentioned is itself 
a long prose work which has only been preserved in part; the kernel 
of the extant Dasakumdracarita is most likely a part of this work, 
its beginning and end being by other hands. The superb manual 
of rhetoric Kdvyddarsa , by which Dandin is best known, marks an 
epoch in the history of literary criticism as it made the Vaidarbhi 
Style the touchstone of good poetry. It also formed the basis of 
Dandiyalangdram in Tamil. 

Though most of Bhavabhuti’s work was done in Northern India, 
still, as he was born in Berar and is said to have had his education 
under Kumarila, it may not be wrong to include the great 
dramatist’s name in this survey. Two of his dramas — the Mahd- 
viracarita and Uttara-rama-carita — are based on parts of the Rama 
saga, while the third — Malatfmddhava — is a work of the poet’s 
imagination. He flourished at the end of the seventh century and 
the beginning of the eighth. 

Kulasekhara, one of the later alvars , and a ruler of Kerala, 
probably in the ninth century, produced a splendid devotional 
lyric in the Muktmda-mdla which has retained a wide popularity 
to this day. Kulasekhara is believed to have been the patron of

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Vasudeva, author of the four Yamaka Kavyas, Yudhishthira Vijaya , 
Tripur adahana, Saurikatha and Nalodaya. Though Yamaka (sound 
jingle) often leads to queer expressions and forced constructions, 
Vasudeva must be deemed to have succeeded in a remarkable 
measure in escaping the defects of the method. The Yudhishthira 
Vijaya was commented on by Rajanaka Ratnakara of Kashmir. 
Vasudeva also wrote the Vasudeva Vijaya, a Kavya in five cantos 
on the model of the Bhattikdvya, illustrating the rules of Sanskrit 
grammar laid down by Panini. The Ascarya-cuddmani of Sakti- 
bhadra claims to be the first full-blown drama ( ndtaka ) to be 
produced in the southern country; its theme is the perennial Rama 
story, and some of the author’s innovations are real improvements. 
The poetry and prose are alike of high quality, and the work has 
always been very popular among the actors of Malabar. Another 
play by the same author, Unmadavdsavadatta , is no longer extant. 
He is reputed to have been a pupil of Sankara and may be assigned 
to the early ninth century. 

Trivikrama Bhatta, contemporary with Rashtrakuta Indra III 
(915), was the author of Nalacampu or Damayanti-kathd, the 
earliest extant Campu in Sanskrit. The story is that the work 
was composed with the aid of Sarasvati to meet the challenge of 
a rival at a time when his father, a court-poet, was absent. It is 
said to have been left unfinished because the father returned and 
rendered the son’s effort otiose. Both verse and prose are no 
more than mediocre. The Madalasdcampu is also attributed to 
Trivikrama. The earliest extant Campu from Kerala is the 
Amoghardghava by Divakara (a.d. 1299)— on the Balakanda story 
of the Ramayana : this type became much more common later both 
in Sanskrit and Malayalam. 

A second Kulasekhara from Kerala (935-55) wrote two dramas 
—Tapatisamvarana and Subhadradhananjaya— which dramatized 
minor incidents from the Mahabhdrata in a very stage-worthy 
form. Kulasekhara was also the author of a prose work Ascarya- 
manjari cited in a Bengali commentary (a.d. 1159) on the Amara- 
kosa. In his time according to tradition there was a reform in 
the mode of staging Sanskrit dramas by the Chakkiyars; they are 
professional actors, who appear to have been a survival in Kerala 
of the older institution of sutas who recited the Puranas to popular 
audiences. The repertoire of the Chakkiyars included the Matta- 
vildsa, Bhagavadajjuka and Kalydnasaugandhika, among others.

The last mentioned work is a play by Nllakantha, a Vyayoga 
depicting a tussle between Hanuman and Bhima ending in a com- 
promise on their recognizing their common parentage. Bilva- 
mangala-svami, also called Krishna-lila-suka, or Lila-suka for 
short, was another protege of the king; his Krishna-karnamrita is 
a devotional poem of unsurpassed beauty in three dsvasas . He 
composed other works of an erudite nature; but by this poem he 
lives in the hearts of Sanskritists. 

The great Jaina writer Somadevasuri (950) flourished in the court 
of Arikesari II of Vemulavada (Andhra Pradesh), a subordi- 
nate of Rashtrakuta Krishna III, where the illustrious Kannada 
poet Pampa also lived. Somadeva was the author of Yasastilaka 
campu , Nitivakyamrita, and other works. The tale of the Campu 
is by no means dull, but the main objective of the author is the 
propagation of Jaina tenets and ethics. The Nitivakyamrita 
reviews the subject-matter of Arthasastra from the standpoint of 
Jaina morals. The author’s style is at once learned, pithy and 
clear. Another contemporary of Krishna III was Halayudha, 
author of Kavirahasya , a pedantic work which seeks to illustrate 
the formation of the present tense of Sanskrit roots and at the 
same time to eulogize the Rashtrakuta king. Vadiraja, a pupil of 
Somadevasuri— a Jain, like his guru — wrote Yasodharacaritra in 
which he mentions the Pdrsvanathacaritra as an earlier work of 
his; but it is not extant. 

The prose romance Udayasundari Kathd of Soddhala, a Kayastha 
of Lata, was written about a.d. 1000 under the patronage of 
Mummuniraja of Thana; the author took Bana’s Harshacarita as 
his model, but falls far short of it. From Kerala we get in 
this period the quasi-historical Mushakavamsa of Atula, a chronicle 
of the Mushaka or Ramaghata kings in fifteen cantos, and the 
exquisite unfinished poem Krishnavildsa by Sukumara whose date 
and nativity are, however, not beyond dispute. The Vikramdnka - 
devacarita of Bilhana, the Kashmirian Vidyapati of Vikramaditya 
VI, is a Mahakavya in eighteen cantos, which recounts in epic 
style the life and deeds of the Chalukyan emperor. The author 
gives his own life-history in the last canto and says that he com- 
posed the poem out of gratitude for the great honour shown to 
him late in his life by the ruler of Kamata. Not all its statements 
on the relations of Vikramaditya with his elder brother Somesvara 
can be accepted as true, but the verse is easy and flowing though

the descriptions are disproportionately long. Bilhana wrote other 
works from which citations have survived in anthologies; but there 
is no proof that the Pahcdsika , a moving though somewhat out- 
spoken portrayal of the pleasures of illicit love, can properly be 
attributed to him. Purporting to be the work of Chalukya Somes- 
vara III, but most likely a composition of one or more of 
his court-poets, is the Mdnasolldsa or Abhilashitdrtha cintamani 
(1129-30), intended for the benefit of all classes in the state. It 
consists of five books of twenty chapters each. Its range is 
cyclopaedic, and obviously it lays under contribution many older 
technical treatises on medicine, magic, veterinary science, the 
valuing of precious stones and pearls, fortifications, painting and 
music, games and amusements and on the many other subjects it 
treats of. No great merit is evident in the choice of topics or 
their sequence, though the work is valuable as a record of the state 
of knowledge on many topics at that time. An astrologer and 
poet who flourished under Somesvara III was Vidyamadhava whose 
Pdrvati-Rukminiya is a tour de force , each verse yielding two mean- 
ings, one narrating the marriage of Siva and Parvatl and the other 
that of Krishna and Rukmini. Another and better effort in the 
same deplorable line was the Rdghava-Pandavlya of Kaviraja 
Madhava Bhatta setting forth the story of the Rdmdyana and the 
Mahabhdrata. The poet lived in the court of Kadamba Kamadeva 
(1182-97) and also wrote the Parijdtaharana , a poem in ten cantos 
on a well-known episode from the Krishna cycle of legends. 

A family of hereditary poets held the position of vidyacakravarti 
(poet-laureate) in the Hoysala court but their names have not been 
preserved. One of them, who seems to have obtained recognition 
also from the Pandyas and other rulers of the South, wrote the 
quasi-historical Gadyakarndmrita , an eloquent prose work dealing 
with the war between Hoysala Narasimha II and the Pandyas in 
the first quarter of the thirteenth century. Another composed a 
poem of high quality, the Rukminikalydna , and wrote commentaries 
on the Alankdrasarvasva and the Kdvyaprakdsa— two celebrated 
works on poetics; this was in the reign of Ballala III (1291-1342). 

To the thirteenth century also belonged Saradatanaya, bom of 
a scholarly family in 'the Chingleput district, and author of the 
well-known Bhdvaprakasa , an important work on literary criticism, 
which cites many writers and works otherwise unknown; he also 
wrote the Saradiya , a treatise on music. Another celebrity of the

same age and neighbourhood was the great Vaishnava teacher 
Venkatanatha or Vedanta Desika ( b . 1268) who, though better 
known for his works on religion and philosophy, achieved distinc- 
tion in the domain of general literature as well. His Mahakavya 
on Krishna’s life, called Yadavdbhyudaya , was commented on by 
the great Appaya Dikshita; the Hamsa-sandesa, an imitation of 
Kalidasa’s Meghasandesa, the devotional poem Padukasahasra , 
and the drama Samkalpasuryodaya (a Visishtadvaitic counterblast 
to the Advaitic drama Prabodhacandrodaya of Krishna-misra), 
deserve particular mention among his other general works. 

Kerala was prolific in Sandesa-Kavyas which have been found 
there in scores. The Sukasandesa of Lakshmidasa (a.d. 1100) is 
the earliest and perhaps the best. The Kokilasandesa of Uddanda 
Kavi (fifteenth century), and the Mayurasandesa of Udaya, the 
commentator of Locana (same century), and the Bhringa Sandesa 
of Vasudeva (sixteenth century) also deserve mention. Apart from 
their lyrical merit, these poems have a historical and topographical 
interest as they refer to contemporary personalities and events and 
contain detailed descriptions of the routes of the respective 
messengers. King Ravivarman Kulasekhara of Travancore found 
time for literary pursuits in the midst of his stormy career; he 
wrote the Pradyumnabhy udaya , a drama in five acts on the marriage 
of Pradyumna and Prabhavatl, and was the patron of Samudra- 
bandha, the author of a learned commentary on the Alankdra- 
sarvasva of Ruyyaka of Kashmir. 

Similar in spirit and manner are two works on dramaturgy, 
both composed about 1300 and both including a play calculated 
to glorify the author’s patron and illustrate the rules of the drama: 
these are the Ekavali of Vidyadhara, written under Narasimha II 
of Orissa, and Prataparudra-Yasobhushana of Vidyanatha whose 
patron was Prataparudra II, the Kakatlya ruler of Warangal. The 
last-named ruler was himself the author of a niti work, extracts 
from which appear in the anthology Siiktiratndkara of Surya and 
on which the Telugu Baddana-niti is based. Vidyanatha is often 
identified with Agastya, the reputed author of seventy-four Kavyas 
in all among which are Balabharata , a poetic summary of the great 
epic in twenty cantos commented on by Saluva Timma, the minister 
of Krishnadeva Raya; the Krishna-carita , a prose summary of the 
Bhagqyata; and Nalakirtikaumudl which narrates the familiar story 
of Nala and DamayantL Visvanatha, the author of Sahityadarpana

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


a comprehensive work covering the entire field of poetics, 
flourished (c. 1350) in the court of one Narasimha, probably the 
third king of that name to rule over Orissa. 

The achievements of Kumara Kampana, the second son of 
Bukka I of Vijayanagar, are celebrated in a beautiful poem by his 
wife GangadevI — Madhurdvijayam (‘ Conquest of Madura ’). One 
of Vidyaranya’s pupils was Vamana Bhatta Bana, patronized by 
the Reddi king Pedda Komati Verna of Kondavldu (1398-1415), 
whom he celebrated in a prose Romance of considerable length, 
the Vemabhupala-carita . The author’s aim was to rival Bana as a 
prose writer, and he achieved a notable measure of success in his 
endeavour. His other works were Naldbhyudaya , Raghundtha - 
carita-kavya, and two plays, Pdrvatl-parinaya and Kanakalekha 
Kalyana. The Reddi ruler Pedda Komati himself passes as the 
author of commentaries on Amarusataka , a centum of erotic verses, 
and Saptasatl-sdra — a selection of 100 verses from Hala’s Prakrit 
anthology; two independent works on poetics and music, Sahitya- 
cintamani and Sanglta-cintdmani are also attributed to him. Like 
him, his predecessor Kumaragiri was also author and patron; he 
wrote a work on natya (dance) called Vasantarajiya , after one of 
his titles. His brother-in-law (and minister) Katayavema wrote 
well-known commentaries on the plays of Kalidasa. 

Passing over several minor works of poetry, drama and criticism 
of the early Vijayanagar period, we may notice the Rasarnavasu - 
dhakara , a masterly treatise on rasa and the rules of dramaturgy. 
This work is said to be by Simhabhupala of Rajakonda ( c . 1350), 
but possibly owes much to his court-poet Visvesvara, who wrote 
Camatkaracandrika — also a good manual of rhetoric. The family 
of Dindimas in the village of Mullandram in North Arcot district 
produced many authors of distinction. Rajanatha’s Salvabhyu- 
daya y a quasi-historical poem on the wars of his patron Saluva 
Narasimha (latter half of the fifteenth century), the Bhdgavata - 
campu and Acyutardydbhyudaya of a later Rajanatha, who lived 
in the sixteenth century in the reign of Achyuta Raya, deserve 
particular mention. This last poem is a useful guide to the events 
of Achyuta Raya’s reign. Krishnadeva Raya was scholar and 
poet as well as soldier and statesman, and wrote with great power 
in both Sanskrit and Telugu ; his drama Jambavatikalydna is marked 
by a fairly high order of poetic and dramatic skill. Tirumalamba’s 
Varadambikaparinaya is another historical Campu of the period to

commemorate the marriage of king Achyuta Raya with Vara- 
dambika. 

The next great name is that of Appaya Dikshita (1520-92), 
author of over a hundred works in many branches of Sanskrit 
learning, who was patronized by the Nayak chieftains of Vellore, 
particularly by Chinna Bomma. His commentary on the Yadava - 
bhyudaya has been mentioned already. Other contributions which 
he made to poetry and poetics include Citramlmdmsa and Laksha - 
navali on literary criticism and the appreciation of poetry; the 
Kuvalayananda which, though in form an amplification of Jaya- 
deva’s Candralokci , almost attains the level of an independent 
treatise on figures of speech; Vrittivdrttika , a treatise on the signi- 
ficance of words in their poetic use; Varadarajastava , and many 
other devotional poems. The family of Appaya Dikshita produced 
a considerable number of talented authors, all of whom cannot be 
mentioned here. Nilakantha Dikshita, Appaya’s great-nephew, 
was a greater poet than his uncle and wrote several works which 
attained a degree of literary force and charm which had been 
unknown for several centuries; the Nilakantha-Vijaya-campii (1637), 
Gangavatarana , Nalacaritanatakci and the Sivalildrnava , all exhibit 
the superior talent of the author, who is reputed to have been 
# minister to Tirumalai Nayaka of Madura. 

At the Nayak court of Tanjore, at about the same period, 
flourished Govinda Dikshita, held in high esteem by Sevvappa 
Nayaka, the founder of the line, and his descendants. His Sahitya 
Sudha treats of the history of the two later rulers Achyutappa and 
Raghunatha; he also composed the Sangltasudhanidhi. Two of 
Govinda’s sons also gained distinction as writers; one, Yajnanara- 
yana, wrote two works on the life of Raghunatha Nayaka — a 
poem Sahityaratnakara , and a drama in five acts, Raghunatha 
Vildsa ; the other, Venkatamakhi, was a versatile writer on all 
Sastras, but his Kavya Sahityasdmrajya is not available. Raghu- 
natha Nayaka himself composed several works like Pdrijdtdharana , 
Valmfkicarita, Gajendra-mo ksha , Nalacarita , and Acyutendrabhyu- 
daya , the last being obviously a biography of his father. He also 
wrote on music. The Raghunathdbhyudaya of Ramabhadramba 
also has the life of the Nayaka for its theme and gives clear proof 
of the intense devotion that the ruler evoked in the talented poetess. 

Yet another family of DIkshitas rose to literary fame under 
the Nayaks of Gingee. Ratnakheta Srinivasa Dikshita of 



342 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Satyamangalam is reputed to have written eighteen plays and sixty 
poetical works — most of which have been lost, however; his alle- 
gorical drama Bhavandpurushottama was composed at the instance 
of Surappa Nayaka, and the Bhaishmiparinaya-campu is a small 
work on the marriage of RukminI and Krishna. Srinivasa had 
three sons, the best known being Rajachudamani DIkshita who 
migrated to Tanjore and became the pupil of Venkatamakhi. 
While still in his teens he is said to have written Kamalini Kala- 
hamsa ; another drama, Ananda-rdghava , a poem RukminI Kalydna 
and a biography of Sankaracarya called Sankarabhyudaya were 
among his other works. He also wrote on Mimamsa and other 
subjects which will be mentioned further on. 

Turning next to philosophical literature, Vatsyayana ( c . 350-400)* 
the author of the commentary on the Nyaya-sutras of Gautama* 
is ascribed by tradition to South India. But the first writer on 
Nyaya definitely known to belong to South India is Varadaraja* 
the author of Tdrkikarakshd and of a commentary ( Bodhini ) on 
Kusumahjali of Udayana; he lived most probably in the middle of 
the twelfth century. Apararka’s commentary on the Nyayasdra 
of Bhasarvajna can be assigned to about the same date. The 
author was the Silahara ruler of Konkan, better known for his 
commentary on Yajnavalkya-smriti. Two commentaries were * 
written on Tarkabhasha, one by the famous Mallinatha (thirteenth' 
century) and the other by Chennubhatta (fourteenth century). 
The most popular manual of logic, Tarkasangraha ( c . 1625), and 
the gloss Dipikd on it were the work of Annambhatta, a native of 
the Chittoor district who also wrote commentaries on other classics 
on this subject. 

The popularity of Purva-Mimamsa studies in the South is indi- 
cated by a number of inscriptions recording endowments — parti- 
cularly in favour of the school of Prabhakara, who was the pupil 
as well as the rival of the great Kumarila, the founder of these 
studies in this part of the country. Kumarila is generally regarded 
as an Andhra by birth and an elder contemporary of Sankaracarya 
(eighth century); his main works are Slokavarttika, Tantravarttika , 
and Tuptika which together form a complete commentary on the 
classic Bhdshya of 6abarasvamin on the Mimamsa sutras of 
Jaimini. Prabhakara (a native of North Travancore according to 
tradition) also wrote two commentaries on Sabara’s Bhdshya , a 
short Laghvi or Vivarana, no longer extant, and a more extensive 


LITERATURE 


343 


Brihati or Nibandhana which has survived in part and gives unmis- 
takable evidence of the author’s originality and dialectical skill. 
Mandana Misra, another eider contemporary of Sankara, discussed 
two fundamental topics of Mimamsa in his Vidhiviveka and 
Bhavanaviveka. The Bhdshyadipa of Kshlrasagaramisra (eleventh 
century) is another commentary on Sahara written from the stand- 
point of Prabhakara: the same writer also composed a tract called 
Arthavadadivicara . Varadaraja expounded in the Nayaviveka- 
dipika the tenets of the same school in the twelfth century. 
The volume of Mimamsa literature that developed in South India 
is very great and cannot be reviewed here in its entirety. Only 
the names of the most important authors and their works can be 
noted. They are: Somesvara’s Nydyasudhd (c. 1200), an elaborate 
commentary on Kumarila’s Tantravarttika ; another commentary 
on the same work — the Nydyapdrdyana (mid-thirteenth century) of 
Gangadhara-misra; the Mimdmsdpddukd and Sesvaramimdmsd of 
Vedanta Desika, who sought to synthesize the views of the two 
rival schools; the Nyayamdld and its vistara by Sayana’s brother 
Madhava (fourteenth century), an abstract in verse and an explana- 
tion in prose on the subject-matter of each section of Sahara’s 
Bhdshya ; a number of tracts on Mimamsa by Appaya Dikshita 
such as Vidhirasdyana , Upakramaparakrama and Vddanakshatra - 
mala besides his Mayukhdvali a commentary on the Sastradipikd , 
a classic exposition of the Kumarila school by Parthasarathi Misra. 

In the domain of Vedanta, all the three major schools had their 
origin in the South. The first and greatest name here is that of 
Sankara, the founder of Advaita Vedanta as we know it. Few 
authentic details of his life are known, though he is believed to 
have been bom at Kaladi (North Travancore) in 788 and to have 
died in 820 at the age of 32. His principal works are the great 
Bhashyas on the Brahma-sutras , the principal Upanishads, and 
the Bhagavadgita , besides certain independent treatises like the 
Upadesa-sahasri. Many other works, particularly Stotras (devo- 
tional poems), pass as his but there is no reason to think that 
Sankara wrote them. The literary force and philosophic depth of 
Sankara’s works entitle him to a very high place among the master 
minds of the world. His pupil Suresvara, who may perhaps be 
identified with Visvarupa, wrote the commentary Bdlakridd on Ydjna- 
valkyasmriti. He also succinctly restated his master’s fundamental 
principles in his Naishkarmyasiddhi y and wrote monumental varttikas 



344 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


(elucidations) on Sankara’s Bhashyas on the Taittiriya and the 
Brihaddranyaka Upanishads. Sankara had other pupils who be- 
came authors; but their provenance is unknown. Mention may 
be made, however, of Padmapada’s Pahcapadika, a commentary 
on Sankara’s Bhashya on the Brahma-sutras ; the work is now only 
available for the first four Sutras. Padmapada was a Brahmin from 
Kerala. Mandana Misra, whom we have already mentioned as a 
contemporary of Sankara, held different views on Advaita which 
he expressed in Brahmasiddhi. Sarvajnatman was the next great 
Advaita author; he flourished in Travancore at the end of the tenth 
century. His authoritative Samkshepa-sdriraka , with its fine 
literary flavour, is his chief work, but he also wrote Pahcaprakriyd 
and Pramdna-Lakshana. This last work, on epistemology, is 
accepted by Mlmamsakas as well as Vedantins. Jnanaghana’s 
Tattavasuddhi is another treatise of about the same time; its author 
finds mention in the 3ringeri list of pontiffs. Jnanottama, who 
commented on Suresvara’s Naishkarmyasiddhi , is the author of 
two independent works — Nydyasudha and Jhdnasiddhi — and his 
more celebrated pupil, Chitsukha of Simhachalam (c. 1200), de- 
serves notice next. Chitsukha’s Bhashya-bhava-prakasikd is a 
highly esteemed commentary on Sankara’s Bhashya on the Brahma- 
sutras ; among his other works the best known is an independent 
treatise on Advaita, Tattvapradipikd . He had pupils like Sukha- 
prakasa who also became writers of repute. Amalananda, a pupil 
of Sukhaprakasa, lived near Nasik on the banks of the Godavari 
in the reigns of the Yadava kings Krishna and Mahadeva (1246-71); 
his Veddnta-kalpataru is an extensive commentary on Vachaspati 
Misra’s Bhamatl , itself a commentary on Sankara’s Brahmasutra- 
bhdshya ; and the Sastradarpana is a more concise statement of the 
doctrines of the Bhamatl school. £ankarananda ( c . 1250) wrote 
the Atmapurana which brings together the gist of the Upanishads 
in a standard work in anustup verse; he also wrote commentaries 
on the principal Upanishads and on the Brahmasutra-bhashya of 
Sankara. The Sarvamatasangraha of Raghavananda Muni of 
Kerala is an epitome of several systems of Hindu philosophy, and 
a forerunner of the better known Sarva-darsana-sangraha of 
Madhava Acarya. Raghavananda’s commentaries on Paramdrtha- 
sdra , on Mukundamala , and on the Bhagavata Parana called Krishna - 
padi exhibit his high learning in several branches of literature. This 
task of commenting on ancient classics and refining and restating 


LITERATURE 


345 


doctrines went on steadily from generation to generation, and we 
oan only note the most prominent works in this later derivative 
literature. Such were: the Vivarana-prameya-sangraha, and Jivan - 
muktiviveka of Vidyaranya and the Pahcadasl ascribed to his teacher 
Bharatitirtha, but held by some to be in fact the work of the pupil; 
the Sarvadarsana-sangraha of Sayana-Madhava which establishes 
the superiority of Advaita by reviewing many of the rival systems 
of philosophy; Anandapuma’s (c. 1410) commentaries on the 
Khandana-khanda-khadya , Brahmasiddhi , and Vivarana as well as 
his Nydyacandrikd ; Appaya Dlkshita’s sub-commentary Vedanta - 
kalpataru-parimala and his Siddhantalesa sangraha , a compendium 
of the various schools of advaitic thought, and Madhvatantra - 
mukhamardana , a polemic against the dualism of Madhva; and 
lastly, the Vedantaparibhasha of Dharmarajadhvarin, the best 
known among the manuals of Advaita. 

The literature of ViSishtadvaita (qualified monism) philosophy 
may be said to start with the Yogarahasya and the Nyayatattva 
by Nathamuni, or Ranganatha-muni (824-924), the first of the 
great acaryas of Vaishnavism who followed the alvdrs . Then 
came the somewhat more systematic exposition of Yamunacarya 
( b . 917), the grandson of Nathamuni, in his works Siddhitraya , 
Gitarthasangraha and Agamapramanya. He also wrote other 
works like Stotraratna , a devotional poem. The true founder of 
the system in its entirety was of course Sri Ramanuja (i b . 1018) 
whose Sribhdshya on the Brahma-sutras is its great classic. He 
also annotated the Bhagavadgitd from his point of view, and wrote 
the Veddrthasangraha to demonstrate that the Upanishads support 
his system rather than that of Sankara. His Vedantasara and 
Vedanta Dlpa are simple commentaries on the Brahma-sutras . 
Parasara Bhatta, who succeeded Ramanuja in the pontificate at 
Srirangam in 1137, wrote the Tattvaratnakara , no longer in exist- 
ence, and a commentary on Vishnusahasrandma . The Nltimdld of 
Narayanarya, composed some time before 1200, and the Prameya- 
mdld and Tattvasara of Nadadur Ammal ( b . 1155) are important 
restatements of the system, while the latter’s Prapannaparijdta 
develops the doctrine of prapatti (surrender) with great elaboration. 
Sudarsana Bhatta, a pupil of Nadadur Ammal, wrote the celebrat- 
ed commentary known as Srutaprakasika on Ramanuja’s Sri - 
bhdshya. Tradition avers that he was born in a.d. 1175 and that 
he fled from Srirangam, burying his commentary in the sands of

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


the Kaveri, when the place was sacked by the Muslim invader; 
both these statements, however, cannot be true. The commentary 
is a voluminous and erudite work and has been itself much com- 
mented on since. Sudarsana also wrote Srutapradipika , and 
commentaries on Ramanuja’s Vedarthasangraha and the Bhagavata , 
the last work bearing the name Sukapakshiya. Another pupil of 
Nadadur Ammal was the famous Pillai Lokacarya, author of 
Vacanabhushana, Acarya Hridaya , and Tattvaviveka , besides many 
works in Tamil, and founder of the Tengalai (southern branch) 
sampraddya . A third pupil of Nadadur Ammal was Atreya Rama- 
nuja ( b . 1220), author of Nydyakulisa which seeks to establish 
doctrines of general Vedanta, and emphasizes the differences be- 
tween Advaita and Visishtadvaita only in some of its chapters. 
His other works have not survived. A nephew (sister’s son) and 
pupil of Atreya Ramanuja was the famous Vedanta DeSika (1268- 
1369) who wrote commentaries on Ramanuja’s Sribhashya ( Tattva - 
tikd) and Gitd-bhashya ( Tatparyacandrikd ) besides independent 
treatises on Visishtadvaita like Nyayasiddhahjana , Sarvarthasiddhi 
and Tatty amuktakaldpa. His Satadushanl is a polemic against 
Advaita. In spite of his decided preference for Tamil, the famous 
Tengalai saint Manavalamahamuni {b. 1370) wrote some philoso- 
phical works in Sanskrit such as Tattvatraya 9 Rahasyatraya y 
Srivacanabhushana 9 Jridnasdra and Prameyasara. Vaishnavism 
waxed strong under the patronage of Vijayanagar rulers, but 
though many authors wrote, there was little real advance in 
philosophic thought. 

Visishtadvaita was the philosophy also of &aivism. The earliest 
Saiva writer in Sanskrit is perhaps Haradattacarya (d, 1116) whose 
Sruti-sukti-mald (also called Caturvedatatparya-sangraha) delineates 
the salient features of Saiva thought, while his Harihara-taratamya 
is a sectarian polemic. He was followed by Srikantha whose 
Brahma-mimdmsd-bhdshya expounds the Sutras of Badarayana from 
the 6aiva viewpoint. Srikantha may well be identical with the 
acarya who, according to Aghorasivacarya, came down from 
Gauda to worship Nataraja at Chidambaram and whom Vikrama 
Chola adopted as his guru. There are notable verbal coincidences 
between Srikantha’s Bhashya and the Srlbhashya of Ramanuja. 
3rikantha’s system is called &ivadvaita to distinguish it from the 
3aiva-siddhanta system developed in the Tamil books. Attempts 
have been made to treat both the systems as one, but they cannot

be regarded as successful, Aghorasivacarya’s (c. 1158) commen- 
taries on Tattvaprakdsikd of Bhojadeva and on the highly philoso- 
phic Mrigendragama are important in the history of Saiva philo- 
sophy. Umapatisivacarya’s ( c . 1290-1320) Bhashya on the Paush - 
kara Samhita is a powerful plea that Siva is the one deity 
for everyone to worship. Nanasivacarya of the mcitha at Surya- 
narkoyil in the Tanjore district, and preceptor of Sevvappa Nayaka 
of Tanjore, commented on the Sivajhanabodha , not the Tamil work 
of Meykandar, but a section of the Raurava Agama , from the 
more usual Saiva-siddhanta standpoint; the commentary is notable 
for its many valuable citations from works no longer extant. His 
other works were Saiva Paribhashd , a manual in five sections on 
the categories of Saivism, and the Sivdgrapaddhati and Kriyadxpikd 
on the rituals of worship and renunciation. Srikantha’s work was 
carried further by Nilakantha (c. 1400) whose Kriyasdra is a 
metrical compendium of Srikantha’s Bhashya which attempts to 
discover common ground between his system and that of the 
Vlra-saivas; and by Appaya Dikshita’s striking contributions to 
&aiva philosophy, particularly in his monumental commentary on 
Srikantha called the Sivarkamanidipikd. 

The philosophy of Dvaita (dualism) was elaborated by Madhva, 
also called Ananda Tirtha (1198-1275), in his Bhashya on the 
Brahma-sutras and in the Anuvydkhya , a further commentary sup- 
porting the conclusions of the Bhashya; he also commented on 
the Upanishads and the Bhagavadgita , and wrote an epitome of 
the Mahdbhdrata entitled Bharatatdtparyanirnaya , besides a com- 
mentary on some hymns of the Rigveda called Rigveda-vydkhyd. 
He wrote also a number of polemical works rebutting the doctrines 
of rival schools. He relied for support more on the Puranas than 
on Vedic texts or logical proofs. Jayatlrtha (d. 1388), a pupil of 
Madhva’s pupil Akshobhyatlrtha and contemporary of Vidyaranya, 
was the greatest elucidator of the works of Madhvacarya, and 
earned for himself the title Tikdcarya. He also wrote two polemics, 
the Nyaya-sudha on the Brahmasutra-bhdshya of Madhva, and 
Vadavali. The next great name in the history of Dvaita is that of 
Vyasaraya (1447-1539) who was highly honoured by the great 
Krishnadeva Raya of Vijayanagar. His Bhedojjivana and Tatparya - 
candrikd are summary restatements of the doctrines of his school; 
Nyayamrita was directed against Advaita, and Tarka-tdndava 
against the conclusions of the logicians ( Naiyayikas ). Vadiraja, a

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


pupil of Vyasaraya, wrote the Yuktimallikd , a critique of the 
doctrines of Sankara. Vijaylndra (1576), another pupil of Vyasa- 
raya, was held in great esteem by Sewappa Nayaka of Tanjore. 
He wrote commentaries on the works of Vyasaraya besides the 
Upasamhdravijaya , and Madhva-tantra-mukha-bhushana , refutations 
of Appaya Dikshita’s works of the opposite names, and Paratattva - 
prakasa , an answer to the same writer’s Siva-tattva-viveka. He 
spent his last days at Kumbakonam writing other works. 

In legal literature (Dharmasastra), the earliest work that calls 
for notice after the Sutras mentioned above is the Balakrida , 
Visvarupa’s commentary on Yajhavalkya-smriti . The author, who 
was also called Suresvara, was a pupil of Sankara. Another writer 
of fairly early date was Bharuci who commented on the Vishnu 
Dharmasutras and Manusmriti ; the first work is lost and the second 
was only recently recovered in a fragmentary form. Perhaps the 
greatest name in this sphere is that of Vijhanesvara who adorned 
the court of Chalukya Vikramaditya VI; his Mitakshara , a com- 
mentary on Yajnavalkya, is an important treatise on law based on 
many earlier writings and it has found acceptance in the whole of 
South India and large parts of the North. The work was com- 
mented on more than once by subsequent writers; Colebrooke, 
who translated into English the section on inheritance, gave it 
currency in British Indian courts. Another work ascribed to 
Vijhanesvara is the Asauca-dasaka or Dasasloki , ten terse verses 
treating of pollution consequent on death. A pupil of this great 
author, Narayana by name, compiled an independent digest on 
civil law called Vyavaharasiromani which has survived only in 
part. The £ilahara ruler of Konkan, Apararka or Aparaditya I, 
already mentioned as a writer on Nyaya, wrote an extensive com- 
mentary on Yajnavalkya early in the twelfth century; even more 
than the Mitakshara , it is more an independent digest than a 
commentary hugging its text. Varadaraja’s Vyavaharanirnaya , for 
which various dates are assigned like a.d. 1297 and a.d. 1500, is 
valuable for its interpretation of juristic rules in the light of 
Mlmamsa principles, and deserves particular notice among the 
legal digests of South India, as also the more extensive Smriti - 
candrika of Devana Bhatta often cited by Hemadri. To the latter 
half of the thirteenth century may be assigned the famous Hara- 
datta whose commentaries on the Dharmasutras of Apastamba 
and Gautama are models of their kind; he is cited by Visvesvara 


LITERATURE 


349 


(1375), author of the Subodhinl on the Mitakshard. Hemadri, 
minister of the Yadava king Mahadeva (1260-71) and his successor, 
was the author of a cyclopaedic digest called Caturvargacintamani 
comprising five large sections on Vrata, Dana, Tirtha, Moksha 
and Parisesha. Two more sections on Prayascitta (expiation) and 
Vyavahara (civil law) are supposed to have been compiled by 
him though they are not now extant. The published portion 
covers over 6,000 pages and forms perhaps the most extensive 
digest on the subjects it treats of. Part of the glory that was 
Vijayanagar was the work of Madhava, the brother of Sayana, 
whose commentary on Parasarasmriti , the Parasara MadhavJya , is a 
most erudite work which includes an independent treatise on 
Vyavahara which was neglected in the text of Parasara. And 
Sayana himself wrote a number of lesser manuals called Sudhdnidhis 
treating of Prayascitta (expiation), Yajnatantra (Vedic ritual), 
Purushartha (the aims of human endeavour) and so on. The two 
brothers wrote in the first half of the fourteenth century. Dalapati’s 
extensive work in twelve sections, Nrisimhaprasdda , deals with all 
phases of religious and civil law; Dalapati (1490-1533) was a highly 
placed Hindu officer in the Nizam Shahi court of Ahmadnagar. 
Prataparudra Gajapati of Orissa composed the Sarasvaii-vilasa 
with the avowed intention of reconciling the apparent discrepancies 
between the views of Vijnanesvara, Apararka, Bharuci and other 
authors who preceded him. Only the Vyavahara section of this 
work has been found. The royal authorship of the work has, 
however, been doubted as it is counted among the writings of the 
polyhistor Loila Lakshmldhara. The Smritiratnakara of Harita 
Venkatacarya (Tolappar) (1450-1500), a native of the Chingleput 
district which was so prolific of Vaishnava scholars, is accepted to 
this day as an authoritative exposition of religious law by the 
Vaishnavas of the South. Vaidyanatha Dlkshita’s Smritimuktd- 
phala , written probably early in the seventeenth century, holds a 
similar position among the Smartas. In the sixteenth and seven- 
teenth centuries under the Nayak rulers of South India many other 
works were written in the field of Dharmasastra as in other 
branches of literature. 

In lexicography, the VaijayantI of Yadavaprakasa, the teacher of 
Ramanuja, has commanded great authority in the eyes of later 
authors; it is a work in two sections — one on synonyms and 
the other on homonyms. Dhananjaya, a Digambara Jaina writer

(1150) of Karnataka, compiled the Ndmamald , a lexicon of 
synonyms in about two hundred verses. Jataveda Dikshita (1250), 
also from Karnataka, annotated the Amarakosa in his Brihadvritti . 
Lastly, Vamana Bhatta Bana, whose writings in prose and drama 
have been noted already, produced two lexicons of merit — Sabda- 
ratnakara and Sabdacandrika. 

In grammar, Sarvavarman, a reputed contemporary of Gunadhya 
in the Satavahana court, wrote the Kdtantra sutras , a simplified 
system of grammar, for the benefit of his patron and thus began 
the Katantra school which flourished subsequently more in Bengal 
than anywhere else. Another system that arose in the South was 
that of Sakatayana, of the reign of the Rashtrakuta Amogavarsha I 
(a.d. 817-77); he wrote the Sabdanusdsana in four chapters as also 
a commentary on it called Amoghavritti after his patron, besides 
the ancillary treatises needed to complete his new system. The 
earliest South Indian writer on the system of Panini was Haradatta 
(ninth century) whose commentary Padamahjari on the Kasikd of 
Vamana and Jayaditya is a work of outstanding merit and 
authority. In the thirteenth century a certain Krishnalilasuka 
wrote a commentary called Purushakara on the Daiva of Deva, 
a terse metrical treatise in 200 verses on roots of similar form. 
The commentary described itself as a varttika and deservedly 
enjoys a high place among grammatical works. The Mddhaviya- 
dhdtuvritti of Madhava, the great commentator on the Vedas, is a 
commentary on the Dhdtupdfha (list of roots) of Panini which, by 
the way, suggests the derivation of quite a large number of words 
whose origin is not given in any other work. The Siddhdnta 
Kaumudl of Bhattoji Dikshita, a younger contemporary of Appaya 
Dikshita, is today the most popular manual of Sanskrit grammar. 

In some ways Kerala occupied from the beginning a special 
position as regards Sanskrit learning and institutions for its promo- 
tion, and this became more apparent from the (fifteenth century) 
when the Zamorins of Calicut began to stand out as the most 
powerful rulers of Kerala. An early ruler of the line instituted an 
annual convocation of scholars and poets for public debates, the 
most meritorious among them being awarded the title of Bhatta 
and money-presents; the whole occasion was known as Bhatta- 
danam. This went on for about a century and a half and attracted 
to Calicut scholars from distant countries. Manavikrama, the 
Zamorin who ruled in the middle of the fifteenth century, was a 


LITERATURE 


351 


distinguished scholar himself and a patron of letters; emulating 
the legendary Vikramaditya of Ujjain who had ‘ nine gems ’ (poets) 
adorning his court, Manavikrama gathered eighteen literary gems 
about himself, and an inspired Malayalam poet Punam, recognized 
as a half-poet; the names of only a few of these eighteen-and-a-half 
(Padienettarakkaviga]) have survived. In this constellation, the 
Bhattatiris of Payyur who specialized in Mimamsa literature stood 
out prominently; they were great writers in the field of belles- 
lettres also. There were three Paramesvaras among them; the 
earliest of them wrote two commentaries on the Nyaya-kanikd 
(Mimamsa) of Vachaspati Misra. He wrote also the Haricharita, 
an artificial composition of 263 stanzas each beginning with one 
of the chandra-vakyas of Vararuchi in order. His grandson Para- 
mesvara II was known as Mimamsa-chakravarti. He composed 
scholarly commentaries on Mandana Misra’s Sphota-siddhi (on the 
sphota doctrine) and Vibhrama-viveka (on the five Khyati-vadas) ; 
on Vachaspati Misra’s Tattvabindu (on the source of verbal cogni- 
tion); and on Chidananda’s Niti-tattva-virbhava (Mimamsa). In the 
commentary on the Sphota-siddhi he claims to come of a family 
whose members were the sole authority on the interpretation of 
the works of Mandana. He had a brother Vasudeva II, a poet 
who, after the manner of his earlier namesake of the ninth 
century a.d. wrote three Yamaka (alliterative) Kavyas, viz. Devi - 
charita, Satyatapahkatha and Achyutalila. The third Paramesvara 
was grandson of the second, and author of Mimamsd-sutrartha - 
sangraha, a commentary on Jaimini’s sutras on the lines of 
£abarasvamin, besides other works. 

Uddanda (a.d. 1430) from Latapura on the Palar river in 
Chingleput district held a prominent place in the court of Mana- 
vikrama. He wrote the drama Mallikamdruta modelled on Bhava- 
bhuti’s Malatlmadhava. It is not possible to mention all the poets 
and works of this prolific period; but mention must be made of 
Chennas Nambutiri’s Tantrasamuccaya , an authoritative treatise on 
temple architecture, iconography, rituals and related matters. 

Very soon after the literary group of Manavikrama flourished 
Melpattur Narayana Bhattatiri (1560-1666), a star of the first 
magnitude in the literary firmament. He was a polymath who 
adorned everything he touched. His celebrated Ndrayaniya sings 
the glory of the divinity of Guruvayur in 1000 stanzas and forms 
the best devotional poem in Sanskrit, regarded in Kerala as of 



352 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


equal sanctity with the Bhdgavala Purana. His Prakriyd Sarvasva 
is a work on grammar which enjoys as much popularity in Kerala 
as the Siddhdnta Kaumudl does outside that area. He maintained 
that great poets were not bound by the strict rules of grammar 
and that grammar should follow their usage, and upheld the 
position in his polemical work Apaniniya-prarndnya-sadhana ; in 
this respect he followed his teacher Achyuta Pisharoti who departed 
from Panini and simplified grammar in his Pravesaka , a primer of 
the subject. Among other works, Narayana wrote the Mana 
section of Mdnameyodaya a primer of Bhattamimamsa, which was 
completed when the Meya section was written by another Nara- 
yana, a protege of Manaveda of Calicut. Narayana Bhattatiri 
composed several Campus for recitation by Chakkiyar. His 
Niranu-nasika-prabandha is a literary tour de force, containing no 
nasal letters as it describes the complaint of Surpanakha to Ravana 
after her nose had been cut of. Bhattatiri lived to be well over 
a hundred years and his fame elicited the admiration of Yajna- 
narayana, the chief minister of Raghunatha Nayaka of Tanjore 
(1650). 

There were families in Kerala which specialized for generations 
in particular subjects, like the Thaikkattu illam in architecture. 
Vastuvidya , Manushyalaya chandrika and Silparatna are well known 
contributions on the subject from Kerala. In Ayurveda (medicine) 
the eight great families, hereditary custodians of the science and 
practice of medicine, are well known. To the departments of 
astronomy and astrology again Kerala made very striking contri- 
butions. The Katapayadi system of numerals was the invention 
of a Vararuchi of Kerala, author of the Chandra Vdkyas used for 
calculating the position of the moon on any day of the year. 
Bhaskara I expounded the astronomical system of Aryabhata in 
his Mahdbhdskarlya some five centuries before the better known 
Bhaskaracharya, author of Siddhantasiromani; the work is still 
widely current in Kerala. Govindasvami wrote an extensive 
Bhashya on it, and his pupil Sankaranarayana wrote in a.d. 869 
a commentary on Laghubhdskarlya, another work of Bhaskara I. 
£ankaranarayana’s patron, Ravivarma of Mahodayapuram, was a 
great astronomer and set up an observatory and is said to have 
inaugurated the Kollam era. Haridatta, another and an earlier 
authority in astronomy, wrote his Grahachdra-nibandhana about 
a.d. 700. This work has been regarded as the basic text of the 



LITERATURE 


353 


Parahita system of computation employed for many centuries in 
Kerala. Venvdroha , a small treatise on the calculation of the 

correct position of the moon, was written by Madhavan Nambutiri 
of Sangamagrama about a.d. 1400. But the most notable figure 
in astronomy was a Paramesvara who from his direct personal 
observation of the movements of the sun and the moon invented 
the system of drigganita in 1431, a correction of the Parahita system. 
He was a prolific writer on astronomy and astrology. His Bhafa - 
dipikd a commentary on the Aryabhatiya and Goladipika in two 
versions are the most notable among them. The next great 
authority in the field was Nilakantha Somayajin (1442-1545), a 
pupil of Damodara, son of Paramesvara; of his many works, the 
most notable is a Bhashya on Aryabhatiya. Then we may note 
Achyuta Pisharoti (1550-1621), the teacher of the celebrated Nara- 
yana Bhattatiri; he wrote Karanottama a manual on astronomical 
calculations, and Upardgakriydkrama on eclipses, besides other 
works including a Malayalam commentary on Venvdroha. Astro- 
logy was also studied and written on extensively, but these works 
cannot be noticed here in any detail. 

There were notable grammarians also in Kerala. The Vararu - 
chasangraha is a concise treatise in twenty-five verses ( kdrikas ) on 
the major topics of Vyakarana; the commentator on the work, 
Narayana Namburi of Agnihotri illam near Cochin, says that the 
author Yararuchi was almost the equal of Panini. Narayana has 
also written an extensive commentary on the Bhashya pradipa of 
Kaiyata. We owe to another Namburi of Kasi illam the volumin- 
ous Vrittiratnam, a metrical commentary in verses on the Kdsikd- 
vritti ; the same author wrote a Laghu vritti in 2720 verses, and the 
Bdlamitram , an elucidation of Madhava’s Dhdtuvritti. Among 
other works may be noted the Subhadraharana , a Kavya in twenty 
cantos, by another Narayana Namburi which illustrates the rules 
of Panini mostly by anushtup verses and excels in lucidity the 
similar works of Bhatti and Bhauma. 

Kerala specialized also in temple worship and rituals and con- 
tributed to the literature on the subject; Prayogamahjari of Ravi 
in twenty-one chapters, and the Paddhati of Isana Sivaguru, an 
encyclopaedic work in 18,000 verses, are among the best specimens 
in this line. 

This sketch may be concluded with a brief notice of the more 
important Sanskrit treatises on music and dance. The musical

inscription of Kudumiyamalai (Pudukkottai), which consists of 
exercises to be practised on stringed instruments, has been without 
good reason assigned to Pallava Mahendravarman I; we read at 
the end of the inscription that it was the work of a Saiva monarch 
who was the pupil of Rudracarya, evidently a famous music master 
of the seventh or eighth century. Chalukya Jagadekamalla (1138-50) 
of Kalyani wrote the Sangitacudamani , a work in five chapters. 
In the reign of the Yadava Singhana (1210-47) of Devagiri Sarnga- 
deva wrote a work of outstanding merit, Sangita-ratndkara. The 
book in its seven chapters covers the whole range of music and 
dance. Jayasenapati, a general of Kakatlya Ganapati, composed 
the Nrittaratnavali (1254), in eight chapters on Dancing. Hara- 
pala-deva, an unidentified Chalukya prince, was the author of 
Sangita-sudhakara. on dance and music, ifhe fine arts received 
great encouragement from the rulers of Vijayanagar and their 
feudatories, and the theory and practice of music and dancing 
made notable advances. The great Vidyaranya wrote the Sangita- 
sdra. Kallinatha, a writer on music, flourished under Mallikar- 
juna, and his grandson Rama Amatya who wrote the Svara-mela - 
kalanidhi was patronized by Rama Raya. The Sangita-suryodaya 
was the work of Lakshmlnarayana, the court-musician of Krishna- 
deva Raya. The Sangita-sudha, composed by Govinda Dikshita 
in the name of Raghunatha Nayaka, and the Caturdandiprakdsika 
of Venkatesvara Makhi, the son of Govinda Dikshita, are works of 
outstanding merit produced in the Nayak Court of Tanjore. 

From very early times South India held an important place in 
the evolution of Indian music. Even the early writer Bharata 
mentions a melody-mould known as Andhri-jati and details of 
other early southern modes are recorded by later writers like 
Matanga and Samgadeva. The large place of choric singing in 
the religious revival of the seventh and eighth centuries is well- 
known. The great musician and composer Gopala Nayaka was 
invited to Northern India by Ala-ud-din Khilji at the instance of 
Amir Khusru. Kallinatha cites a composition of Gopala Nayaka 
called Raga Kadamba, and Venkatamakhi states that he claimed 
to be the promulgator of Caturdandi, that is, a fourfold delineation 
of Raga forms in Gita, Prabandha, Thaya, and Alapa. The Vaish- 
nava saint Purandara Dasa was the author of numerous composi- 
tions which had a great influence in shaping the tradition of 
Kamatic music. The four generations of Tallapakkam composers

who produced many kirtanas on Lord Venkatesa of Tirupati and 
a short treatise on the nature and features of kirtana called 
Samkirtana Lakshana and the celebrated composer Kshetrajna of 
Maruvapuri (Guntur district) are famous musicians who flourished 
towards the close of our period. 

Tamil 

Some account has been given in Chapter VII of the literature 
of the Sangam Age, the oldest body of works now known in the 
Tamil language. That literature was the result of the meeting 
and fusion of two originally separate cultures, the Tamil and the 
Aryan. Its beginnings are no longer traceable, and the schematic 
anthologies that have been handed down doubtless represent a 
relatively late phase in that epochal literary movement, and to this 
phase we have suggested the period a.d. 100-300. A close study 
of the grammar and vocabulary of the different works as also of 
their ideas enables the trained reader to discern the outlines of a 
progressive development and to arrive at tentative conclusions on 
their relative chronology. The Tolkappiyam , for instance, is best 
placed towards the close of the age indicated above, and at least 
two of the anthologies, the Kalittogai and Paripadal , may well be 
taken to at least a century later. The theme of all the 130 
poems of the Kalittogai is love as manifested in the five tinais 
(types of landscape), and the treatment of the subject is much 
more sophisticated in these poems than in the Ahandnuru. This 
sophistication is found also in the Paripadal and both works 
mention new names of ornaments like vahu-valaiyam (armlets), and 
mekalai (girdles) unknown to the earlier poems. A certain Nallan- 
duvanar was the author of the verses in one section ( neydal ) of the 
Kalittogai by one account, and the compiler of the entire anthology 
according to another. The Paripadal takes its name from the metre 
employed in the poems in the collection; the original collection 
included seventy songs on different deities, and of these only 
twenty-four entire songs and a few fragments of some others have 
survived; Tirumal (Vishnu), Muruga, and the river Vaigai form 
the themes of all these poems and fragments. This is the first 
instance of a work set to music and belonging to the class of 
isait-tamil , 4 musical Tamil \ The songs show much familiarity 
with Upanishadic and Puranic lore, and are replete with advanced 
philosophic concepts belonging to different schools of thought. 



356 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


The story of Prahlada in ail its details is mentioned, as also the 
story of Indra’s misconduct with Ahalya, the wife of the sage 
Gautama; the six mothers of Muruga and the dances of Vishnu 
with the shepherdesses are other myths indicating a relatively late 
age for the collection. 

The next great epoch in the annals of Tamil literature extends 
over a period of three and a half centuries (500-850). In this age 
the inflow of northern Sanskritic influences became even more 
marked than before; numerous words and concepts in the domain 
of ethics, religion and philosophy were freely borrowed and incor- 
porated in Tamil; the Sanskrit codes and law books were accepted 
as the basis of a considerable volume of didactic literature which 
forms a striking feature of the time; sometimes whole works in 
Sanskrit or allied dialects were translated or adapted into Tamil. 
There was a preponderance of Jaina writers to start with as Jainism 
and Buddhism were then waxing strong. But the rising tide of 
Hindu reaction soon produced a great volume of popular devo- 
tional literature, which was set to music and ravished the hearts 
of the common folk. Notable developments occurred in belles- 
lettres, grammar and lexicography, but here the Jains and 
Buddhists continued to hold the palm. Almost all writing was in 
verse, and there was little prose worth mentioning. 

Most of the important didactical works composed in the period 
have been grouped together under the title ‘ The eighteen kilkka- 
nakku ’ from about the thirteenth century, because of their being 
composed in various short metres, generally types of the \enbd. 
Certainly the best known of them all, and possibly also among 
the earliest, is the Kura. I of Tiruvajjuvar, a comprehensive manual 
of ethics, polity and love. It contains 1,330 distichs divided into 
133 sections of ten distichs each— the first 38 on ethics (aram), 
the following 70 on political and economic topics ( porul ) and the 
rest on love (kdmam). The author was most probably a learned 
Jaina divine and his close acquaintance with the works of Manu,. 
Kautilya and Vatsyayana is unmistakable. We have little authentic 
information of his life, and the great merits and continued influence 
of his work have naturally led to the growth of many popular 
legends around his name. If, as is often affirmed, he and some 
other writers of this age belonged to a Sangam, it must have been 
a later institution than the one which flourished in the early 
centuries of the Christian era : 450-500 may be suggested as the best

date for the Kural. To the same period must be assigned the 
KalavaU of Poygaiyar, already noticed, and the Mudumolikkanji , a 
short work of 100 stanzas on mutability by Kudalurkilar of 
Madura. 

The age of the remaining works in the collection may be given, 
tentatively and within broad limits, as follows: between 550 and 
<350 — Kdrndrpadu , Inna-narpadu , Aindinai-aimbadu , Ndladi , Nan- 
manikkadigai, and Palamoli ; between 650 and 750 — Tirikadukam , 
Aindinai-yelubadu, Tinai-malai-aimbadu, Kainnilai , Eladi , Tinai- 
malai-nurraimbadu, Sirupahcamulam , Iniya-ndrpadu and Asarak - 
kovai. The figures ndrpadu (40), aimbadu (50), and so on, with 
which some of these names end indicate the number of stanzas 
in the work. The Kdr- ndrpadu is a love poem in which a love-lorn 
lady is supposed to describe the dreadful approach of the rainy 
season in the absence of her lover; the four other poems whose 
titles contain the word tinai , as well as Kainnilai , are also on the 
theme of love and belong to the class of aham works. Innd-ndrpadu 
and Iniya-ndrpadu are catalogues of painful and unpleasant, and 
pleasurable and joyous, things and deeds respectively. Ndladi is a 
Jaina anthology (400 verses) put together by Padumanar and 
arranged in forty chapters on the lines of the Kural; the names of 
the poets whose songs are collected are unknown, but the reference 
to Muttaraiyar in two of the stanzas gives the clue to the date of 
the collection. Nanmanikkadigai (100 stanzas) by a Vaishnava 
poet, Vilambi Naganar, contains four sententious statements in 
•each stanza; it is a work of high literary merit and ranks next only 
to the Kural. The Palamoli is a Jaina work of 400 venbas , each 
citing a proverb and mentioning some incident or story to illustrate 
it. Tirikadukam (‘ three pungents ’), Eladi (cardamom and others) 
and Sirupancamulam (‘ the five minor roots ’) take their names 
from well-known medicinal preparations; just as the medicines 
cure the illnesses of the body and restore health, the morals incul- 
cated in these works cure the diseases of mind and spirit and set 
the reader on the road to virtue and happiness. The author of 
Tirikadukam was a worshipper of Vishnu; the other two works 
were by Jains. The Asarakkovai is a veritable Tamil smriti by a 
Saiva author based avowedly on Sanskrit originals. It is among 
the latest, if not the last, works of this type in this period. 

The widespread Hindu religious revival for which many Saiva 
ndyandrs and Vaishnava alvars worked together furnished a powerful 



358 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


stimulus to the growth of a popular devotional literature. It 
was of great importance alike for its volume and for its influence 
on the life of the people. Groups of devotees headed by some 
prominent religious leader moved from place to place and shrine 
to shrine singing the hymns they composed in the course of these 
pilgrimages. The result was the use of simple diction and catchy 
times. In this golden age of Tamil Hinduism there must have 
come into existence a much larger volume of literature than has 
been preserved in the canonical editions of hymns made in the 
tenth century by Nambi Andar Nambi for the Saiva group, and 
Nathamuni for the Vaishnava. For instance, a hymn of Nana- 
sambandar, which is unknown to the canonical collection, is found 
engraved on stone in the temple at Tiruvidaiyavayil in the Tanjore 
district. 

Perhaps the earliest author in the group whose works have 
entered the Saiva canon is Karaikkal Ammai, 4 the woman of 
Karaikkal \ Tradition makes her the contemporary of Pudam, 
one of the early alvars , and both may be assigned to about 550, 
The Ammai sang the praises of the deity of Tiruvalangadu where 
she witnessed the dance of Siva. The two other poems she wrote 
which mark the beginning of Prabandha literature in Tamil — a 
genre which counted in course of time no fewer than ninety-six 
types — are Tiru-irattai-mani-malai with twenty pairs of stanzas 
each including a kalitturai verse and a venba and the Adbhutat - 
tiruvandadi of 100 venba verses. Next comes AiyadigaJ Kadavarkon 
who is reputed to have handed over the rule of his principality to 
his son and devoted himself to a religious life. His Kshetrattiru - 
venba is an andddi (a poem in which the last word or syllable of 
one verse recurs at the beginning of the next) and contains a list 
of twenty-one Saiva shrines including Ujjain (Makalam) which 
were held in esteem in his day. The 307 padigams (hymns) of 
Appar constitute books 4-6 of the Saiva canon. They contain 
many notable anticipations of the Saiva-siddhanta philosophical 
system; the intensity of devotion that characterizes them is 
excelled only in the Tiruvdsagam of Manikka-vasagar. Nanasam- 
bandar, the most celebrated Saiva hymnist, heads the canon, and 
384 hymns sung by him constitute its first three sections. It is 
said that he began singing hymns of his own composition at the 
age of three, and that he met Appar and Siruttondar in person, 
but the story of his meeting with the Vaishnava saint Tirumangai 


LITERATURE 


359 


seems to be no more than a beautiful legend. Sambandar’s hymns 
are marked by an exceptionally high literary quality, but towards 
the end of each one the Buddhists and Jains come in for round 
denunciation — evidence of the most active part he took in the 
campaign against the heretical faiths. 

The Tirumandiram of Tirumular is a manual of Saiva mysticism in 
3,000 verses. It constitutes the tenth book in the canon, though 
it does not appear to be mentioned by name by any author before 
Sekkilar. The life of Tirumular is wrapped in a fantastic legend: 
a siddha from Kailasa, the abode of Siva, migrated to the South 
to meet his friend Agastya; near Tiruvaduturai he entered the 
dead body of a shepherd out of pity for the herd which had just 
lost him; he led the herd back home in the evening, and then 
abandoned the shepherd’s family; then as a penance he sat under 
a tree for 3,000 years composing the work at the rate of one verse 
per year. In spite of its almost unredeemed obscurity, it is held 
in great veneration by Tamil Saivas. . 

Sundaramurtti, the last of the three hymnists of Devaram , con- 
tributed the 100 hymns which make the seventh book of the canon. 
His devotion to God was that of an intimate friend and he was 
known as the 4 Friend of God ’ ( tambirdn tolan). Legend credits 
him with having sent the deity as a messenger to his first love when 
she was cross with him for his temporary unfaithfulness. His 
Tiruttondattogai sung at Tiruvalur in the presence of Adiyars 
(devotees) is the classic list of Saiva saints, individual and collective, 
of whom sixty-two are named, including the author’s father and 
mother; by adding Sundaramurtti himself we get the celebrated 
sixty-three ndyandrs , the story of whose lives was told briefly by 
Nambi Andar Nambi in the tenth century and, with epic elabora- 
tion, by Sekkilar in the twelfth. One of Sundara’s friends, 
Cheraman Perumal, was the author of other devotional works of 
high literary quality: Tiruvdlur-mummanik-kdvai , a schematic poem 
of ten groups of three stanzas each in a different metre — an ahaval 
followed by a venba and a kalitturai; Pomarmattandddi in a hundred 
verses; and the Tirukkaildya-hana-uld reputed to be the first poem 
in this genre and to have been promulgated at Kailasa after the 
ndyandr reached the sacred mountain in the company of Sundara- 
murtti. 

Last but by no means least of the §aiva saints of this period 
who earned themselves an abiding place in the literature and hearts 



360 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


of the Tamils was Manikka-vasagar whose Tiruvasagam forms the 
eighth book of the canon, to which some would add his Tirukkovai 
also. The transparent sincerity of the passionate outpourings of 
the saint in the Tiruvasagam makes a deep impression on the 
reader’s mind, and the fifty-one hymns, in spite of their many 
strange mythical allusions, strike him as a true record of a vivid 
religious experience which traces the progress of a soul from the 
bondage of passion and ignorance to the liberty of fight and love. 
The supreme power of divine grace to liberate the soul is the main 
theme. Some would trace Christian influences in the trend of the 
saint’s thought and feeling; the parallel with some aspects of 
Christian experience is clear enough, but of any direct borrowing 
there is no proof; and on the whole the differences are more 
important than the resemblances. The Tirukkovai is among the 
earliest of the full-fledged kovais which treat of love in a schematic 
poem of 400 stanzas, each depicting a particular situation. 
Manikka-vasagar’ s poem has a double meaning throughout, the 
main theme being the love of the soul for God. Some are inclined 
to doubt the authorship of the poem, which is, however, marked 
by a devotional intensity not unworthy of the author of the 
Tiruvasagam , though its diction is less popular. The Kdrikkdvai 
of Kari-nayanar and the Muttaraiyar-kovai mentioned in the com- 
mentary to the Yapparungalam (tenth century) may be earlier than 
Tirukkovai , but they are no longer extant; and the PdndikkovaU also 
perhaps an earlier poem, is available only in numerous citations. 

Side by side with the £aiva ndyandrs , the Yaishnava dlvdrs also 
laboured along the same lines for the revival of Hinduism, and 
their devotional songs constitute in their final redaction the * Four 
Thousand Sacred Hymns * — Naldyira Divyaprabandham . The 

three earliest dlvdrs were Poygai, Pudam, and Pey, and later literary 
tradition avers that Pudam was the contemporary of Karaikkal 
Amm ai. These saints are each represented by one andadi of one 
hundred venbas , remarkable for their non-sectarian outlook and 
for the purity and gentleness of their devotion. Then came Tiru- 
mafisai, a contemporary of Mahendravarman I, in whose works, 
the Nanmugantiruvandddi and Tiruccandaviruttam 9 a somewhat 
more controversial tone can be traced than in the writings of the 
first three alvars. He is reputed to have tried both Jainism and 
Buddhism before turning Vaishnava yogi , and this explains the 
state of religion in his day and the tone of his poems. Tirumangai 


LITERATURE 


361 


(eighth century) was a much more voluminous writer and a keen 
controversialist. His poems constitute about a third of the entire 
collection in volume, and ensure him a high place both as poet and 
devotee. In its literary quality and in sentiment his work has 
many resemblances with that of Sambandar. He has many flings 
at Jains and Buddhists, and some even against Saivas. Periyajvar 
and his daughter Andal contribute nearly 650 verses to the collec- 
tion between them. The daughter claimed that the Lord of 
fSrirangam was her lover, and her poems are suffused by her 
passionate longing for companionship with the Lord ; she is reputed 
to have been accepted as his bride, and her poems, with her father’s 
are placed first in the canon. The cycle of Krishna stories is most 
effectively used to rouse the devotion of the hearer, and to a Hindu 
the repeated allusions to the tales in different settings constitute 
not the least attractive feature of her work. The hymn of Anda} 
which starts with the words vdranam-ayiram ( 4 one thousand ele- 
phants ’), telling of her dream-marriage with Vishnu, is sung at all 
Vaishnava Brahmin marriages to this day. Tiruppan and Tondar- 
adip-podi may be placed next; the former has only one hymn 
while the latter has two, Tirumdlai and Tiruppall iyelucci, to his 
credit. The last-named presupposes the existence of the order of 
worship in temples as the offering of royal honour, rajopacdra , to 
the deity; it is a song meant to rouse the god from his sleep at 
break of day. Tirumangai, Tondar-adip-podi and Kulasekhara 
are said to have been contemporaries, but we may well doubt this. 
Kulasekhara calls himself king of Kongar, Kudal and Koli in his 
poems. He was the author of a notable devotional poem in 
Sanskrit, Mukundamald , besides the 105 Tamil verses forming the 
Perumal Tirumoli in the Tamil canon of the Vaishnavas. The 
Veflala saint Nammalvar, also called Sathakopa, and his Brahmin 
pupil Madhurakavi were the latest of the ahdrs. Nammajvar’s 
work is held in the highest respect as it is believed to embody the 
deepest philosophical truths taught by the Upanishads. The 1,101 
stanzas comprising the Tiruvaymoli hold the place of honour and 
have been most elaborately commented on by later expositors of 
the Visishtadvaita system of philosophy. The Tiruvasiriyam, Tiru- 
viruttam and Tiruvandadi are other works comprising together less 
than 200 stanzas. They relate to the deities of some thirty 
shrines, of which all but six are found in the Pandya and Chera 
countries. Nammalvar was a yogi , and his Tiruvaymoli is replete 



362 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


with a convincing narration of his mystical experiences. Like the 
other alvars, he delights in the contemplation of the avatars of 
Vishnu and their achievements, and his handling of themes from 
the lives of Rama and Krishna has found expression in some very 
charming child poetry. Not only as philosopher and mystic, but 
even as a pure literary artist, Nammajvar takes a very high rank. 
Nathamuni, the first of the deary as of the next epoch, is said to 
have been his pupil and received from him the entire canon of 
4,000 hymns. The other pupil, Madhurakavi, himself an afoar, 
wrote only one hymn in praise of his guru. It is quite probable 
that the last two alvars lived for many years after 850, the limit of 
our second period. 

In the field of general literature, the three most outstanding 
works are by Jaina and Buddhist authors. The Silappadikaram 
is an unsurpassed gem, though its authorship and date are not 
free from besetting doubts. The work is in some ways unique in 
the whole range of Tamil literature, and the vivid portraiture of 
its scenes and its skilful metrical effects are practically unknown 
to any other work. Its theme is an old popular saga, the story of 
a merchant prince, Kovalan, who neglects his wife Kannagi and 
loses his fortune through love of the celebrated hetaera Madhavi 
of Puhar. A quarrel between the lovers sends Kovalan back to 
his wedded wife, and they both migrate from Puhar to Madura 
to start a new life with the money to be raised by the sale of 
Kannagi’s jewels — particularly her precious anklet (. silambu ) which 
gives the name to the poem. As the result of the machinations 
of the royal goldsmith, Kovalan is suspected of being the thief 
who stole the queen’s anklet from the palace and is cut down by 
the king’s officers in the streets of Madura. When Kannagi hears 
the news, she rushes to the palace with the second anklet as proof 
of Kovalan’s innocence. The king realizes his injustice and dies 
of a broken heart. Kannagi wreaks her vengeance on Madura by 
consigning the city to flames, and moves into the Chera country 
where she is received into heaven with her husband. Senguttuvan 
enshrines her as the Goddess of Chastity. Despite its supernatural 
elements, the bulk of the story is a moving human tale powerfully 
told, its scenes laid in all three kingdoms of the Tamil land. The 
author is called Ilango Adigal (‘ Prince ascetic ’) and is reputed to 
be the brother of the Chera monarch Senguttuvan; but of such a 
brother the Sangam poems have no knowledge. The mystery 


LITERATURE 


363 


deepens when we learn further that Ilango was a contemporary of 
Sattanar, a grain-merchant of Madura, the author of Manimekalai. 
This is a Buddhist poem, which tells the life-story, mainly of reli- 
gious interest, of Manimekalai, the daughter of Madhavi by 
Kovalan. The prologues to the two poems say that each was 
read out to the author of the other. And there is actually among 
the &angam poets a SIttalaic-Cattanar, who contributes ten poems 
to four of the eight anthologies, though there is no trace of any 
leaning to Buddhism on his part. In its present form the Mani- 
mekalai contains a long exposition of fallacies in logic which is 
obviously based on the Nydyapravesa of Dinnaga, a work of the 
fifth century a.d. And the literary form of the two epics is so 
different from anything known in the real age of Sangam literature 
that it would not be wrong to postulate an interval of several 
centuries between that age and that of the Silappadikaram and 
Manimekalai. 

The Perungadai (Sanskrit, Brihat-katha) of Kongu-Velir is 
another great poem by a Jaina author, of which only parts are 
available. It tells of the adventures of Naravanadatta, the son of 
the celebrated Udayana of KausambI and is apparently based on a 
Sanskrit original which was a rendering of Gunadhya’s famous 
poem in the PaisacI dialect. The Western Ganga king Durvinita 
is said to have composed a Sanskrit version of that work at the 
end of the sixth century. As a narrative poem the Perungadai has 
exceptional merits and is deservedly popular. Valaiyapati and 
Kundalakesi are the names of two other Jaina Kavyas in Tamil 
which have been lost but were once counted among the five great 
Kavyas. The commentary on the Ydpparungalam , a Jaina 
grammar of the next period, cites many works on grammar by 
Jaina authors which must have been composed at this time; so 
also the commentary on the Virasoliyam , a Buddhist grammatical 
work of the eleventh century, cites verses from many Buddhist 
Kavyas of this period no longer accessible to us. 

The commentary on the Iraiyandr Ahapporul traditionally 
ascribed to Nakklrar must have been composed late in this period- 
It is worthy of note as the earliest of the great prose commentaries 
which occupy so conspicuous a place in the development of Tamil 
prose. The style of the commentaries is by no means easy or 
popular, and is often marred by the authors’ desire to show off 
their learning and by their straining after alliteration; the 



364 A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 

earliest commentary exhibits in full all the demerits of this class 
of writing. 

The Muttollayiram must have been a work of 900 venbas , made 
up of 300 verses in praise of each of the three monarchs of the 
Tamil country. It is now known only from about 100 verses, 
which are often very good poetry, cited by different writers, but 
its authorship cannot be traced. The Tagadur - Yattirai is another 
lost work of the age, which is likewise only known from stray 
citations. Its theme was the war between the Chera monarch and 
Adigaiman of Tagadur which took place relatively late in the 
Sangam Age. 

Finally, mention must be made of two works of the time of 
Pallava Nandivarman III. The anonymous Nandikkalambakam , 
that has come down with many interpolations, is a quasi-historical 
poem of about eighty stanzas dealing, in various metres, with 
events of the reign of the last great Pallava monarch. The Bhdratam 
of Perundevanar of which only a small part has survived raises 
questions which cannot now be satisfactorily answered. The 
extant portions include the whole of the Udyoga and Bhishma 
parvas , and part of the Drona parva , — to the battle on the thirteenth 
day. The work consists of venbas interspersed with connecting 
prose passages, and thus attains the form of a Campu. But it has 
been doubted if the poetry and prose are from the same pen, and 
the problem is complicated by the fact that the Bhdratam was 
rendered into Tamil by a Perundevanar in the Sangam Age. The 
present work, poetry and prose taken together, is a straightforward 
and simple narrative of the main story not devoid of eloquence 
and charm. It may well be that the entire work was written by 
a single author in the ninth century, his poetry conforming to a 
long-established tradition regarding its diction, while his prose was 
modelled on the style of the learned commentaries, the only prose 
then known. 

The age of the imperial Cholas (850-1200) was the golden age 
of Tamil culture, and it was naturally marked by the widespread 
practice and patronage of literature. The Prabandha form became 
dominant and the systematic treatment of Saiva-siddhanta in 
philosophical treatises began. Great Siva temples were built anew 
and celebrated in hymns on the model of those of the previous 
period by new authors (among whom was a prince), and the 
hagiology of JJaivism was standardized in a great Purana by 



LITERATURE 


365 


!§ekkilar. A quantum of Vaishnava devotional literature and com- 
mentaries on the canon also came into existence. Jaina and 
Buddhist authors continued to flourish though not in such numbers 
as in the earlier age. Many works mentioned in the numerous 
inscriptions of the period have been lost beyond recovery. 

In general literature, the Jivakacintamani of the Jaina ascetic and 
poet Tiruttakkadevar was composed early in the tenth century. 
It follows late ninth-century Sanskrit originals and tells the life 
story of JIvaka, an ideal hero, equally distinguished in the arts of 
war and peace, the perfect saint no less than the charming lover. 
After a stormy youth marked by many adventures Jivaka finds 
himself, in the prime of life, the monarch of a splendid kingdom. 
For some years thereafter he leads a life of pleasure in the company 
of his eight queens; in fact the poem has another name, Mana-nul , 
4 The Book of Marriages on account of each of Jlvaka’s early 
adventures culminating in a happy marriage. Jivaka is shaken 
from his complacency by an incident, trivial in itself, but full of 
deep significance to him. He sees in a moment’s flash the hollow- 
ness of human life and the wisdom of seeking release from its 
bonds. He installs his son on the throne and seeks the peace of 
the forest, and attains salvation in the end. In its present form 
the work contains 3,154 stanzas, of which it is thought that only 
2,700 were composed by the original author, two contributed by 
his guru, with whose permission he wrote the poem, and the rest 
by a later writer. The annotator has marked out the guru's two 
verses, but there is no means of identifying the work of the third 
writer. The art of Tiruttakkadevar is marked by all the qualities 
of great poetry and even, as is well known, furnished the model 
for the genius of Kamban. The poem is said to have been the 
author’s answer to a challenge that while Jaina writers were 
admittedly distinguished in the field of religious literature, they 
could make no contribution to the literature of love. Tiruttakka- 
devar was allowed to take up the challenge and write this long 
erotic poem after he had satisfied his guru that he had the literary 
capacity for the task and that he would not lose his spiritual balance 
by writing it. He is thought to have been a Chola prince by birth. 
Another Jaina writer of the time was Tolamoli (‘ a man of unsur- 
passed eloquence ’) whose Suldmani handles a Jaina puranic theme 
in very mellifluous verse and is counted among the five minor 
Kavyas of Tamil literature. 



366 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Kalladanar, the author of Kalladam , must be distinguished from 
his namesake of the Sangam Age. He can perhaps be identified 
with the author who figures in the eleventh book of the Saiva 
canon. Kalladam is a place-name and possibly the writer was 
bom there. He is said to have chosen one hundred verses from 
the Tirukkovai as the basis of his work which deals with the sixty- 
four sacred sports of Siva. The style of the work is very stilted 
as a result of the author’s attempt to revive the poetic forms and 
diction of the Sangam Age. The whole poem of 100 pieces, each 
purporting to depict a particular mood of love ( ahatturai ), is a 
curious instance of extreme pedantry. The Kalingattupparani of 
the poet-laureate of the Chola court, Jayangondar, dates from the 
end of the reign of Kulottunga I and is the earliest and best of the 
Paranis now accessible. It is a splendid little masterpiece which 
keeps clear the line between history and fictitious convention; its 
choice diction and the sustained harmony between the metres 
employed and the incidents portrayed are unique. The Parani is 
the war poem par excellence and depicts not only the pomp and 
circumstance of war, but all the gruesome details of the field. 
The Kalinga war of Kulottunga, the theme of this poem, was 
celebrated in several other works, none of which could survive 
in the face of Jayangondar’s poem. Another poet-laureate of the 
Chola court was Kuttan or Ottakkuttan who graced the reigns of 
three successors of Kulottunga (viz. Yikrama Chola, Kulottunga II 
and Rajaraja II) and sang eloquent Ulas of each of them. Bom 
of a poor Sengundar (weaver) family in Malari, a village in the 
Chola country, Kuttan sought service under Sankaran, the chief- 
tain of Puduvai and father of Sadaiyan, the patron of the more 
celebrated Kamban. Kuttan had other patrons like Gangeya, 
whom he praised in a Nalayirakkovai , and a certain Soman of 
Tribhuvani. When his fame rose he was invited to the imperial 
court and entertained there as Kaviccakravarti (‘ Emperor of 
Poets ’) by the three successive monarchs named. Besides the 
three Ulas, he composed a Parani, no longer extant, on the Kalinga 
war of Vikrama Chola, and a pillaittamil (a poem describing the 
hero’s childhood) on Kulottunga II. The last is easily the best 
of the poet’s compositions on account of its copious diction, the 
rich melody and fine imagery of its verse. The same poet’s Takka - 
yagapparani , obviously an imitation of Kalingattupparani , in its 
metres and style, handles the legendary theme of Daksha’s sacrifice 


LITERATURE 


367 


with considerable force and power, but must take a rank well 
below its model. Other poems attributed to him are Sarasvatiyan- 
dadi in praise of the Goddess of Learning by whose grace he became 
a poet, reputed to be his first composition, and Arumbaittollayiram , 
besides Ittiyelupadu and Eluppelupadu , poems of no merit about 
the composition of which popular imagination has trumped up 
wild legends which reflect no credit on their inventors or the poet. 
The village of Kuttanur on the banks of the Arisil river (Tanjore 
district) keeps the poet’s memory alive, and has a Sarasvatl temple 
with a record of the twelfth century mentioning the installation of 
the image of the goddess by Kavipperumal alias Ovada-Kuttar, 
the grandson of Ottakkuttan. 

A greater poet than Kuttan was Kamban, the celebrated author 
of the Tamil Ramayanam or Ramavataram , who flourished in the 
reign of Kulottunga III. This poem is the greatest epic in Tamil 
literature, and though the author states that he follows in the wake 
of Valmlki, still his work is no translation or even adaptation of 
the Sanskrit original. Like the other great poets who have 
enriched the literatures .of the different languages of India by their 
works on the Rama saga, Kamban imports into his narration the 
colour of his own time and place. Thus his description of Kosala 
is an idealized account of the features of the Chola country, and 
he compares the brightness of moonlight to the fame of his patron, 
Sadaiyan of Vennai-nallur. Rama himself was as much master of 
the Tamil idiom as of Sanskrit. Sometimes Kamban yields to the 
somewhat rigid canons of Tamil poetics as when he enters on an 
elaborate analysis of the emotions of Rama and Sita after a chance 
meeting which takes place immediately after Rama’s entry into 
Mithila. Elsewhere, as in the description of Slta’s behaviour on 
receiving Rama’s ring from Hanuman, Kamban elaborates a brief 
hint thrown out by Valmiki who says that she rejoiced as if she 
had rejoined her husband. He compresses Valmlki’s account at 
other points, as in Dasaratha's asvamedha. Few authentic details 
of the poet’s life are forthcoming. He is believed to have belonged 
to the Uvaccar caste, priests in the temples of Kali and similar 
deities, and stray verses attributed to him seek to bring him into 
some relation with all the great monarchs of South India including 
the Pandya and Kakatlya rulers, Kamban’s poem carried the 
story of Rama up to his return to Ayodhya and his coronation as 
king; the Uttarakandam being the work of another hand. The 



368 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Ramavataram attained great popularity, and there was a family of 
hereditary expounders of the Kambaramdyana in Hassan in Mysore 
State at the end of the fourteenth century. Two mediocre poems 
Erelupadu and Satakoparandadi are attributed to Kamban; the 
former is in praise of agriculture, and the praise of Satakopa 
(NammaWar) is said to have been composed to please the god of 
Srirangam whose approval was sought by the poet for the Ramd- 
yana and who ordered him to praise his beloved devotee in a 
centum of verses. One of the best known works of secular litera- 
ture belonging to the late Chola period is the KulottungankovaU 
on Kumara Kulottunga, afterwards Kulottunga III. Little is 
known of the author, and the poem has no conspicuous merit 
except that it has a great Chola monarch for its hero and contains 
passing allusions to some of his achievements in war. 

The impulse to produce devotional religious literature which 
was so active in the last period (500-850) continued with some 
force far into this (850-1200), and the extant arrangement of the 
Saiva canon into eleven books was the work of Nambi Andar 
Nambi who lived at the close of the tenth and the beginning of 
the eleventh century. His part in the collection and editing of 
the canon became the subject of Umapatisivacarya’s poem Tiru- 
murai-kanda-puranam (fourteenth century). Nambfs own works 
include six Prabandhas on Nanasambandar and one on Appar, 
besides Tiruttondar-tiruvandadi which gives brief accounts of the 
lives of the sixty-three saints and is based on Sundaramurtti’s 
Tiruttondattogai. All these and the poems he wrote in praise of 
Vinayaka and Chidambaram, find a place in the eleventh book of 
the canon. The same book includes five compositions of Patti- 
nattu-pillaiyar in which this senior contemporary of Nambi cele- 
brates the Saiva shrines of Chidambaram, Kalumalam (Shiyali), 
Tiruvidaimarudur, Kanchipuram and Orriyur. Earlier than Nambi 
but not far removed from him were the authors represented in the 
ninth book of the canon, Tiruvisaippa. There are nine of them 
including Gandaraditya, the son of Parantaka I, and a Karuvur 
Devan who has hymns on the three famous Chola temples newly 
erected in his day — the Adityesvara at Kalandai, the Rajarajesvara 
at Tanjore and the Gangaikonda-sojesvara at Gangaikonda- 
solapuram.

the history of Tamil Saivism. Umapati-sivacarya has celebrated 
the event in a short Purana called Sekkildr-ndyandr-purdnam. A 
Vellala by caste, Sekkilar was bom at Kunrattur very near Madras, 
and having entered the service of the Chola monarch, he rose to a 
high position and earned the title Uttamasoja Pallavarayan. He 
built a Siva temple closely modelled on that at Tirunagesvaram 
(near Kumbakonam), a shrine to which he was greatly devoted. 
The story goes that the king’s study of Jivakacintamani offended 
§ekkilar’s deeply religious nature and that he exhorted the king 
to abandon the pursuit of impious erotic literature and turn instead 
to the lives of the Saiva saints celebrated by Sundaramurtti and 
Nambi Andar Nambi. The king thereupon commanded Sekkilar 
to expound these lives, and being greatly attracted by the theme, 
he wanted Sekkilar to write them out in extenso in a great poem 
and gave him much wealth to enable him to do so. Sekkilar 
then went over to Chidambaram, and with his mind filled with 
divine grace — there was a voice commanding him to begin his 
work with the words Ulagelam — he began to compose the Purana 
in the beautiful thousand-pillared mandapa within the precincts of 
the temple. On its completion, the Chola monarch himself came 
to Chidambaram and, in accordance with another divine command, 
he listened attentively to Sekkilar’s exposition of the work from 
day to day for a whole year. It was hailed universally as a veritable 
fifth Veda in Tamil and immediately took its place as the twelfth 
and last book in the Saiva canon. It has influenced profoundly 
the lives of all the Saivas of the Tamil country and of those in 
Andhra and Karnataka through translations and adaptations. It 
is one of the masterpieces of Tamil literature, and worthily 
commemorates the great age of the Imperial Cholas and their 
sustained devotion to Saivism. 

Vaishnava religious literature during this period was mostly 
composed in Sanskrit. It is possible that the last two alvars lived 
far into this period, but the acaryas who succeeded them, Natha- 
muni, the redactor of the 4,000 hymns, his grandson Alavandar 
or Yamunacarya and the great Ramanuja himself wrote almost 
all their works in Sanskrit, a rather strange transformation for a 
movement which began with a more popular appeal than Saivism. 
Even the commentators on the early Tamil hymns like Pijlan, the 
author of the shortest extant commentary on Tiruvaymoli , Nanjlyar, 
Nambillai, Periyavaccan and Vadakkuttiruvldippijlai, all authors

of more elaborate commentaries, developed a quaint style, mani- 
pravdla (lit. crystal and coral), loaded with Sanskrit words not 
easily understood outside the narrow learned circle. The centum 
of verses in praise of Ramanuja, the Rdmanuja-nurrandadi , by his 
disciple Tiruvarangattu Amudanar is a conspicuous exception; it is 
a poem in simple devotional style held in great esteem to this day 
and often repeated as a daily prayer; the central idea of the poem 
is that there is no way to salvation without the grace of the guru. 

Jivasambodanai of Devendra-munivar is a Jaina work expound- 
ing in detail twelve modes of meditation in the form of an address 
to the soul. The work is replete with mythical stories and 
anecdotes, and its metres resemble those employed in contemporary 
Tamil inscriptions. 

In the field of Tamil grammar, the Yapparungalam and 
Ydpparungalakkdrigai , two authoritative works on prosody, were 
composed by Amitasagara, a Jaina ascetic of the close of the tenth 
century. Both the works have lucid commentaries, that on the 
Karigai being by a certain Gunasagara, also a Jaina ascetic and 
most probably a pupil of Amitasagara. The Yapparungalam is 
unique in its range and offers an exhaustive treatment of the metres 
in Tamil, and the Karigai (Skt. Karika) is its abridgement. Amita- 
sagara quotes the Sulamani and is himself quoted by Buddhamitra, 
the Buddhist author of Virasoliyam. Both Amitasagara and 
Buddhamitra were patronized by the contemporary Chola monarchs 
and granted liberal assignments of territory. The latter mentions 
king VIrarajendra as a great Tamil scholar. His work written in 
kalitturai metre attempts a synthesis between the Tamil and 
Sanskrit systems of grammar, and comprises all the five sections 
of a complete treatise — sandhi (eluttu), sol y porul , ydppu and 
alankara (ani). The work is full of interest for a student of the 
history of grammatical theory in Tamil; it has a commentary by 
Perundevanar, a pupil of the author. The Dandiyalangaram treats 
mainly of figures of speech and, as its name implies, it is modelled 
on the famous Kavyadarsa of Dandin. It is composed in sutra 
(aphoristic) style and, like its model, it treats of the nature of poetry 
and Kavya, and of figures of speech under two generic heads— 
arthdlankara ( porulani ) and sabddlankara (. sollani ). Each sutra is 
followed by an explanation and illustration, all believed to be by 
the author, and some of the illustrative stanzas are in praise of 
Anapaya Chola (Kulottunga II). The name of the author and the 



LITERATURE

details of the life are lost. The Neminadam of Gunavlrapandita is 
a short treatise of less than 100 verses in the venba metre treating 
of the orthographs and parts of speech ( eluttu and sol) of the Tamil 
language. The author, a Jain of the time of Kulottunga III, named 
ids work after Neminatha, the tirthankara of South Mylapore. 
Another work of the same writer on prosody was Vaccanandi-malai 

the Garland of Vaccanandi ’), named after the author’s guru; 
it is also known as Venbdppattiyal. The Nannul (‘ The Good 
Book’) was the work of Pavanandi, another Jaina grammarian 
patronized by a Ganga feudatory of Kulottunga III. It treats only 
of eluttu and sol, and it is not known whether the author stopped 
there or the rest of the work has been lost. By its simplicity and 
terseness, it has practically displaced all other books as the begin- 
ner’s handbook of Tamil grammar. The Purapporul-venbamalai 
of Aiyanaridanar, yet another Jaina writer, defines the conven- 
tions governing the turais (situations) of puram and illustrates each 
turai by a venba ; in some respects it differs from the Tolkappiyam , 
and is said to be based on an early work called Pannirupadalam . 

In lexicography the large nigandu (lexicon) called Pingalam after 
its author belongs to this period. Its topical divisions are different 
Trom those of Divakaram , the earliest extant lexicon composed by 
Divakara under the patronage of a Sendan of Ambar sometime in 
the eighth century a.d. Little is known of the author of Pingalam; 
lie is mentioned in the Nannul and seems to have been a Saiva. 

The philosophical literature of Saiva-siddhanta had its beginnings 
late in this period in two works, Tiruvundiyar by Tiruviyalur- 
uyyavanda-devar and Tirukkalirruppadiyar by Tirukkadavtir- 
uyyavanda-devar; the latter is said to have been the pupil of the 
tformer and these two works composed in 1148 and 1178 are the 
only ones among the fourteen works comprising the Siddhanta- 
sastra that precede Siva-Nana-Bodam of Meykandar, the celebrated 
manual of Saivism. 

The fourth and last great period of Tamil literature that will 
engage our attention extended from 1200 to 1650 and was marked 
by a large output of philosophical works, commentaries, Puranas 
.and Prabandhas. Much of this literature is derivative and second- 
rate, and one gets the impression that the age of creative achieve- 
ment has given place to imitation and criticism. A somewhat arid 
scholasticism found much encouragement in the numerous mafhas 
lhat begin to play a prominent part in the educational system of

the country. The numerous authors of the period belonged mostly 
to the Saiva or Vaishnava sects, though some Jaina writers con- 
tinued to write also. Though the emperors of Vijayanagar and 
most of their feudatories even as far south as Madura were Telugus 
with a decided preference for Sanskrit and Telugu, there is no 
reason to think that there was any setback in Tamil literary work, 
and the Pandyas, confined to the extreme south from the fifteenth 
century, bestowed particular attention to the cultivation of Tamil. 

Early in this period, in the first half of the thirteenth century, 
came Meykandar who formulated the tenets of Saiva-siddhanta in 
his Siva-N dm- Bodam , a short treatise of a dozen Sutras, perhaps 
translated from a Sanskrit original. The author has added 
varttikas which explain and illustrate the argument of each of the 
Sutras. The scheme of the work is simple : the first three Sutras 
affirm the existence of the three entities — God ( pati ), Bondage 
( pasa ), and Soul ( pasu ); the three next define and explain their 
nature and interrelation; the next triad deals with the means of 
release, and the last with its nature. * The Veda,’ it has been said, 

‘ is the cow; its milk is the true agama; the Tamil sung by the four 
in Devaram and Tiruvasagam is the ghee extracted from it; and the 
virtue of the Tamil work of Meykandar of the celebrated (city of)' 
Vennai is the fine taste of the ghee.’ After the Bodam , the next 
work of importance on Saiva doctrine is the Siva-N ana- Sittiy dr of 
Arunandi, reputed to have been first the guru of Meykandar’s 
father and then the disciple of Meykandar himself. Written alto- 
gether in verse, this work is a statement of the true doctrine 
(supakkam) in viruttam verses, following the order of the Sutras 
in the Bodam ; this statement is preceded by a critical discussion 
of rival systems {para-pakkam ) of which no fewer than fourteen, 
including four schools of Buddhism and two of Jainism, are passed 
under review. This is the great classic of Tamil Saiva doctrine; 
often commented on, it has been the most widely read manual on 
the subject. The Irupav-irupahdu by the same writer owes its name 
to the alternate use of two metres in its twenty verses in the form 
of a dialogue between teacher and pupil. The name of the author’s 
guru , Meykandar, occurs in each of these twenty verses. The 
Unmai-vilakkam (‘ Explanation of the Truth ’) of Manavasagan- 
gadandar of Tiruvadi (South Arcot) is the simplest of the manuals 
on the doctrine, true to the essence of the Agamas. Umapati- 
sivacarya (end of the thirteenth and early fourteenth century) was 



LITERATURE 


373 


the author of the remaining eight works which complete the tale 
of the fourteen Saiva-siddhanta-sastras. 1 One of them, Sankarpa- 
nirdkaranam, is dated 1313. Like the para-pakkam of the Sittiydr, 
it is a critique of other creeds; but, unlike the earlier work, it is 
much exercised with the minute differences within the fold of 
£aivism. Both these works were commented on in the sixteenth 
century by Nanaprakasar of Tiruvornyur who also composed a 
Purana on his birthplace (c. 1580). 

At the end of the fourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth 
•century came Svarupananda Desikar and his pupil Tattuvarayar, 
authors of two celebrated anthologies bearing on the philosophy of 
Advaita. The Sivaprakasap-perundirattu comprising 2,824 verses is 
the work of the teacher; that of the pupil, called Kurundirattu , 
{short anthology), includes almost exactly half as many verses as 
the bigger work. The two anthologies together conserve much 
of the religious and philosophical literature of the silver age of 
Saivism in the Tamil country that would otherwise have been lost. 
Tattuvarayar was an ascetic, like his guru, and author of many 
•devotional poems and songs, some of which were remarkable for 
the simplicity of their diction and their wide appeal to the common 
man; the songs in particular were of the nature of ditties and 
created many new models that were extensively followed by sub- 
sequent composers. Among the poems may be named Paduturai , 
Nanavinodan Kalambakam , Mdhavadaip-parani and Annavada ip- 
par ani. Even wider in its appeal was the Tiruppugal of Arunagiri- 
natha, over 1,360 songs in various metres handled with the utmost 
skill and characterized by a unique lilt. The diction is highly 
Sanskritized and the imagery vivid; the author’s wide knowledge 
of the sacred lore of Hinduism is evident in every song. His 
mention of Praudhadeva Raya places him in the fifteenth century. 
His life has become the subject of many legends, but the references 
in the songs show that for a time he led the life of a libertine which 
he afterwards regretted. He accepted Muruga or Karttikeya as 
the supreme deity, and in philosophy he followed the £aiva- 
siddhanta system. He seems to have visited all the shrines of 
Muruga and been particularly attached to Palani which figures 
largely in the Tiruppugal A number of shorter devotional poems, 
all in praise of Muruga also are attributed to him. A certain

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Sivaprakasar of Madura (1489) wrote valuable commentaries on 
Irupav-irupahdu of Arunandi and Sivaprakasam of UmapatL 
Haridasa was a Vaishnava poet who adorned the court of the 
celebrated Krishnadeva Raya of Vijayanagar, and wrote the* 
Irusamaya-vilakkam , an exposition of the two systems, viz. Saivism 
and Vaishnavism, with a bias towards the latter. The Sivadaru- 
mottaram (1553) of Marainanasambandar, who lived in a matha 
in Chidambaram, contains over 1,200 verses in twelve sections 
based on the Agamas and dealing with cosmology, with the temple 
and its constitution, and with theology. The same author wrote 
also the Saiva-samaya-neri (‘ the path of the Saiva creed ’)> 727 
small stanzas ( kural venbas ) on the daily religious observances 
of Saivas. About the same time (1564) Sivagrayogi alias Sivak- 
kolundu Desikar composed an authoritative commentary on the 
whole of the Sittiyar , besides other works on ritualism, asceticism 
and other religious subjects. Another famous writer who flourished 
at the same time was Kamalai Nanaprakasar, the author of many 
manuals of Saiva worship, besides the Purana on Tirumajuvadi*. 
and a kovai on Tiruvannamalai. Masilamani Sambandar’s 
Purana on Uttarakosamangai is very important for the life-story 
of Manikka-vasagar. Niramba AJagiya Desikar wrote Setu-puranam 
which is popular among scholars as it uses all the rare words listed 
in the lexicons and is considered helpful in enriching the vocabulary 
of aspiring writers. He wrote also Puranas on Tirupparangiri and 
Tiruvaiyaru, and a commentary on the Sittiyar , differing in some 
ways from his elder contemporary Sivagrayogi. He had many 
pupils who composed several minor Puranas and religious works 
including the well-known Tiruvdlur-puranam (1592). Turasai 
Ambalavana-Desikar (c\ 1605) was the author of many religious 
works like the Sittanta-sikdmani , Nittai-vilakkam and Sanmdrga - 
sittiyar , besides the PuppiUai-attavanai , an easy prose exposition of 
Saiva philosophy said to have been composed for the edification of 
a loyal attendant. 

A certain Turaiyur Sivaprakasa-svami was a contemporary of 
Lingama Nayaka of Vellore (early seventeenth century). He is 
said to have embraced Vira-saivism to win the Nayaka’s favour 
and induce him to restore worship in the shrine of Nataraja at 
Chidambaram, interrupted by the intolerance of the Vaishnava 
officials of Vijayanagar. Among his works Advaita-venba expounds 
the Saiva philosophy in 218 verses based on the Agamas y

particularly the Vatula, while others like Gana-bhashita-ratnamdlai 
and Satakatrayam deal with the theology and philosophy of Vira- 
saivism. Of more than ordinary interest is the work of Madai 
Tiruvengadanathar, an officer of the Nayak of Madura at Kayattar 
in the Tinnevelly district about 1633. He undertook the exposition 
of Advaita Vedanta in a long Tamil poem and sought to excel 
Krishna Misra who expounded the same system in the popular 
Sanskrit drama Prabodha-Candrodaya. The Tamil work also 
bears the name of its model and has an alternative name Meynhana - 
vilakkam (exposition of true knowledge), 48 cantos comprising 
2,019 verses. Being a high official, Tiruvengada patronized many 
poets. One of the latest works of Saiva philosophy was Nana - 
bharana-vilakkam , a commentary on Siva-Nana-&ittiyar by Velli- 
yambala Tambiran (c. 1650), a disciple of the famous Kumara- 
guruparar. It is an extensive Bhashya replete with citations from 
Agamas of which the author also translated some into Tamil. 

The philosophical and religious literature of Vaishnavism during 
this period as in the last comprises mostly Sanskrit works. There 
was very little writing in Tamil other than commentaries and sub- 
commentaries on the canonical hymns and a class of esoteric 
theological works called Rahasyas (secrets), of which it is not easy 
to gather an authentic account. The commentaries adopted the 
manipravala style. Pillai Lokacarya, author of eighteen Rahasya 
works, and his pupil and younger brother Alagiya Manavala- 
perumal Nayanar, author of more Rahasyas and commentaries on 
parts of the canon, came very early in the period and belonged to 
the first decades of the thirteenth century. Vedanta Desika, an 
eminent divine and prolific writer in Sanskrit, was also the author 
of a number of Tamil works like Mummanik-kovai , Navaratna- 
malai, Arthapahcakam, and Adaikkalappattu . His son and pupil 
Nayinar Acariyar wrote a poem in praise of his father and guru 
in twenty verses known as Pillaiyandadi , and other works of 
theology and polemics; both father and son were keen contro- 
versialists and travelled incessantly to hold religious disputations. 
Tiruvaymoh Pillai (1307) wrote commentaries on the hymns of 
Periyalvar and on $ri-vacanabhushana , one of Pillai Lokacarya’s 
eighteen Rahasyas; Manavaja Mahamuni (1370), pupil of Tiruvay- 
moli Pillai, wrote commentaries on many canonical works and on 
the Ramdnuja-nurrandddi ; he is held in the highest esteem by one 
section of the Vaishnavas, the Tengalais (southern branch). 



376 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


A considerable part of the religious and philosophical literature 
of the age took the form of Puranas, some of which have been 
named already. Other prominent works in the same class may 
now be noticed. The Koyirpuranam of Umapati-sivacarya is 
among the earliest of the Sthalapuranas and narrates the legends 
of the celebrated Saiva shrine in Chidambaram; it follows the 
Kavya style and ranks fairly high as literature. There is also a 
Cidambara-puranam (1508) by Purana Tirumalainathan, who also 
wrote the Cokkandthar-ula in praise of the deity of Madura. More 
popular in its diction and content is the Ariccandira-purdnam (1524) 
of Nallur Virakavirayar which sets forth the trials which Haris- 
candra had to endure on account of his devotion to truth. The 
work comprises twelve sections and 1,225 easy-flowing verses; the 
poet is said to have been a goldsmith of Nallur in Ramnad district. 
We may next mention three large works on the sixty-four sacred 
sports of Siva at Madura. The Sundarapdndiyam of Anadari was 
composed at the request of Tiruvirundan, a general of Vlrappa 
Nayaka (1572-95) of Madura; the poem is a translation and bears 
the name of its Sanskrit original; only a fragment of over 2,000 
verses has survived. Two other poems, both called Tiruvilaiyadal , 
also handle the same theme with many variations; the shorter one 
was by Perumbarrappuhyur-nambi who has been assigned on 
rather slender grounds to the thirteenth century, but might have 
lived much later; the larger version (purporting to give the names 
of the Pandya kings in whose reigns each of the sports took place) 
was by Paranjoti of Vedaranyam, perhaps written at the beginning 
of the seventeenth century. The Kandapuranam of Kacciyappa 
Sivacarya (1625) closely follows Kamban’s poetry as a model and 
is based on a section of the Sanskrit Skandapurana. The last 
section of this book was completed by a pupil of the author, 
Nanavarodaya Pandaram. The work comprises over 13,000 verses 
including 2,600 at the end by the pupil. Among minor Sthala- 
puranas composed towards the close of our period may be 
mentioned: Vriddhacalapuranam of Nanak-kuttar, a pupil of 
Turaiyur Sivaprakasa; Tiruvanjiya-puranam of Kalandaikkumaran 
{1616); the Puranas on Kumbakonam, Vedaranyam and Tiruk- 
kanapper by Aghora Munivar, who had for his pupil the celebrated 
grammarian Vaidyanatha Desikar; and the Pa[an it- tala-purdnam 
(1628) of Balasubramanya Kavirayar, a native of Palani. There 
are two versions of the Bhagavatam in Tamil, by Sewaiccuduvar

of Vembarrur in the Madura district and by Varadaraja 
Aiyangar of Nellinagar (1543); the former is the earlier and 
better work. 

In secular literature, the Tanjai-vanan-kovai of Poyyamoli of 
Vanji comes first. The Vanan of Tanjai, the hero of the poem, 
is described as 6 the eye of the Pandya who conquered the rnalai - 
nadu This must be a reference to Maravarman Kulasekhara I 
(1260-1308) especially as the kovai illustrates systematically the 
rules of the Nambi Ahapporul , a work on grammar composed and 
published by Narkavirajanambi under Kulasekhara. Tanjai, the 
residence of the Bana hero of the kovai , is modem Tanjakkur near 
Madura. The Nalavenba of Pugalendi is an easy and moving 
narration of the tragic story of Nala and Damayanti; nothing 
authentic is known of the author except that he was patronized by 
a chieftain named Chandran Suvarkki, ruler of Mullur in MaHuva- 
nad; he certainly came after Kamban and the popular stories that 
connect him with Ottakkuttan and Auvaiyar deserve no credence. 
The Bharatam of Villiputturar (c. 1400) is a poem of great merit 
which tells the entire story of the Great Bharata War in 4,350 
well-turned verses. The narrative style of the author and his rich 
diction marked by a profuse admixture of Sanskrit words and 
expressions make the poem very attractive reading. The author 
was patronized by a certain Varapati Atkondan of the Kongar 
family. Contemporary with Villiputturar were the two brothers, one 
lame and the other blind, known as Irattaippulavar (twin poets), 
authors of Ekamra-nadar-ula and two kalambakams ; in the Ula 
which celebrates the Saiva shrine of Kanchl they refer to Malli- 
nathan Rajanarayana Sambuvarayan (1350), the last of the Sengeni 
chieftains of North Arcot and Chingleput districts. 

An Ula on another famous Saiva shrine, that of Tiruvanaikka 
on the island of Srirangam, was the work of Kalamegham, the 
accredited author of many witty verses besides; he was supported 
by Saluva Tirumalairaja, the son of Goppaya, and ruler of the 
Chola country under Vijayanagar in the middle of the fifteenth 
century. Saiva Ellappa Navalar, a vellala poet of the Tanjore 
district, flourished in the sixteenth century (c. 1542-80), and wrote 
an excellent kovai on Tiruvarur (496 verses), besides Arunaiandadi 
and Anmdcalapuranam , both on the shrine of Tiruvannamalai, 
and Tiruvirinjaipuranam ; he also wrote a commentary on the 
Tamil Soundaryalahari , a translation by Virai Kavirajapanditar.

About the same time the Pandyan king Ativirarama of Tenkasr* 
(c. 1564) achieved literary distinction by his Naidadam with its- 
twelve padalams and 1,172 verses written in high style and full 
of conceits not always pleasing to a modern reader, but held in 
high esteem by pandits; it contains many echoes of phrases and 
sentiments from older classics like the Jivakacintdmani and the^ 
Rdmayanam of Kamban. Easier in their style are the same royal, 
poet’s translations from Sanskrit originals — the Kdsikandam and 
Kurmapurdnam ; and the small book on morals known as Verri ~ 
verkai or Narundogai is simple enough to be followed by children, 
for whom it is meant. A contemporary of this royal author was* 
Serai Kavirajapillai who wrote Tirukkdlatti-nddar-kattalaikkalit- 
turai-mdlai on the deity of Kalahasti at the request of the king;, 
other works of Kavirajapillai were Tirukkalatti-nddar-idd , Tiruv - 
annamaliyar-vannam , Seyur-Murugan-ula and Rattinagiri-ula. All 
the poems are marked by elegant diction and deep religious feeling. 
Varatungarama Pandya, a cousin of Ativirarama, was also a 
litterateur with varied interests; his three andadis on the Siva shrine 
at Karuvai, i.e. Karivalam-vandanallur in Tinnevelly district, take 
high rank as pure literature: one of them employs ten metres and 
is called Padirruppattandadi ; and the others are known from their 
metres as Venbavandadi and Kalitturai-andadi. His Piramottira- 
kandam is a theological poem in twelve adhydyas of 1,310 verses on 
religious subjects. He also translated into Tamil the work on 
erotics known as Kokkoha after the name of the composer of the 
Sanskrit original. In the first half of the seventeenth century r 
Kandasami Pulavar (1621) of Tiruppuvanam wrote an Ula on the 
local Saiva shrine and a Purana on Tiruvappanur. More famous, 
was Andakakkavi Viraraghava Mudaliyar, pupil of Kacciyappasiva 
of Kandapuranam and author of a Purana and an Ula on 
Tirukkalukkunram, an Ula on Tiruvarur and other works of the 
same type; he also wrote some poems no longer extant in praise 
of patrons and rulers, such as a pillaittamil on Vittinar Ammai- 
yappan of Seyur, a \annam on Pararajasinghan of Ceylon and an 
Ula on the ruler of Kayattar, i.e. Madai Tiruvengadanathar men- 
tioned above as the author of Prabodacandrodayam. 

Other famous authors of the period of Tirumalai Nayaka were 
Kumaragurupara and Tiraimangalam Sivaprakasar. The former 
was bom at Srlvaikuntham, had his initiation at the hands of 
Masilamani Desika — the fourth in succession to the headship of

the matha at Dharmapuram — and spent a good part of his life 
in Northern India conducting disputations with rival sectarians 
including Muslims. He is said to have performed miracles, met 
the Mughal emperor and received from him a gift of land in 
Benares for the erection of a temple and a matha. Born a mute, 
he gained the power of speech in his sixth year by the grace of the 
deity of Tiruccendur and celebrated him in his first poem Kandar- 
kali-venba. His other literary productions included Kayilaikkalam- 
bakam on the deity (Siva) of his birthplace which was also called 
Kailasam; a pillaittamil , and irattaimani-mdlai on the goddess 
Minakshi of Madura; Maduraikkalambakam, a work of 102 stanzas 
celebrating Chokkalinga (Siva), the deity of Madura, and his 
sports; Tiruvarur-nanmani-malai , forty verses in four metres on 
Tyagaraja (Siva) of Tiruvarur; a pillaittamil on Muttukumarasvami 
(Muruga) of Vaidisvarankovil; Kasikkalambakam and other devo- 
tional works. His Sakalakald-valli-mdlai , in praise of Sarasvati, 
the goddess of learning, in ten verses, is said to have been composed 
during his residence at Benares for gaining proficiency in Hindus- 
tani to meet and converse with the emperor of Delhi. He also 
wrote Cidambaracceyyutkdvai , a work on Tamil prosody, which 
defines and illustrates the different metres; and the Nltinerivilakkam , 
comprising 102 venbas on ethical conduct, written at the request 
of Tirumalai Nayaka who asked for an abstract of the contents, 
of the Kural for his guidance. 

Sivaprakasar is associated with Turaimangalam as he accepted 
the friendship and patronage of Annamalai Reddi of that place. 
Born in Kanchipuram, Sivaprakasar had his education under Velji- 
yambalavana Tambiran of Tinnevelly; he spent some time with 
Annamalai Reddi both on his way to Tinnevelly and back; patron 
and protege were alike Vira-saivas by persuasion, but the poet at 
any rate was no fanatic, as among his thirty works there are many 
that show his deep knowledge of and regard for the philosophy 
of Saiva-siddhanta and for the four Samayacaryas of Tamil Saivism 
and their works. He is said to have met a Christian missionary 
for a disputation, (this could not have been Father Beschi as is. 
often stated), and to have composed a polemic refuting the Chris- 
tian creed — Esumada-nirdkaranam , no longer extant. Besides 
devotional poems on the deities of Tiruccendur, Tiruvengai (near 
Turaimangalam), Tiruvannamalai and other places, he wrote the 
Prabhulinga-lilai , a translation from a Kannada original on the

sports of Allamadeva, an incarnation of Siva honoured of the Vira- 
saivas; it is a long poem in 25 sections containing 1,157 stanzas. 
It bears the date 1652. Other notable works of the author are: 
Siddhantasikhamani , a VIra-saiva manual, translated from Sanskrit; 
Vedanta-cudamanU a translation of a Kannada version of a portion 
of Vivekacudamani of Sankaracarya ; Tarukkaparipadai , a trans- 
lation of the Sanskrit manual Tarkaparibhashd ; and Nanneri, a 
short work on ethics in forty venbas. Sivaprakasar remained a 
bachelor to his death at the early age of thirty-two. 

To the first half of the fifteenth century has been assigned an 
important anthology, Purattirattu , which followed the Kural in the 
selection and arrangement of topics and sections, and brought 
together perhaps 2,000 verses and more from all works in the 
language to the date of the anthology; no work later than 
Kamban’s seems to have found a place in it. Its last part, on Love, 
has not been recovered except in an abstract of 65 poems. Many 
poems no longer accessible were known to the anonymous compiler 
of the anthology. 

Among works of grammar composed in this period, after Nambi 
Ahapporul , already mentioned, we have the Cidambarappattiyal by 
Paranjoti, the son of Tirumalai-nathan (1508) of the Cidambara- 
puranam ; the pattiyal explains the conventions governing the com- 
position of different types of Prabandhas. Another work on the 
same subject was the Navanitappattiyal of Navanlta-natan which 
has evoked a very valuable commentary. Next may be placed a 
fragmentary and anonymous work based on the Kalaviyal or Ahap- 
porul of Iraiyanar, and named Kalaviyar-kdrigai for that reason by 
the editor of this precious fragment, Mr. S. Vaiyapuri; the work, 
more particularly its commentary, is valuable for its numerous 
citations from many otherwise unknown authors and works. 
Maran-Alankaram by Kurugai Perumal Kavirayar (c. 1575) is a 
work on rhetoric which cites many earlier writers and incidentally 
celebrates Maran, i.e. Nammalvar. The author wrote also the 
Tirukkuruga-manmiyam , a sthalapuranam on Alvar-Tirunagari, the 
birthplace of Nammalvar. The Ilakkanavilakkam of Vaidyanatha 
Desikar of Tiruvarur belongs to the first half of the seventeenth 
century and is rightly celebrated as Kuttit-Tolkappiyam , as it is 
like the Tolkappiyam , a complete exposition of the entire range of 
Tamil grammar. It is said to have grown out of the lessons given 
by the author to the children of Madai Tiruvengadanathar, already

noticed as ruler of Kayattar under Tirumalai Nayaka. Desikar 
also composed devotional works like Pasavadaip-parani and the 
extensive Nallurp-purdnam of over 1,000 verses. 

The period 1200-1650 was also the age of many celebrated com- 
mentators whose work is important enough to find a place even 
in a short sketch of Tamil literary history. The dates of many of 
them cannot be ascertained accurately though there is good reason 
to assign all of them to this period. The commentaries of Mayilai- 
nathar on Nannul and of Perundevanar on Vira-sdUyam , both 
works of grammar, were among the earliest. Then came the gloss 
of Adiyarkkunallar on Silappadikaram, a very learned and eloquent 
commentary remarkable for its extensive and instructive citations 
from numerous old works now lost. Senavaraiyar on the sol 
section of Tolkappiyam and Parimeialagar on Rural may be placed 
next. The latter’s comment on Rural now recognized as the best 
is said to have been preceded by nine other commentaries; however 
that may be, Parimeialagar is at once learned, concise and clear; 
he often traces the ideas of the Rural to their sources in Sanskrit 
or helps one to do so. He is said to have been a native of Madura, 
and is therefore probably different from the homonymous annotator 
of Paripadal who belonged to Kanchl and was a Vaishnava by 
faith. Perasiriyar and Naccinarkkiniyar were other great com- 
mentators. The former elucidated Tolkappiyam and 380 out of 
the 400 poems in the Rurundogai, a Sangam anthology. The latter 
completed the gloss on Rurundogai , and also annotated the Tolkap - 
piyam , Pattuppdttu , Ralittogai and Jivakacintamani. The anonymous 
commentaries on the Sangam anthologies of Purananuru, Padirrup - 
pattu and Aingurunuru must also have been written sometime in 
this period. So also the commentary on Purapporulvenbamalai by 
Chamundi-devanayakan. Tirumenikkavirayar, born in Tentirup- 
perai in Tinnevelly district, was a contemporary of Tirumalai 
Nayaka; he wrote a commentary of Maran-Alankaram , and a 
prose abstract of the Rural known as Tirukkural-nun-porulmalai ; 
a similar work based on Tolkappiyam attributed to him is not now 
available. The importance of the commentaries is twofold: they 
are almost the only considerable prose works in Tamil; and they 
mention many authors, works and historical and social facts that 
we have no other means of knowing. 

In lexicography, the most popular lexicon Nigandu-cudamani 
was composed by a Jaina author by name Mandalapurusha, most 



382 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


probably in the reign of Krishnadeva Raya of Vijayanagar whose 
name figures prominently in the lexicon. The work follows the 
scheme of Divakaram , but is written in verse instead of in the form 
of Sutras. Then came the Agaradi-nigandu (1594) of Chidambara 
Revana Siddar, a Vira-saiva, the first to attempt an alphabetical 
arrangement of the words treated; the first word (, agarddi ) in the 
name of the work meaning ‘ alphabetic order ’ has since come to 
mean a dictionary. The Kayadaram (c. 1550) of a Brahmin author, 
Kayadarar by name, cited in Maran-Alankaram , and the Uriccol- 
.nigandu , a short lexicon by a certain &aiva author named Gangeyan 
(early seventeenth century), are also worth noting. 

Tamilakara-munivan of Tinnevelly set forth portions of religious 
law from Sanskrit in two Tamil works called Prayaccitta-samuc- 
cayam (1633) and Asaucadipikai ; their names show that they dealt 
respectively with penances for sin and pollution due to death. He 
.also wrote other works like Nitisaram and Nellaitiruppani-mdlai . 
Much more interesting is the anonymous ballad Ramappayyan- 
ammanai, giving an account of the wars of a general of Tirumalai 
Nayaka, which belongs to a class of works of which few specimens 
have survived. 


Kannada 

Among South Indian languages, after Tamil, Kannada possesses 
the oldest literature. Its beginnings are not clearly traceable, but 
a considerable volume of prose and poetry must have come into 
existence before the date of Nripatunga’s Kavirajamdrga (850), the 
earliest extant work on rhetoric in Kannada. In that work the 
Kannada country is said to have extended from the Kaveri to the 
Godavari, and thus included much territory in the north where 
now Marathi is the spoken language. The district round about 
Puligere was held to be the well of pure Kannada undefiled. 
Durvinlta, mentioned in the same book as one of the best writers 
of Kannada prose, might well have been the Ganga monarch of 
the sixth century. Another early writer was the celebrated Sri- 
vardhadeva, also called Tumubuluracarya from the place of his 
birth; his Cudamani, a commentary on the Tattvartha-mahasastra , 
in 96,000 verses, was known to the great Kannada grammarian 
Bhattakalanka (1604) who calls it the greatest work in the language. 
Another writer of this early period (c. 650) was Syamakundacarya. 
Both these deary as, like most early Kannada writers, were Jains. 


LITERATURE 


383 


The Kavirdjamarga is based in part on Dandin’s Kavyadarsa , and 
must have been inspired if not actually composed by the Rashtra- 
kuta emperor Nripatunga Amoghavarsha I, its ostensible author. 
But the first extant work of real literature is the Vaddaradhane of 
£ivakoti (c. a.d. 900), a prose work on the lives of the older Jaina 
•saints, written mostly in the oldest Kannada style called purva - 
Mla-kannada. Then we have Pampa, who came of a family from 
Vengi and flourished in the court of a feudatory of Rashtrakuta 
Krishna III, Arikesari II of Vemulavada. Pampa is said to have 
composed two great poems at the relatively early age of thirty-nine 
(941). His Adipurdna narrates the life-story of the first Jaina 
Tirthankara; the other work, Vikramarjuna Vijaya , contains the 
.author’s own version of the Mahabharata story, and is called 
Pampa- Bharata on that account; the poet makes Arjuna the hero 
of the poem and identifies him with his patron Arikesari and intro- 
duces into the narrative many interesting details of contemporary 
history. Critics have unanimously hailed Pampa as the most 
eminent among Kannada poets. Pampa’s junior contemporary 
was Ponna whose principal work is the Sdntipurana , the legendary 
history of the sixteenth Tirthankara. He wrote also the Bhuvanai- 
, karamdbhyudaya now known only from citations in later works, 
.and the Jinaksharamale, 4 an acrostic poem in praise of the Jinas \ 
His family also had its origin in Vengi. He got the title Ubhaya- 
Jcavicakravarti, 4 supreme poet in two languages (Sanskrit and 
JCannada) ’ from Krishna III. 

Ranna, who, with Pampa and Ponna, completes ‘ the Three 
<}ems ’ who usher in Kannada literature in full panoply, adorned 
the court of the Chalukya king Taila II and his successor. Bom 
in 949 of a family of bangle-sellers in Muduvolal, Ranna rose to 
■the rank of Kavicakravarti (poet-laureate) in the Chalukya court 
and enjoyed the honours of the golden rod, chauri, elephant and 
umbrella. His Ajitapvrana (993) is a Campu in twelve asvasas on 
the life of the second Tirthankara. The poem was written at the 
request of Attimabbe, the pious wife of general Nagavarma, who 
survived her husband for some years and promoted the cause of 
Jainism in many ways. The Sahasabhimavijaya or Gadayuddha 
f(982) is also a Campu of ten asvasas which reviews the story of the 
Mahabharata with particular reference to the last fight with clubs 
*(gadd) between Bhlma and Duryodhana, as well as the wars and 
achievements of Irivabedanga Satyasraya on whom the poet confers 



384 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


the title Sahasa-bhima (‘ daring Bhlma ’)• Two other works of 
Ranna — Parasurama-carita and Cakresvara-carita are no longer 
extant; and a lexicon Ranna Kanda in which the verses generally 
end with kaviratna may well be his production also. 

Chavundaraya, one of Ranna’s early patrons, was a feudatory 
of Ganga Racamalla IV who conferred on him the title Raya for 
his haying set up the colossus of Gommatesvara at Sravana Belgola. 
He composed in 978 the Cavundaraya-purana or Trishashti - 
lakshanamahapurana , one of the earliest extant prose works in 
Kannada, treating of the legends of twenty-four Tirthankaras, 
twelve Cakravartis , nine Balabhadras, nine Narayanas and nine 
Pratinarayanas, sixty-three in all. Nagavarma I was another 
protege of Chavundaraya, and like him, a pupil of Ajitasena. He 
came of a Brahmin family which like Pampa’s came from the Vengi 
country. His Chandombudhi , 6 ocean of prosody % addressed by 
the author to his wife, is the earliest work on the subject in 
Kannada. The Karnataka- Kadambari is a Campu based on Bana’s 
prose romance in Sanskrit; its sweet and flowing style is valued 
highly by critics. 

The next writer of note was Durgasimha, a Brahmin £aiva 
minister under Jayasimha II Jagadekamalla; his Pahcatantra is a 
Campu professedly based on Gunadhya’s Brihatkatha; it is a 
learned work perhaps too full of sound jingles (prasa ) to suit 
modern taste. Durgasimha mentions many of his predecessors 
and contemporaries. Among the latter was Chandraraja, a Brah- 
min polyhistor of the Vajigotra, whose Madanatilaka , a Campu in 
eighteen adhikaranas , is a work on erotics in the form of a dialogue 
between his patron and his wife; the author claims that he has 
used the most modem language of his time ( posa-kannada ). 
Another Brahmin Advaita Saiva protege of Jayasimha was Chavun- 
daraya, author of Lokopakdra (a.d. 1025), a guide to daily life, a 
cyclopaedic miscellany in good verse on various subjects such as 
astronomy and astrology, sculpture, construction of buildings, 
omens, divination of water, medicinal herbs and their uses, scents, 
cookery and toxicology. Sridharacarya, a Jaina Brahmin, showed 
his capacity for scientific writing (sdstrakavitva) in his Jdtaka-tilaka 
(1049), the earliest work on astrology in Kannada, and his capacity 
in belles lettres (kavya kavitva ) in his Candraprabhacarite , no longer 
extant. The Advaiti Nagavarmacarya, patronized by Ganga 
Udayaditya (1070), a feudatory of Somesvara II at Banavase, was 


LITERATURE 


385 


the author of Candracudamani-sataka , a centum of easy verses in 
mattebha metre on the ethics of renunciation. 

The next great writer was Nagachandra (c. 1105) a Jain and a 
man of means who built the Mallinatha Jinalaya dedicated to the 
nineteenth Tirthankara at Bijapur and also wrote the Mallinatha - 
purana, a Campu. But Nagachandra is best known for his Rama - 
candra-caritapurana which gives the Jaina version of the Rama 
legend in a Campu of sixteen sections, the story proper beginning 
only with the third. The poem was a necessary complement to 
the Bharata of Pampa, and earned for its author the title Abhinava 
(new) Pampa. The story differs in many ways from Valmlki’s; 
Rama gets the Jinadiksha , becomes a Jaina ascetic and attains 
Nirvana at the end. To the first quarter of the twelfth century 
belong also a Jaina polemic Samayaparikshe of Brahmasiva which 
seeks to establish the superiority of Jainism over all other creeds, 
and the Govaidya of Kirttivarma, a work on veterinary science, 
half-medicine and half-magic. Round about 1145, Karnaparya 
wrote the life of the twenty-second Tirthankara in his Nemindtha - 
purana , a Campu in fourteen dsvasas in which the story of Krishna 
and the Mahdbharata are also cleverly worked in. To the same 
time belongs Nagavarma II, the author of Kavyavalokana , an 
important work on the grammar and rhetoric of Kannada in five 
sections; it takes the form of Sutras in verse illustrated by examples 
from literature. Another work of Nagavarma on grammar is the 
Karndtakabhashabhushana ; here the Sutras and a short explanation 
are both in Sanskrit, while the illustrations come from Kannada 
literature. The Vastukosa, a third work of Nagavarma II, is a 
relatively short lexicon of 800 granthas , giving Kannada equivalents 
of Sanskrit terms. Nagavarma was Katakopadhyaya (camp- 
teacher) under Jagadekamalla II, whom he survived for many 
years, becoming the teacher of poet Janna (c. 1209). Udayadityd - 
lankdra ( c . 1150) is a short work on the art of poetry based on 
Dandin’s Kavyadarsa by a Chola prince whose name it bears. A 
work on medicine, Pujyapada’s Kalyanakaraka, was translated from 
Sanskrit into Kannada at this time by a Jaina author Jagaddala 
Somanatha; ‘the treatment it prescribes is entirely vegetarian and 
non-alcoholic.’ Rajaditya (1190), a Jain of Puvinabage, showed 
great skill in reducing to easy verse the mathematical subjects he 
dealt with in several ganita works like Vyavahara-ganita , Kshetra - 
ganita and LildvatL

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Most of the writers so far mentioned were Jains, and it may be 
well to continue and complete the account of Jaina authors before 
turning to those of the two other classes, Vlra-saivas and 
Yaishnavas, who began to influence Kannada literature from the 
twelfth and fifteenth centuries respectively. 

Jaina writers continued to flourish under the later Hoysalas, and 
the lives of the Tirthankaras formed the theme of many Puranas 
in the form of Campus. Nemichandra, court-poet under Vira 
Ballala, wrote the Lilavatl , a plain romance with Banavase as its 
scene of action, where a prince and princess dream of each other, 
meet after delays, and are wedded to live happily for ever. Nemi- 
chandra undertook to write the Neminathapurdna , at the instance 
of Ballala’s minister, but died before completing it, and the work 
came to be known as Ardha Nemi , 4 unfinished (life of) Nemi \ 
Janna was not only a poet but a minister and a builder of temples; 
he wrote the Yasodharacarite (1209), the story of a king who was 
about to sacrifice two boys to Mariamma, but on hearing their 
story gave up the idea, released them and abandoned the practice 
of sacrificing live victims. The Anantandthapurana (1230) on the 
life of the fourteenth Tirthankara was also his work; his style is 
noted for its dignity and grace. Bandhuvarma, a vaisya , wrote 
the Harivamsabhyudaya and JIva Sambodhana. The latter is a 
work on morals and renunciation in the form of an address to the 
soul. A new form of composition, sangatya , meant to be sung to 
the accompaniment of a musical instrument, was introduced by 
Sisumayana (c. 1232) who wrote two works in this style — Anjana- 
carita and Tripura-dahana; the latter is an allegorical poem on the 
destruction of the triple fortress of Birth, Decay and Death. 
Andayya’s Madana Vijaya (Triumph of Cupid), composed about 
1235, is remarkable for its total avoidance of assimilated Sanskrit 
words (i tatsamas ), limiting itself to indigenous (desya) and natural- 
ized Sanskrit ( tadbhava ) words; the experiment was not continued 
by later authors. The story of the poem is that Siva imprisoned 
the moon, and Cupid, in his anger, assailed Siva with his arrows 
and was cursed by him to be separated from his bride; he con- 
trived, however, to free himself of the curse and rejoin his bride. 
The work is known by other names— Kdvana Gella (‘ Victory of 
Kama’), Kabbigara Kava (‘Poets’ Defender’), and Sobagina 
Suggi (‘ Harvest of Beauty ’). A brother-in-law of Janna was 
Mallikaijuna (c. 1245), an ascetic who compiled an anthology 



LITERATURE 


387 


Sukti-sudharnava , which arranges extracts from many works 
under eighteen topical headings, of which only fifteen have yet been 
found. Kesiraja (c. 1260), the son of Mallikarjuna, was the author 
of Sabdamanidarpana Mirror of Word-jewels ’), the standard 
grammar of Kannada. The rules are set forth in kanda metre 
and followed by a prose commentary by the author himself; like 
other works of its class it refers to the usage of writers of repute 
and is of high scientific and historical value to the student of the 
language. Kumudendu ( c . 1275) wrote a Rdmayana according to 
Jaina tradition in shatpadi metre; the work was largely influenced 
by the Pampa Rdmayana already noticed. Other works of note 
produced under the Hoysalas were: Ratta-Mdla or Rattasutra 
(c. 1300) of Ratta-kavi, treating of ‘ natural phenomena such as 
rain, earthquakes, lightning, planets and omens ’ ; Punyasrava 
(c. 1331) of Nagaraja, a Campu containing fifty-two tales of 
Puranic heroes said to be translated from Sanskrit for the guidance 
of house-holders; and a work on toxicology, Khagendra-mani - 
darpana (c. 1360), by Mangaraja I. 

In the Age of Vijayanagar (1336-1650) the Jains were being 
steadily pushed out by the rising influence of Saivas of different 
schools and Vaishnavas; yet they continued to write in Kannada 
on the lives of TIrthankaras and other holy persons. Madhura 
(1385), patronized by ministers of Harihara II and Devaraya I, 
wrote Dharmanathapurana on the fifteenth Tirthankara and a 
short poem in praise of Gommatesvara of Sravana Belgola ; his style 
resembled that of the earlier Jaina poets. There was also Vritta 
Vilasa, author of Dharmaparikshe , a Kannada version of a Sanskrit 
original of the same name by Amitagati, and Sastrasara , both 
works of quasi-religious import. The life of Jlvandhararaja was a 
favourite subject and was handled three times over in shatpadi 
metre by Bhaskara of Penugonda (1424), Bommarasa of Terka- 
nambi (c. 1485) and Kotesvara of Tuluvadesa (c. 1500). Bahubali 
of Sringeri ( c . 1560) narrated the story of Naga-Kumara who 
despised riches and took to a religious life. 

Jainism flourished in the Tuluva country more than anywhere 
olse in this period, when two colossal Jaina statues were erected — 
one at Karkala in 1431 and the other at Yenur in 1603. Accord- 
ingly we have four authors from that country. First was Abhinava 
Vadi Vidyananda of Gersoppa, an able champion of Jainism in 
public debates at Vijayanagar and many provincial capitals; in 



i 


388 A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 

1533 he compiled the Kdvyasara , an anthology with forty-five 
different heads, similar to, but much more useful than, Mallikar- 
juna’s Sukti-sudharnava, as he gives the names of many of the poets 
of the period 900-1430. Salva (c. 1550), court-poet of a petty 
prince of Konkan, produced a Jaina version of the Bhdrata , in 
shatpadi in sixteen parvas ; this was perhaps meant to be a rival 
to the Krishna Raya Bhdrata which had completed the Vaishnava 
version about 1510. Ratnakara-varni, a Kshatriya of Mudabidire, 
wrote a number of works; his Trilokasara (1557) is an account of 
Jaina cosmogony; the Aparajita-sataka treats of philosophy, morals 
and renunciation; the Bharatesvara-carita gives the story of the 
legendary emperor Bharata, the son of the first Tlrthankara who 
turned Jaina ascetic. Many songs by this author are still current 
among Jains and are known as Annagalapada, ‘ songs of the 
brothers’. Nemanna’s Jhana-bhdskara-carite (1559) exalts medi- 
tation and study as means of emancipation above rites and 
austerities. 

Lastly may be mentioned a poet of uncertain date assigned by 
some to c. 1400, Ayata-varma whose Ratna-karandaka , a Campu 
translated from Sanskrit, treats of ‘ the beliefs and duties of the 
Jains under the heads of the three Jaina “ jewels ’’—right belief,, 
right knowledge, and right conduct \ 

After the Jains, the Vlra-saivas did most for the development 
of Kannada language and literature; they wrote many religious 
works in Kannada and showed a decided preference for the prose 
medium. Basava and his contemporaries (twelfth century) brought 
into existence the Vacana literature in simple prose easily under- 
stood by the common folk and well calculated to popularize the 
new creed. There were over two hundred writers, many women 
among them, with Mahadeviyakka at their head. E. P. Rice char- 
acterizes their work thus: * In form the Vacanas are brief discon- 
nected paragraphs, each ending with one or another of the 
numerous local names under which Siva is worshipped. In style 
they are epigrammatical, parallelistic and allusive. They dwell on 
the vanity of riches, the valuelessness of mere rites or book-learn- 
ing, the uncertainty of life, and the spiritual privileges of the 
Sivabhakta. They call upon men to give up the desire for worldly 
wealth and ease, to live lives of sobriety and detachment from the 
world, and to turn to Siva for refuge. They are seldom contro- 
versial, but almost entirely hortatory, devotional, and expository. 


LITERATURE 


389 


They are still recited by Lingayat acdryas for the instruction of 
their followers/ Some of the Vacanas have a section called Kala- 
jhana , a messianic forecast of the future, speaking of the arrival 
of an ideal king, Vira Vasanta Raya, who would rebuild Kalyani 
and restore the Lingayat religion to its full glory. The Vacanas 
often bear the mudras (marks in set phrases) of their authors. 

Besides Basava himself, to whom six works of this type are 
attributed, and his nephew Chenna Basava, special mention must 
be made of two groups of highly honoured teachers and writers. 
First the ‘ three panditas ’ — Mancanna known as Sivalenka (body- 
guard of Siva), Sripati Pandita, and Mallikarjuna Panditaradhya; 
and the * five deary as * — Revana Siddha or Renukacarya of Kolli- 
paka, Manila Siddha of Kollapura, Panditaradhya just mentioned 
as one of the three panditas , Ekorami Tande, and Visvesvaracarya. 
They were either contemporaries of Basava or lived a little before 
or after him. 

This period forms a definite transition marked by some notable 
changes in Kannada language and literature. The letter la tends 
to disappear giving place to la y and pa in particular positions 
changes into ha. The Campu form of composition goes out of 
use, and new metres distinctive of Kannada like shatpadi and 
tripadi , verses with six and three lines respectively, and ragales , 
lyrical poems with refrains, come into vogue. 

We may now notice the chief Lingayat writers other than the 
authors of Vacanas. The first is Harisvara, who came of a family 
of Karanikas (accountants) of Halebid and was a contemporary of 
Hoysala Narasimha I (1152-73). He spent several years at Hampi, 
and among his works is Pampdsataka , a centum of verses in praise 
of Virupaksha of Hampi. His Girijd-kalyana is still in the old 
style of Jaina works, a Campu of ten sections on the marriage of 
Siva and Parvati. His Siva-ganada-ragalegalu has all the char- 
acteristics of the new school which starts with him; it treats of 
the lives of the sixty-three saints of early 3aivism, of Basava and 
other devotees. A nephew and disciple of Harisvara was Ragha- 
vanka, a native of Hampi, who was the first to use shatpadi metre. 
His Hariscandra-kavya, though very good as poetry, contains 
several desya words and occasionally violates the strict rules of 
grammar. The Sdmanatha-carite , giving the life of Somayya of 
Puligere, and the Siddharama-purdna on the life of Siddharama of 
Sonnalige are works of Lingayat hagiology. The Harihara-mahatva 



390 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


is in praise of Harisvara of Hampi. Other works attributed to 
him are Viresvara-carita and Sarabha-caritra. Kereya Padmarasa 
held office under Narasimha I and got his title by constructing 
the Belur tank. He was called from his retirement to meet an 
itinerant Telugu Brahmin preacher of Vaishnavism who as the 
result of the contest had to accept the Saiva creed. Padmarasa 
wrote the Diksha-bodhe , a work of r agates in dialogue form in 
which a guru instructs his disciple in the faith, citing Sanskrit 
verses in support of the true doctrine. Padmarasa became the 
hero of a Padmarajapurana written by one of his descendants 
(c. 1385). Though Raghavanka and Padmarasa were contem- 
poraries of Basava, neither of them makes any reference to 
him. Palkuriki Somanatha born at Palkuriki in the Godavari 
district, was the author of several works on Vira-saivism 
in Telugu and Kannada. Legend credits him with victory in 
many contests with other sectarians, particularly Vaishnavas, and 
final mukti at Kailasa. His life became the subject of a Purana by 
Tontadarya (c. 1560). He was a great admirer of Basava and his 
Telugu Basava-purana was used by Bhlma Kavi (1369) when he 
wrote a Kannada work of the same name. Somanatha’s chief 
works in Kannada are Silasampadane, Sahasragananama , and 
Pahcaratna , besides several ragales and Vacanas. Somesvara - 
sataka , a popular work on moral subjects, was perhaps the work 
of a contemporary and namesake of Somanatha from Puhgere. 
Two works of romance belonging to this period are the Kusumdvali 
of Deva-kavi ( c . 1200) which resembles Llldvatl of Nemichandra 
in its story, and Sringarasara of Somaraja (1222), also called 
Udbhatakavya as it has Udbhata, a ruler of Gersoppa, for its hero. 

The Lingayat literature of the Vijayanagar period (1336-1650) 
falls under two heads — stories of reformers and devotees, and 
expositions of doctrine. The Basava-purana of Bhlmakavi, an 
Aradhya-Brahmin, completed in 1369, is an important and a very 
popular work on hagiology. Written in shatpadi metre, it treats 
of Basava as an incarnation of Nandi, specially sent to re-establish 
Vlra-saiva faith on earth, and dwells at great length on the miracles 
performed by Basava in his life-time. Another account of Basava’s 
life written about 1500 is Mala-Basava-raja-carita of Singiraja, also 
known as Singirajapurana, recounting the eighty-eight miracles of 
Basava and giving particulars of his opponents at Bijjala’s court. 
Prabhulinga, also called Allama-prabhu, an associate of Basava, is 



LITERATURE 


391 


the hero of Prabhulinga-lile of Chamarasa, an Aradhya-Brahmin 
poet of the court of (Praudha) Devaraya II (1422-46). Prabhulinga 
is here regarded as an incarnation of Ganapati, and Parvati is said 
to have taken the form of a princess of Banavase to test the strength 
of his detachment from the world. The work is said to have been 
read out to Devaraya who caused it to be translated into Telugu 
and Tamil. Chamarasa held disputations with Vaishnavas in the 
king’s presence and was a rival of Kumara Vyasa, the author of 
the Kannada Bharata. Over a century later came Virupaksha 
Pandita (1584), author of Cenna-Basava-purana. The hero, Cenna 
Basava, is regarded as an incarnation of Siva for the instruction of 
Siddharama of Sonnalige in the entire Saiva lore including stories 
of saints. The popular Purana identifies the messianic Vira 
Vasanta Raya with the contemporary ruler Venkatapati Raya of 
Vijayanagar, who, in some of his inscriptions styles himself ‘ Lord 
of Kalyanapura ’, though with little justification. There are also 
lives of many dcaryas and purdtanas (elders). Panditaradhya and 
Revana Siddha were the most popular among the dcaryas , and 
became heroes of many works. 

In the literature of the doctrine, several works were produced 
under Devaraya II who had two zealous Lingayat ministers. One 
was Lakkanna who wrote the Siva-tattva-cintamani , a treatise on 
the tenets and rites of the sect. The other, Jakkanarya, not only 
wrote a work entitled Nurondusthala (hundred and one topics), 
but liberally patronized other scholars like Kumarabanka-natha 
and Mahalinga-deva. An eminent guru of the time was Guru 
Basava, author of seven works, Sapta-kavya , six in shatpadi metre 
expounding aspects of the doctrine in the form of dialogues between 
teacher and pupil, and the Avadhutagite — * Songs in Praise of 
Detachment ’. There were also one hundred and one teaching 
jangamas of whom several wrote Vacanas and works on the 
doctrine. Acute rivalry between Lingayats and Vaishnavas led to 
‘organized processions through the town in honour of the books 
of their respective faiths ’. Out of this rivalry also arose the 
Praudharayacarita of Adrisya (c. 1595), stories of Saiva saints 
narrated by Jakkanarya to Devaraya II to divert his mind from 
the Brahminical version of the Bharata . 

A famous teacher of the time of Virupaksha (1465-85) was 
Tontada Siddhesvara or Siddalinga-yati, who practised Siva-yoga 
for a long time in a garden and came to be known on that account

as tontada , of the garden. A matha and a temple mark the place 
of his burial at Yediyur, near Kunigal. He wrote a prose work of 
700 Vacanas called Shatsthala-Jnanamrita, and had many disciples 
who wrote similar works. Virakta Tontadarya (c. 1560) composed 
the Siddhesvara-purana on the life of his teacher. Nijaguna-siva- 
yogi, at first a petty ruler. of the territory round &ambhulinga hill 
near Yelandur and afterwards Siva-yogi, was a prolific writer who 
employed tripadi , sdngatya , ragale and prose in his works. Notable 
among them are a commentary on the Sanskrit work £iva-yoga- 
pradipika meant for those who cannot read Sanskrit and desire 
emancipation, and Viveka-cintamani , a cyclopaedia of ‘ Sanskrit 
terms and Vira-saiva lore \ Mailanarya of Gubbi lived in the 
reign of Krishnadeva Raya (1509-29) and wrote both in Kannada 
and Sanskrit. His chief works in Kannada were: Bhdva-cintaratna 
(1513), said to be based on a Tamil work of Nanasambandar; 
Satyendra-chola-kathe , the story of a Chola king to illustrate the 
power of the sacred mantra of five letters of the £aivas; and 
Virasaivamrita (1530), describing twenty-five sports of &iva and 
giving the lives of the saints, old and new. Viruparaja (1519), 
author of a sdngatya work on the life of king Cheramanka, a 
puratana, and his son Vlrabhadra-raja who wrote five Satakas on 
Vira-saiva doctrine and morals were other writers of the period. 
Towards the close of it came Sarvajnamurti whose Sarvajhapadagalu 
is in tripadi metre: about a thousand of these padas are current 
and treat of religion, morals and society, in much the same manner 
as the sayings of Vemana in Telugu or Namdev and Tukaram in 
Marathi. Like them he exalted sincerity in life above externals 
such as the worship of idols, pilgrimages and rituals. 

The earliest writer of note on Vaishnava topics in Kannada was 
Rudra-bhatta, a Smarta Brahmin of the time of Vira Ballala 
(1173-1220). His Jagannatha-vijaya is a Campu on the life of 
Krishna up to his fight with Banasura and based on the Vishnu - 
purdna. In 1281 Narahari-tirtha, third in succession from Madhva, 
composed songs in praise of Vishnu. But the Vaishnava move- 
ment began to exert a strong influence on Kannada literature only 
from the time of Krishnadeva Raya. And this new Vaishnava 
literature in the form of translations of Sanskrit classics also marks 
the transition from medieval to modern Kannada. The first ten 
parvas (sections) of the Mahdbhdrata had been translated by 
Naranappa, a Brahmin author, who had the title Kumara Vyasa 


LITERATURE 


393 


and was a rival of Chamarasa in the reign of Devaraya II; his 
work, dedicated to the deity at Gadag, came to be known as 
Gadugina Bhdrata. The remaining parvas were translated in 1510 
by Timm anna who named his work after his patron Krishna-rdya 
Bhdrata. Then followed the Torave Rdmayana , so called because 
it was produced in Torave in Sholapur district. This is the first 
brahminical version of the story in Kannada and the author was 
Narahari who calls himself Kumara Valmiki; his date is not quite 
settled. Mention must also be made of the Jaimini Bhdrata of 
Lakshmlsa composed some time in the seventeenth century. A 
free rendering in shatpadi metre of a Sanskrit original ascribed to 
the legendary sage Jaimini, the work is ‘ esteemed alike by learned 
and unlearned, and universally studied ’. The subject is the wan- 
derings of the horse appointed for Yudhishthira’s horse-sacrifice, 
and thus corresponds to a portion of the Asvamedhaparva of the 
Mahabharata , though there is no correspondence in details. The 
Bhdgavata found its translator in Catu Vitthalanatha who flourished 
under Krishnadeva Raya and his successor Achyuta. He also 
wrote a fuller rendering of portions of the Mahabharata which had 
been greatly abridged by Kumara Vyasa — the Pauloma and Astika 
parvas . This was a great period not only for Kannada, but for 
other languages as well — Sanskrit, Telugu and Tamil. And not 
only Vaishnavas, but Lingayats and Jains, were patronized by 
Krishnadeva Raya and Achyuta. 

Popular songs in ragale metre by dasas (mendicant singers) was 
another form of Vaishnava literature in Kannada in this period. 
These singers got their inspiration from Madhvacarya and Vyasa- 
raya, and the visit of Chaitanya to the South in 1510 did much to 
stimulate the growth of this popular type of song. Purandara 
Dasa was * the earliest, most prolific and most famous ’ of these 
singers; he visited Vijayanagar in the reign of Achyuta Raya and 
died at Pandarpur in 1564; all his songs bear the imprint Puran- 
dara Vitthala. Kanakadasa of Kaginele in the Dharwar district 
was a contemporary of Purandara, who, like him, owed his 
adoption of a religious life to Vyasaraya, head of the Madhva 
matha at Sosile, himself a composer of lyrics in praise of Krishna. 
Besides songs in praise of Vishnu, Kanakadasa wrote Mohana 
Tarangim (‘ River of Delight ’) narrating stories ol Krishna in 
sdngatya , and two works in shatpadi — Nala-carita and Hari-bhakti- 
sara, the latter being a popular book of morals for children. 



394 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


A little poem of Kanakadasa called Rama-dhanya-caritre exalts rdgU 
the grain which above all other grains forms the staple food of a 
great part of Karnataka. Kanakadasa came of the caste of hunters 
( beda ) according to some accounts, and of shepherds ( kuruba ) 
according to others. There were many other dasas besides. 

This sketch of Kannada literature may close with the notice of 
some important works of the early seventeenth century. Most 
notable among them is the Karnataka Sabdanusasana (1604) of 
Bhattakajanka Deva, the most comprehensive grammar of Kannada 
in 592 Sanskrit Sutras with a gloss (vritti) and commentary 
( vyakhya ) in the same language. Its references to previous author- 
ities and citations from leading Kannada writers are of value to 
the student of the history of the language. The author was a Jain 
and was reputed to be learned in six languages. The re-consecra- 
tion of the Gommata statue at Sravana Belgola in 1612 was 
described by poet Pancabana of that town in his Bhujabalicaritra 
(1614). The Karkala image was rededicated in 1646 and itshistory 
and that of Gommata form the subject of Karkala-Gommatesvara- 
caritra of Chandrama of the Tuluva country. Bijjala-raja-caritra , 
giving the Jaina version of Basava’s life at Kalyana, and Jina-muni- 
tanaya on Jaina morals are other works of the period. 

Mention may also be made of collections of short stories the 
dates of which are not settled, but which came into existence about 
the sixteenth century — Battisa-puttali-kathe , Betala-panca-vimsati- 
kathe in the three forms of Campu, tripadi and prose, $uka-saptati> 
and so on. Tenali-Rdmakrishna-kathe is a collection of funny 
anecdotes of the famous court jester of the court of Krishnadeva 
Raya. 


Telugu 

In ancient times the Telugu country was often called Trilinga r 
the country which contained or was bounded by the three lingas 
of Kalahasti, Srisailam and Daksharama, and Telinga-Telugu 
as the name of the country and language may well be traced to 
this word. It is also suggested that Tel(n)ugu comes from tene y 
4 honey ’ or tennu , 4 way \ The beginnings of the language can be 
traced from stone inscriptions of the fifth and sixth century a.d., 
and its basic elements have unmistakable affinities with Tamil and 
Kannada. But, from the beginning, the literary idiom depended 
very largely upon Sanskrit and the Janasrayachandas 9 an early 


LITERATURE

work on prosody, fragments of which have recently come to light, 
though it includes some metres peculiar to Telugu and unknown 
to Sanskrit, is itself written in Sanskrit throughout; the author 
was most probably the Vishnukundin monarch Madhavavarman II 
(580-620), who had this title Janasraya. The inscriptions of the 
dynasty are in Sanskrit with an admixture of Prakrit and Telugu 
words. 

In the beginning Telugu had much in common with Kannada 
and this affinity persisted to a relatively late stage in the develop- 
ment of the two languages. Pampa and Ponna, two of the greatest 
Kannada poets, came from the Telugu country, and the great 
Telugu poet Srinatha styles himself a poet in Kamata-bhasha. 
Early Telugu prose and verse can now be traced only in inscrip- 
tions like those of the Telugu-Chodas and the Eastern Chalukyas; 
a well-developed verse in slsa metre adorns the grant of General 
Panduranga (845-6). Beyond doubt there must have existed much 
unwritten literature of a popular character which enlivened the 
daily life of the common folk; such desi compositions may have 
included lalipatalu (songs of the cradle), melukolupulu (songs of 
the dawn), mangala haratulu (songs of festivity), klrtanalu (devo- 
tional songs) and udupu patalu (songs of the harvest). 

Higher literature strongly influenced by Sanskrit was said to be 
in the marga style. Of this class no work earlier than the eleventh 
century has survived. The beginnings and early history of this 
type of writing can no longer be traced. Some are inclined to 
doubt the existence of a separate marga style altogether. 

Telugu literature as we know it begins with Nannaya’s transla- 
tion of the Mahabharata undertaken in the reign of Rajaraja 
Narendra (1019-61). Nannaya undertook the great work at the 
king’s instance and had for his assistant a certain Narayana Bhatta, 
also a talented poet, who was rewarded richly by the monarch. 
Rajaraja’s reign was a troubled time, and it is not known if the 
political troubles hampered the work of Nannaya. He was able 
to complete the translation of only two parvas (Adi and Sabha) 
and of a part of the third (Vana). The translation was not literal, 
and the poet allowed himself free scope for the exercise of his 
powers of imaginative creation; he set the model for later trans- 
lators. Nannaya’s vocabulary is dominated by Sanskrit, but he is 
never obscure; and the majesty of his diction induced Yerrapra- 
gada, another translator of the Mahabharata , to compare it to a 



396 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


noble elephant (bhadragaja). Nannaya was perhaps also author 
of Andhra-sabda-cin tdman i, the first Telugu grammar which syste- 
matized the language by standardizing words and their usage and 
earned for the author the title Vaganusasana , law-giver of the 
language. 

An eminent younger contemporary of Nannaya was Vemulavada 
Bhlma Kavi, associated by tradition with the Eastern Ganga 
emperor Anantavarman Chodaganga (1078-1148). He was the 
-author of Kavijandsraya , a Telugu grammar, and Bhimesvara 
Purdna relating legends of the shrine of Bhimesvara at Daksha- 
rama. He seems to have written also Raghava-Pandaviya , giving 
the story of both the Ramayana and Mahabharata together, the 
whole book being a sustained double entendre ; it is no longer extant. 
There is much uncertainty about the life and works of Bhlma Kavi 
who has become a centre of many myths and miracles. 

From the twelfth century VIra-saivism became an important 
factor in the religious life of the Telugus and a sectarian outlook 
became more and more common. The poets of the period were 
generally supporters and propagandists of this faith. Famous 
among them was Mallikarjuna Pandita, guru of Nanne Choda; his 
Siva-tattva-saram is an exposition of VIra-saivism in about five 
hundred verses. Nanne Choda, a Telugu-Choda prince, son of 
Chodaballi of Pakanadu, was the author of Kumarasambhava , a 
Mahakavya which has recently come to light; it is based on the 
Sanskrit works on the same theme by Kalidasa and Udbhata, and 
draws also upon the Saiva literature known to the author. Nanne 
Choda employed Kannada and Tamil words in his poetry, and 
he had a partiality for Kannada metres. The author’s style has 
not commanded universal praise. Atharvana, the grammarian, 
considered Nanne Choda as a poet who courted death by using 
inauspicious metres. Palkuriki Somanatha was a contemporary of 
Kakatlya Prataparudra II (1291-1330). Somanatha was a staunch 
Lingayat and a prolific writer in Sanskrit, Kannada and Telugu. 
He was an active pamphleteer and disputant in the cause of VIra- 
saivism. His major works in Telugu are Panditarddhya Car it a, 
Dvipada Basava Purdna and Anubhava Sara. The first was used 
by Srinatha when he wrote a work of the same name. Another 
Basava Purdna in Telugu verse was that of Piduparti Somanatha 
{1510). Palkuriki Somanatha’s Vrishddhipa Satakam , a centum of 
verses addressed to Basava, became very popular. 



LITERATURE 


397 


The translation of the Mahdbharata was resumed by Tikkana 
(1220-1300), perhaps the greatest Telugu poet. He was a niyogi 
Brahmin of the court of Manumasiddhi, chief of Nellore and sub- 
ordinate of Kakatiya Ganapati. The poet’s grandfather was a 
minister and poet, and his father and cousin were renowned 
warriors. Tikkana himself was a successful courtier and diplomat, 
and on one occasion he secured Ganapati’s aid for Manumasiddhi 
in regaining his throne. He performed a sacrifice and earned the 
title Somayaji. He commenced his translation with the Virata 
parva, evidently because he did not wish to start where Nannaya’s 
work had been so unhappily interrupted. Tikkana’s translation is 
complete for the rest of the Bhdrata. Many legends have grown 
up about Tikkana’s prodigious learning and to account for his 
unfading inspiration. His prologue was marked by originality, 
and it gave currency to certain conventions which have generally 
been adopted by his successors. He condemned incompetent 
poets and lavished praise on the true ones; he introduced a dream 
in which his grandfather delivered to him a message from Hari- 
hara-natha asking that Tikkana’s work should be dedicated to 
him; lastly he put in a hymn of praise with every word ending in 
the possessive case ( shashthyantamulu ). The first and last features 
are found in Nanne Choda’s Kumarasambhava also. Tikkana’s 
compact diction and his marvellous capacity for vivid portraiture 
and characterization earned for him the title Kavi Brahma. Before 
undertaking the translation of the Bhdrata , Tikkana composed 
Nirvacanottara Rdmdyana , an all-verse work on the story of Rama 
after his coronation; for some reason or other he left the last canto 
of this work to be completed later by another hand. 

The gap in the Vana parva between Nannaya’s and Tikkana’s 
works was filled by Yerrapragada (1280-1350). He was a niyogi 
Brahmin from Gudlur in the Nellore district, and his father, Sri 
Surya, was a poet in Sanskrit and Telugu, and a yogi. Yeinra- 
pragada himself was a great devotee of Siva and bore the title 
Sambhu-dasa. He was attached to the court of Prolaya Verna 
Reddi. For fear of the possible evil consequences of continuing 
the ill-fated translation of Nannaya, he made it appear that his 
work was that of Nannaya himself by dedicating it to Rajaraja 
Narendra, Nannaya’s patron. He says also that Tikkana appeared 
to him in a dream and urged him to complete the Bhdrata. ‘ Hi& 
ability as a poet is manifest from the fact that he begins his work 



398 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


in the style of Nannaya and, imperceptibly, passes into that of 
Tikkana.’ He was called Prabandha Paramesvara. He also 
translated the Harivamsa , the epilogue to the Bhdrata which traces 
the occurrences after the war. His other works are: Rdmdyana 
(not extant), and Lakshmi Nrisimha Purdna also known as Ahobala 
Mahdtmya. 

The three translators of the Mahdbharata have always been held 
in the highest esteem as the ‘ Kavitraya ’ — the three poets of Telugu, 
and subsequent authors generally began their writings by making 
obeisance to them. 

A contemporary of Yerrapragada was Nachana Soma (1355-77) 
who wrote the Uttar a Harivamsa as he was dissatisfied with Yerra- 
pragada’s achievement and wanted to produce a work worthy of 
the theme, and competent critics have held that the poet achieved 
his object. 

The Rdmdyana was translated by two poets of the thirteenth 
nnd fourteenth centuries. Kona Buddharaja, a feudatory of 
Kakatiya Prataparudra II, produced the Ranganatha Rdmdyana in 
dvipada metre, a work of great simplicity and sweetness and full 
of apt similes. Ranganatha’ s relation to the poem is by no means 
clear; either he was a court poet or possibly the guru of the king 
who dedicated the poem to him. Buddharaja’s sons are said to 
have completed it by adding the Uttar a- Rdmdyana. The other 
translation is a Campu by Hullakki Bhaskara and his pupils 
dedicated to a Sahinimara, whose identity is not settled beyond 
dispute. 

Among the contemporaries of Tikkana must be noticed Ketana, 
author of Dasakumdracarita , a translation of Dandin’s work which 
got him the title ‘ Abhinava Dandi \ of a grammar called Andhra - 
bhdsha-bhushana , and of a translation of Vijnanesvara’s M it dk shard ; 
Marana, a pupil of Tikkana, whose Markandeya Purdna became 
the basis of Peddana’s Manucaritra ; and Mancana of Rajahmundry, 
author of Keyurabahucaritra . Baddena, a Chola feudatory of 
Rudramadevi in the Shatsahasra country, wrote the Nitisdstra - 
muktavali, a treatise on politics in fifteen chapters, and probably 
also Sumati Sataka , a popular work of moral maxims. 

Before proceeding to the next period, we must notice two works 
on mathematics, also translations from Sanskrit, which are the 
earliest scientific works in Telugu. Mallana (1060-70), a niyogi 
Brahmin karnam of Pavalur near Guntur, translated into verse a 



LITERATURE 


399 


mathematical treatise of Mahaviracaryulu which contained chapters 
on mensuration, fractions and theory of numbers, among others. 
Eluganti Peddana translated the Lilavati of Bhaskara and called 
the work Praklrna Ganita . 

The century and a half that followed 1350 may well be desig- 
nated the age of Srinatha (1365-1440), held by some to be the 
greatest poet in the language. His great talents secured for him 
early in life the patronage of many chiefs and kings — the Reddis 
of Kondavidu, the Velamas of Rajakonda, and Devaraya II of 
Yijayanagar. He moved on equal terms with them and their 
ministers, and enjoyed a full taste of the pleasures of life though 
in the end he died a poor man. His command over Sanskrit and 
Telugu was unrivalled, and he says that he wrote the Ma rut rat- 
caritra as a boy and translated Salivahana-sapta-sati while yet in 
his teens; unfortunately neither has survived. His masterpiece 
was the translation of Sri Harsha’s Naishadhakavya called Sringara 
Naishadha , a majestic and stately poem in which all the great 
qualities of Srinatha’s genius found full play. His other works 
were Panditdradhya-carita, Sivardtrimdhatmya, Haravilasa, Bhima- 
khanda and Kdsikhanda. Only the last four are available now and 
these show what a staunch Saiva he was. Another work attri- 
buted to him is Kridabhiramam , a drama which marked a new 
departure in Telugu and started the genre known as vithinataka 
in which one person narrates his experiences in the streets of 
Warangal to another who is only a listener. Sringara-dlpika a 
work of poetics, purports to be the composition of Kumaragiri 
Reddi but is held by some to be the work of Srinatha. A heroic 
ballad of a very popular type, the earliest available work of its 
kind, Palndtivira-caritram , which commemorates the achievements 
of the warriors of Palnad (Guntur district) in the thirteenth and 
fourteenth centuries, is also considered to be his work. Many 
Catus or stray verses on miscellaneous subjects are reputed to be 
his and command great popularity to this day. 

A striking contrast in almost every way to Srinatha was his 
brother-in-law and junior contemporary Bammera Potana (1400- 
75), a niyogi from Ontimitta in Cuddapah district and translator 
of the Bhagavata Purana . Potana lived and died a poor man; he 
had no scholarly education, and his poetry, the result of inspira- 
tion born of an intense devotion, often overlooked the niceties of 
grammar. Potana is said to have met a yogi called JItananda 


400 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


whose grace converted him into a devotee with the gift of poesy. 
The Bhagavata of Potana is more voluminous than the original, 
and its easy diction, vivid descriptions, and narrative power together 
with the intense spiritual experience conveyed by almost every 
verse have made the work much more popular than the transla- 
tions of the Ramayana and the Mahdbharata. The story goes that 
when Rao Singa wanted Potana to dedicate the poem to him, the 
Goddess of Learning appeared in a dream and begged Potana to 
guard her chastity by not casting her into the arms of Singhabhu- 
pala, and there is a notable verse purporting to be Potana’s answer 
to the goddess. In any event, Potana did not publish his great 
work in his life-time and left it as a legacy to his son Mallana. 
Parts of the poem were found later to have suffered damage from 
insects, and the gaps had to be filled in by other hands. The 
sections of the poem on the release of the Gajendra (elephant lord) 
by Vishnu and the marriage of Rukmini carry an appeal even to 
the unlettered. Potana perhaps also wrote Virabhadra Vijaya in 
praise of Siva, it is said, as an expiation for his having penned the 
words of abuse which the enemies of §iva uttered against him on 
the occasion of Daksha’s sacrifice. 

The philosophical moralist Vemana, whose Sataka (centum) of 
verses has been well known to both young and old and has been 
translated into many other languages, most probably lived in the 
early fifteenth century. 

Pillalmarri Pina Virabhadra Kavi is counted by tradition as a 
much younger contemporary of Srinatha than Potana. Virabhadra 
translated the Jaimini Bharata which treats of the story of the 
Asvamedha parva of the original Bharata, and dedicated the work 
to Saluva Narasimha. The poet is said to have claimed that 
Sarasvati, the Goddess of Learning, was his Queen and to have 
sustained the claim to the satisfaction of Narasimha’s court. His 
Sringara Sakuntala, a rendering of Kalidasa’s great drama, is his 
only other work now available, the rest of his writings being known 
only by their names. The subtle musical character of his verse 
has gained the appreciation of critics. 

Of the other poets of this period, Nandi Mallaya and Ghantam 
Singaya (c. 1480) are important; they were joint authors of Varaha 
Purana and Prabodhaccmdrodaya. The latter, in Prabandha form, 
is far more faithful to its Sanskrit original than either Srinatha’s 
Naishadha or Pina Virabhadra’s Sakmtala. The Varaha Purana , 



LITERATURE 


401 


also a translation from Sanskrit, is dedicated to Tuluva Narasa- 
nayaka. Peram Raju Jakkana (1450) was the author of Vikra- 
marka-carita narrating the stories centring round the legendary 
monarch of Ujjain. Other notable names are: Duggupalli Duggaya 
(1480), author of Naciketopakhyana , Dubagunta Narayana (1470), 
author of Pahcatantra , Vennalakanti Suranna (1460), author of 
Vishnupurana , and Gaurana, author of Hariscandropakhydna. 

The reign of Krishnadeva Raya was a glorious epoch in litera- 
ture as in politics, war and art. The monarch was himself no 
mean scholar and poet, and the impetus he gave to Telugu 
literature lasted far beyond his time. Under his lead the practice 
of translating from Sanskrit originals was generally given up and 
independent Prabandhas which handled a puranic story or some 
invented theme after the manner of a Mahakavya in Sanskrit 
came more into vogue. The earlier Prabandhas were marked by 
originality, variety, freedom and grace of matter and style; but 
in course of time in the hands of lesser poets the Prabandha 
tended to degenerate into stereotyped and monotonous forms 
which observed the formal rules of rhetoric, but fell far short of 
true literature. 

Krishnadeva Raya’s Amuktamalyada or Vishnucittlya , one of 
the five great Kavyas in Telugu, is among the first fruits of the 
new movement; it also marks the beginning of the influence of 
Vaishnavism on Telugu literature. It deals with the life of the 
dlvar Vishnucitta (Periyalvar), his exposition of Vaishnava philo- 
sophy and the love between his foster-daughter Goda and God 
Ranganatha. The style is involved and complex, the similes are 
sometimes far-fetched, but all the same the effect achieved is 
majestic and sublime. * There is hardly a book in Telugu where 
there is such a continued flow of ideas, seeking an impetuous outlet 
in language which, though rich, is yet scarcely equal to the task of 
full and adequate expression. For insight into human nature, and 
for facility in depicting elusive moods by some striking phrase, 
Krishnadeva Raya has no superior, and scarcely an equal.’ He 
was the author of a number of Sanskrit works also. 

Like the Nine Gems of Vikramaditya’s court the Ashtadiggajas 
(the Eight Elephants of the Quarters) of Krishnadeva Raya’s court 
are famous in legend. In either case, popular imagination has 
sought to glorify an intrinsically great name at the cost of historical 
truth. But there were doubtless many great poets who did adorn 
26

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


the court of Krishnadeva Raya, and among them Allasani Peddana, 
on whom the emperor conferred the title Andhrakavitapitamaha 
(Grandfather of Telugu poetry), stands out foremost. He was 
the son of Chokkanamatya and had his literary training under 
Sathakopayati, a Vaishnava patriarch of the age. His chief work 
is the Svarocisha-sambhava or Manucarita . The story is taken from 
the Markandeyapurana. An orthodox Brahmin by name Pravara 
refuses the love offered to him by the divine courtesan Varuthinl. 
A gandharva comes to know of this, assumes the guise of Pravara 
and lives with her. Their son was Svarocisha from whom the 
second Manu was born. As in Kalidasa’s Kumara-sambhava , 
interest centres round the parents of the hero whose name the 
work bears, and Peddana’s fame rests on his delineation of Pravara 
and Varuthinl. He borrowed from his predecessors like &rinatha 
some features in the development of the theme and in the use of 
Kannada words. Manucarita was dedicated to Krishnadeva Raya 
who marked his appreciation of the poem by being a pole-bearer 
of Peddana’s palanquin. Peddana survived his royal patron and 
bemoaned the years of desolation that followed. Harikatha-sara 
attributed to him is no longer extant. 

Nandi Timmana, the second great poet of Krishnadeva Raya’s 
court, was the author of Parijatapaharana, which elaborates in 
beautiful verse a well-known episode in Sri Krishna’s life. The 
poem is said to have been composed to reconcile the emperor to 
one of his queens, who, he thought, had insulted him by sleeping 
with her legs stretched towards his portrait; Krishna’s efforts to 
appease Satyabhama, particularly the scene of his falling at her 
feet and being spurned by her with a kick, was calculated to hint 
to the emperor the extent of liberties permitted between lovers, 
and served its purpose. A pretty story, but most probably 
apocryphal. 

Bhattumurti, who came to be known later as Rama Raja 
Bhushana, had a long and distinguished literary career. His 
Narasabhupaliyam is a work on rhetoric written in imitation of 
Vidyanatha’s Prataparudrfya and dedicated to Toraganti Narasa- 
raju. His Hariscandra-Nalopakhyanam is a poem in which each 
verse has two meanings and tells the story of Nala as well as that 
of Hariscandra. But he is best known for his Vasucaritra which 
elaborates a simple story with great art. The theme is the marriage 
of prince Vasu with princess Girika, the daughter of the river 


LITERATURE 


403 


Suktimati and the mountain Kolahala — a minor episode in the 
Mahdbhdrata. The musical cadence of his verse and the high 
imagination characteristic of his often over-elaborated descriptions 
have been highly esteemed by critics. The poem was written in 
the reign of Tirumala I, the brother of Rama Raya, and dedicated 
to him. It was translated into Sanskrit. 

Dhurjati, a Saiva poet from Kalahasti, evoked the admiration 
of Krishnadeva Raya by his Kalahasti Mdhdtmya and a Sataka 
on the same shrine. His grandson, Kumara Dhurjati, chronicled 
the conquests of the emperor in his Krishnadevaraya-vijaya. 
Madayyagari Mallana was another court poet of the time whose 
Rajasekharacarita is dedicated to Nadendla Appa, a nephew of 
Saluva Timma and governor of Kondavldu. The work is a typical 
Prabandha dealing with the wars and loves of Rajasekhara, king 
of Avanti. Ayyalaraju Ramabhadra, known as Pillala (of many 
children) Ramabhadra, is believed to have gained the patronage 
of Krishnadeva Raya by the good offices of Rama Raja Bhushana. 
He wrote the Sakalakathdsdra-sangraha , an abridgement of many 
puranic stories, at the instance of the emperor, and later the 
Rdmabhyudayam , on the story of Rama, under the patronage of 
{jobburi Narasaraju. 

Pingali Suranna, (Pingali is a village in the Krishna district), 
though counted among the Ashtadiggajas , came later than the 
reign of Krishnadeva Raya. His Raghava-Pandaviya , as the name 
indicates, tells the story of the Rdmdyana and Mahdbhdrata simul- 
taneously. It commands a grace and simplicity hard to attain in 
this type of forced composition, and it is believed that Bhattumurti 
(already mentioned) found his model in this work. Suranna’s 
Kalapurnodayam is more a novel in poetry than a Prabandha, the 
only work of its type. The plot is a veritable comedy of errors 
and grips the attention of the reader. 4 In the centre of the plot 
are Krishna and his seraglio, and in the background are Kali 
worshippers with dark hints of human sacrifices, and Malayali 
magicians with mystic garlands and strange spells. A noticeable 
feature of this work is that the writer altogether discards sleshaJ 
The Prabhavati Pradyumna was esteemed by the author himself as 
the best of his works. It deals with a puranic theme in an original 
dramatic manner. The subject is the fall of the powerful Daitya 
king Vajranabha at the hands of Pradyumna, the son of Krishna, 
followed by the marriage of Prabhavati, the daughter of the fallen

Daitya, with Pradyumna. In this work Suranna’s 4 characters are 
lifelike, their movements spontaneous, their conversations natural, 
and the situations tense and vivid \ 

In some ways the most interesting figure of the time was Tenali 
Ramakrishna who started his career under Krishnadeva Raya but 
lived on to the reign of Venkata. Posterity remembers him more 
as a court jester who played many practical jokes on high-placed 
men, the monarch himself not excepted; but he was also a poet 
of talent, and his Pdnduranga Mdhdtmya , counted among the five 
great Kavyas in Telugu, is a work of high merit which narrates 
the story of a dissipated Brahmin’s soul being successfully rescued 
from the servants of Yama by those of Vishnu, because he 
happened to die in Pandarpur. Ramakrishna also wrote the 
Udbhatdcdrya-carita and dedicated it to an officer of Krishnadeva 
Raya. 

Though not counted among the 4 great eight % Sankusala 
Nrisimha Kavi was a distinguished poet of the time. Peddana, 
it is said, out of jealousy, obstructed his approach to the emperor, 
and the poor poet had to sell his poem, Kavikarna Rasayana, in 
the market-place; one of its verses reached the emperor through 
his daughter Mohanangi and, struck with its beauty, Krishnadeva 
Raya sent for the poet, but he had left for Srirangam where he 
dedicated his work to the goddess of the shrine. It treats of the 
life of the mythical emperor Mandhata, and in its prologue 
Nrisimha Kavi roundly denounces bad poets and kings. 

Chintalapudi Ellaya was the author of Rddhd-mddhava-vildsa 
and Vishnumayavilasa ; the first work was so much appreciated 
that the poet came to be known by its name. Molla, a poetess of 
the time, born of a low caste, was the author of the most popular 
version of the Rdmdyana , in chaste and simple Telugu. Kamsali 
Rudraya was the author of Nirankusopdkhydna , a fascinating story 
of a gifted gambler defeating the god Siva, the stake being Rambha, 
the divine dancer; Nirankusa, the victor, fives with Rambha though 
Indra tries to break up their companionship. Addanki Gangadhara 
(1570) wrote the Tapatlsamvaranopakhydna and Ponnaganti Tela- 
ganna the Yayaticaritra ; they are both dedicated to Ibrahim Qutb 
Shah (1550-83), ruler of Golconda — called by the poets Ibha-rama- 
sauri in their dedication. Venkatanatha translated Pahcatantra 
into a Prabandha, instead of a collection of stories as in the 
original. Piduparti Somanatha’s Basava Purdna is the only Saiva 



LITERATURE 


405 


work of the time; the author was a fanatical VIra-saiva and his 
intolerance of Vaishnavism which breaks out everywhere in his 
work is out of place in the tolerant age of Krishnadeva Raya. 
Sarangu Tammayya and Chadaluvada Mallaya were authors of 
two Vipranarayana-caritas. 

Among the scientific works of the time may be noted Manu- 
manci Bhatta’s Hayalakshana Sdstra and Lilavati-ganita by Valla- 
bhacarya. The first is an original work on horses and their 
training dedicated to Oba Kamparaya, a dandandyaka of Krishna- 
<ieva Raya; it is now available only in parts. The second is 
a translation of Lilavati-ganita in verse form dedicated to an officer 
of Achyuta Raya. 

In the seventeenth century Vijayanagar lost its importance and 
its place was taken by the feudatory courts such as Gandikota, 
Siddhavatam, Nellore, Gingee, Tanjore and Madura. Matli 
Ananta (1590-1610) of Siddhavatam (Cuddapah district) and his 
grandson were both poets and composed respectively the Kakustha- 
vijayam and the Kumudvati-kalydnam. About the same time 
Tarigoppula Mallana wrote a Prabandha — Candrabhanu caritra — 
at the instance of Pemmasani Timmanayudu. Interesting in its 
own way, this Prabandha ranks far below the masterpieces of the 
age of Krishnadeva Raya. Nellore was made famous by the work 
of Pushpagiri Timmana who rendered Bhartrihari’s Nitisataka 
into Telugu and described the exploits of Hanuman in a poem 
called Samirakumdravijayam. He gathered round him a circle of 
talented friends including the celebrated Kankanti brothers — 
Paparaja and Narasimha. Paparaja’s Uttararamayana challenges 
comparison with the best works in Telugu; he also wrote a yaksha - 
gana Vishnumaydvilasa. His less celebrated brother Narasimha 
was the author of a mechanical rendering into dvipada metre of 
the Vishnumayavilasa Nataka of Radhamadhava Ellaya. The 
Dasavatdracarita of Dharanidevula Ramamantri is another notable 
poem of the period though the author’s tendency to parade his 
learning makes his composition rather heavy. At Tanjore Raghu- 
natha Nayaka himself became the author of two delightful poems 
— the Vdlmiki-caritram and Ramayanam. The former is the first 
important prose work in the language; the latter, though incom- 
plete, shows Raghunatha’s art at its best. Less talented than his 
father, Vijayaraghava, the son of Raghunatha, also composed 
poems and yakshaganas but his fame rests more securely on the 



406

poets patronized by him. Among them was the celebrated 
Chemakuri Venkatakavi whose poems Sarangadhara- car it ram and 
Vijayavilasa handle respectively the themes of Chitrangi’s love for 
her step-son and Aijuna’s pilgrimage to the sacred tirthas and his 
marriages with the naga princess UlucI and with Subhadra, the 
sister of Sri Krishna. The Vijayavilasa is rightly counted as one 
of the great Kavyas in Telugu. One of the queens of Vijaya- 
raghava, Rangajamma, contributed to the development of the 
yakshagdna in her Mannarudasavilasa where she employs more 
characters than usual and frequently uses prose in conversations 
instead of song. Savaram Chinna Narayanaraju who lived in 
South Arcot and wrote an excellent Kavya Kuvalaydsvacaritra was 
another poet notable for the grace of his manner and his wit. 
Lastly Kadiripati, a cousin of Ramaraja, the commander-in-chief 
of Sriranga III, composed the Sukasaptati , a work of great literary 
excellence in which he perfected the art of story-telling. 

M ALA YAL AM 

Malayalam was the last of the South Indian languages to 
develop a separate existence and a literature of its own. In the 
&angam age, the present Malayalam area was a land of Tamil 
speech though grammarians recognized that the dialect of the 
mountain country deviated from standard Tamil in many ways. 
The Sangam literature contains many words and expressions that 
survive in Malayalam today though they have gone out of use in 
Tamil. Attempts to derive Malayalam from Sanskrit or to postu- 
late for it an origin independent alike of Sanskrit and Tamil are 
clearly misplaced, and there can be no doubt that it was a natural 
growth through centuries from the form of ‘ Kodum-Tamil 9 that 
prevailed in Kerala at the beginning of the Christian era. The 
literary idiom of Malayalam, like that of Kannada and Telugu, 
borrowed freely from Sanskrit, and in order to express the Sanskrit 
sounds adequately, it had to discard the old Vatteluttu script and 
evolve a new script based on Tamil-grantha. This happened per- 
haps about the tenth century or a little later. The early inscriptions 
of the country used the grantha script for Sanskrit words in the 
midst of Tamil-Malayalam written in Vatteluttu. 

The Urmunlli Sandesam, an anonymous poem of the fourteenth 
century, is the earliest extant literary work in the language. Its 
model was the Meghasandesa of Kalidasa, and it purports to be 


LITERATURE 


407 


a message sent by a lover in Trivandrum to his lady love at 
Kodungallur and a detailed description of the route to be followed, 
the messenger in this case being a prince, Adityavarma by name, 
and not a cloud or a bird as in other sandesa poems. On his way 
the messenger is required to pay his respects to Ravivarman 
(Kulasekhara), the great ruler of Quilon, and other contemporary 
rulers are also mentioned in the poem. The style of the work 
shows a large admixture of Sanskrit, and is in fact manipravalam , 
like most works of Malayalam literature. It is universally accepted 
as one of the most exquisite poems in the language. The Chan- 
dr otsava is another poem of the same period in Sanskrit metres, 
while the Lilatilakam (15th century) is a grammar of manipravalam 
style. 

Prior to the date of the first sandesa poem, there had come into 
existence popular ballads of various kinds, now known as Pajaiya- 
pattus, old songs. Though in their present form they appear in 
a very modernized garb, competent critics hold that some of them 
at least must be of really early origin. There were many varieties 
of these folk songs such as Brahmanip-pattu sung in marriages, 
Bhadrakalip-pattu and Sas tap-pat tu in praise of the respective 
deities, Ydtrakkalip-pd(tu and Tiruvadiraip-pattu which take their 
names from the festive occasions when they were sung; they appear 
to have been generally accompanied by dance. Similar in character, 
but longer on account of the continuous themes they handled, 
were compositions like the Payyanur Pat (d la, of which only the 
memory has survived. This early literature shows the least admix- 
ture of Sanskrit in its vocabulary. More systematic and much 
nearer true literature among these early poetic compositions were 
Rdmacaritam, a long metrical work on the story of the Yuddha- 
kanda of Ramdyana, believed to have been written by an ancient 
ruler of Travancore some time between the tenth and thirteenth 
centuries A.D.; and the somewhat later Ramakathdp-pdtju of a 
certain Ayyipihai Asan. Both these works show signs of a strong 
Tamil influence in respect of words and metres. To this early 
period must also be assigned the anonymous Bhashakaufillya, a 
Malayalam commentary on the Arthasastra of Kautilya; it follows 
the Sanskrit commentary Jayamangald , and only six out of the 
fifteen adhikaranas are known. 

From about the thirteenth century a strong impetus to literature 
came from the development of Chakkiydr-kuttu , a dance-recital of 



408 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


literary works which grew out of a simple and earlier form of the 
same art known as Kudiy-attam devoted to the exposition of dramas 
like Ndgdnandam and Ascarya-cudamani . For enriching the reper- 
toire of the Chakkiyar, many Campus, works in mixed prose and 
verse, and Prabandhas came to be written under the inspiration of 
Sanskrit influences. Poetry follows Sanskrit metres and the prose 
passages are also really poetical in content and conception. Puranic 
stories and episodes form the themes of these compositions; but 
extraneous matter is often introduced and the Campus abound in 
satirical references to contemporary usages and personalities. 
They were mostly written by Nambudiri Brahmins, a class well 
known for their mordant wit and sarcasm, employed to good 
purpose in these works. Perhaps the most famous of them was 
Punam Nambudiri of the fifteenth century to whom many Campus 
are ascribed; the Ramayana-campu is unquestionably his master- 
piece. Second only to Punam was Malamangalam Nambudiri,. an 
inspired poet of the sixteenth century, who was gifted with a vivid 
imagination and an easy flow of language. His great work is the 
Naishadha-campu in which piquant situations like Nala leaving his 
kingdom and Damayanti lamenting over her separation from him 
are portrayed with great effect. These front-rank writers were 
followed by imitators of lesser calibre among whom Narayanan, 
the author of the Bharata-campu, is the most notable. 

Mention must be made of the Niranam poets, so called from 
their native village Niranam in central Travancore, who from the 
fifteenth century sought to develop an independent Malayalam 
style relatively free from the domination of Tamil and Sanskrit 
models. Most prominent among them was Rama Panikkar, 
of the Rdmayanam , popularly known as Kannassa Rdmdyanam , 
which narrates the whole of the Rama story. He was also the 
author of Bhdrata Gdthd , Savitri Mdhdtmyam , Brahmandapurdnam , 
and Bhagavatam . His poems are marked by great narrative power 
and he has been called ‘ the Chaucer of Malayalam \ The trans- 
lation of the Gita by Madhava Panikkar, the maternal grandfather 
of Rama Panikkar, also deserves more than a passing mention. 
The Niranam poets also popularized a metre which takes its name 
after them, Niranavrittam , but even this is seen to have its prototype 
in Tamil. 

Cherusseri Nambudiri (early sixteenth century), author of the 
Krishnagatha , may be said to close the middle Malayalam period 



LITERATURE 


409 


and herald the literature of modern Malayalam. The subject- 
matter of his great poem is the entrancing theme of the life of Sri 
Krishna as narrated in the tenth skandha of the Bhdgavata , and 
Cherusseri’s gatha is hailed by critics as a marvellous work of art 
which captivates the mind of the reader by the wealth of its 
imagery and the rich harmony of sense and sound. 

For some time after Cherusseri, only local songs and ballads, 
like some of the Vadakkan-pdttukkal, the Anju Tampurdn-pattu 
and EravikuttipiUa-pattu , were produced. These continued the old 
tradition of popular songs on contemporary events which ushered 
Malayalam literature into being. The great luminary after Cherus- 
seri was the renowned Tuncat Ramanujan EJuttaccan who gave 
shape to modem Malayalam. His chief works were: Adhyatma 
Rdmayanam Kilippattu , Bharatam Kilippattu , Harindmaklrianam , 
Cintaratnam — a work on Advaita Vedanta, and perhaps also 
Bhagavatam Kilippattu and Devimdhdtmyam. It will be seen that 
he covers practically the whole range of Hindu mythology giving 
his own versions of the two great epics and Bhagavatam, and did 
not neglect religion and philosophy. The Kilippattu reached its 
perfection in his hands, and he is hailed as the genius who con- 
ferred literary dignity on the daily speech of the common man by 
adapting it to the highest purposes of literary art. Eluttaccan’s 
date is not settled beyond dispute, but he may be placed late in 
the sixteenth or early in the seventeenth century. 

A word must be said about Attakatha or Kathakali. This 
variety of dance-drama was till a few years ago believed to be a 
development of recent origin, not older than two or three centuries 
at the most. Recent research has shown, however, that the first 
Attakathas were composed towards the close of the fifteenth cen- 
tury, and that the Raman-attam of Kottarakkara Tampuran, meant 
to be completed in eight performances, is the earliest of the extant 
Attakathas; though there is no direct evidence, the author may be 
taken to belong to the sixteenth century. Later contributions to 
this type of popular literature — about two hundred Kathas have 
so far been listed — lie outside the period covered by this book

CHAPTER XV 


RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY 

Introductory— early harmony among sects — reaction against Jainism and’ 
Buddhism — bhakti schools — ndyanars — alvars — Kumarila and Sankara — tem- 
ples and bhakti — schools in the age of the Cholas — Ramanuja — Nimbarka — 
Madhva — Vaishnava schism — saints of Maharashtra — VaUabhacarya — Pasu- 
pata sects — temples of the Deccan — growth of Saiva-siddhanta — Vira-saivism 
and the Aradhyas — temples and festivals under Vijayanagar. 

Buddhism, Jainism and Ajivikas — Islam — Christianity. 

In the sphere of religion, as generally in all matters of spiritual 
culture, South India began by being heavily indebted to the North;, 
but in the course of centuries it more than amply repaid the debt 
and made signal contributions to the theory and practice of religion 
and to philosophic thought in its various aspects. Its saints and 
seers evolved a new type of bhakti , a fervid emotional surrender to 
God which found its supreme literary expression in the Bhagavata - 
pur ana, a bhakti very different from the calm, dignified devotion 
of the Bhagavatas of the early centuries before and after Christ in 
Northern India. Again, from South India arose the two schools 
of Vedic exegesis — MImamsa — that go by the names of Kumarila- 
bhatta and Prabhakara. The founders of the three main systems of 
Vedanta — Sankara, Ramanuja and Madhva — also hailed from the 
southern country. Yet another prominent philosophical system — 
the Saiva-siddhanta — also found its exponents in the Tamil country. 
Lastly, the Vedas were commented on more than once in this part 
of the country, and the constant study of the ritual manuals of the. 
different Vedic schools was kept up. The literature of these move- 
ments was reviewed in outline in the last chapter; here we shall 
seek to sketch the main stages in the history of these developments. 

Till about the fifth century a.d., harmony and tolerance charac- 
terized the relations between the different religious sects. The 
worship of primitive godlings with offerings of blood and toddy 
went on side by side with the performance of elaborate Vedic 
sacrifices; the popular pantheon included many deities like Muruga r 
&iva, Vishnu, Indra, Krishna, and others. Buddhists and Jains 
were found in considerable numbers in different parts of the 
country following their practices without let or hindrance. In the 



412 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


story of Manimekalai , for instance, we find the heroine advised 
to study in Kanchl the philosophical systems of the Veda, 
Siva, Vishnu, Ajivika, Jaina and of the Sankhya, Vaiseshika and 
Lokayata. 

But soon a great change came— particularly in the Tamil country 
— and people began to entertain fears of the whole land going over 
to Jainism and Buddhism. At any rate, worshippers of Siva and 
Vishnu felt the call to stem the rising tide of heresy. The growth, 
on the one hand, of an intense emotional bhakti to Siva or Vishnu 
and, on the other, of an outspoken hatred of Buddhists and Jains, 
are the chief characteristics of the new epoch. Challenges to public 
debate, competition in the performance of miracles, tests of the 
truth of doctrines by means of ordeal, became the order of the 
day. Parties of devotees under the leadership of one gifted saint 
or another traversed the country many times over, singing, dancing 
and debating all their way. This great wave of religious enthusiasm 
attained its peak in the early seventh century and had not spent 
itself in the middle of the ninth. 

Later tradition counted sixty-three nayanars, individual and col- 
lective, as the most prominent leaders of this revival on the side 
of the £aivas. The individuals included a woman from Karaikal, 
and a pariah, Nandan from Adanur, besides a general of the 
Pallava forces, £iruttondar. But most prominent among them 
were the three great men whose hymns are collected together in 
the Dev dr am. First came Tirunavukkarasu, a Vellala from Tiru- 
vamur and most probably contemporary of the Pallava ruler 
Mahendravarman I. Though born in an orthodox £aiva family 
he was attracted to Jainism in his early years, and joined the Jaina 
monastery at Pataliputra (Cuddalore) as a monk. His elder sister, 
who had watched his change of faith with untold regret, implored 
Siva’s help. Her prayer was answered : Dharmasena, for that was 
her brother’s name in the monastery, became the victim of an 
incurable abdominal disorder. When all his fellow-Jains failed 
him, he was compelled to go and seek his sister’s aid. She secured 
his cure by the grace of the God of Tiruvadigai. The news of his 
defection greatly upset the Jaina monks of Pataliputra who trumped 
up many false charges against Dharmasena to poison the mind of 
Mahendravarman against him. He was subjected to many trials 
and tortures which, however, by the grace of £iva he easily 
surmounted. Finally, the king himself was convinced of the 



RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY 


413 


superiority of Saivism, and embraced it. Whatever element of 
truth there may be in the life-story of Tirunavukkarasu or Appar 
which we have sketched above, a verse in the Trichinopoly inscrip- 
tion of Mahendravarman furnishes clear proof that the king did 
indeed turn to Saivism from some other creed. It must, however, 
be admitted that the tradition regarding the persecution of Appar 
by Mahendravarman (whose name does not occur in the story 
narrated by &ekkilar) is hard to reconcile with the spirit of the 
Mattavilasa. The rest of Appar’ s long life of 81 years was spent 
in pilgrimages during which he met many contemporary nayanars, 
of whom Nanasambandar was the most notable, indeed the greatest 
of them all. 

Nanasambandar was a Brahmin of the Kaundinya gotra from 
Shiyali in the Tanjore district. There are few Saiva temples in 
the Tamil country today where worship is not offered to him. 
Legend avers that as a child of three he got the milk of divine 
knowledge from Parvati herself and narrated the incident to his 
father in song. The father at once realized the divinity of his 
child and carried him on his shoulders from one Saiva shrine to 
another until he was relieved by the present from the gods of a 
pearl palanquin for his son’s use. At that time the Pandya 
country was almost completely overrun by Jainism, and the 
Pandyan queen, a princess from the Choi a country, and the 
minister Kulaccirai, both of whom were Saivas, sent Sambandar 
an urgent invitation to come and release the Pandya and his 
country from the tightening grip of Jainism. Nanasambandar 
betook himself to Madura, foiled all the conspiracies of the Jains 
against him, vanquished them in debate and converted the king 
and his subjects to Saivism. The story goes that on this occasion 
8,000 Jains were put to death by impalement, and a festival in the 
Madura temple is supposed to commemorate the gruesome event 
to this day. This, however, is little more than an unpleasant 
legend and cannot be treated as history. There is no reason to 
believe that, even in those days of intense religious strife, intoler- 
ance descended to such cruel barbarities. Nor are we asked to 
believe the story of his marriage. It is said that when, at the age 
of sixteen, he was married, the ceremony had hardly been com- 
pleted when the newly wedded pair and all the wedding party were 
absorbed into the god-head. Sambandar had disputations with 
Buddhists also and visited many shrines and sang hundreds of

liymns in his short life-time. He was the purest of all the saints, 
with no past to regret. He may be placed in the middle of the 
seventh century and his Pandyan contemporary was either Mara- 
warman Avanisulamani or his grandson Arikesari Maravarman. 

About a century later came Sundaramurtti of Navalur. He was 
T)om of poor Brahmin parents but his beauty as a child was such 
that he attracted the attention of the local chieftain Narasinga 
Munaiyadaraiyan who, with the consent of the parents, brought 
h im up. When his marriage with a girl of his own caste was about 
to take place it was stopped by the mysterious intervention of £iva 
who claimed him as his slave. A little later Sundara fell in love 
with two women, one a dancing-girl of Tiruvalur and the other a 
sudra girl of Tiruvorriyur. Their jealousies, it is said, could only 
be resolved by Siva himself acting as a messenger to one of them. 
Like the other nayanars , Sundara is also credited with many 
miracles and the contemporary Chera ruler, Cheraman Perumal, 
was his friend. They visited each other regularly and made 
their last journey to the abode of Siva in Mount Kailasa together, 
Sundara on a white elephant and Cheraman Perumal on a horse. 
Sundara’s devotion to Siva was that of an intimate friend so that 
he was given the title Tambiran-Tolan (‘ Friend of God ’). 

A little later than Sundara came the illustrious Manikka-vasagar. 
Legend makes him the minister of a Pandyan king; and on his 
account Siva, the presiding deity of Madura, is said to have per- 
formed many miracles. His Pandyan contemporary was most 
probably Varaguna II (862-80). Manikka-vasagar is said to have 
debated with Buddhists from Ceylon at Chidambaram and to 
have utterly vanquished them. His hymns form the Tiruvdsagam 
(‘ The Sacred Word ’) and another work, Tiruccirrambalakkovai , is 
also ascribed to him. 

The hymns of Sambandar, Appar and Sundara form a varied 
treasure-house of religious experience which tells of mystical 
raptures and ecstasies, of moments of light when there is a vision 
of God and the world is transfigured in the light of his love, and 
of periods of gloom when all is dark and the blind seeker is filled 
with a sense of fear. Somewhat different and more exuberant are 
the outpourings of Manikka-vaSagar whose confessions are more 
outspoken and whose devotion is more impassioned. Some of 
them were keen controversialists and had no soft word for 
Buddhists and Jains.

The Vaishnava wing of the movement is represented by twelve 
alvars (‘ divers ’ into the qualities of God) for whom orthodox 
tradition gives an impossible chronology. Three of them — Poygai, 
Pudam, Pey, bora respectively at Kanchi, Mallai and Mylapore — 
are believed to have come earliest. A beautiful legend tells how 
these three saints sheltered from the rain in a narrow room which 
could only just hold them standing, when Vishnu himself came 
seeking their company. The bhakti of these early saints is a gentle, 
simple devotion, altogether free from a sectarian outlook. This 
fact, and their employment of the venba metre in their songs, points 
to a really early date for them — not later than the fifth or the sixth 
century a.d. 

Then came Tirumalisai, bora in the village of that name in 
Chingleput district and most probably an elder contemporary of 
Pallava Mahendravarman I. The story goes that at birth he was 
a shapeless mass of flesh abandoned by his parents and brought up 
by a sudra. He is said to have practised Jainism, Buddhism and 
Saivism before settling down finally as a Vaishnava yogi. His 
poems show a more controversial tone than those of the first three 
chars , and this was quite natural to his age. 

After him we might place Tirumangai, one of the most cele- 
brated of the alvars. He was the petty chieftain of Alinadu in the 
Tanjore district who, legend says, became a highwayman in order 
to carry off and marry the daughter of a Vaishnavite doctor of a 
higher caste, for whom he also changed his religion. He is said 
to have stolen a solid golden image of Buddha from a monastery 
in Negapatam to pay for renovating the temple of Srirangam The 
clear reference to Vairamegha in his hymns places him in the middle 
of the eighth century, a date which discredits the story of his friend- 
ly meeting with Nanasambandar at Shiyali. Neither story can be 
treated as history, though each in its own way furnishes a clue to 
what his followers believed in later times. His hymns, and they 
are many, are equally full of good poetry and attacks on Jainism 
and Buddhism. To Saivism, on the whole, he evinced a more 
friendly attitude and there are many resemblances in literary form 
and religious sentiments between Nanasambandar and Tirumangai. 

A little later than Tirumangai, about the close of the eighth 
and the beginning of the ninth century, came a number of alvars . 
Periyalvar, a Brahmin of Srivilliputtur, won a religious disputation 
in the court of the Pandya king Srimara Sri Vallabha (815-62). 



416 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


The only woman among them, Andal or Kodai (Skt. Goda), was- 
the real or adopted daughter of Periyalvar. In her intense devo- 
tion to Vishnu she dreamt of her marriage with that god, and 
described her experience in her hymns. This mystical union was 
the only one she knew, and in many ways the ardour of her 
devotion resembles that of Manikka-vasagar, and her hymns are 
replete with allusions to Krishna stories. To about the same 
period belonged Tiruppan, a minstrel of low caste, who was not 
permitted to enter the temple of 3rlrangam and was thus the 
Vaishnava counterpart of Nandan; and Ton<Jar-adip-podi (‘The 
dust of the feet of the devotees ’)> a Brahmin from Tanjore district 
whose real name was Vipranarayana and whose intolerance of 
Buddhism and Jainism was nearly as great as that of Tirumangai. 

Kulasekhara, the ruler of Kerala, proficient alike in Sanskrit and 
Tamil, was the next atvar who, among other shrines of Vishnu, 
sang of those at Chidambaram and at Tiruvali — the latter, no 
doubt, a foundation of Tirumangai. Lastly came the celebrated 
Nammalvar and his pupil Madhurakavi. The former was born of 
a Vehala family of Alvartirunagari (also called Kurugur) in the 
Tinnevelly district. His personal name was Maran and he seems 
to have gained the name Sathakopa on the occasion of his initia- 
tion. He renounced the world in his thirty-fifth year to practise 
yoga. His hymns, the largest in number alter those of Tirumangai, 
are rightly regarded as embodying the deepest religious experience 
and philosophic thought of one of the greatest seers of the world. 

Yuan Chwang, who visited South India in 642, when the Hindu 
revival was just gathering momentum, did not notice the new 
movement, although in speaking of Maharashtra he mentions the 
worshippers of Deva (§iva) who covered themselves with ashes. 
He mentions with regret that his own creed — Buddhism — was on 
the decline, but remarks repeatedly that it had yielded to Digam- 
bara Jainism. The triumph of the revivalist movement was largely 
achieved in the two centuries that followed. Public disputations 
which led kings and rulers to transfer their allegiance from one 
creed to another did much to bring this about. More important, 
however, was the use of the popular speech by the nayandrs and 
the alvars in their soul-stirring compositions, and the fact that 
these were set to simple times which the masses loved to sing. 

Another important, though less popular, aspect of the same 
revival is seen in the work of Kumarila and Sankara. They were 


RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY 


417 


Smartas (traditionalists) who laboured m the cause not of any one 
sect in particular but of the ancient brahminical religion as it had 
been developed through the centuries. They held up as the reli- 
gious ideal a youth occupied with ritual observances followed by 
an old age given up to philosophic contemplation. Kumarila 
frequently attacks Buddhists in his works, and tradition asserts 
that he did much to discredit them in the course of his many 
scholarly journeys. He elucidated the philosophy of ritualism 
(Mimamsa) in all its aspects, but Sankara was the greater thinker. 
Few details of his life are very well attested, but he is generally 
taken to be a Nambudiri Brahmin from Kaladi on the banks of 
the Alwaye river in north Travancore, where he was bom in 788. 
He lost his father early in life and turned ascetic, with Govinda 
yogi , a pupil of Gaudapada, as his guru. In a short life he travelled 
all over India propagating his new philosophy of a rigorously con- 
sistent monism and triumphing against all rivals who met him in 
debate. He reorganized the ascetic order of Hinduism on the 
model of the Buddhist order, and founded a number of mathas in 
different parts of India, the best known being those at Sringeri, 
Dvaraka, Badrinath, Puri and KanchL His philosophy, which 
traces all apparent multiplicity and difference to illusion (maya), 
is indeed derived from the Upanishads, but clearly owes much in 
detail to Mahayanist speculation; nevertheless, he regarded Bud- 
dhism as Hinduism’s chief enemy. Within a few years of his death 
in 820, one of his pupils, Sivasoma, was spreading his doctrine in 
distant Kambuja across the seas. Not without justice, it has been 
said that Sankara ‘ would have a higher place among the famous 
names of the world had not his respect for tradition prevented him 
from asserting the originality which he undoubtedly possessed \ 

The work of the poet-saints of the Pandya-Pallava period was 
continued in the age of the Cholas by a succession of poets and 
teachers of second rank. The Tamil hymns of the last age came 
to be treated as equal to the Veda and were collected and arranged 
in canonical books. Gradually they were regularly employed in 
the daily worship in temples, and their authors came to be regularly 
worshipped as manifestations of divinity. In fact the rise of the 
temple to an important place in the religious and social life of the 
land was the direct result of the revivalist movement. The age of 
the Imperial Cholas saw the construction of stone temples, great 
and small, in almost every town and village in their extensive 
27

empire. The great temples of Tanjore and Gangaikondasolapuram 
were symbolic of the new age and, among many others, they were 
celebrated in hymns by contemporary poets. 

The Saiva canon, in which these hymns also found a place, was 
arranged in the first instance in the reign of Rajaraja I by Nambi 
Andar Nambi and continuously added to till about the middle 
of the twelfth century. The Vaishnava canon, on the other 
hand, received its definitive shape at the hands of Nathamuni. 
In his works he expressed the clear need he felt for the support 
and guidance of a living God, and pointed the way to a philo- 
sophical justification of the path of love. His grandson Alavandar, 
also called Yamunacarya in memory of his visits to the sacred 
spots of Krishna’s youth, was the next great name in the succession 
of Vaishnava acaryas of the period. In his early years he was a 
man of the world, but a follower of Nathamuni called him to the 
higher life. He then turned ascetic and led the life of a religious 
teacher, gathering disciples round him and preaching, writing and 
conducting debates. In his writings, often cited by Ramanuja, 
‘ he sought to establish the real existence of the supreme soul, and 
the eternal independence of the individual soul ’. 

The greatest of the Vaishnava acaryas was undoubtedly Rama- 
nuja. Bom at Sriperumbudur, near Madras, in the first quarter 
of the eleventh century, he had his early philosophical training 
under Yadavaprakasa of Kanchipuram who belonged to the school 
of Sankara. Yamunacarya is said to have once met Ramanuja at 
Kanchi but, unwilling to disturb the progress of the youth’s studies, 
he uttered a prayer for the increase of Sri Vaishnavas and went 
back to Srirangam. Ramanuja then disagreed with the teachings 
of his guru and was strongly attracted by those of the Srirangam 
school. Yamuna sent for him, but breathed his last before 
Ramanuja could reach him. He succeeded Yamuna as head of 
the matha at Srirangam, which gave him control over the temple 
and the school and a position of authority in the sect. He soon 
proved his mettle as a teacher and organizer, and his influence 
grew day by day. In his lectures and writings he refuted the 
Mayavada of Sankara, demonstrated that the Upanishads did not 
teach a strict monism, and built up the philosophy of Visishtadvaita 
which reconciled devotion to a personal God with the philosophy 
of the Vedanta by affirming that ‘ the soul, though of the same 
substance as God and emitted from him rather than created, can

obtain bliss not in absorption but in existence near him \ He 
attempted to unify the sect by a reform of temple ritual wherever 
possible. Though he respected the rule that none but the twice- 
born may read the Veda, he was eager, like the alvdrs , to spread 
the doctrine of bhakti among Sudras and even among the outcastes. 
He arranged that in certain important temples the outcastes should 
have the privilege of entering the temple on one day in the year. 
He travelled throughout India to propagate his ideas, and these 
journeys may well account for the wide influence of the sect in 
Northern India. 

The Cholas were ardent Saivas and evidently did not view the 
growing influence of Ramanuja with favour. We may not trust 
the legends of the persecution to which Ramanuja and his followers 
were subjected in all their details, but the fact remains that he had 
to withdraw into Mysore about 1098 and could not return to 
jSrirangam till 1122. During this time Ramanuja won over the 
Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana from Jainism and established a 
well-organized matha at Melkote. After his return to Srirangam, 
Ramanuja continued his work there till he died in 1137. He is 
worshipped as an avatar in all Vaishnava temples. 

A younger contemporary of Ramanuja was Nimbarka, a scholar- 
ly Bhagavata Telugu Brahmin from Nimbapura in Bellary district 
who spent most of his time in Brindavan in Northern India. In 
religion he accepted the doctrine of surrender ( prapatti ) and trans- 
lated it into a total devotion to Krishna and Radha. For him 
Radha is not merely the favourite mistress of Krishna but his 
eternal consort who lives with him for ever in Goloka, the highest 
heaven. Philosophically, he accepted the position that God, the 
soul, and the world were identical yet distinct, the position 
described as bheda-bheda . Nimbarka thus became the founder of 
a new sect allied to, but distinct from, that of Ramanuja. He 
expounded his views in a commentary on the Vedantasutras and 
in another work called Siddhdntaratna or DasaslokL 

The philosophic debate which, as against Sankara, laid increas- 
ing stress upon the reality of the world and the soul in distinction 
from Brahman ended in complete pluralism in the system of 
Madhva. Bom shortly before 1200 in a Brahmin family at Kalyana- 
pura in the Udipi taluk of South Kanara district, some forty miles 
west of Sringeri, he became a sanyasi while he was still quite young 
and, like Ramanuja, had his early training in the system of 



420 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Sankara. But before his training was over, he broke away from 
that system and evolved his own based mainly on the Bhagavata- 
purdna. Tradition credits him with a great capacity for physical 
endurance. A debate at Trivandrum with an acarya of §ringeri 
ended in his discomfiture and he was robbed of his library and 
subjected to much annoyance and persecution. He toured Northern 
India where he had encounters with robbers, wild beasts and 
hostile chieftains in the course of his journeys. After resting for 
a while in Hardwar he retreated into the Himalayas for communion 
with Vyasa and published his commentary on Vedantasutras on 
his return. Back at Udipi again, he built a temple of Krishna and 
spent his time preaching, converting, and defeating ‘ illusionists \ 
After a ministry of nearly eighty years, and at the age of ninety-six, 
he disappeared as he sat teaching and was seen no more. He 
claimed to be an incarnation of Vayu, the Wind-god. He was a 
prolific writer who disdained fine-spun arguments and found sup- 
port for his teachings mainly from the Puranas and other later 
literature. He taught that the Universe is ruled by God as two 
persons — Vishnu and Lakshmi — and that the souls in the world 
are eternally distinct from Him. He recognized different orders 
of souls and consigned some of them to eternal damnation, which 
has led some modern critics to hold that 4 it is impossible not to 
see traces of Christian influence ’ in his teaching. The centre of 
his religion is bhakti to Krishna as taught in the Bhagavata , Radha 
having no place in it; but all other avatars are revered, Siva is 
worshipped, and 4 the five gods ’ (Pancdyatana) are recognized. 

The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries witnessed the rise of a 
schism among the followers of Ramanuja due to a difference in 
their interpretation of prapatti (surrender). Some held that the 
devotee had to exert himself to win the grace of the Lord, while 
others thought that the Lord’s grace by itself conferred salvation 
on the soul that had entered the path of surrender. The position 
of the first school, Vadagalai (northern branch), is commonly 
summed up in the phrase Markatakisoranydya , the rule that the 
young monkey clings to its mother with an effort, and that of the 
second school, the Tengalai, is called Mdrjdrakisoranydya , the 
rule of the kitten which is carried by its mother in her mouth. 
There are other differences between the two schools, one of them 
being a decided preference for Tamil as against Sanskrit on the 
part of the Tengalais. The southern school looks upon Pillai

Lokacarya (b. 1213) as its founder. He was the author of eighteen 
esoteric treatises (rahasyas), and had to leave Srirangam with the 
sacred image during the period of the Muslim inroads. He found 
an influential expositor in Manavala Mahamuni (b. circa 1370), 
the next great teacher and writer in the southern school. The 
leader of the northern school was Vedanta Desika (b. 1268). He 
once hid himself under a mass of dead bodies in Srirangam on the 
occasion of a Muslim incursion and escaped to Mysore until the 
storm blew over. As we have seen, he was poet, philosopher, and 
man of affairs. 

Another development of Vaishnavism based on the Bhdgavata 
was the rise from the close of the thirteenth century of a number 
of poet-saints whose popular songs stirred the life of Maharashtra 
as those of the nayandrs and the alvdrs had stirred the Tamil 
country centuries before. The earliest of them was Jnanesvara, 
popularly called Dnyandev Dnanoba — a pupil according to some 
accounts of Vishnusvami, who was a dualist and founder of a sect 
of his own. Jnanesvara was the author of an extensive work in 
Marathi verse on the Bhagavad-gita . His tone is Advaitic, though 
he also lays great stress on yoga; he was also the author of many 
abhangs or hymns. The movement begun by him continued 
through a succession of saints to Tukaram, the contemporary of 
Sivaji. 

Vaishnavism continued to be one of the dominant forces influ- 
encing the life of the people. No striking developments took 
place in the rest of our period in doctrine or practice. Occasion- 
ally the cult, especially that of Radha, tended to degenerate into 
erotic excesses. This is particularly true of the followers of 
Vallabhacarya (1479-1531), a Telugu Brahmin contemporary of 
Chaitanya. He was bom in Benares, wrote several works in 
Sanskrit including a commentary on the Vedantasutras and became 
the founder of a system called Suddhadvaita which exalted bhakti 
above knowledge. He is said to have vanquished Smarta scholars 
in public debate at the court of Krishnadeva Raya. The acaryas 
of the sect were known as Maharajas and lived luxurious lives. 
The highest ambition of his followers was to become gopis and 
sport eternally with Krishna in his Heaven, an ideal which in 
practice degenerated into gross eroticism. Further, disputes be- 
tween rival sects sometimes flared up with unusual violence. 
Nevertheless, Vaishnavism continued to be, in general, a noble 



422 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


and sweet influence on life. The Rayas of Vijayanagar were great 
patrons of Vaishnavism; in 1556 Sadasiva, at the request of Rama 
Raya, gave thirty-one villages to maintain the temple of Ramanuja 
and the institutions attached to it at 3riperumbudur. 

To return to the history of Saivism; we must note that by the 
side of the pure school of bhakti represented by the three saints 
o? Devaram and Manikka-vasagar, there existed other types of 
worshippers of Siva whose tenets and practices are gruesome and 
repellent to modern taste. Such were the Pasupatas, Kapalikas, 
Kalamukhas, and others whose presence in considerable numbers 
in centres like Kanchl, Tiruvorriyur, Melpadi and Kodumbalur 
is attested by inscriptions and literature from the seventh century 
onwards. Smearing the body with ashes from a burning ghat, 
eating food in a skull, and keeping a pot of wine, were some of 
the common practices of the Kalamukhas; and some of these sects, 
if not all, were addicted to the worship of the female principle, 
which often degenerated into licentious orgies. The practice of 
the devotee offering his own head as a sacrifice to the goddess is 
shown in the sculpture and literature of the age of the Pallavas 
and Cholas. 

In the Deccan, under the Chalukyas of Badami and the Rashtra- 
kutas of Manyakheta, both Saivism and Vaishnavism flourished 
although Saivism was, perhaps, the more favoured creed. Magni- 
ficent temples were built at Badami, Pattadakal, Mahakuta, Ellora, 
and other places, arcakas (priests) were imported from the Saiva 
deary as on. the banks of the Ganges, and daily worship and 
periodical festivals in these temples were richly endowed. At the 
same time the performance of Vedic sacrifices was continued, 
vratas (religious vows) were observed and danas (gifts) made. The 
worship of Kartikeya attained such prominence in the Bellary 
region in the tenth century that two tapovanas were dedicated to 
him as the supreme deity, a development initiated by some teachers 
from Bengal. In the Andhra country also, where Buddhism had 
flourished in great strength in the early centuries of the Christian 
era, there came about a strong Hindu revival. Besides the more 
famous shrines of Kalahasti, Daksharama and jSrisailam, the 
temples of Mahasena (Kartikeya) at Chebrolu, Humkarasankari at 
Bidapura, and Mallesvara at Bezwada became important centres of 
pilgrimage. Mathas grew up and were occupied by monks who 
fed the poor, tended the sick, consoled the dejected and set up

schools for the education of youth, and in the process many 
Buddhist shrines and viharas were turned to Hindu uses. 

Hinduism has always been a house of many mansions, and the 
following description of the Arab geographer al-Idirlsi, who wrote 
at the beginning of the twelfth century basing himself on earlier 
writers, may well be taken to apply to the whole of the Deccan 
from the tenth to the twelfth centuries. ‘ Among the principal 
nations of India there are forty-two sects. Some recognize the 
existence of a Creator, but not of Prophets; while others deny the 
existence of both; some acknowledge the intercessory powers of 
graves and stones and others worship holy stones on which butter 
and oil is poured. Some pay adoration to fire and cast themselves 
into the flames. Others adore the sun and consider it the Creator 
and Director of the world. Some worship trees, others pay adora- 
tion to serpents which they keep in stables and feed as well as they 
can, believing this to be a meritorious work. Lastly there are 
some who give themselves no trouble about any kind of devotion, 
and deny everything.’ 

Two developments in Saivism which occurred in the twelfth and 
thirteenth centuries in the Tamil country and in the Deccan deserve 
particular mention. The first is the development of the Tamil 
Saiva-siddhanta philosophy based on the Agamas. The Agamas 
are first mentioned by Sundaramurtti, and the Tirumandiram of 
Tirumular (ninth century) is the earliest work to reflect the theology 
of the Agamas. Agamic terminology is also found in the writing 
of Manikka-vasagar, who frequently speaks of the Agamas as 
revealed by Siva and openly expresses his dislike of the Vedanta, 
by which he means the monism of Sankara. But the first definite 
formulation of the philosophy of the Tamil Saiva-siddhanta was 
in the work of Meykandadeva, a pious Vellala who lived early in 
the thirteenth century on the banks of the Pennar river, south of 
Madras. He is reputed to have received instruction from Paranjoti- 
muni who was sent down from Kailasa specially for that purpose. 
His Siva- N ana- Bodam, a translation into Tamil verse of twelve 
Sanskrit Sutras from the Raurava-dgama , is looked upon as the 
fountainhead of the dogmatics of the system. The extensive philo- 
sophic literature that sprang from this work has already been 
reviewed. The progress of discussion led to the growth of different 
schools within the fold of the Saiva-siddhanta. But in the main 
the system sought, like other philosophies of religion, to determine 



424 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


the relations of God, matter and the soul. It declared that matter 
and souls were, like God, eternal. The Absolute through its 
6 grace-form ’ is for ever engaged in the rescue of souls from the 
bondage of matter and the three stains (malas) which defile their 
purity. 4 As body and mind together form a unity so God is the 
soul whose body is the Universe of nature and of man. He is 
not identical with either; He is not their substance but he dwells 
in them and they in Him. Advaita is not Oneness, but insepara- 
bility. To realize this union is the high calling of the soul.’ It is 
for the guru or the teacher to let in the light, but Siva is the source 
of all enlightenment, sole embodiment of intelligence and grace, 
and hence the true object of all devout aspiration. The system 
transcends caste and ritual and calls for inner devotion. According 
to one writer contentment, justice and wisdom are the flowers of 
worship. 

The other development in Saivism (also based on the twenty- 
eight Saiva Agamas) was the growth of Vira-saivism or the 
Lingayat cult in Karnataka and the Telugu country. Basava, the 
prime minister of Kalacuri Bijjala, king at Kalyani (1 156), is usually 
regarded as the founder of the sect. Lingayat tradition avers that 
the sect is very old and was founded by five ascetics — Ekorama, 
Panditaradhya, Revana, Maru]a, and Visvaradhya— who were held 
to have sprung from the five heads of Siva. Basava, they say, 
was but the Reviver of the Faith; but we know for a fact that the 
five ascetics named were all contemporaries of Basava, some older, 
some younger. The early history of Vira-saivism is therefore still 
somewhat uncertain. Two features of the sect, however — the 
prominent place held by monasteries, and the more or less com- 
plete social and religious equality among the sectarians — have been 
held to be due to the influence of Jainism and Islam. Lingayats 
regard Siva as supreme and must worship only Him; hence the 
name Vira-saivas, stalwart Saivas. They must also worship each 
his own chosen guru. Each Lingayat, man or woman, carries a 
linga about his person, usually in a silver or wooden reliquary 
^ suspended from the neck. Reverence is paid by Lingayats to the 

sixty-three nayanars of the Tamil country whom they recognize as 
Puratanas (elders) and to seven hundred and seventy later saints 
among whom are included Manikka-vasagar, Basava, and his chief 
disciples. An account of Lingayat literature has been given

The Aradhya Saivas of the Telugu country differed from the 
Lingayats in some respects. They followed Mallikarjuna Pandi- 
taradhya, a contemporary of Basava, in refusing to accept the 
latter's rejection of the Veda and renunciation of caste. But the 
relations of Aradhya Saivism with Lingayatism were friendly, and 
both joined together in the fourteenth century in resisting the 
inroads of Muslims and in preparing the way for the foundation 
of Vijayanagar. 

Under the Rayas of Vijayanagar all types of religion found 
encouragement, and most of the famous temples of South India 
were enlarged at this time, particularly by the addition of large 
gopuras or entrance towers and corridors and mandapas. A few 
temples were altogether rebuilt on a new integral plan, like that 
of Madura under Tirumalai Nayaka (1623-59). The periodical 
festivals in most of these temples were also richly endowed, and 
brought together people from all classes of society including groups 
of peripatetic merchants and traders. The festivals of the capital 
city of Vijayanagar, in particular the Mahanavami (nine days’ 
festival) in October, were occasions of great display which have 
been described by many foreign travellers who had occasion to 
witness them. Their accounts leave little doubt that there Was 
widespread slaughter of buffaloes and sheep as sacrifices to the 
goddess, hook-swinging, and other bad practices of a similar 
character. 

Buddhism, Jainism, and AjIvikas 

The early history of Buddhism in South India has been inci- 
dentally sketched in the opening chapters of this book. Its decline 
in Andhradesa, where it had flourished in the early centuries a.d., 
was noticed by Yuan Chwang, and this decline proceeded further 
after his time. The renascent Hinduism of the period began the 
worship of the Buddha at Amaravati as an incarnation of Vishnu 
and seems likewise to have converted many other Buddhist centres 
into Hindu shrines. In the Tamil country. Buddhism declined 
rapidly as a result of the activities of the Hindu saints and 
reformers which we have noticed in this chapter, but it lingered on 
feebly in different parts of the country. Under the Cholas there 
were Buddhist settlements in Negapatam on the east coast and at 
Srimulavasam in the west; and Buddhism was considered suffi- 
ciently important for some scenes from Buddha’s life to be

represented in decorative panels in a balustrade of the great temple 
of Tanjore. The ancient Velgam Vehera on the banks of the Periya- 
kulam tank near Trincomalee in Ceylon was remodelled and con- 
siderably extended, and renamed Rajaraja PerumbaHi early in the 
eleventh century; a large life-size limestone image of the Buddha 
and an inscribed bronze lampstand are among the finds in the 
vihara area — clear proof of the active interest of the great Chola 
monarch in the spiritual well-being of his subjects in Ceylon. An 
important work of Tamil grammar, the VJrasoliyam composed in 
Virarajendra’s time, had a Buddhist scholar for its author. One 
section of Kanchipuram bore the name of Buddhakanchl to a 
relatively late date, and a Buddhist monk from one of the monas- 
teries there sang the praises of a Hindu ruler of eastern Java in the 
fourteenth century. 

In the north-west of the Deccan also, new vihdras were coming 
up on behalf of Buddhism late in the ninth century. Thus, in 
853, a monk from Bengal built a great monastery ( mahdvihara ) in 
Krishnagiri (Kanheri) for the use of the sangha and endowed it 
with one hundred gold drammas. In the same neighbourhood a 
meditation hall was constructed for monks in 877 by a minister of 
the Silaharas of Konkan, and other endowments are record- 
ed at the same time and place for the regular worship of the 
Buddha. 

On the whole, however, Jainism had more influence than Bud- 
dhism on the life of the people, particularly in Karnataka and in 
the Tamil country owing to the striking contributions made by 
Jaina authors to the literatures of Kannada and Tamil. Some 
account of them has already been given in the last chapter on 
literature. The Jaina temple built at Aihole by Ravikirti in the 
reign of Pulakesin II is said to have been the abode of all 
excellences, and Jaina temples and monasteries continued to be 
built everywhere in the extensive dominions ruled by the Chalukyas 
and the Rashtrakutas. Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I, for instance, 
found solace by retiring to a Jaina monastery more than once in 
the course of his long reign. Many of the early Western Ganga 
monarchs were followers of Jainism, and it also found patronage 
under the Eastern Chalukyas. Amma II (mid-tenth century) built 
two Jinalayas and established satras (feeding houses) attached to 
them where sramanas (Jaina monks) of all the four castes were 
to be fed. 


RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY 


427 


Jainism had much more in common with Hinduism than Bud- 
dhism, and many popular beliefs and practices were common to 
both the systems. Thus in 812 a Jaina temple was endowed for 
the removal of trouble caused to a Chalukya Vimaladitya by the 
planet Sanaiscara (Saturn). In many Jaina grants we find that the 
donees are required to use the proceeds of the endowment for their 
daily rites and observances in terms identical with those employed 
in Hindu donations; and influential guilds of merchants often 
included a strong Jaina wing in their membership. Soon after the 
establishment of Vijayanagar, Jains complained to king Bukkaraya 
of persecution by the Vaishnavas. The monarch interceded (1368) 
and decreed that both parties should practise their respective reli- 
gions with equal freedom and without mutual interference. Though 
Jainism has been steadily losing ground it has not altogether dis- 
appeared from the country — particularly in parts of Gujarat. 

Another sect outside the pale of Hinduism, which continued to 
count some adherents in South India though it had disappeared 
elsewhere, was that of the Ajlvikas. Founded by Gosala Maskari- 
putra, a contemporary of the Buddha and Mahavira, this strictly 
deterministic school was influential in the Maury an period in the 
North, and Asoka and his successor Dasaratha presented fine 
rock-cut caves to it. They believed in an inexorable Niyati 
(Destiny) which man was unable to counteract. The South Indian 
Ajlvika monks practised severe asceticism, and probably influenced 
by Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism, came to look upon Gosala 
as ‘ an ineffable divinity they also developed the ‘ view that all 
change and movement were illusory, and that the world was in 
reality eternally and immovably at rest \ The inscriptions show 
that they were sometimes subjected to a special tax levied on them 
at least by the Cholas. 


Islam 

The contact of South India with Islam is much older than that 
of the North. A Muslim fleet first sailed in Indian waters in 636, 
when a governor serving under Caliph Umar sent an army to 
Thana; but Umar disapproved of this. Very soon afterwards, 
Muslim traders continuing the contacts of pre-Muslim days settled 
in numerous parts of the Malabar coast, married the women of 
the country, and the issue of such unions became the Mappillas 
(Moplahs). Such Muslim traders were encouraged by Hindu

Rajas who used them to procure horses for their cavalry and for 
manning their fleets. AMshtakhrl, an Arab writer of the tenth 
century who knew India at first hand, says that there were Musal- 
mans and Jumma Masjids in the cities of the Rashtrakuta empire. 
A doubtful legend relates the conversion to Islam of the last of the 
Perumal rulers of Kerala, Cheraman Perumal. He is said to have 
made the pilgrimage to Mecca and to have sent directions from 
there to the rulers of his homeland to receive Muslims hospitably 
and to build mosques for them. Travellers like Masudi (916) and 
Ibn Batuta. (fourteenth century) testify to the presence of Muslims 
and mosques all along the west coast. There were Muslim settle- 
ments on the east coast also, of which Kayal-pattanam and Nagore 
were the most important. Islam, it is said, was preached actively 
near Trichinopoly early in the eleventh century by a Sayyid prince 
of Turkey, Nathad Vali, who became a missionary, came to India, 
and spent his last years converting many Hindus. His tomb is still 
pointed out in the city. According to Ibn Batuta, the army of 
Hoysala Ballala III included 20,000 Musalmans. The Muslim 
invasions from the North and their consequences, the rise of the 
Bahmani kingdom and its relations with Vijayanagar, have been 
dealt with elsewhere. By the beginning of the sixteenth century 
the Mappiflas were estimated by Duarte Barbosa to have formed 
one-fifth of the population of Malabar, but the arrival of the 
Portuguese checked the growth of Muslim power and ruined the 
Arab trade. 

It is very difficult to say how far Islam influenced Hindu reli- 
gious thought and practice in the South. Some traits of the Hindu 
revival, such as the increasing emphasis on monotheism, on 
emotional worship, on self-surrender, on the need for devotion to 
a spiritual teacher, as well as the growing laxity in caste rules and 
indifference to ritual at least among some sects, have all been held 
to be in some way or other the result of Islamic influence. But 
these developments may well be explained from the internal history 
of Hinduism itself, and there is no direct evidence of the active 
influence of Islam on their growth. Perhaps, after all, it is not an 
accident that, as Eliot has observed, sects grew 4 more definite in 
doctrine and organization, especially among Vishnuites, as Hindus 
became more familiar with Islam \ As we have shown, however, 
there were Musalmans in plenty who, in general, were left free 
both to worship and to proselytize. 


RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY 


429 


Christianity 

A persistent but doubtful tradition ascribes the introduction of 
Christianity in South India to St Thomas, in the first century a.d. 
Cosmas, the Alexandrian merchant who travelled in South India 
in 522, found a church at Quilon and another in Ceylon, both 
Nestorian. Copper-plate grants to Malabar Christians, the earliest 
of which is dated 774, show that they had then gathered native 
converts, though they were not yet very numerous. The strength 
of the community was increased by a number of immigrations of 
Christians from western countries, from Baghdad, Nineveh, Jeru- 
salem and other places. 

There was a Christian community at St Thomas Mount, but 
no authentic evidence of its condition is forthcoming before 
Marco Polo (1293) who first reports the story of the martyrdom 
of St Thomas on the Mount, but the shrine on the Greater 
Mount was visited by Hindus and Muslims as well as by the 
Christians themselves. Thirty years after Marco Polo heard the 
story of St Thomas, Friar Odoric found some fifteen houses of 
Nestorians beside the church, but the church itself was filled with 
idols. A century later Conti reckoned a thousand Nestorians in 
the city; yet early in the sixteenth century Barbosa found the 
church in ruins, with a Muslim fakir charged to keep a lamp 
in it. 

Christian travellers in the Middle Ages occasionally complain of 
the paucity of Christians in South India and of the persecution to 
which they were sometimes subjected, and Friar Jordanus (1321-30) 
wrote enthusiastically of the great scope that India offered for 
missionary activity in the cause of Christianity. 

Active propagation of Christianity, however, began only after 
the arrival of the Portuguese and of St Francis Xavier (c. 1545). 
But these efforts did not make much headway except among the 
lower classes, and what is more, they led to the rise of acute schisms 
and quarrels between the new Catholic Christians and the other 
sects that had already established themselves in different parts of 
the country. The coming of other Christian nations like the 
Dutch only added to the confusion. We have already seen that 
the Portuguese policy of turning religious propaganda to political 
use roused the resentment of even the tolerant rulers of Vijayanagar 
and their feudatories.

This brief sketch of the architecture and art of South India is 
more historical than aesthetic; aesthetic appreciation is a matter 
of individual taste, and the role of the art critic is different from 
that of the student of its history. Again, though the continuity 
in the evolution of art forms and the mutual influences of the 
different schools that flourished in different localities and ages will 
be taken account of in a general way, no attempt can be made here 
to study such questions in any detail. Our aim must be to give a 
general view of the salient features of the different schools and their 
productions in the light of the most recent studies on the subject. 

The earliest monuments that call for notice are the caityas and 
viharas of the north-western Deccan. These are often called ‘ caves ’ 
and ‘cave-temples’; such names are misleading when applied to 
these wonderful excavations, many of which are large, well-planned 
temples and monasteries skilfully chiselled out of the solid rock 
with infinite forethought and patience. The term ‘ rock-architecture’ 
has been suggested as more adequate by Percy Brown (to whose 
great work on Indian Architecture this account is much indebted). 

- Such work involved no great problems of constructional engi- 
neering, and is best regarded as a branch of sculpture, though

a temple or place of worship, and was so called because in early 
Buddhism the object of worship was generally a stupa ( caitya ); 
the vihara was a monastery. In Hlnayana Buddhism the Buddha 
was never represented in sculptured form, but his presence was 
indicated by a throne, a footstool, cushions and other symbols. 
The Buddha image came into use in later Mahayana Buddhism 
and then it was introduced into some of the early caityas as at 
Kanheri and Nasik. The Hlnayana rock-cut monasteries and 
shrines are all situated in Bombay State within a radius of two 
hundred miles round Nasik. The caitya was generally ‘ a large 
vaulted hall having an apsidal end and divided longitudinally by 
two colonnades into a broad nave and two aisles. In the apse 
stood the stupa, also carved out of the natural rock.’ Circumam- 
bulation of the stupa took place along the aisles and the apse, while 
the congregation assembled in the nave. The vihara consisted of a 
‘ central hall entered by a doorway ’ from a verandah in front and 
surrounded by square cells cut further into the rock, each serving 
as the abode of a monk. Architecturally the caityas are more 
notable than the viharas. In both there was a close imitation of 
the wooden structures which were the originals of their designs; 
even in rock-cut buildings, much woodwork was put into both the 
fagade and interior, so used were the early builders to wood before 
they started building in stone. But rock-architecture as it comes 
before us is fully matured, and the stages, if any, of its evolution 
are no longer traceable. 

There are eight caitya halls of the second and first century b . c . 
and in their probable order of execution they are ‘ Bhaja, Kondane r 
- Pitalkhora, Ajanta (No. 10), Bedsa, Ajanta (No. 9), Nasik and 
Karle the first four belonging to the second century and the 
remainder to the first. Two caitya halls at Junnar are * of the 
same type and date as that at Nasik \ The series may be said to 
close with the caitya at Kanheri (second century a . d .). In the 
earlier examples the pillars of the colonnades are copies of plain 
wooden posts, with an octagonal section and without capital or 
base, and they generally slope towards the interior; in later exam- 
ples the inward slant disappears and the columns become more 
elaborate, with bases and capitals, and evolve into an 6 order \ 
The horseshoe archway above the entrance which dominates the 
fagade also undergoes a corresponding evolution. Bedsa and 
Karle are the finest examples of this early series of caityas , and

the facade as well as the column is marked by many innovations. 
At Bedsa the base of the column is vase-shaped and its capital is 
surmounted by a group of figures and animals 6 each of which 
consists of a male and female figure lightly clad but with heavy 
ornaments seated astride kneeling animals, on the one side horses, 
and on the other elephants. These groups are exceptionally vivid 
and spirited examples of rock sculpture, evidently the work of a 
master craftsman in this medium.’ The hall is 45J feet long and 
21 feet wide. Karie (PI. I), the largest and best of the series, is 
124 feet long, 46J feet wide and 45 feet high. Here the fagade 
consists of two stages, the lower wall pierced by three doorways 
and an upper gallery over which rises the enormous horseshoe 
window. The pillars of the colonnade have capitals more elaborate 
than at Bedsa, and they have the effect of a frieze and cornice. 
From them rise the wooden ribs attached to the domed stone of 
the roof. The spaces between the doorways in the lower stage of 
the fagade are each decorated with sculptures of two human figures, 
very massive and grandly executed. ‘ The setting back of the 
entrance into the face of the rock forms an outer porch, the sides 
of which are sculptured in architectural fagades of several storeys, 
the lowest supported by huge elephants, the second decorated with 
sculptured figures’ like those of the lower stage of the fagade. 
The entrance was preceded by a wooden antechamber or porch, 
and farther outside stands one of the two original monolithic 
dhvajastambhas with a capital of four lions which once supported 
a wheel. The arrangements carefully designed to deflect the glaring 
sunshine streaming through the horseshoe window of the fagade 
have received high praise from Percy Brown who observes : ‘ There 
are few lighting effects more solemnly beautiful than the soft 
luminous atmosphere diffused in this manner through the sun- 
window at Karie \ The caitya at Kanheri is ‘ a decadent copy of 
that at Karie, but only about two-thirds its size \ 

The viharas are monastic houses excavated near the caityas in 
secluded places where the monks found freedom to pursue their 
religious observances without distraction. From a small beginning 
in course of time they developed a full complement of rooms: a 
dormitory, a common room, a refectory, and so on, besides cells 
for individual monks. Ajanta (No. 12) is ‘ a simple but typical 
example ’ of an early single-storeyed vihara. Another vihara of 
the same type is that to the left of the caitya at Kondane. At 
28 



434 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Nasik this type of vihara is seen ‘ in its most decorative form . . . 
in a series of three examples’, all of the first century a.d., viz. 
Nahapana (No. 8), Gautamlputra and Sriyajna, so-called from 
their inscriptions. ‘ All have columned porticos ’ but no pillars 
in their large central hails, from which open the individual cells 
generally containing stone beds. 

Contemporary with these monasteries in the Western Ghats, 
another group — not Buddhist but Jaina — was excavated near 
Cuttack in Orissa. These rock-cut chambers are all located in 
two hills known as Khandagiri and Udayagiri, and were made 
within the century and a half preceding the Christian era. There 
are in all some thirty-five excavations but only half the number 
are at all important, only one of these being on Khandagiri. There 
was apparently no regular plan and they were cut in convenient 
places and connected by paths. The workmanship is clumsy and 
crude, but that was perhaps at least in part due to the rough tex- 
ture of the sandstone. Locally, these monasteries are known as 
gumphas , and each is distinguished by some prefix, like Hathi 
(elephant). There are many unidentified sculptured scenes from 
Jaina legends in the more important gumphas . The style of the 
sculptures is at once original and vigorous. The Rani and Ganesa 
gumphas are both two-storeyed; and the courtyard of the Rani, 
there is good reason to think, constituted an open-air theatre. 
In it are the remains of channels for the distribution of water 
throughout the structure. In the Ganesa gumpha the entrance 
steps are flanked with figures of elephants, the first appearance of 
the sculptured-animal motif at the entrance to a rock-cut hall 
which was developed with such wonderful effect later at Ellora and 
Elephanta (where, however, the elephants are replaced by lions). 

Remains of extensive Buddhist sanctuaries, rock-cut and struc- 
tural, are found on many sites in the lower reaches of the Krishna 
and Godavari rivers. Nearly all of them bear traces of an early 
foundation, for in this region Buddhist art found a refuge under 
the patronage of the Andhras and their successors and had a more 
or less continuous evolution from about 200 b.c. to a.d. 400. The 
monuments of this region form a precious link between the ancient 
schools of Barhut and Sanchi and medieval Hindu art. Rock-cut 
architecture is found in two sites in Andhra state, one at Gunfu- 
palli (Krishna district), the other on the Sankaram hills (Vizaga- 
patam district). The small circular caitya of Guptupalli (200 b.c.).

18 feet in diameter, and its ribbed domical roof are obvious 
imitations of a primitive hut, and the whole structure, perhaps, 
contains the clue to the beginnings of the more elaborate caitya 
hall. There are, besides, two viharas , one large and the other 
small, ruins of a brick-built caitya hall, and several stupas of 
various sizes, rock-cut and structural. There is no regular plan 
and the work is rather coarse. The remains on the Sankaram 
hills are perhaps later — about a.d. 350. A number of monolithic 
stupas and rock-cut chambers scattered in an irregular way to suit 
the configuration of the hilltop and the foundations of an extensive 
structural monastery are the principal remains. Some of the 
monolithic stupas here are the largest of their kind, one being 65 
feet in diameter at the base. Here, as at Guntupalli, the work is 
rather crude and unskilled. 

The technical skill and artistic excellence of the Andhra crafts- 
man are best seen in the structural monuments, particularly the 
stupas distributed over an area of 75 miles all round Ellore. The 
most notable of them were at Goli, Jaggeyapeta, Bhattiprolu, 
Ohantsala, Amaravatl and Nagarjunikonda. As examples of 
Buddhist architecture and sculpture they had few equals at the 
beginning of the Christian era. Most of them had an exterior 
encasement of white marble, richly carved in low relief, and this 
gave them an imposing appearance. In the early examples, as at 
Bhattiprolu, the stupa was built solid, but later strength and 
economy of material were secured by means of cross-walls and 
4 other walls radiating towards the circumference like the spokes 
of a wheel \ The bricks themselves were of enormous size, 
24" X 18" X4". At first, the stupa was a low hemispherical mound, as 
at Sanchi, but in later examples the dome is raised by being set on 
a lofty plinth. The marble casing was never applied over the 
whole surface of the brick core, but only to its lower portion, the 
remainder being plastered and painted white. At the four cardinal 
points there were rectangular projections from the plinth which 
accommodated steps leading to the procession-path above the 
plinth. Above each of these projections stood five slender pillars 
which may have symbolized the five Dhyanibuddhas and were 
called dryaka kambhas (‘ worshipful columns ’)- ‘ As an orna- 

mental attribution to the domical shape of the stupa, this projection 
with its graceful pillars was an admirable device and gives an 
artistic distinction to the southern type.’ 


436 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


The largest of all these stupas , that of Amaravatl, had its begin- 
ning about 200 b.c., but was completely reconstructed between 
a.d. 150 and 200. The dome was 162 feet across at the base and 
the concentric railing outside enclosed the pradakshina path 15 feet 
wide. The height of the dome must have been from 90 to 100 
feet. Some 20 feet above the ground there was a higher proces- 
sional path with the usual offsets and the aryaka pillars. There 
was a balustrade about 8 feet high round the terraced path and it 
was richly carved on the inner sides. All that remains now of 
this stupendous monument are the sculptural slabs and parts of 
the railing preserved in museums. 

The sculptures of Amaravatl, like those from several other stupas 
in the neighbourhood, depict incidents in the life of the Buddha 
and scenes of worship, and contain many fine ornamental motifs. 
The figures of women and animals are in the Sanchl tradition and 
display a vigorous and supple realism, characteristic of all Indian 
sculpture, particularly of animals, from the days of Asoka to the 
age of the Pallava sculptures at Mamallapuram. In the scenes 
depicting fife in the women’s quarters, there is an innocent delight 
in the nude and a refined sensuality with marked freshness. The 
Bodhisattvas and the Buddha are represented actually and not by 
mere symbols, and good reason has been shown to admit the 
presence of Roman influences in the art of Amaravatl, which fore- 
shadows that of Aihole and Mamallapuram. This side of 
Amaravatl art leaves naturalism behind ancMevelops an idealism 
of the highest order, 4 a new canon of beauty and tranquillity ’, 
4 the aesthetic ideal of India \ 4 The school of Amaravatl,’ says 

Grousset, 4 can show many a scene which is a veritable picture in 
stone, perfect in its composition, by some very great, though un- 
known, artist.’ In the medallion (Madras Museum) depicting the 
taming of the elephant (PI. II), for instance, the confusion caused 
by the mad beast contrasts remarkably with the calm after it is 
tamed by the power of Buddha’s kindliness. In the various stories 
illustrated 4 there are representations of walled cities, palace-build- 
ings, tor anas and stupas ; and more than one of the slabs portrays- 
the stupa of Amaravatl itself as it must have appeared in the height 
of its glory \ 

At Ter in the Sholapur district and Chezarla in the Krishna 
district are found Buddhist caitya halls built in brick, perhaps in 
the fifth century a.d., and surviving to this day because they were 



ART AND ARCHITECTURE 


437 


appropriated to brahminical uses after the decline of Buddhism. 

We refer to the Trivikrama temple at Ter and the Kapotesvara 
temple at Chezarla. These two small buildings, each not more 
than 30 feet long, are now the only means of judging the external 
appearance of the Buddhist structural temples as the rock-cut 
caityas have no exteriors except their fagades. 

About the middle of the fifth century there was a revival of 
rock-architecture in the western Deccan under the stimulus of 
Mahayana Buddhism. The chief centres of this art were Ajanta, 

Ellora and Aurangabad, not to speak of some places of lesser 
importance in the same region. The caitya in its essential features 
remained the same as before except for the introduction of Buddha 
images, sometimes of colossal proportions. The vihdra , however, 1 

undergoes much alteration and the innermost range of cells which 
served originally as dormitories for monks now became sanctuaries 
containing images of the Buddha. And the vihdra thus became a 
place of worship as well as of residence. 

The monastic retreats of Ajanta extend in a * sickle-shaped curve 
along the face of the cliff for over a third of a mile, and 
overhanging the waters of a pretty stream, cascading through the 
ravine below \ Here are twenty-eight halls of various sizes and j* 

they have been numbered in order from west to east. Two caityas 
and three vihdras (Nos. 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13) had come into existence ! 

in the earlier Hlnayana period under the Andhras (200 b.c.- [ 

a.d. 200); the others were added in the two centuries that followed J 

a.d. 450. In these later examples the imitation of wooden con- 
struction is discarded, and a distinct advance- made in the handling 
of the rock-medium. The walls and the ceilings of these halls j 

were covered with a large number of mural frescoes which have I 

survived in some of them almost intact. I 

The two vihdras (Nos. 16 and 17) made under the Vakatakas 
•(about a.d. 500) are pillared halls (with the usual cells and shrines * 

in the back walls) containing Buddhas seated in * European fashion ’ 

( pralamba pdda ). In the paintings of No. 16, there is a remarkable J 

combination of figures with architectural motifs, while a striking j 

narrative style marks the scenes of the life of the Buddha depicted 

in No. 17. No. 19 (PI. Ill), with its highly embellished fagade and 

its numerous Buddhas, marking a great development of Mahayana 

sculpture, may be dated about 550, thus forming a link between 

the earlier group and that of the seventh century. The pillars

within this caitya are fluted columns richly ornamented. The 
capitals are of the pot and foliage variety. The chief painting 
jhere is the 4 Return to Kapilavastu \ Nos. 1-5 and 21-6 were the 
last group to come into existence (c. 600-50). No. 1 contains the 
painting of the beautiful 4 Bodhisattva with blue lotus ’ and other 
famous frescoes including the 4 Sibi-Jataka ’ and 4 Banquet of 
Persians really a representation of the Buddhist god Pancika. 
The painters of Ajanta 4 had a complete command of posture. 
Their knowledge of the types and positions, gestures and beauties 
of hands is amazing. Many racial types are rendered; the features 
are often elaborately studied and of high-breeding, and one might 
call it stylistic-breeding. In some pictures considerable impetus 
of movement of different kinds is well suggested. Some of the 
schemes of colour composition are most remarkable and interesting 
and there is great variety.’ A critic observes: 4 It is impossible 
for anyone who has not seen them with their own eyes to realize 
how great and solid the paintings in the caves are; how wonderful 
in their simplicity and religious fervour.’ But the simplicity was 
the result of a very conscious art-tradition of long standing and* 
as Grousset has said, 4 every one of the chief subjects of the Ajanta 
frescoes is worthy of separate analysis The Ajanta style of paint- 
ing is seen contemporaneously at Sigiriya in Ceylon and some 
centuries later in the paintings of a Jaina cave at Sittannavasal 
(Pudukkottai), in the cave-temple at Tirumalaipuram (Tinnevelly 
district), and on the inner walls of the garbhagriha of the Great 
Temple at Tanjore. 

The rock-architecture of Ellora was begun by the Buddhists 
from 450 to 650, with twelve rock-cut halls that fall into two sub- 
groups, one slightly later than the other and each comprising a 
prayer-hall with monasteries attached to it. The later group 
contains two monasteries which are the only examples in three 
storeys, rising to a height of nearly 50 feet with wide courtyards in 
front. The technique of rock-architecture reached its culmination 
in some of these viharas in which 4 lines are straighter, angles more 
correct, and surfaces more true than in any other examples At 
Aurangabad there are three groups of Buddhist excavations in a 
hill about 3 miles north of the city. One of them includes a caitya 
and four viharas , another has four viharas , and the third comprises 
three unimportant caves. They all belong to the sixth and seventh 
centuries. Some of the sculptures of deities and devotees, male

and female, in these viharas are remarkable for their massive 
proportions and bold relief and for their life-like presentation of 
the people of the period, their garments, head-dresses and 
ornaments. 

The beginnings of Hindu temple architecture in South India are 
best traced in the temple-complex at Aihole and its neighbourhood 
dating from a.d. 450 to 650. Aihole is a town of temples and 
contains no fewer than seventy structures. The work started there 
was continued in the neighbouring towns of Badami and Patta- 
dakal. The temple at Aihole known as Ladh Khan, usually 
assigned to about 450, is a low flat-roofed building 50 feet square, 
with a small square cella and a porch set on the roof at a later 
date and forming an independent shrine of the Sun. Of the main 
temple three sides are completely enclosed by walls, two of which 
carry stone windows perforated in a variety of beautiful designs. 
On the fourth side, which forms the eastern front, there is an open 
porch on the pillars of which are figures of the river-goddesses. 
The interior is a pillared hall containing ‘ two square groups of 
columns one within the other \ A large nandi fills the central bay, 
and the cella at the farther end is not a separate chamber leading 
off from the main hall, as one would expect, but built within it 
against the back wall. The entire disposition is totally inadequate 
for the purposes of a temple, and Percy Brown suggests that it was 
just a mote-hall converted into a temple. In the pilasters at the 
exterior angles of the building may be traced the beginnings of the 
* Dravidian order ’ with the tapering upper end of the column and 
its ‘ cushion capital with an expanded floral abacus supporting the 
bracket \ The construction of the roof is also peculiar as it consists 
of large flat slabs held together by long narrow stones covering the 
entire length of the joints and fitting into grooves cut in the slabs. 

Very different from Ladh Khan is the Durga temple (PI. IVa), 
which was another experiment seeking to adapt the Buddhist caitya 
to a brahminical temple. This temple, perhaps of the sixth century, 
is an apsidal structure (60 feet by 36 feet) with a large portico 24 
feet deep on its eastern front making its entire length 84 feet. The 
temple stands on a high plinth with many mouldings. The top of 
its flat roof is 30 feet from the ground. A sikhara rises above the 
garbhagriha in the apse and there is a verandah roofed with sloping 
slabs carried on massive square columns with heavy brackets and 
this forms the pradakshina path. 



440 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


The sikhara or pyramidal tower over the sanctum is generally 
curvilinear in shape in Northern India, but in the far South it rises 
by square terraces of diminishing size. In the Deccan both styles 
were used. There was even a tendency, at times, to combine the 
features of the two styles. The sikhara of the Durga temple, 
perhaps a later addition, is of the Northern variety. 

Another temple very similar to the Durga temple is the smaller and 
simpler Huccimalli-gudi which contains one new feature, namely a 
vestibule or antarala between the cella and the main hall. One of 
the last temples to be built at Aihole was the Jaina temple of 
Meguti (634), which shows considerable progress in the erection of 
structural temples. It is unfinished and its shrine is detached from 
the back wall. Of nearly the same date is the small finely-pro- 
portioned and magnificently located Malagitti Sivalaya at Badami. 

A group of four pillared rock-cut halls at Badami, three of them 
Hindu and one Jaina, are all of the same type, each comprising 
* a pillared verandah, a columned hall, and a small square cella cut 
deep into the rock \ One of these (No. 3) is a Vaishnava cave 
exactly dated 578, and contains fine reliefs of Vishnu seated on 
Ananta and a Narasimha, both in the verandah. The workman- 
ship in these caves is marked by a high degree of technical 
excellence. One noteworthy feature is the running frieze of ganas 
in various amusing postures carved in relief on each plinth. The 
front of these caves is otherwise unassuming but the interior is 
treated with great skill and care in every detail. 

The next stage in the development of Chalukyan art is marked 
by the temples at Pattadakal, about ten miles from Badami. There 
are ten temples here, four in the Northern style and six in the 
Southern. The Papanatha temple (c. 680) among the former, and 
SangameSvar (c. 725) and Virupaksha (c. 740) among the latter, 
are the most notable. The temple of Papanatha in its plan and 
elevation alike exhibits shortcomings due to uncertainty regarding 
the correct relation of the different parts of the temple structure 
to one another. The temple is 90 feet long and too low for its 
length, its tower in true Northern style is too small and stunted, 
and the antarala too big — almost a supplementary hall. The outer 
walls carry a close and monotonous repetition of canopied niches 
representing a shrine. This temple was perhaps one of the first 
attempts to combine Northern and Southern features in one 
structure, and was not quite successful. 



ART AND ARCHITECTURE 


441 


The vastly improved design and execution of the Virupaksha 
temple, built by one of Vikramaditya IPs queens, was most 
likely due to workmen brought from Kanchipuram, and to their 
-direct imitation of the Kailasanatha temple which had come 
into existence in the Pallava capital some decades earlier. ‘ There 
is a bold beauty/ says Brown, 6 in the appearance of the 
Virupaksha temple as a whole, which is best seen in the exterior. 
It is a comprehensive scheme as it consists not only of the central 
structure, but of a detached nandi pavilion in front, and it is 
contained within a walled enclosure entered by an appropriate 
gateway.’ It measures 120 feet from the front of the porch to the 
back of the shrine, and the studied grouping of its parts produces 
a very pleasant total effect. The heaviness of the stonework is 
relieved by an increase in the amount and quality of the sculpture. 
The main shrine, distinct from the mandapa , has a pradakshina 
path. The pillared mandapa has thick walls with perforated 
stone windows. The square sikhara rises in clearly defined storeys 
each of considerable elevation. The external wall surface is 
divided by pilasters into well spaced ornamental niches filled alter- 
nately with windows and sculptures. The sculptures include repre- 
sentations of Siva, nagas and ndginis , and scenes from the 
Ramayana. To cite Brown once more: 4 The sculpture flows into 
the architecture in a continuous yet disciplined stream. . . . The 
Virupaksha temple is one of those rare buildings of the past in 
which the spirit still fingers of the men who conceived it and 
wrought it with their hands.’ The neighbouring Sangamesvara 
temple, built some years earlier, is very much in the same style 
but has an open mandapa. 

Progress in the erection of structural temples did not mean the 
cessation of rock-architecture, which continued to flourish to the 
end of the ninth century. Its final manifestation occurred in three 
localities, namely: Ellora, already in the occupation of Buddhists 
for over 200 years; the islands of Elephanta and Salsette near 
Bombay; and the Pallava kingdom in the far South. At Ellora, 
the brahminical group (spread over half a mile along the west 
face of the hill) contains sixteen temples. They fall into three or 
four types. The simplest is still much under the influence of the 
Buddhist \ihdra and is just a pillared portico with a cella beyond, 
like the Dasavatar cave. The second type was similar to the first 
except for the passage round the cella, as in Ravana-ka-khai and 


442 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


Ramesvara. In the third type, the shrine stands in the centre of 
a cruciform hall having more than one entrance to it, as in the- 
Dumarlena, the temple at Elephanta, and the Jogesvara in Salsette. 
Lastly, the culmination of this architecture came in the monolithic 
temple of Kailasa which stands in a class by itself and in which 
an entire structural temple in all its details is carved out of the 
living rock. 

Of the first type, the Dasavatar is the largest and best example. 
A rock-cut entrance leads to an open courtyard of irregular shape 
with a detached shrine in its centre, probably a nandi-mandapa . 
Beyond this lies the facade of the temple, in two storeys defined 
by two rows of square pillars one above the other. Each floor 
consists of a large pillared hall, the pillars being generally 4 simple 
square prisms with flat abacus capitals \ But the architecture was 
only meant to furnish the framework for the gigantic sculptures of 
Hindu mythology adorning the large sunk panels between pilasters 
at regular intervals on the surrounding walls. The sculptures on 
one side are mostly Vaishnava while those on the other are entirely 
£aiva. One of the finest of these sculptures is that of the death 
of Hiranyakasipu, 

Both the Ravana-ka-khai and the Ramesvara of the second type 
are simple in their plan. On each side of the entrance to the 
monolithic cella in the Ravana-ka-khai are carved a number of 
figures, including two dvdrapalas ; and within is a broken image 
of Durga. On the walls of the pillared hall are recesses between 
pilasters carrying bold sculptures in high relief, Saiva subjects on 
the south and Vaishnava on the north. The Ramesvara contains 
a lingam in the cella guarded by giant dvdrapalas and is remarkable 
for the wealth of carving which adorns it in all its parts. The 
handling of the female figures in particular shows 4 a feeling for 
grace of pose and voluptuous beauty which is instinctive \ 

The Dumarlena (PI. Via), the only example of the third type at 
Ellora, has three separate entrances, one at the front and one on 
each wing. Tt is much larger than the previous types in its area 
and in the scale of its parts, and the fight entering the temple from 
three different directions makes the interior much more impressive 
than in the other types. The central feature of the lena is a massive 
shrine guarded by huge dvdrapalas by the sides of each of its four 
doorways, reached by flights of steps. 4 Leading up to this shrine 
and partly encircling it, is the main hall, a fine rectangular gallery 



ART AND ARCHITECTURE 


443 


150 feet long and 50 feet wide divided into a nave and aisles by a 
colonnade of five pillars on each side, including the two forming 
the principal entrance.’ Flanking the main hall are the transepts 
leading to the two lateral entrances, the width across the temple 
between the side-entrances being the same as its depth. Each of 
the three entrances is a wide pillared opening approached by a 
flight of steps guarded by sejant lions mounted on pedestals on 
either side. The pillars within the temple are of huge proportions, 

15 feet high and 5 feet wide at the base, and carry 4 cushion ’ 
capitals. 

The second example of this type on the island of Elephanta, 
near Bombay, resembles the Dumarlena in many ways but is some- 
what smaller (130 feet by 129 feet). But the Elephanta temple is 
better than all others of its kind in its sculptures, particularly those 
on the back wall. There are three large square recesses separated 
by pilasters each bearing a huge dvarapala. The panel on the left 
contains a representation of Ardhanari, the hermaphrodite form 
of Siva, while the corresponding one on the right contains figures 
of Siva and Parvati. In the central recess is the famous colossal 
three-headed bust (PI. IVb) long called Trimurti but in reality a 
representation of Mahesa. Of this magnificent sculpture Grousset 
remarks: ‘The three countenances of the one being are here 
harmonized without a trace of effort. There are few material 
representations of the divine principle at once as powerful and as 
well balanced as this in the art of the whole world. Nay, more, 
here we have undoubtedly the grandest representation of the 
pantheist God ever made by the hand of man. In a magnificently 
poetic outburst Rodin has celebrated “ this full, pouting mouth, 
rich in sensuous expressions, these lips like a lake of pleasure 
fringed by the noble, palpitating nostrils Indeed never have 
the exuberant vigour of life, the tumult of universal joy expressing 
itself in ordered harmony, the pride of a power superior to any f 

other, and the secret exaltation of the divinity immanent in all 
things found such serene expression.’ 

A third example of this style, the temple of Jogesvari (c. 800) in 
Salsette, is larger than the others, measuring 250 feet in a straight 
line, but has no other remarkable features about it. 

The last type, a complete monolithic structural temple, is repre- 
sented by the unique example of Kailasa at Ellora (PI. V), 
excavated under Rashtrakuta Krishna I. In its general plan, it 


444 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


bears a certain resemblance to the Virupaksha temple at Patta- 
dakal though it is more than twice its size. The temple resolves 
itself into four parts — its main body, the entrance gateway, a nandi 
shrine in between, and cloisters round the courtyard. Supple- 
mentary chambers, probably of a slightly later date, have been 
cut on the sides of the courtyard, that in the north wall called the 
Lankesvara being a large, pillared hall. The entrance to the 
temple is on the west, and its main body measures roughly 150 
feet by 100 feet, with projections at intervals throughout the entire 
height of the structure. The lofty and substantial plinth 25 feet 
in height is marked by heavy mouldings, above and below, while 
the central face is taken up by a magnificent series of elephants 
and lions seeming to support the structure (PL VIb). We cannot 
do better than quote the description from Percy Brown: 

‘ Standing high on this plinth,’ says Brown, ‘ is the temple pro- 
per, approached by flights of steps leading to a pillared porch on 
its western side, and it is here that its designers rose to the greatest 
heights. There is no pronounced departure from the conventional 
combination of the mandapa and the vimana , but the manner in 
which various architectural elements, all definite and sharply out- 
lined, such as cornices, pilasters, niches and porticos, have been 
assembled in an orderly and artistic manner to form a unified 
whole, is masterly. Then over all rises the stately tower in three 
tiers, with its prominently projecting gable-front, and surmounted 
by a shapely cupola, reaching up to a total height of 95 ft. But 
this is not all. Around the wide space of the platform at the base 
of the vimana five subsidiary shrines have been fashioned out of 
the rock, each an elegant reproduction to a reduced scale of the 
main theme, to which they serve as a refrain. The interior consists 
of a pillared hall, from which a vestibule leads to the cella. This 
ball is a well-proportioned compartment measuring 70 feet by 62 
feet having sixteen square piers in groups of four in each quarter, 
an arrangement which produces a cruciform central aisle with an 
effect of great dignity.’ 1 

Noteworthy in the remaining parts of the scheme are the two 
dhvajastambhas 51 feet high, one on each side of the nandi shrine, 
in themselves striking works of art, which mark an important stage 
in the evolution of the Southern pillar style. Lastly the sculptural 
decoration of the entire temple fits its parts admirably and forms

the crowning glory of the monument. The vigorous representation 
of Ravana’s attempt to uproot mount Kailasa specially deserves 
to be noted. 

Also at Ellora are five Jaina excavations, all probably of the 
ninth century, but only three of them are notable. One is a copy 
of the Kailasa, about a fourth of its size, and is known as Chota- 
Kailasa. The other two — Indrasabha and Jagannathasabha — are 
both two-storeyed. Indrasabha is the larger and finer. The 
sculptures in its upper storey, as well as its frontage comprising 
three sides of a quadrangle elaborately carved into a fagade with 
two storeys, are remarkable features. 

Remains of frescoes can be found on the ceiling of the porch 
on the second storey of the temple known as Rangmahal (probably 
because of the coloured decoration which once covered all its 
interior). The paintings are of two periods, the earlier contem- 
porary with the excavation and therefore of the eighth century, 
the second much later. The later layer overlaps and partly conceals 
the earlier and is decidedly inferior. The earlier painting is clearly 
related to the Ajanta school. Vishnu and Lakshmi borne through 
the clouds by garudas of the human type, a rider upon a horned 
lion and pairs of gandharvas floating amongst the clouds can be 
identified among the paintings, besides representations of lotus 
pools with elephants, fish, and so on. The quality of the painting 
is already much removed from the style of Ajanta with features 
connecting it with the medieval style of Gujarat. 

In the far South, the Pallavas bridge the transition from rock- 
architecture to structural stone temples. Their architecture and 
sculpture constitute a most brilliant chapter in the history of South 
Indian art. Its first phase was entirely rock-cut and comprised 
two groups of monuments: one the pillared mandapas , all of the 
reign of Mahendravarman I, who gloried in the construction of 
temples without the use of bricks, timber, metals or mortar; and 
the other, including similar but more elaborate mandapas and 
monolithic temples known as rathas, all of the reign of Narasimha- 
varman I Mahamalla and his immediate successors. The mandapas 
of the Mahendra group are simple pillared halls with one or more 
cellas cut into the back wall. The main feature of the front fagade 
is a row of pillars each 7 feet high, the shaft being square in section 
with a two-foot side above and below, and the comers chamfered 
in the middle third to give an octagonal section. A heavy bracket 


446 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


provides the capital. In the earliest examples (Mandagappajtu 
and Trichinopoly), there is no cornice above the pillars, but later 
a roll moulding was added as at Pallavaram In still later exam- 
ples, e.g. Mogalrajapuram, the roll cornice carries at intervals a 
new ornament known as the kudu which is really a much reduced 
version of the Buddhist caitya window. 

The rock-cut temple of Anantasayana at Undavalli (Guntur 
•district) and the series at Bhairavakonda (North Arcot district) 
towards the end of Mahendra’s reign attempt a departure from 
the very plain treatment of the earlier examples. Undavalli is 
probably an attempt to copy a Buddhist vihara and consists of 
four storeys of pillared mandapas set one above the other and 
rising to a height of 50 feet. But it is in the elaboration of the 
pillars of Bhairavakonda that the beginnings of a distinctive Pallava 
* order ’ can be traced, and the figure of a lion is introduced and 
combined with the pillar in its lower portion and another in the 
capital. This order of pillar and capital was further refined and 
developed into a column of striking elegance in the productions 
falling in the second group called after Mahamalla. 

All the examples of the Mahamalla group are found in the now 
deserted seaport town of Mamallapuram (Mahabalipuram) at the 
mouth of the Palar river, 32 miles south of Madras. A large 
granite hill 100 feet high, half a mile in length from north to south 
and a quarter of a mile wide, and a smaller granite outcrop further 
south, admirably served the purpose of the talented Pallava 
sculptors. Mamallapuram must have been a busy port with its 
royal residences, bazaars, warehouses and harbour. All the secular 
buildings of relatively perishable material have disappeared but the 
halls and sculptures quarried out of the natural rock with a 
religious intent have survived. There can be little doubt that 
Mamallapuram was one of the chief entrepots of South India and 
that from it streamed forth strong cultural influences which shaped 
the art of Hindu colonies in Indonesia and Indo-China. 

Clear traces survive of a carefully-designed system to supply the 
town with fresh water drawn from the Palar river and distributed 
to all parts of the port; and it is quite possible that the remarkable 
open-air sculpture ‘ The Descent of the Ganges * (PL VII), long 
known as ‘ Aijuna’s Penance % was not unrelated to this system. 
This vast sculpture, in high relief, is nearly 30 yards long and 23 
feet high, covering the sea-face of the cliff. There is a cascade in 



ART AND ARCHITECTURE 


447 


a natural fissure in the middle of the rock in which a band of nagas 
and nagls sport and symbolize the sacred waters, and on both sides 
are sculptured figures of deities, human beings and animals of all 
kinds approaching or facing the fissure in attitudes of adoration. 
4 What we have before us here,’ says Grousset, ‘ is a vast picture, 
a regular fresco in stone. This relief is a masterpiece of classic 
art in the breadth of its composition, the sincerity of its impulse 
which draws all creatures together round the beneficent waters, 
and its deep, fresh love of nature.’ 1 A small shrine immediately 
to the left of the cascade contains the standing figure of Siva. 
Before this temple is bowed the emaciated figure of Bhaglratha 
who is represented also above practising tapas with upraised arms. 
Among the sculptured animals, the monumental elephants on the 
right and the ascetic cat imitating the posture of Bhaglratha’s 
penance with trustful mice playing at its feet are particularly note- 
worthy, as also the pair of deer which look on the scene * from the 
mouth of a cave opposite, on the left hand side, with the life-like 
action of the stag scratching his nose with his hind foot \ More 
amazing still in its masterly realism is the detached family of 
monkeys sculptured in the round * with the male picking vermin 
off the female while she suckles her two little ones \ 

There are all together ten mandapas of the Mahamalla style on 
various sites on the main hill at Mamallapuram. All of them 
exhibit much progress from the simple style of the Mahendra caves 
though they still retain more or less the same general character 
and proportions as before. None of them is a large structure. 
Generally speaking the dimensions are: fagade, 25 feet wide, 15-20 
feet high, depth (including cella) 25 feet; pillars, 9 feet high, sides 
1-2 feet at their widest; cellas, rectangular, each side 5-10 feet. 
The pillars are the main features. The roll cornice above them 
in front is decorated with kudus. Above the comice is a parapet 
formed of miniature shrines alternately long and short. In the 
interior, pilasters and mouldings on the walls supply a suitable 
frame for the sculptural figures of mythological subjects. Some of 
the more developed pillars, like those on the exterior of the 
Mahishasura mandapa and in the fagade of the Varaha mandapa , 
look singularly graceful. But the two inner columns of the former, 
both lion pillars, are the best of the whole lot. The fluting and 
bands of their shafts, the graceful necking (tadi\ the beautiful

448 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


‘ melon ’ capitals (kumbha) and the lotus form (idal) above, with 
the wide abacus ( palagai ), combine very well to produce the typical 
Pallava ‘ order \ Notable among the sculptures are the magni- 
ficent rehefs of the Varaha and Vamana avatdras , of Surya, Durga 
and Gajalakshmi, and two fine groups of royal figures representing 
Simhavishnu and Mahendravarman with their queens, all in the 
Varaha cave. The vivid dramatic effect and the sureness in the 
groups of figures characteristic of these sculptures marks other 
reliefs also, such as the sleep of Vishnu on the serpent Ananta, 
and the battle of Durga with the buffalo demon Mahisha, both in 
the Mahisha mandapa, and Krishna raising the Govardhana in the 
Panca Pandava mandapa . 

Mention must be made in passing of the existence of rock-cut 
mandapas in the Pandya country. These have not received much 
attention, but doubtless they were contemporary with the Pallava 
mandapas and are more or less in the same style. One prominent 
example with sculptured scenes on its walls is found at Tirupparan- 
kunram, near Madura, hidden behind a good-sized medieval temple 
of Subrahmanya and serving as its garbhagriha. Other instances 
of temples built in front of rock-cut mandapas are known, e.g. at 
&ingaperumal-kdyil in Chingleput district. 

The monolithic rathas popularly called the Seven Pagodas, 
though in the same style as the mandapas , are obviously copies 
of wooden religious structures with all the details of timber 
work faithfully reproduced in granite. None of their interiors is 
finished and they do not seem ever to have been actually used. 
There are eight of them all together, the southern group called 
after the names of DraupadI, Aijuna, Bhlma, Dharmaraja and 
Sahadeva, and three others in the north and north-west called 
Ganesa, Pidari and Valaiyan-kuttai. The rathas are only of 
moderate size, none of them being more than 42 feet long, 35 feet 
broad or 40 feet high. The DraupadI ratha is merely a cell, a 
copy of a thatched structure, with its base supported by animal 
figures, a lion alternating with an elephant. All the other rathas 
are copies of the vihara or the caitya. The vihdra type is pyramidal 
in shape, and the Dharmaraja is a good example of the style. It is 
a small square hall in the centre with pillared verandahs below and 
a pyramidal sikhara above. Its plinth has many strong mouldings 
and its porticos with lion pillars greatly improve the appearance. 

‘ This type of design,’ says Brown, ‘ is not only an effective production 



ART AND ARCHITECTURE 


449 


in itself, but it is a storehouse of pleasing forms and motifs, 
besides being replete with potentialities.’ 

The Bhima, Sahadeva and Ganesa rathas are of the caitya type, 
oblong in plan, with two or more storeys, and barrel roofs with 
gable ends. The Sahadeva is apsidal, a form adopted in some 
later Pallava and early Chola temples, the shape of the latter 
specially designated gajaprishtha (‘ elephant back ’). The Ganesa 
is entered through a pillared portico on its long side. The oblong 
plan, diminishing storeys and barrel roofs with pinnacles ( kalasas ) 
and gable ends of these rathas may well have suggested the design 
for the later gopuras , or entrance towers of temples. All these 
rathas were most probably Saiva in character and the figure sculp- 
ture on all of them is of the same high quality as in the mandapas . 
Men and gods are sculptured in the most graceful forms, and the 
animal sculpture is superb. Deities have four arms, dvarapalas 
only two. For some unknown reason work on these monoliths 
was left incomplete, and we enter on the second phase of Pallava 
architecture marked entirely by structural temples in stone. 

These structural temples again fall into two groups — the Raja- 
simha group (c. 700-800), and the Nandivarman group (800-900). 
There are six examples of the former: three at MamaUapuram 
(the Shore, Isvara and Mukunda temples), one at Panamalai (South 
Arcot district), and the temples of Kailasanatha and Vaikuntha- 
perumal at Kanchipuram. The earliest of them was doubtless the 
Shore temple (PL Villa). Its excellent workmanship is proved 
by its having withstood, in a very exposed position, the action of 
wind and sea and the shifting sands of the shore. The plan of 
the temple is somewhat unusual. Its cella faces the sea and is 
located almost at the water’s edge. The usual adjuncts to the 
temple had therefore to be accommodated in its rear. A massive 
enclosing wall surrounds the central building and entry into the 
open courtyard is obtained from the west. Two additional shrines 
were attached as an afterthought to the western end of the main 
shrine, one of which has a smaller vimdna and presents the appear- 
ance at first sight of being the main entrance. These additions go 
far to account for the unusual, though by no means unpleasing, 
appearance of the Shore temple with its two vimdnas . Clearly the 
buildings in this temple are a logical development from the 
Dharmaraja ratha, allowance being made for the change from the 
rock-cut to the structural technique. At the same time there is a 
29

marked attempt, particularly in the treatment of the vimanas, to 
leave the idea of the vihara behind and evolve a lighter and more 
rhythmic tower. The lion motif, particularly, in the pilasters 
becomes more developed, and in the Shore temple, as Brown 
remarks, * this heraldic lion, erect and holding up a Dravidian 
capital, projects from every angle, and is also introduced at 
intervals around the lower part of the entire building The outer 
enclosure contained a system of shallow cisterns holding water 
brought by conduits, any overflow being led into the sea. The 
parapet of the imposing surrounding wall was crowned by figures 
of couchant bulls and all round the exterior there were boldly 
carved lion pilasters at close intervals. The richly ornamented 
doorway on the west led into a mandapa of which only the 
foundations remain. 

Not long after the Shore temple came the Kailasanatha at 
Kanchipuram built mostly in the reign of Rajasimha though 
the actual completion of the structure owed something to his 
son Mahendravarman. In its original form, the temple con- 
sisted of a sanctuary with its pyramidal vimana and a detached 
pillared hall or mandapa in front, the whole enclosed in a rectan- 
gular courtyard by a high wall composed of cells. The mandapa 
and the sanctuary were joined together centuries later by an inter- 
mediate ardhamandapa which has spoiled the total effect. The 
sanctum and the vimana conform to the type of the Dharmaraja 
ratha except for the subsidiary shrines. These are seven in number, 
one at each angle of the sanctum and one in the middle of each 
free side, and they add greatly to the beauty of the whole. All the 
main features of the Pallava style are assembled together in this 
temple in a very fascinating way. The cells in the interior of the 
enclosing wall which bear traces of painting, ‘ the design of the 
wall itself with its parapet of cupolas ’, the sturdy pillars of the 
mandapa and the constant repetition of the lion pilaster, all fit 
into the scheme admirably. The vimana is a further development 
from that of the Shore temple and is at once substantial and well- 
proportioned. The entrance to the courtyard is by means of small 
openings on the sides of a large subsidiary temple, the Mahendra- 
varmesvara, built in such a manner as to suggest the beginnings 
of the gopuram. The builders of the Kailasanatha temple would 
seem to have exercised some thought in selecting their building 
materials as its foundations are of granite and able to carry a great

weight, while sandstone was used for the sculptured superstructure. 
The action of time has rendered many repairs necessary and these 
have not always been effected with discrimination. 

Perhaps the most mature example of Pallava architecture, 
however, is the Vaikunthaperumal (PI. VHIb). Slightly larger 
than the Kailasanatha, its principal parts — cloisters, portico, and 
sanctum — are no longer separate buildings but are amalgamated 
into a well-articulated structure. The sanctum is a square with 
sides of nearly 90 feet, and its front is carried forward 28 feet on 
the east to provide the portico. The whole is enclosed by a high 
outer wall which is decorated outside with simple and effective 
ornamental motifs, while inside it are the open ambulatory and 
the cloisters with a colonnade of lion pillars and sculptures 
inscribed with the leading events of Pallava history. The portico 
is a square with sides of 21 £ feet, its ceiling supported on eight 
pillars. A vestibule leads from it to the rectangular cella over 
which rises the vimana . This vimana is square in plan with sides 
of 47 feet and reaches a height of 60 feet from the ground. It has 
four storeys, ‘ each with a passage round its exterior, a cella in 
the centre, and a corridor encircling two of these for circumambu- 
lation 

The second group of Pallava structural temples, the Nandi- 
varman group, mostly consist of small temples and in no way form 
an advance on the achievements of the previous age. The principal 
examples are the Muktesvara and Matangesvara at Kanchipuram, 
the Vadamallisvara at Oragadam, near Chingleput, the temple of 
Virattanesvara at Tiruttani near Arkonam, and the Parasurames- 
vara at Gudimallam (near Renigunta). Perhaps the earliest in 
the group are the two temples at Kanchipuram, which both have 
porticos supported on two pillars at the entrance. The other four 
temples of this group are all apsidal in character, possibly based 
on the example of the Sahadeva ratha at Mamallapuram. These 
modest structures are witnesses to the decline of Pallava power. 
To the Pallavas, however, belongs the credit of having kept up 
and developed the traditions of Amaravatl and transmitted them 
to lands beyond the seas where in course of time there arose vast 
monuments which threw even the splendid achievements of the 
mother country into the shade. 

The Cholas were the inheritors and continuers of the Pallava 
traditions in temple construction. They built numberless stone

temples throughout their kingdom, but to the end of the tenth cen- 
tury the buildings were not very large. Unlike the great imperial 
designs of the early eleventh century, they imply limited resources 
and local developments. The district of Pudukkottai contains an 
unusually large number of early Chola monuments, in a good 
state of preservation, which give a very good idea of the stages 
by which later Pailava architecture grew into the Chola style 
proper. Among them, the Vijayalaya-Cholesvara at Narttamalai 
has the first claim on our attention. This temple was most 
likely built in the time of Vijayalaya, the first Chola ruler of 
the period. It faces west, and is one of the finest examples of 
the early Chola style. It has the unusual arrangement of a circular 
cella within a square prakdra . Above the cella and prakdra rises 
the vimana in four diminishing storeys of which the three lower 
ones are square and the uppermost circular, the whole surmounted 
by a dome-shaped sikhara with a round kalasa on top. There is 
an enclosed mandapa in front. The external walls are adorned 
with ornamental pilasters with characteristic features of the Chola 
4 order \ There are no niches in the walls and a frieze of bhutas 
is carved below the curved cornice at the top, the cornice itself 
being decorated at intervals with kudus containing human heads 
or animal figures, while at the corner the decoration takes the 
form of very pleasing scroll work. Above the cornice is another 
frieze of lions (vydlas), changing at the corners into the form of 
a makara head. The parapet over the ceiling carries miniature 
shrines {panjarams ), which are square in plan at the comers and 
rectangular elsewhere. The panjarams are also repeated in the 
lower storeys of the vimana . The pillars in the mandapa in front 
are still of the Pailava style, square at the base and top and 
octagonal in the middle. The corbels carrying the roll ornamenta- 
tion have a slightly raised, plain, medium band. Over the main 
entrance is an elegantly carved floral design, and on either side of 
it are two dvarapalas inside niches 5 feet high facing forwards, but 
with their bodies half-turned towards the entrance, one leg crossed 
over the other. They have only two arms, as in Pailava monu- 
ments. Round the main temple in an open yard are seven small 
sub-shrines, all facing inwards, all built of stone and resembling 
the main temple in essential features. This arrangement of seven 
or eight sub-shrines round the main temple was typical of the 
early Chola period. The Balasubrahmanya temple of Kannanur

<Pudukkottai), built in the reign of Aditya I, is another temple in 
the same style in which, however, elephants take the place of nandis 
.at the four comers of the roof of the shrines and below the sikhara 
in the vimana , the elephant being the vehicle of Subrahmanya. 

The beautiful little temple of Nagesvara at Kumbakonam is 
more or less of the same period and style, but its most remarkable 
feature is the sculptures found in the niches on its outer walls. 
The central niche on each side of the cella enshrines the usual 
<3eity — Ardhanarl on the west, Brahma on the north, Dakshinamurti 
on the south — but the others carry almost life-size sculptures of 
men and women in such high relief as to appear almost in the 
Tound; they are in graceful attitudes and are undoubtedly portraits 
either of donors to the temple or contemporary princes and 
princesses. There are other sculptures of Puranic scenes in some- 
what low relief in small squares on the plinth below the pilasters 
of the walls of the cella, which remind one of the art of the 
goldsmith or of the carver in wood. 

The next stage of evolution is best represented by the temple 
of Koranganatha at Srinivasanallur (Trichinopoly district), built 
in the reign of Parantaka I. The temple has a total length of 50 
feet, the cella being a square of 25 feet and the mandapa in front 
n rectangle 25 feet by 20 feet. The height of the sikhara is 50 feet. 
The interior is a small hall with four pillars, and a vestibule and 
passage beyond lead to the cella, a square chamber of 12 feet. 
As in the other examples already noticed, there is in this moderate- 
sized temple a general simplification in its parts, an avoidance of 
oxcess in ornamental detail combined with an appreciation of the 
walue of plain surfaces. The lion motif disappears from the pillars 
though it is reproduced in friezes at suitable stages. The interior 
pillars are typical of the Chola * order \ In the words of Brown, 

* two changes from the Pallava type of order are discernible, one 
relating to the capital itself, the other to the abacus above. In 
the capital a neck moulding has been introduced where it joins on 
to the shaft, thus appropriating to itself a segment of the upper 
part of the shaft, and adding another member to the lower part of 
the capital in the form of a vessel or pot ( kalasa ). As to the 
abacus, the palagai or “ plank 99 is much expanded, so that, com- 
bined with the flower shape (idal) underneath, it becomes the most 
striking element in the order.’ The central niches outside the walls 
of the cella enshrine the usual deities: Dakshinamurti on the south 


454 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


seated beneath a tree with devotees, lions, and ganas on either 
side, a standing Vishnu on the west, and a standing Brahma on 
the north. Other niches contain standing figures which may be 
portraits. All the sculptures are in very high relief and of fine 
workmanship. 

The Muvarkoil (‘Temple of the Three’,) in Kodumbalur 
(Pudukkottai) is another early Chola temple-complex notable 
alike for the fineness of its architecture and the beauty of its 
sculptures. These three vimanas forming the central shrines amidst 
a group of sub-shrines were built in the second half of the tenth 
century by Bhuti Vikramakesari, a feudatory of Ghola Parantaka II. 
A big monastery in charge of the Kalamukha preceptor Malli- 
karjuna was attached to them. The three central shrines are all 
21 feet square at the base. They are separated from one another 
by about 10 feet and stand on a north-south line and face west. 
The central and southern shrines are intact, but of the northern 
only the moulded basement remains. Each of these shrines had 
an ardhamandapa , about 18 feet square. Common to all the three 
and at a distance of 8 feet Irom the edge of the ardhamandapas 
was a mahamandapa, 91 feet north to south by 41 feet east to west. 
In front of the mahamandapa, placed centrally at a distance of less 
than 2 feet, was a small nandi shrine, a square with sides of a little 
over 1 1 feet. Midway between the nandi shrine and the main 
entrance is a plinth 5 feet 9 inches square — either the balipitha or 
dhvajastambha. Around the whole group was a covered cloister 
with fifteen sub-shrines of slightly varying dimensions but all 
miniatures of the main shrines. The fifteen sub-shrines are dis- 
tributed as follows: two on either side of the main entrance 
of the western wall, four each on the inside of the northern and 
southern walls, and three on the eastern wall behind the main 
shnnes. The outer enclosure was a massive stone wall 3 feet 4 
inches thick with an entrance gdpura on the western side which 
must once have been a fair-sized structure, though smaller than 
the principal vimanas. The doorway below is 4 feet 6 inches wide. 
There was another entrance 4 feet wide on the north-east comer 
leading down a flight of steps to a circular stone well 10 feet in 
diameter just outside the wall. The three principal shrines have 
been conceived as padmakosas, one of the lowest mouldings in 
the basement simulating the petals of a full-blown lotus The 
other architectural features are the same as in other temples, only

more finely wrought. The frieze of ganas below the cornice has 
been made particularly interesting by the variety which the crafts- 
man has introduced into the attitudes, actions and countenances of 
its members. Noteworthy among the sculptures on the walls of 
the vimana , or on loose-lying slabs, are several forms of Siva such 
as Ardhanari, Vinadhara Dakshinamurti, Gajari, Andhakasura 
Samharamurti, Kiratamurti, Gangadhara, Harihara, Umapra- 
sadana, Chandrasekhara and Kalari, besides Chandra, Surya, 
Uma, Jyeshtha, Saptamatrikas and Mohinl. 

Temple building received great impetus from the conquests and 
the genius of Rajaraja I and his son Rajendra. In the early years 
of Rajaraja, many temples larger than the specimens so far 
described, but still of moderate size, sprang up in different parts 
of his growing empire. One of the most remarkable — unique for 
the wealth and detail of its sculpture — was the Tiruvalisvaram 
temple at Brahmadesam in the Tinnevelly district. Its garbhagriha 
is square; the yali frieze on the plinth consists of the full figures of 
the animal, not of the bust alone as elsewhere. The gcma frieze 
below the cornice is very well composed and shows figures in 
different dance poses or otherwise engaged in merriment; some 
have comic features, like lion- or monkey-faces and pot bellies, 
and the whole scene of dancing, mockery and music is very 
humorously portrayed. The entire cornice is elaborately embel- 
lished by designs of foliage and creepers in the spaces between the 
kudus which are themselves highly ornate arches surmounted by 
simhamukhas (‘ lion faces ’). The first storey of the vimana carries 
a number of fine sculptures of the greatest interest for the icono- 
graphy of the period. On the southern side there is the figure of 
Nataraja in the centre with Vrishabharudha and Gangadhara on 
the proper left, and Virabhadra and Devi on the proper right. 
On the western side, the centre is taken by Lingodbhava flanked by 
Vishnu and Brahma. To the proper left are Kalarimurti and 
Kiratamurti and on the other side Yogadakshinamurti and Uma- 
sahita. Gajari occupies the centre on the northern side with 
Chandesanugraha and Sukhasanamurti on the proper right, and 
Somaskanda and an unidentified figure on the left. The eastern 
side is hidden by the thick brick terrace over the ardhamandapa 
put up in modern times. The second storey of the vimana repro- 
duces on a reduced scale the ornamental features of the exterior 
of the garbhagriha including the friezes of ganas and ydlis and the 



456 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


cornice. On the top of the second storey are placed four magni- 
ficent recumbent bulls, very life-like, one at each comer and facing 
outwards. In the centre rises an octagonal plinth with the grivd 
and the domical eight-ribbed sikhara above. The grivd has niches 
at the cardinal points bearing figures of a Vyakhya-dakshinamurti 
on the south, Yoganarasimha on the west, Brahma on the north, 
and Indra on the east. Over the highly ornate sikhara are the 
mahdpadma and pattikd with the stupi above. The ardhamandapa 
in front of the temple is coeval with it, but the mahamandapa was 
a later addition, perhaps of the reign of Rajendra I, while the 
shrine of the goddess is later still, probably dating from the 
thirteenth century. The Uttara Kailasa shrine at Tiruvadi (Tanjore 
district), the Vaidyanatha temple at Tirumalavadi (Trichinopoly 
district), the twin temples to Siva and Vishnu at Dadapuram 
(South Arcot district), and Sivadevale No. 2 at Polonnaruva 
(Ceylon) arc some of the more notable among the many small 
temples of Rajaraja’s reign, though none of them approaches 
TiruvaliSvaram from the standpoint of sculpture. 

The maturity of Chola architecture found expression in the two 
magnificent temples of Tanjore and Gangaikondasojapuram. The 
superb Siva temple of Tanjore, completed about 1009 (PI. IX), 
is a fitting memorial to the material achievements of the time of 
Rajaraja. The largest and the tallest of all Indian temples, it is 
a masterpiece constituting the high-water mark of South Indian 
architecture. The vimana , the ardhamandapa , mahamandapa , and 
the large nandi pavilion in front are all aligned in the centre of a 
spacious walled enclosure, 500 feet by 250 feet, with a gopura 
gateway in front on the east. On the inner side of the high 
enclosing wall runs a pillared corridor connecting together a 
number of sub-shrines raised at the cardinal points and at intervals 
along the four sides. A second gopura in front of the first forms the 
gateway of a second and outer enclosure. The main feature of 
the whole scheme is the grand vimana towering to a height of nearly 
200 feet over the garbhagriha in the west and dominating every- 
thing in its vicinity. Its great dignity is due to the simplicity of 
its parts — the * square vertical base, the tall tapering body and 
over all the graceful domical finial \ The vertical base is a square 
with sides 82 feet long rising perpendicularly to a height of 50 feet. 
Above it is the pyramidal body mounting up in thirteen diminishing 
tiers, the width at the apex being equal to one-third of its base. 



ART AND ARCHITECTURE

* On the square platform thus formed stands the cupola, the inward 
curve of its neck producing a pleasing break in the otherwise rigid 
outlines of the composition, while the bulbous dome poised like a 
light but substantial globe is a fitting finish to its soaring character. 5 
The lowest vertical portion is divided into two storeys by a massive 
cornice, the only striking horizontal feature of the vimdtia. The 
walls above and below this cornice are adorned with ranges of 
pilasters combined with several ornamental devices and dividing 
the wall-space into a number of elegantly proportioned compart- 
ments. The middle of each compartment is occupied by a niche 
containing a sculptured figure-subject of high quality. In the 
tapering section the horizontal lines of the diminishing tiers inter- 
sect vertical disposition of the ornamental shrines and thus produce 
an ‘ architectural texture of great beauty \ Lastly, the rounded 
cupola with its winged niches on all four sides relieves * the severity 
of the outline just where this is required \ 

The cella is a 45-foot square inside with a narrow circumambu- 
latory passage 9 feet wide around it. The inner walls of this 
passage contain fine frescoes coeval with the temple (Frontispiece) 
but overlaid by later tempera work of the Nayak rulers of Tanjore. 
The cella enshrines an enormous lingam originally called Rajarajes- 
vara and now known as Brihadlsvara. Its height with its pedestal 
occupies the space of both the storeys. In front of the cella is a 
transept reached by flights of steps on the south and north, and 
the walls of the garbhagriha and ardhamandapa on either side are 
adorned with pilasters and large niches, the same as the outer 
walls of the shrine. The entrance to the shrine-chamber is guarded 
by two large dvarapalas in niches. The roof of the transept is 
supported by two rows of four piers each. In front of the transept 
is the ardhamandapa (also a two-storeyed structure) on the same 
plinth with the same type of pilasters and niches. Then comes 
the mahdmandapa with rows of pillars along the middle and aisles 
on either side. In front of the mahdmandapa is another transept 
reached by flights of steps on the north and south. The relatively 
small mandapa added to this with another flight of steps in front 
is a very late accretion. Some yards away in front is the nandi- 
mandapa containing one of the largest monolithic bulls known in 
South India. The outer walls of the ardhamandapa contain niches 
carrying sculptures of gods and goddesses of considerable mono- 
graphic and artistic interest. The whole temple from the heavily

moulded parts of its high basement to its finial is a magnificent 
example of solidity combined with proportion and grace of form. 

The temple of Gangaikondasolapuram, the creation of Rajaraja’s 
son Rajendra, was evidently meant to excel its predecessor in every 
way. The town which once surrounded it, as also the large lake 
of fresh water that once adorned the neighbourhood of the Chola 
capital, have now disappeared, and this fine temple therefore stands 
in the solitude of the wilderness except for the mud huts of a small 
village nearby. Erected about 1030, only two decades after the 
temple of Tanjore and in much the same style, the greater elabo- 
ration in its appearance attests the more affluent state of the Chola 
empire under Rajendra. It is larger in plan though not so tall, 
the vimana being 100 feet square at the base and 186 feet high. 
The temple, which forms a large rectangle 340 feet long and 110 
feet wide, occupies the middle of an immense walled enclosure 
partly designed for defensive purposes, as may be seen from a 
substantial bastion at the south-east angle and a smaller one on 
the west. Its main entrance is on the east, next to which is the 
mahamandapa , a rather low building 175 feet by 95 feet with over 
150 pillars of ordinary design. These pillars are arranged in colon- 
nades on a solid platform 4 feet high which is divided by a wide 
passage or aisle down the centre while a narrower passage on the 
same level is carried round the hall. Between the mahamandapa 
and the sanctuary is a transept with doorways to the north and 
south, ‘ both deeply recessed side entrances approached from out- 
side by flights of steps \ As in Tanjore, there are in the transept 
two rows of massive square piers, eight in all. 

The vimana has the same construction as in Tanjore but the 
number of tiers making up the pyramidal body is only eight as 
against thirteen in Tanjore. The most important difference lies in 
the introduction of curves in the place of the strong straight lines 
of the Tanjore vimana . The pyramidal body is slightly concave in 
its outline at its angles while the sides are curved to produce a 
somewhat convex outline. These curves enrich the beauty of form 
of the vimana though they detract from its stateliness and power. 
Of the two vimdnas considered together Brown observes: ‘ Each is 
the final and absolute vision of its creator made manifest through 
the medium of structural form, the one symbolizing conscious 
might, the other sub-conscious grace, but both dictated by that 
“ divinity which has seized the soul 



ART AND ARCHITECTURE 


459 


The scheme of decoration and sculpture on the outside of the 
walls is also the same as in Tanjore, but the style is more ornate. 
The Chandesvara shrine to the north of the vimana is a small 
structure of the same style and period as the main temple. The 
separate temple of the goddess, a medium-sized structure with a 
vimana following the Tanjore model more closely, appears to have 
been built not long after the main shrine. 

The Chola style continued to flourish for a century longer and 
expressed itself in a very large number of temples all of which 
cannot be mentioned here. But two large temples deserve parti- 
cular mention as being almost worthy of comparison with the two 
largest specimens described above. They are the temple of 
Airavatesvara at Darasuram (Tanjore district), a magnificent struc- 
ture typical of the stage of architectural development reached in 
the age of Rajaraja II, and the Kampaharesvara at Tribhuvanam 
near Kumbakonam which has survived intact as built by Kulot- 
tunga III though with a few later accretions by way of subsidiary 
structures. The architecture and sculpture of both these temples 
have many features in common with those of their predecessors. 

The Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and 
bronzes, many of which are masterpieces. The Tanjore inscrip- 
tions mention a number of bronzes in groups illustrating the 
sacred legends of Saivism but they have all disappeared. Among 
existing specimens in the various museums of the world and in 
the temples of South India may be seen many fine figures of 
Siva in his various forms, Brahma, the seven mothers, Vishnu 
and his consorts Lakshml (PI. XI) and BhudevI, Rama and 
Sita with their attendants, the Saiva saints — the figures of Sam- 
bandar being most numerous among them, the infant Krishna 
dancing on the serpent Kaliya, and many other subjects. The 
statues often compare most favourably with the finest of the 
stone sculptures of the various schools mentioned above. Though 
conforming generally to iconographic conventions establish- 
ed by long tradition, the sculptor worked in great freedom 
in the eleventh and twelfth centuries and his productions show 
classic grace, grandeur, and perfect taste. This art is seen at its 
best in the numerous images of the Divine Dancer, Nataraja 
(PL X). ‘ Whether he be surrounded or not by the flaming 
aureole of the tiruvasi (prabhamandala ) — the circle of the world 
which he both fills and oversteps — the King of the Dance is all

rhythm and exaltation. The tambourine which he sounds with 
one of his right hands draws all creatures into this rhythmic motion 
and they dance in his company. The conventionalized locks of 
flying hair and the blown scarfs tell of the speed of this universal 
movement, which crystallizes matter and reduces it to powder in 
turn. One of his left hands holds the fire which animates and 
devours the worlds in this cosmic whirl. One of the god’s feet is 
crushing a Titan, for “ this dance is danced upon the bodies of the 
dead ”, yet one of the right hands is making the gesture of 
reassurance (< abhayamudra ), so true it is that, seen from the cosmic 
point of view and sub specie aetemitatis , the very cruelty of this 
universal determinism is kindly, as the generative principle of the 
future. And, indeed, on more than one of our bronzes, the King 
of the Dance wears a broad smile. He smiles at death and at life, 
at pain and at joy alike, or rather, if we may be allowed so 
to express it, his smile is both death and life, both joy and 
pain. . . . From this lofty point of view, in fact, all things fall into 
their place, finding their explanation and logical compulsion. Here 
art is the faithful interpreter of the philosophical concept. The 
plastic beauty of rhythm is no more than the expression of an 
ideal rhythm. The very multiplicity of arms, puzzling as it may 
seem at first sight, is subject in turn to an inward law, each pair 
remaining a model of elegance in itself, so that the whole being of 
the Nataraja thrills with a magnificent harmony in his terrible joy. 
And as though to stress the point that the dance of the divine 
actor is indeed a sport, ( lila ) — the sport of life and death, the sport 
of creation and destruction, at once infinite and purposeless — the 
first of the left hands hangs limply from the arm in the careless 
gesture of the gajahasta (hand as the elephant’s trunk). And lastly 
as we look at the back view of the statue, are not the steadiness 
of these shoulders which uphold the world, and the majesty of 
this Jove-like torso, as it were a symbol of the stability and 
immutability of substance, while the gyration of the legs in its dizzy 
speed would seem to symbolize the vortex of phenomena? ’ 1 

Under the Pandyas the builders began to divert their attention 
from the central shrine to the outlying portions of the temple. 
They sought to emphasize the sanctity of the shrine by making the 
entrances to the enclosures containing it into vast towered gate- 
ways of imposing size and appearance, and thus the gopuras came

to form immense piles and provided a basis for a wealth of 
sculptural embellishments. Generally the two lowest storeys of 
the gopura are vertical and built of solid stone masonry, a stable 
foundation for the high pyramidal superstructure of brick and 
plaster. These gopuras are some of them firm and rigid in their 
contours with straight sloping sides while others have somewhat 
curved and concave outlines imparting to them an impressive 
upward sweep. In the latter class the sculpture is of a more florid 
character. The pillar also underwent a further evolution under 
the Pandyas: the idal became more pronounced with a scalloped 
edge, the corbel was moulded into a pendant or drop, and the 
palagai increased in width. Pandya architecture generally spent 
itself in embellishing existing temples by adding outer mandapas , 
additional sub-shrines and gopuras , rather than in building entire 
temples. One of the early examples of the Pandya gopura is that 
in the second enclosure wall of the temple of Jambukesvara on the 
island of Srirangam, a twelfth-century structure, still retaining 
many features of the Chola style. Later and more typical Pandya 
gopuras are the Sundara Pandya gopura also at Jambukesvara and 
the eastern gopura of the temple of Chidambaram, both mid- 
thirteenth century. In Pandya art, in general, is seen an attempt 
to produce a more elegant effect by an increase of decorative detail 
which may be taken to mark the transition from the restrained 
maturity of Chola architecture to * the exquisite though extravagant 
productions of Vijayanagar \ 

Mention must also be made of two Jaina monuments of parti- 
cular interest at Sravana Belgola, both creations of Chamundaraya, 
the minister of the Ganga king Racamalla IV. One of them is the 
Chamundaraya basadi , the largest and finest of a number of Jaina 
temples on the side of the Chandragiri hill. It measures 70 feet in 
length together with the portico on its eastern front and its width is 
36 feet. It must have been built originally about a.d. 980 although 
in its present form the structure is typical of Chola architecture of 
the early twelfth century. The other monument is the stupendous 
monolithic image of Gommata, son of the first Tirthankara, rising 
to a height of 56 feet on the hill known as Indrabetta. This colossus, 
carved about a.d. 983, represents the ascetic standing entirely 
nude and absorbed in meditation with ant-hills rising at his feet 
and plants winding themselves about his limbs. Two similar but 
smaller statues, also monoliths, were made in Kanara, one over

40 feet high at Karkala in 1432, and the other at Yenur, about 
35 feet high, in 1604. One feature common to Jaina temples of 
the South is the manastambha standing in front of the temple on 
a wide square base of several moulded steps. The column is 
generally square in the lower part but becomes circular above and 
bears ‘ shallow flutes crossed by lateral bands at regular intervals \ 
The capital is generally a fluted vase supporting an elaborate super- 
structure carried on an abacus supported by figures of rampant 
gryphons. Some of these free-standing pillars are over 50 feet in 
height and are in themselves impressive works of art. 

The temples built in the western Deccan under the Chalukyas 
of Kalyani developed features which received their most mature 
expression in the architecture of the Hoysala temples in Mysore. 
These temples often had their principal entrances not at the front 
but at the sides, and the decoration of their external walls with 
architectural motifs dividing the wall into well-proportioned areas 
tended to be singularly graceful and restrained, while their vimanas 
were a compromise between the plain, stepped storeys of the early 
Chalukyas and the closely moulded tiers of the Hoysala style. 
The pillars were turned on lathes and had a pronounced knife-edge 
very considerably projected below the capital. The doorways, 
both at the outer entrance and of the shrine-chamber, were very 
elaborately carved with fine detail and finish. The Navalinga 
(Nine Lingas) and Kallesvara temples at Kukkanur near Gadag 
are perhaps the earliest examples of this style and possibly date 
from the close of the tenth century, though they still bear resem- 
blances to the early Chalukyan group of Aihole and Pattadakal. 
From among the numerous other examples of this style spread 
over the entire area of the Chalukyan empire, the temples of 
Kasi-visvesvara at Lakkundi, of Mahadeva at Ittagi and of 
Mallikarjuna at Kuruvatti may be mentioned as the most typical. 

The builders of Hoysala temples invariably used a dark stone 
of much finer grain than the large unwieldy blocks of sandstone 
used by the early Chalukyas. The change of material made it 
possible for the masonry of the Mysore temples to be better 
finished and the sculptures to be carved in more minute and 
exquisite detail. In general, the Hoysala temple comprises a 
central structure surrounded by walls containing a number of cells 
with a pillared verandah or cloister in front. The main building 
contained the cella with a vestibule in front known as sukhandsi

and connecting with a pillared hall ( navaranga ). In front of this 
there was often an open pillared pavilion, the mukhamandapa. 
In many cases, the Hoysala temples are not single but double, 
having all essential parts duplicated; indeed they are frequently 
even built in triplicate, quadruplicate, and, occasionally, even 
quintuplicate. Another notable feature was the star shape of the 
external walls of the main shrine, set on a high platform, the sides 
of which project or recede with lines and angles parallel to those 
of the building it supports. The platform is much wider than the 
temple, leaving a flat surface all round to serve as the pradakshina- 
patha for which there is no provision inside. The general treatment 
of wall surfaces is marked by a large number of horizontal friezes 
imposed upon one another. The walls of the vimana are divided 
into three horizontal divisions while those of the pillared hall have 
only two; but a wide continuous cornice binds the two parts of 
the structure together. In both, a high and almost vertical basement, 
9 or 10 feet high, (PL XIII) is made up of a number of sculptured 
animal friezes running right round the building. The lowest band 
is usually a procession of elephants; the next, of horsemen. Then, 
after another band of spiral foliage, and on a level with the eye, 
is a wider frieze depicting a succession of Puranic scenes executed 
with great effect and a considerable wealth of detail. Above this 
is a border of yalis with spirals of foliage issuing from their mouths, 
and crowning all is a running frieze of hamsas. The basement of 
the pillared hall is terminated above by a ‘ sloping seat-back ’ 
( dsana ) above which rise the external pillars of the hall with their 
moulded shafts at regular intervals, the spaces between the columns 
being filled by perforated stone screens. 

The three horizontal divisions of the vimana are even more ornate 
than the two of the hall. The basement, which is continuous with 
that of the hall, is just the same. Above it, the broad space 
corresponding to that taken up by the pillars and screens of the 
hall is adorned with ornate niches containing images of gods under 
foliated canopies, each one so elaborately chiselled (and often 
signed by the sculptor) as to constitute a more or less distinct work 
of art (PI. XII). The rich effect of all this statuary is enhanced by the 
star shape of the structure which produces vertical planes like facets 
and provides an abundant variety of light and shade. The sikhara 
separated by the wide projecting cornice from the body of the 
temple below keeps the stellate formation, but its vertical lines are 


464 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


balanced by horizontal mouldings so that the whole tower appears 
as an orderly succession of diminishing tiers terminating in a low 
finial having the shape of a parasol at its apex. Miniature shrines 
and niches adorn each of these tiers 
The shape of the pillar and its capital was another remarkable 
feature of this style. The shaft is a monolith fashioned into beauti- 
ful shapes by being turned on a lathe, the base being left square. 
A sloping bracket-stone was set above the capital, to which it was 
fixed by sockets. These brackets, also monolithic, carried carvings 
of fine images with leafy aureoles known as madanakai figures. 
Their high finish rivals that of the figures in the niches of the vimana. 

These Hoysala temples, though basically developments of the 
South Indian style, represent an art which applies to stone the 
technique of the ivory worker or the goldsmith (PL XII, XIII). The 
wealth of jewellery borne by many of the figures, the variety of 
head-dresses and other details are well calculated to give a fair idea 
of the social life of the times. A very typical and complete example 
of the style is the Kesava temple at Somanathapur twenty miles 
from Seringapatam. It is a triple shrine in the shape of a cross, 
87 feet by 83 feet, with only one enhance on the east, set within 
a rectangular courtyard surrounded by sixty-four cells, the whole 
enclosure measuring 215 feet by 177 feet. 6 So well balanced and 
finely proportioned are its parts that no element obtrudes or is 
out of place, and although the three stellate towers are only 30 feet 
high they are fully in accord with the rest of the building.’ 

A larger and earlier example is furnished by a group of 
temples at Belur dating from about 1117 of which the temple 
of Chennakesava is the centre. Its superstructure is now missing 
but clearly when complete it must have been a work of surpassing 
beauty. It has three entrances, one on each of the free sides of 
the pillared hall, ‘ approached by a flight of steps flanked by a 
pagoda-like shrine, the last a useful note of architectural emphasis \ 
On the main pillars of the hall and its recessed ceiling the sculptor 
has bestowed the largest amount of attention. The hall is 92 feet 
by 78 feet and the total number of pillars is forty-six. All of 
them, except the four in the central bay, are of different design so 
that the variety and complexity of the whole is astonishing. Each 
pillar must have been the handiwork of a separate artist and his 
assistants, an arrangement which set the masters of the art to 
compete with one another in the production of their finest work.

The temple of Hoysalesvara at Halebid was perhaps the highest 
achievement of the school though its present ruined condition — 
for it lacks the whole of its superstructure — renders it difficult to 
realize this. This grand temple was designed and erected by 
Kedaroja, the master-builder of Narasimha I, under the super- 
vision of Ketamalla, chief officer of the public works. It is a 
double temple, two complete structures exactly alike built side 
by side and connected by their side transepts. Each measures 
112 feet in length and about 100 feet in width. The infinite wealth 
of sculpture over the exterior of this temple makes it one of the 
most remarkable monuments of the world and an unrivalled 
4 repository of religious thought expressed in plastic form \ 

In the kingdom of Kalinga (Orissa) many temples were built 
from the ninth to the thirteenth century in the North Indian style. 
Bhuvanesvar contains the main group, numbering over thirty. 
Within fifty miles of it are two of the largest and most important 
monuments of the locality, the temple of Jagannath at Puri and 
that of the Sun at Konarak. There is also a small group in the 
south of Mukhalingam on the coast of the Ganjam district. The 
Mukhalingam series may well be taken to count among the earliest 
examples and to date from the ninth century, if not earlier, as it 
contains architectural features bringing it into unmistakable rela- 
tion with the early Chalukyan temples of the Deccan. The most 
striking example in the group is the Mukhalingesvara, comprising 
five shrines — a central sanctuary with four minor shrines one at 
each corner. In its decorative features the temple shows traces 
of both Chalukya and Gupta influences. 

In Orissa the sanctum (usually a square building) is called deul y 
and the assembly hall in front of it bears the name jagamohan . 
In larger temples there are two other parts, the natmandir or 
dancing hall in front of the jagamohan , and the bhogmandir in 
front of the natmandir — all aligned on one axis. These halls stood 
on a plinth and were invariably of one storey comprising a cubical 
portion below with a pyramidal roof above. Pillars are conspicuous 
by their absence here. In larger halls where support was necessary 
to sustain the weight of the pyramidal roof four solid piers were 
introduced, ‘ one at each corner of a four-square system of roof- 
beams \ Indeed one chief characteristic of the Orissan temple is 
the plain treatment of the interior in striking contrast with the 
profusely ornamented surfaces of the exterior.

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


The temple of Parasuramesvar and the Vaital deul at Bhuva- 
nesvar are two early examples of the period 750-900. They are of 
great interest as throwing light on the origins and affiliations of 
the style. The former has a deul and jagamohan with an overall 
length of 48 feet, and the sikhara over the deul is 44 feet high. The 
hall is a low rectangular structure with a double roof, plain, 
massive eaves, a doorway on each of its three free sides, and two 
rows of three pillars each in the interior supporting the ceiling of 
the nave which was higher than that of the aisles. The original 
deul must have fallen into decay and been rebuilt later, as is evident 
from the joint between it and the hall, and from the difference in 
the character of the sculpture on the walls of the two buildings. 
The shape of the sikhara is rather thick-set and rudimentary. Two 
stone grilles, one on each side of the doorway on the west, contain 
representations of young dancers and musicians with their instru- 
ments, a work of considerable artistic merit. Large blocks of 
stone were employed in the construction with no mortar or other 
cementing material. While this feature and some others connect 
the temple with early Chalukya temples at Aihole, the pilasters 
with vase and foliage capitals and other ornamental modes would 
seem to be derived from Gupta art. 

The Vaital deul is notable for its barrel-roofed sikhara , its small 
supplementary shrines at the corners of its jagamohan (making it 
virtually a nascent pahcayatana shrine), and for the well-balanced 
arrangement of all its parts. A small structure measuring only 
18 feet by 25 with a height of 35 feet, it is a very pleasing blend of 
well-marked Southern and Northern forms. 

The second period, from 900-1100, is represented by the small 
temple of Muktesvar (975) on the outskirts of Bhuvanesvar, and 
by the two very large temples of Lingaraja at Bhuvanesvar (1000) 
and the Jagannath at Puri (1100). The Muktesvar registers a 
considerable advance on the earlier period and is one of the few 
temples of the region containing sculptured decorations in the 
interior. The Lingaraja (PL XIV) occupies the centre of a large 
quadrangle 520 feet by 465 feet enclosed by a high and massive 
wall with a platform inside making for easy defence when necessary. 
Within the enclosure are many small shrines, replicas of the central 
temple. The Lingaraja has all the parts of a large temple though 
the napnandir and the bhogmandir were later additions. The most 
striking feature of the temple is the great sikhara over the deul 



ART AND ARCHITECTURE 


467 


-which dominates the whole town by its height (125 feet) and volume. 
The plastic decoration of its external walls is of absorbing interest 
and gives ample evidence of the fertile invention of the artists. 

The construction of the Jagannath at Puri was begun about 1100 
by Anantavarman Chodaganga but was not completed till much 
later. It is built on the same plan as the Lingaraja and consists 
of four parts in one alignment. The extreme length is 310 feet 
and the width 80 feet. The tower is nearly 200 feet high. As it 
-stands on an eminence, the temple with its soaring sikhara is an 
imposing landmark for many miles around. Except for its im- 
press ive proportions this temple is no improvement on the 
Lingaraja, of which it is a close imitation. The action of sea air 
has rendered extensive renovations necessary from time to time 
and these have also detracted from the original appearance of the 
structure. The natmandir is a large square with a side of 80 feet, 
and its ceiling is borne on 16 pillars in four rows of four each, the 
one real example of a pillared hall in Orissa. There are some 
30 to 40 minor shrines round the main temple and the whole group 
is enclosed within three concentric walls, known as ‘the three 
garlands with gateways in the centre of each side. These gate- 
ways are substantial structures with pyramidal roofs and bear no 
resemblance to the gdpura of South India. 

The third and last period (1100-1250) of the Orissan style is 
represented by a number of medium-sized temples, all remarkable 
for the richness and finish of their appearance. There are at least 
a dozen at Bhuvanesvar, most having only the two essential parts, 
the deul and the jagamohan . One striking example, the Ananta- 
vasudeva, also has the natmandir and bhogmandir as later additions. 
This gives the temple a total length of 125 feet with a breadth of 
40 feet, and a tower of 68 feet. As the whole structure is built on 
a substantial plinth, it presents a very impressive effect. Another 
temple, the Rajarani, has its deul completed but not its jagamohan , 
but the unfinished condition of the latter gives a fair idea of the 
technical methods followed by the sculptors of the time. The 
completed deul is very refined in its curves, contours, and in the 
disposition of decoration on the tower, and may almost be said 
to have started a new mode in the embellishment of sikharas which 
was carried further in the temples of Khajuraho in Central India. 
The deul of the Rajarani temple is placed diagonally to the hall in 
its front, a rather unusual arrangement for Orissa.

A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


But undoubtedly the greatest achievement of the period was the 
temple of the Sun at Konarak, some twenty miles from Puri along 
the sea-coast in a north-easterly direction. Built by king Nara- 
simhadeva (1238-63), the ruined mass of this temple, popularly 
known as the Black Pagoda, is a prominent landmark in the 
locality. It may be doubted if it was ever quite completed as it 
seems that the foundations began to give way before the heavy 
superstructure was finished. ‘ The conception of this temple/ 
says Brown, ‘ was that of a genius, but its colossal grandeur out* 
stripped the means of execution. ... It was however a magnificent 
failure, for without unduly straining the imagination, it is possible 
to see, even in its ruin, that it was one of the finest architectural 
efforts the Indian master-mason ever made.’ The whole temple is 
fashioned like a wheeled chariot being drawn by the seven horses 
of the Sun. There are twelve giant wheels each nearly 10 feet 
high on either side of the immense plinth while the wide flight of 
steps in the front is flanked by seven richly caparisoned horses 
* rearing and straining in their harness as they strive to drag its 
great bulk along The nafmandir was a separate structure with 
a pyramidal roof on a high square plinth in front of the temple 
and reproducing all its main features on a smaller scale. Round 
it were a number of supplementary shrines and other accessories 
all enclosed within a courtyard 875 feet by 540 feet with pyramidal 
gateways on three of its sides. The immense surfaces of the walls 
of the temple and its accessories are decorated with many sculp- 
tured forms — some of outstanding beauty, but others of a crudely 
erotic character. Only the jagamohan , a square hall 100 feet long 
with a stepped pyramidal roof 100 feet high, remains in a tolerable 
state of preservation. Notable among the subsidiary structures is 
the ornate temple of Ramachandra in the south-western portion of 
the enclosure. Many colossal groups of sculptures, some of them 
superb works of art intended to occupy salient positions in the 
structure, are lying loose on the ground (PI. XV). Among them are 
two spirited war-horses and the statues of Surya and of Ganga. 
The decorations on the walls of the main temple include every 
motif and subject known to the Indian mind, carved with minute pre- 
cision. It has at its basis a frame of vertical and horizontal courses 
which combine to produce an astonishingly beautiful impression. 

A variation of the Northern style flourished in the north-western 
part of the Deccan from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries. 


ART AND ARCHITECTURE 


469 


The most striking feature in this Deccani type of temple is the 
design of the sikhara which has a well-marked vertical band carried 
from the lower cornice right up to the finial at each of its angles. 
The space between these bands is filled in with rows of small 
replicas of the sikhara itself, each one supported on a pedestal of 
suitable size. This principle of using miniatures of the entire 
-structure as decorations on its sides is applied in other parts of the 
temple also with generally very pleasing results. In the larger 
'examples the sanctum is laid out on a diagonal arrangement; and 
the shaping of the walls also undergoes a marked elaboration by 
means of projections and recesses of the wall-surfaces — sometimes 
carried to excess. Horizontal mouldings, many of them with a 
knife-edged section named kani , break the vertical effect of the 
treatment of the wall-surface. The pillars were generally lathe- 
turned, had kani moulding, and were richly carved throughout, 
though sometimes the lower third was left simply as a plain square 
prism. Even the largest of these Deccani temples does not exceed 
80 feet in length, but they are all very well proportioned, the unit 
furnishing the proportion of the various parts being the height of 
the monolithic pillar in the interior. 

One of the earliest temples and perhaps the finest in this group 
is that of Ambamath in the Thana district of Bombay. Erected 
about 1060 in a delightful situation, by the side of a long deep 
pool, the temple is covered with intricate decoration of a lavish 
but tasteful design. The two essential parts of the temple are both 
set diagonally astride the axis making an attractive plan 90 feet 
long by 75 feet in width. A series of vertical projections and 
recesses break up the sides and multiply the shadows and lights. 
There are three doorways, one on each of the free angles of the 
assembly-hall. There is much excellent carving in the panels of 
the ceiling and its shallow domes, but the pillars of the main hall, 
especially the four columns in the centre, are particularly elabo- 
rately decorated with conventional designs and figure subjects. 
A smaller but beautiful replica of Ambamath is found at Balsane 
in Khandesh in the midst of a number of other temples probably 
built over a period of more than a century. One of these is almost 
an exact copy of a rock-cut vihdra . The Gondesvara temple (first 
half of the twelfth century) at Sinnar (Nasik district) is a pahed * 
yatana, the main temple being surrounded by four smaller supple- 
mentary shrines in the same style, all upon a moulded, stepped 



470 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 

platform measuring 125 feet by 95 feet. The main shrine occupies, 
the centre of the platform with a nandi pavilion in front. There 
is a falling off in the quality of the sculpture which seems to indicate 
a decline in technique. 

In the latter half of the thirteenth and early fourteenth century 
were built a number of temples marked by their heavy proportions 
and a scarcity of external figure sculpture. They are generally 
referred to as in the Hemadpanti style— Hemadri, or Hemadpant. 
as we have seen, being a minister of the last Yadava rulers of 
Devagi ri and reputed to be the builder of many religious edifices. 
Examples of this style are not confined to the Deccan but extend 
to Madhya Pradesh (the Berars) also. 

Under Vijayanagar, South Indian art attained a certain fullness 
and freedom of rich expression in keeping with the general con- 
sciousness of the great task of the empire, namely the preservation 
and development of all that remained of Hinduism against the 
onslaughts of Islam. In this period, temples became very elaborate 
both in structure and organization; even old temples were amplified 
by the addition of pillared halls, pavilions and other subordinate 
structures. The most characteristic of such additions is the kalydna- 
mandapa, generally put on the left in the courtyard of the temple 
as we enter it from the east. This is a very ornate pillared pavilion 
with a raised platform in the centre 4 for the reception of the deity 
and his consort at the annual celebration of their marriage 
ceremony \ The goddesses invariably came to have separate 
shrines of their own, a development of which the beginnings go 
back to the late Chola period. Another feature was the so-called 
4 thousand-pillared mandapa \ a huge hall with many rows of 
pillars. In fact the varied and complicated treatment of the pillar 
was perhaps the most striking feature of the Vijayanagar style. The 
shaft becomes just a core round which is grouped a vast amount 
of statuary of great size and sculptured in the round, 4 having 
as its most conspicuous element a furiously rearing horse, rampant 
hippogryph or upraised animal of a supernatural kind ’ — the whole 
of it, pillar and sculptures, being carved out of a single block of 
stone (PL XVI). Another type shows a cluster of miniature pillars 
encircling the central column, and so carved sometimes as to give 
out, when struck, the seven separate notes of Indian music. There 
were also other modes of treatment, but all pillars had ornamental 
brackets as part of their capitals, and below the bracket a pendant

which was elaborated in this period into an inverted lotus-bud. 
The tall entrance towers or gopuras , evolved under the Pandyas, 
continued in this period also. 

Buildings in the Vijayanagar style are distributed throughout the 
country south of the Tungabhadra, but the fine ,t and most charac- 
teristic group is to be found in the deserted city of Vijayanagar 
itself. The principal temples here are the Vitthala and the Hazara 
Rama, but there are also others of interest. 

The Vitthala is by far the most ornate temple. Begun in the 
time of Devaraya II, if not earlier, its construction was con- 
tinued even in the reign of Achyuta Raya, but was never entirely 
finished. The rectangular courtyard, 500 feet by 310 feet, with 
cloisters on the interior with a triple row of pillars, surrounds the 
temple. There are three entrances with gopuras , those on the east 
and south being more important. The main temple occupies the 
centre and there are five other structures mostly of the nature of 
pillared halls within the enclosure. The main temple is dedicated 
to Vishnu as Vitthala. It is a long (230 feet), low structure aligned 
from east to west, its height being only 25 feet. It comprises three 
distinct sections, the mahamandapa , an open pillared hall in front, 
an ardhamandapa , a similar closed hall in the middle, and the 
garbhagriha in the rear. The mahamandapa is impressive with its 
deeply recessed sides measuring 100 feet at its greatest length and 
breadth. It stands on a moulded plinth 5 feet high, with flights 
of steps guarded by elephants on its three free sides. A very wide 
double-curved eave surmounted by turrets of brickwork is its other 
notable feature. There are fifty-six pillars inside, each twelve feet 
high. Forty of them are disposed at regular intervals to form an 
aisle round the hall’s outer edge, and the remaining sixteen provide 
an oblong passage in the centre. The pillars are variants of the 
types generally described above and exhibit an amazing exuberance 
of the most ornate and vigorous carving. The rest of the temple 
is a unified structure, rectangular in shape, 135 feet by 67 feet, and 
its external walls are embellished with the usual arrangement of 
pilasters, niches and canopies. Besides the entrance from the 
mahamandapa on the east, the ardhamandapa has two side-entrances 
* each having steps and a pillared porch of some size \ Its interior 
is a square with sides 55 feet long, with a square dais at the centre 
and one pillar at each of its comers. The other pillars are disposed 
to form an aisle near the perimeter. The vimana is 75 feet long 



472 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


and 72 feet wide and includes a pradakshina path on the same level 
as the outer courtyard. This is entered by flights of steps descend- 
ing on either side of the vestibule connecting the garbhagriha with 
the ardhamandapa. Of the remaining structures, the kalydna - 
mandapa , as may be expected, throws the rest into the shade by 
the excellence of its statuary, although it is little more than half 
the size of the mahdmandapa . Near the kalydnamandapa and facing 
the entrance to the mahdmandapa is the ratha or chariot of the god. 
Its base and principal storey are carved out of a single block of 
granite with movable wheels, the superstructure of brick having 
disappeared. Similar stone cars are found in other temples of the 
period, for example at Tadpatri and Tiruvalur. 

The Hazara Rama temple, most probably the work of Viru- 
piiksha II, is a more modest but perfectly finished example of this 
style. Besides the main temple there are a shrine for the goddess, 
a kalydnamandapa and other subsidiary temples all enclosed in a 
courtyard by a wall 24 feet high. The enclosure is entered by 
means of a well-proportioned flat-roofed porch on the east, which 
leads to the assembly-hall with a group of four huge blackstone 
pillars, one at each corner of a central square. These pillars are 
of unusual design, cubes alternating with fluted cylinders in their 
shafts, all richly carved. There are two other entrances with 
porches to the hall — one on each side — leading to the courtyard. 
The vimana with its lower storey of stone and the pyramidal super- 
structure of brick, now much decayed, is impressive though it is 
less than 50 feet in height. The inner walls of the temple are 
decorated in relief with scenes from the Rdmdyana . 

Some secular buildings within the citadel of Vijayanagar of 
which the lower portions have escaped the fury of its destroyers 
deserve a passing notice. Two of these impressive basements 
stand out above many others — the King’s Audience Hall and the 
Throne Platform (or House of Victory, as it is sometimes called 
because it was intended to commemorate Krishnadeva Raya’s 
conquest of Orissa). These buildings go far to show that the 
encomiums bestowed on the architecture of the city by many 
foreign travellers were fully justified. Both terraces must have 
been surmounted by pillared pavilions with pyramidal roofs, 
several storeys high. The Audience Hall was a hall of a hundred 
pillars, ten rows of ten pillars each. The pillars evidently had 
square bases, cylindrical shafts and bracket capitals. The

basement, in three spacious diminishing stages one above the other 
with fine flights of steps and sides, was decorated by broad, bold 
mouldings and courses in conformity with the monumental charac- 
ter of the whole structure. The Throne Platform is also in three 
diminishing stages, square in plan, the lowest tier having sides of 
132 feet and the highest sides of 78 feet. The highest stage of the 
platform is decorated by extremely beautiful mouldings in stone 
while the two lower stages are more or less plain masonry plinths, 
carrying, however, bands of figures and animals of an entertaining 
character in low relief. 

In the rest of the empire Vellore, Kumbakonam, Kanchipuram, 
Tadpatri, and £rlrangam are justly celebrated for their temples in 
the style of this period. The kalydnamandapa of the temple at 
Vellore is considered to be the most beautiful structure of its kind, 
and its gopura is typical of the style of the century. The temple 
of Margasakhesvara at Virinchipuram (North Arcot district) is also 
remarkable for the exuberant treatment of its kalydnamandapa . 
The Ekamranatha and the Varadaraja temples at Kanchipuram 
contain pavilions of remarkable size, the pillars of which are notable 
even in this period for their * bizarre grouping of imaginative 
statuary Two gopuras of the temple of Ramesvara at Tadpatri 
are remarkable for their rich and exquisite carvings in the whole 
of the perpendicular part usually left comparatively plain. 4 These 
carvings,’ says Ferguson, ‘ are in better taste than anything else in 
this style.’ Lastly, the so-called ‘ horse court ’ or Seshagirimandapa 
at Srirangam contains a ‘ colonnade of furiously fighting steeds 
each rearing up to a height of nearly nine feet, the whole executed 
in a technique so emphatic as to be not like stone but hardened 
steel ’ (Brown). 

The last stages of Vijayanagar architecture are rightly known as 
the Madura style as they found most encouragement from the 
Nayaks of Madura. To some extent it was a revival and con- 
tinuation of the building methods of the Pandyas, which often 
took the shape of enlarging older temples by adding new parts to 
them. We may note in particular the provision of additional 
prdkdras by means of concentric outer enclosure walls, each prdkdra 
wall having generally four gopuras at the cardinal points, and 
enclosing important adjuncts to the temple like a hall of a thousand 
pillars or a sacred tank. Srlrangam, for instance, has seven such 
concentric rectangular enclosures. There is a tendency to multiply 



474 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


the pillars wherever possible, and some of them begin to bear on 
their shafts more than life-size statues of deities or donors. 

Among the more important temples of this period may be 
named those of Madura, Srlrangam and Jambukesvara, Tiruvalur, 
Ramesvaram, Chidambaram, Tinnevelly, Tiruvannamalai and 
Srivilliputtur. The temple of Madura is, perhaps, the most typical 
of them, most of it having been built at one time. It is a double 
temple, one dedicated to Sundaresvara and the other to his consort 
Minakshl. These two shrines take the largest space inside the 
main enclosure, an area 850 feet by 725 within a high wall, with 
four large gopuras towards the centre of each of its four sides. 
The main entrance is on the east and communicates with a beauti- 
ful pillared avenue 200 feet long and nearly 100 feet wide. This 
leads to a smaller gopura, the eastern entrance to the second 
prakara—z. rectangle 420 feet by 310, with a gopura in the middle 
of each of its sides smaller than the outer gopura. Most of this 
second enclosure is roofed in, while a part of the northern side 
is open. Within there is a smaller covered court, 250 feet by 160 
feet, entered by only one gateway from the east. It is outside this 
entrance that a very elaborate grouping of pillars, in some ways 
the most impressive part of the scheme, is found. Within the last 
enclosure is the main temple with the usual three compartments, 
the cella being surmounted by a sikhara which projects above the 
flat roof covering the whole of this part of the temple. All the 
corridors and halls in these enclosures have long colonnades of 
pillars in the characteristic style of the period offering vistas in all 
directions. The sanctuary of Minakshl is an enclosure attached 
to the southern side of the main temple and somewhat to its 
rear, and is a smaller replica of the main temple, roughly half its 
size. It measures 225 feet by 150 feet and is entered by two gopuras , 
a relatively small one on the east and a larger one on the west. As 
in the adjacent 6iva temple, the sikhara of the sanctum rises above 
the flat roof of the temple. In front of the temple of Minakshl is 
the Tank of Golden Lilies (PI. XVII), a reservoir 165 feet by 120 
feet, surrounded by steps and a pillared portico on the sides. Its 
picturesque appearance is enhanced by the background of the 
southern gopura , over 150 feet high, which is reflected on its surface. 
Near the north-east comer of the tank, a fair-sized gopura marks a 
processional passage from outside to the Minakshl temple, and 
constitutes an independent entrance to that shrine. The Hall of a 



ART AND ARCHITECTURE 


475 


Thousand Pillars in the north-east angle of the outer prakara 
covers an area 240 feet by 250 feet, and its front which faces south 
lies alongside of the wide, pillared approach to the main temple. 
Its interior is symmetrical in the arrangement of the pillars and 
includes a central aisle leading up to a small shrine of Sabhapati 
at its northern end. The sculptures on the pillars, says Fergusson, 
‘ surpass those of any other hall of its class I am acquainted with \ 
Outside the main enclosure but in axial alignment with the eastern 
gopura and separated from it by a street, is the Pudumandapam 
known also as 4 Tirumalafs choultry \ This is a large open hall 
350 feet by 105 feet, divided longitudinally into a nave and two 
aisles by four rows of pillars, all very elaborately carved. The 
pillars towards the centre of the hall bear life-size statues of the 
Nayak kings of Madura, the latest being that of Tirumalai, the 
builder of the mandapa. 

The additions made by the Nayaks of Madura to the Ranga- 
natha temple of Srlrangam contributed in no small measure to 
make it by far the largest of South Indian temples. The outermost 
prakara is a rectangle, 2,880 feet by 2,475. There are no fewer than 
six other prdkdras within, making in all seven concentric enclosures 
round the shrine in the centre. The three outer enclosures are 
as much parts of the surrounding town as of the temple, and are 
remarkable only for some of their gdpuras. Of the two incomplete 
gdpuras on the outermost wall, that on the south or main approach 
would, if it had been finished according to plan, have attained a 
height of nearly 300 feet. The temple proper may be taken to 
begin at the fourth court of which the outer wall measures 1,235 
feet by 849 feet, and has gdpuras on the north, south and east, the 
last being the finest and largest in the whole scheme Near this 
gopura at the north-eastern angle of the fourth enclosure is the 
Hall of a Thousand Pillars 500 feet by 160 feet. The celebrated 
‘ horse-court ’ is also in this enclosure. The next or third enclosure 
has gdpuras on the north and the south, but the latter opening 
into the fine pillared garudamandapa is the main entrance. 
This enclosure contains two tanks named after the Sun and 
the Moon. The second enclosure is a covered court occupied 
mainly by pillared halls with a long processional passage on the 
western side. It has two entrances, from north and south. Within 
is the innermost enclosure with its entrance on the south side, 
its sides being 240 feet by 181 feet. The sanctuary is a circular 





476 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


chamber set within a square compartment and surrounded by a 
larger rectangular chamber; its position is indicated by its golden 
domical vimdna projecting above the flat roof. 

The temple of Ramesvaram, planned and constructed on a 
unitary plan like that at Madura, is remarkable for its impressive 
pillared corridors which completely surround it besides forming 
avenues leading up to it. These passages vary in width from 17 
to 21 feet and have a height of about 25 feet. Their total length 
is calculated to be about 3,000 feet. 

The art of casting bronzes which began to be practised on an 
extensive scale under the Cholas continued to flourish under the 
rulers of Vijayanagar and their feudatories. The subjects of 
sculpture and the mode of treatment continued to be the same as 
before, but this period is remarkable for some actual life-size 
portraits which have survived, like those of Krishnadeva Raya and 
his two wives, of Venkata I, and others of doubtful identity, all 
in the Tirupati temple. Mention may also be made of a small 
stone statue in the round of Krishnadeva Raya in a niche in the 
doorway below the northern gopura of the temple at Chidambaram 
which he built in 1520. 

We may conclude with a brief sketch of the architecture of the 
Bahmani kingdom and its successors. In general the model of 
Delhi architecture was followed here even after the political bond 
with Delhi was snapped in 1347. No provincial style of Muslim 
architecture in India was less influenced by the surrounding indige- 
nous styles than the art of the Bahmani kingdom. From the 
beginning of the fifteenth century, however, other and more remote 
influences began to come into play. The Bahmani rulers were 
generous patrons of art, science and learning, and their court was 
as attractive to poets, scholars and artists as their army was to 
soldiers of fortune. Influences from the military architecture of 
Europe and the civil architecture of Persia come more into evidence 
here than in any other contemporary style of India. The Jami 
Masjid of Gulbarga is known to be the work of Persian architects. 
Others like the Chand Minar at Daulatabad (1435) and the college 
of Mahmud Gawan at Bidar (1472) are also dominantly Persian, 
and must have been the work mostly of architects and craftsmen 
from that country. Other structures show Persian inspiration in 
a more partial and indirect form. Towards the end of the fifteenth 
century, however, the Deccan reasserted itself and the influence 



ART AND ARCHITECTURE

of pre-Muslim styles appears strongly in the architecture of Bijapur 
on which Indian artists were employed in considerable numbers. 

Only two monuments can be ascribed with confidence to the 
period from 1294 to 1347 — the Jami Masjid at Daulatabad (c. 1315) 
and the Deval Mosque at Bodhan of the reign of Muhammad 
Tughlak. But both are only adaptations of Hindu shrines and 
have no real bearing on the history of Islamic art. There was 
much sound work during this period on the fortification of strong- 
holds, as at Daulatabad; but the history of military architecture 
has not yet been properly studied, and it is difficult to discriminate 
clearly between the work of successive periods or even between 
Hindu and Muslim. In Daulatabad (PI. XVIII), for instance, 
Yadava, Tughlak and Bahmani work met and combined. The 
inner citadel stands on an isolated rock 600 feet high. The outer 
wall is 2 4 miles in perimeter and in between the two there are three 
inner walls, all loop-holed and battlemented and furnished with 
fortified gateways, outworks and bastions, and so arranged that 
the maximum of fire could be concentrated on an assailant. In 
addition, a moat below the glacis surrounded the outer wall. The 
Bahmanis did much for military architecture as they had powerful 
enemies on all sides. Among the more important fortresses are 
Ellichpur, Gawilgarh and Namala in the north of Berar; Mahur, 
in Adilabad district, which served to keep in check the highland 
chieftains of Satpura and the wild tribes beyond the Wardha river; 
Parenda, Naldurg, Panhala and Gulbarga itself in the west; Bidar 
in the centre; Warangal and Golconda towards the east; and 
Mudgal and Raichur in the south-west corner. Some of these 
were taken over from conquered Hindu states but so transformed 
as to retain little of their original character. Raichur, for instance, 
was built in 1294 by a Hindu chieftain and Mudgal was once the 
seat of local Yadava governors. Bidar has walls 50 feet high and 
three miles in circumference, provided with battlements, bastions 
and outworks, all solidly constructed, and protected further by a 
triple ditch hewn out of solid rock. Parenda, a smaller fort tradi- 
tionally ascribed to Mahmud Gawan, is remarkable for the singular 
efficiency of its defences. It is a clear case of imitation from 
European models in military engineering probably due to for- 
eigners, Turks and others, in Bahmani service. But the architectural 
style is essentially local and ‘combines sincerity of purpose with 
an innate sense for the decorative ’ (Marshall). 



478 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


The capita] cities of Gulbarga and Bidar were the centres of 
the civil architecture of the Bahmanls. In the former are two 
groups of royal tombs — one near the south gate of the fort and 
the other to the east of the town. They fall into two patterns: 
single tombs, 4 simple square chambers crowned with battlements 
and corner turrets and roofed by a single dome, the whole standing 
on a low square plinth ’ ; and double tombs which are merely 
duplications of the single ones. In the treatment of details, changes 
are traceable from reign to reign. First, Sultan Hasan’s tomb is 
typical of the Tughlak style of Delhi. So also are the tombs of 
Muhammad Shah, Mujahid, and Daud. In that of Ghiyyas-ud- 
din, at the close of the fourteenth century, Hindu craftsmanship 
begins to appear in the carvings of the prayer niche. A generation 
later, the splendid mausoleum of Firuz Shah and his family, 
measuring externally 153 feet by 76 feet, bears witness to the grow- 
ing strength of this Hindu influence as well as to the new preference 
for Persian ornament, the former on the outside and the latter in 
the shining plaster and painted decorations of the interior recalling 
the rich designs of Persian book-binding and embroidery. 

At Gulbarga, Muhammad Shah built two mosques: the earlier 
and smaller one is now the Shah Bazar Masjid, austere in the 
simplicity of its style, imitating the Tughlak architecture of Firuz 
Shah’s reign at Delhi. The other, the famous Jami Masjid (1367) 
within the fort has stilted domes and narrow entrances typical 
of the Persian style, but otherwise belonging more to Delhi 
than to Persia. The squat arches of its cloisters, appearing here 
for the first time, become henceforth a familiar feature of Deccan 
architecture. The treatment of its courtyard is unique, for instead 
of being left open to the sky as usual it 4 is covered in by 63 small 
domes carried on arched bays, the cloisters at the sides being 
roofed with corresponding vaults, and light and air being admitted 
to the interior through open archways in their outer walls \ The 
building measures 216 feet by 176 feet overall and has four shapely 
domes at its four comers. A fifth and larger one dominating the 
whole is raised on a square clerestory above the prayer chamber. 
The dignified simplicity and grandeur of the structure place it in 
the front rank of such buildings and account for its undoubted 
influence on the subsequent development of the style. 

Bidar comes up from the time of Ahmad Shah Wali (1422-35). 
Here are two separate groups of tombs, one of later BahmanI

kings and the other of Barid Shahi. The former number twelve 
and resemble the Gulbarga tombs though ‘ their scale is larger, 
their domes loftier and more bulbous and their facades adorned 
with a greater multiplicity of arched recesses or screened windows \ 
The finest of them is that of Ahmad himself which has its interior 
decorated with brilliantly coloured paintings in the Persian style 
and bands of Kufic and other inscriptions worked out in letters 
of gold on a ground of deep blue or vermillion. Persianization is 
carried further in the Chand Minar at Daulatabad of the time of 
Ala-ud-din Ahmad Shah (1436-58), and in the tomb of that 
emperor, of which the facade is covered with enamel tiles in various 
shades of blue. But the Madrasa of Gawan in Bidar (1472) is the 
most remarkable building in the Persian style (PL XX). Three 
storeys in height with towering minarets at its two front comers, 
it covers an area of 205 feet by 180 feet. ‘ In it were a mosque, 
library, lecture halls, professors’ quarters and students’ cubicles 
ranged about an open courtyard, a hundred feet this way and that. 
The mosque and library were to the front of the building on either 
side of the entrance; the lofty lecture rooms (which rose to the 
full height of the three storeys) in the middle of the other sides; 
and the professors’ rooms in the corners — all planned for con- 
venience and comfort and amply provided with light and air.’ 
The comer towers are like the Chand Minar in form and the whole 
front facade between them was emblazoned with a glittering surface 
of encaustic tile work, ‘ which with its chevron patterning and deep 
bold bands of sacred texts, would challenge comparison with any- 
thing of its kind in Persia 

The Adil Shahi rulers of Bijapur made it one of the most magni- 
ficent cities in the whole of India. Coming into existence to meet 
the real need of a large town to serve as a fortified centre of 
administration, it had all the constituents of a state capital — 
palaces, mosques, tombs, mint and gateways. The material used 
in construction, the local trap, gives the whole city a sombre and 
monotonous look, a striking contrast with the cities in red sand- 
stone and white marble of contemporary Mughal architecture. 

The Jami Masjid begun by Adil Shah I about 1565 is one of the 
first buildings of importance and illustrates the style in its forma- 
tion. ‘ Never quite finished, it still lacks the frontage of the 
courtyard. The arcaded prayer hall has five aisles supported on 
massive piers and with its fine dome is very impress ive. Ornament 



480 


A HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 


has been sparingly used and the surfaces are finished with a coat 
of fine plaster which time has mellowed to a pleasant creamy tint. 
The central bay, however, is embellished with the most gorgeous 
array of patterns in colour and gold, work of a later hand which 
is not in keeping with the austere refinement of the rest. The 
Ibrahim Rauza, built at the end of the sixteenth century, is a 
highly ornate structure on a large scale. It consists of the tomb 
of Sultan Ibrahim II and its mosque, both on a raised terrace 
inside a walled enclosure, and may claim to rival the finest 
buildings of the Mughals. The tomb is the more important 
structure and its artistic finish, with carved decorations by local 
craftsmen, leaves nothing to be desired. 

The versatility of the Bijapur workman is seen in the contrast 
between the majestic proportions and breadth of treatment of the 
Gol Gumbaz, the tomb of Muhammad Adil Shah (Pl. XIX), and 
4 the exquisite detail of the miniature Mihtar Mahal \ The former* 
the most striking monument in the city, is a tour de force. Its dome 
is one of the largest of its kind and covers an area of no less than 
18,000 square feet. Under Muhammad (1627-56), Bijapur reached 
the height of its power and this monument is its expression. The 
scheme of the Gol Gumbaz includes 4 a mosque, a gateway and 
musicians’ gallery, a hostel and other annexes essential to a royal 
tomb, all disposed within an extensive walled enclosure \ It is 
doubtful if the entire scheme was completed. The tomb chamber 
is one of the largest single cells ever constructed — 4 a hall of noble 
proportions ’. Externally, apart from the vast size of the dome* 
4 the most arresting features are the octagonal turrets which project 
at each angle ’ and the heavy bracketed cornice below the parapet. 
Only three sunken arches relieve the wall-space between, and 
something seems to have been left incomplete here. The arrange* 
ment of the arches supporting the dome forms a skilful and artistic 
solution of a difficult problem of construction, that of gaining a 
circular platform for the dome from the square sides of the walls. 
The only other example of its kind was constructed at Cordova 
600 years earlier. 

The Mihtar Mahal (1620) is not a palace as its name implies but 
an ornamental gateway to the courtyard of a mosque. It is a 
tall graceful building with an upper storey consisting of an 
assembly-room. 4 Above this again is an open terrace surrounded 
by a high wall with oriel windows and a perforated parapet. On

each side of the facade are two slender ornamental minarets . . . but 
it is the projecting balcony window filling the entire space between 
that is the most striking feature. It is thrown out from the wall 
on a series of closely set carved brackets, and the wide eaves-board 
is supported by struts of stone so finely wrought with the chisel 
as to have every appearance of wood.’ The delicate prettiness of 
the whole structure is unrivalled. 

A few examples of secular Hindu architecture showing strong 
Islamic influence may also be noticed. The Lotus Mahal, a garden 
palace of Vijavanagar built about 1575, employs recessed and 
foliated arches of the Lodi type together with a pyramidal roof 
built up in tiers after the manner of the sikhara of a southern 
temple. The large palace in the fort at Chandragiri (early seven- 
teenth century) presents a magnificent fagade combining the same 
features with very pleasant results. On the other hand the palace of 
Tirumalai Nayaka at Madura (c. 1645), in which some European 
influence can also be traced in addition, is imposing by its large 
dimensions, but lacks satisfactory co-ordination of the architectural 
features drawn from different sources.
