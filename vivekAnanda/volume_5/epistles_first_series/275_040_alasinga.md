## XL

NEW YORK,  
*14th May, 1895*.

DEAR ALASINGA,

. . . Now I have got a hold on New York, and I hope to get a permanent
body of workers who will carry on the work when I leave the country. Do
you see, my boy, all this newspaper blazoning is nothing? I ought to be
able to leave a permanent effect behind me when I go; and with the
blessings of the Lord it is going to be very soon. . . . *Men* are more
valuable than all the wealth of the world.

You need not worry about me. The Lord is always protecting me. My coming
to this country and all my labours must not be in vain.

The Lord is merciful, and although there are many who try to injure me
any way they can, there are many also who will befriend me to the last.
Infinite patience, infinite purity, and infinite perseverance are the
secret of success in a good cause.

Ever yours with blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.
