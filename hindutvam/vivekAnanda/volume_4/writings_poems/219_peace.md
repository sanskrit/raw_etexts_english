## PEACE

(Composed at Ridgely Manor, New York, 1899.)

Behold, it comes in might,  
The power that is not power,  
The light that is in darkness,  
The shade in dazzling light.

It is joy that never spoke,  
And grief unfelt, profound,  
Immortal life unlived,  
Eternal death unmourned.

It is not joy nor sorrow,  
But that which is between,  
It is not night nor morrow,  
But that which joins them in.

It is sweet rest in music;  
And pause in sacred art;  
The silence between speaking;  
Between two fits of passion —  
*It* is the calm of heart.

It is beauty never seen,  
And love that stands alone,  
It is song that lives un-sung,  
And knowledge never known.

It is death between two lives,  
And lull between two storms,  
The void whence rose creation,  
And that where it returns.

To it the tear-drop goes,  
To spread the smiling form  
It is the Goal of Life,  
And Peace — its only home!
