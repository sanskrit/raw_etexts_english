R1’s father mentioned that a good tAntrIka is one who can prognosticate
and disease and block it using a prayoga that involved the deployment of
the mantra of amR^iteshvara bhairava or the tryaMbaka mantra. When R1
was afflicted by a strange roga on account of abhichAra he applied this
procedure. I heard the outline of procedure he followed and he also
mentioned a saMpuTikaraNa with the heart of tripura-sundarI. The
outline, I much later realized, follows the pattern of dhAraNa-s
mentioned in the siddhayogeshvarImata, malinIvijayottara and the
dIkShottara tantra-s on one hand and the prayoga-s of the dakShiNAmUrti
saMhitA, j\~nAnArNava and kaulAvalI-nirNaya on the other.

The primary sAdhana is given the siddhayogeshvarImata (11.3cd-12) and is
known as the mR^itu\~njaya sAdhana:

Here the mR^ityu\~njaya yoga of trika is laid out. First the sAdhaka
meditates upon an 8-petalled lotus with a white pericarp and of
crystalline form emerging from the vacuum \[above his head\] like
glittering frost. In its midst he visualizes the moon disc in its midst
with the lotus firmly rooted in the ground \[the spinal cord of he
sAdhaka is the stem\]. He sees himself of crystalline form and
glittering like frost. In the moon in the midst of the vacuum lotus he
sees the devI parA of clear complexion who sends down the stream of
nectar with the meditation upon her mantra (the single syllabled sauH).
This nectar streams through the brahmabila or brahmarandhra and streams
through the amR^itavAhinI nerve and fills the cavity of his heart. The
yogin who practices this dhyAna doing japa on the mantra of parA devI
for six month attains mR^ityujit. This deployment of parA devI’s mantra
in the mR^ityujit sAdhana is expanded in the stream of the kAlImata
outlined in the dakShiNAmUrti saMhitA. Here, the combination of the parA
mantra-s with the mR^ityujit mantra-s gives rise to the mantra devatA-s
known as the simhAsana devI-s of tripurasundarI. These devI-s are
mR^itasaMjIvanI and mR^ityu\~njaya-parA whose mantras are respectively
(as given by vidyAraNya yati):  
mR^itasaMjIvanI: hrIM \\ haMsaH \\saMjIvani\\ jUM saH \\ kuru kuru\\
sauH sauH \\svAhA |  
Here the first element is the hR^illekha which is the essence of the
“peaks” of the triad elements of the tripurasundarI
pa\~nchadashAkSharI or shrIvidyA. haMsaH is the Ajapa mantra already
known in the pAshupatabrAhmaNopaniShad or seen by dvija-s as the essence
of the vaidika durohaNa-s. saMjIvanI + kuru kuru is the prayoga khANDa
or the imperatives for deployment. jUM saH is the amR^iteshvara or
mR^ityu\~njaya mantra, the tAntrIka equivalent of the mR^itasaMjIvanI
R^ik which can be used by dvija-s. Finally sauH is the bIja of parA
devI.

mR^ityu\~njaya-parA: vada vada vAgvAdini \\ hsaim klinne kledini\\
mahAkShobhaM kuru kuru \\hsrIM \\ OM \\mokShaM kuru kuru\\ hsauH ||  
Here the first element is parA in her primal form vAgvAdini worshiped in
the saundaryalaharI 15. hsaim klinne kledini + hsrIm OM comprise the
mantra of amR^iteshvarI or amR^italakShmI conjoined with amR^iteshvara
bhairava; she is klinnA and kledini because amR^iteshvarI is seen as
sending the moist nectar. The praNava is amR^iteshvara whose worship is
laid out in the netra tantra. The prayoga khANDa-s are the two
imperatives of which the second one “mokShaM kuru kuru” derives is power
from the final element which is a version the parA mantra i.e. hsauH.
This become clear because the prapa\~nchasAra (9.42) states while
explaining the tripurabhairavI vidyA that one who concentrates on its
terminal bIja attains mokSha. This bIja is the parA mantra under the
tripurabhairavI transform.

The shrIkula tradition also states that the shakti bIja of the bAlA
mantra is mediated as the mR^ityujit vidyA. Now, parA is the heart of
tripurasundarI and her mantra i.e. sauH thus becomes the shakti bIja of
the bAlA mantra as the hallowed nityAShoDaShikArNava states: “shakti
bIje parA shaktir ichChaiva shivarUpinI”. This is expounded briefly in
the great nityAShoDaShikArNava and expanded in the j\~nAnArNava
(19.29-31) (or equivalently in kaulAvalI-nirNaya of the Eastern shrIkula
tradition):  
sharire chintayet parAm |  
sravat pIyUShadhArbhir varShantIM viShahAriNIm ||  
hema-prabhA-bhAsamAnaM vidyun-nikara-suprabhAm |  
sphurach-chandrakalA pUrNa kalaShaM varadAbhayau ||  
j\~nAnamudrAM cha dadhatIM sAkShad amR^itarUpinIm |  
Here parA is mediated as sending down the nectar from the full moon
pitcher while doing japa of her mantra sauH.

The practical aspects of the meditation are further expanded by the
malinIvijayottara (16.48-58a), giving details on how diseases are
prognosticated and countered.  
malinIvijayottara 16.55-58a \[somadeva vAsudeva’s partial edition\]:

First the sAdhaka sits in padmAsana doing japa of the parA mantra,
focusing on a point at the level of his eyebrows but just outside of it
to the front. When he stills his mind he sees the puruSha measuring 12
digits. He focuses on the puruSha and continues his sAdhana for 3 months
and then he perceives the puruSha of the form of moon-light possessed of
all limbs. Upon seeing this puruSha thus he acquires kAlaj\~nAna or the
knowledge of time. If the vision becomes headless then it means that the
sAdhaka would die within 6 months. So he has to strive to perform the
cheating of kAla (kAlasya va\~nchanaM) by meditating on the lunar disc
above the brahmrAndhra streaming forth nectar copiously to fill the
yogin’s body. The one meditates upon the internal and external inputs to
consciousness being filled with the nectar flowing through the 3rd
ventricle of the brain \[the chetonala: the realization of the
importance of the chetonala was a major discovery of the yogins\]. Then
in 10 days the yogin becomes mR^ityujit. The mAlinIvijayottara goes on
to reveal how this procedure may be used to prognosticate and eliminate
disease in the yogin himself or even in someone else – if while
visualizing the body in meditation a particular organ is missing then a
disease is prognosticated in it. When the organ is seen in a smoky color
then it is indicative of a major disease – for example black is
indicative of mycobacterial infection and blue of smallpox. To destroy
or preempt the disease from striking the yogin meditates upon that
nectar flowing through the afflicted organ.

A similar procedure of meditating upon the lunar nectar streaming in
through the ventricle into the vagus nerves into the hR^it chakra is
outline in the svachChanda tantra (7.217-226) belonging to a different
lineage of the bhairava srotas (the mantra-pITha). The presence of such
meditations in the tantra of the mantra-pITha and also a tantra of the
saiddhAntika-s (dIkShottara) suggest that as the basic mR^ityujit yoga
it was present in the ancestral shaiva yoga system. But the combination
with the meditation upon the goddess parA is a part of the kula system
starting from the trika tantra-s.
