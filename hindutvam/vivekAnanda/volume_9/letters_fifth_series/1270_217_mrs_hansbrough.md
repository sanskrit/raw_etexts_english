## CCXVII

*To Mrs. Alice (Shanti) Hansbrough*

BENARAS

*14 Feb. 1902*

MY DEAR MRS. HANSBROUGH,

I am eternally indebted to you for what you did for me in the past, and
infinitely more now for what you are doing for Turiyananda.

A gloom came over the Math when news reached Calcutta of his severe
illness. Now, I hope, he has recovered completely, and I will be so glad
to get the news from you.

It seems the American climate does not suit him. In that case it will be
better for him to come over to India whenever he thinks fit.

In all probability I am going to Japan in a month or two.
Ramakrishnananda accompanies me. Turiyananda may come over to Japan and
I go to America. "Mother" knows best, however, and we obey.

I am just now in Benaras for a few days. All letters should, however, be
addressed to the Belur Math.

Kindly convey my best love to Turiyananda and to yourself, the holy
family and the other friends.

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA

PS. Let Turiyananda take rest all the time now. He must not work at all
till I reach Japan or America.
