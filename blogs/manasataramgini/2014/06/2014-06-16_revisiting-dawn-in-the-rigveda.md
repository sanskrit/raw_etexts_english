title = "Revisiting dawn in the R^igveda"

+++
One of the most physically and mentally demanding performances in the
agnichayana and other soma rituals based on that model is the atirAtra
or the overnight rite. The highpoint of it is the great ritual to the
gods agni and the ashvin-s and the goddess uShas. The sAman songs to
these deities from the rahasya-gAna section are sung at the beginning of
this ritual. These songs collectively go by the name saMdhistotra
indicating that they are sung at the junction between night and the
daybreak, i.e., the dawn. That they are linked with the dawn presided by
the goddess uShas is clear from one set of these songs known as the
uShANi, which are thus deployed by the sAmavedic singers:

nidhana: As |

The prastAva is sung by the prastotA, the udgItha by the udgAtA, the
pratihAra by the pratihartA, the upadrava by the udgAtA, and the nidhana
by all three.

The lyrics of this rahasya gAna are based on the mantra-s of the
maitrAvaruNi vasiShTha:  
praty u adarshy Ayaty uchChantI duhitA divaH |  
apo mahi vyayati chakShase tamo jyotiSh kR^iNoti sUnarI ||  
The daughter of dyaus has appeared now, shining as she nears;  
The noble lady rolls up great darkness and makes light for us to see.

ud usriyAH sR^ijate sUryaH sachAM udyan nakShatram archivat |  
taved uSho vyuShi sUryasya cha sam bhaktena gamemahi ||  
The sun frees the red cows while he the radiant star rises high;  
May we acquire our share \[of wealth\] when you O uShas and the sun’s
light come forth\! (RV 7.81.1-2)

This is followed by the recitation of the thousand mantra-s of the
Ashvina shastra by the hotr^i, which is a great feat of memory for they
are recalled from the R^igveda in a rather jumbled order, i.e., mantra-s
from different maNDala come in different places in the recitations. This
rite to the ashvin-s (evidently in its earlier form) is alluded to
within the R^igveda itself by maitrAvaruNi vasiShTha. This reference not
only supports its antiquity but also suggests it was performed at dawn:

ashochy agniH samidhAno asme upo adR^ishran tamasash chid antAH |  
acheti ketur uShasaH purastAch Chriye divo duhitur jAyamAnaH ||  
*agni has shone brightly when kindled (using samidh-s) by us;*  
*boundaries of darkness were visible.*  
*Eastward is seen the banner of uShas,*  
*one born to \[indicate\] the glory of dyaus’ daughter.*

abhi vAM nUnam ashvinA suhotA stomaiH siShakti nAsatyA vivakvAn |  
pUrvIbhir yAtam pathyAbhir arvAk svarvidA vasumatA rathena ||  
*The good hotR^i faces you, O ashvin-s,*  
*now the eloquent chanter attends you with the recitation, O
nAsatya-s\!*  
*Come by the paths you have formerly traveled by,*  
*by the chariot that finds the light, laden with treasure.* (RV
7.67.2-3)

The great Hindu patriot Lokamanya Tilak, based on the nature of the
Vedic references to dawns, postulated that the composers of the veda
lived in, or were familiar with, extreme northern latitudes. In
particular, the case Ashvina-shastra impressed him the most. He realized
that the whole long recitation of 1000 mantra-s was completed before
sunrise, which implied a long dawn, much longer than the ones we see in
India. Based on this and other allusions he outlined this hypothesis of
his in the “Arctic Home in the Vedas.” The title and the form he
presented the hypothesis was somewhat unfortunate because it gave rise
to the impression that the ancestors of the Indo-Aryans lived inside the
Arctic circle (i.e. 66.5°N latitude). While that is unlikely, it is
clear from several lines of evidence in the R^igveda, chiefly,
familiarity and fear of snow/cold winters, centrality of the fire cult,
and the natural habitat of Ephedra (soma), that the ancestors of the
Indo-Aryans, at some point temporally close to the composition of the
RV, lived at a fairly northern latitude in Eurasia. Moreover the
evidence from the “fire in water legend” places them in the vicinity of
the Caspian or Black Seas, which have the characteristic geological
setting with fossil hydrocarbon-powered mud volcanoes that could inspire
this legend. On the other hand, linguistic evidence for contacts with
Uralic place them even further north, perhaps in the zone just north of
the above lakes closer to the Urals (\~47-50°N latitude). This contact
with Uralic is also consistent with the specific evolutionary
connections between Baltic and Slavic one hand and Indo-Iranian on the
other. This suggests that early Indo-Iranian was positioned in proximity
to these northerly branches of IE. In light of these points, we are
sympathetic to Tilak’s idea that it is likely that the Vedic references
point to long dawns. Indeed, the cognate goddess presiding over the dawn
was an important one in several branches of Indo-European, who appears
to have faded away in several branches in subsequent times. Thus,
cognates of Indo-Aryan uShas include, Iranian uShA (as in the Avestan
incantation uShAhin gAH; also vî-daêvô-dAta 19.28 and yasna haptanghaiti
50.10), the Greek Eos, Latin Aurora and Lithuanian Aushrine. Aushrine
seems to have been conflated with Venus in Lithuanian legend after the
destruction of their ancestral religion (cf. indraja becoming Lithuanian
name of Jupiter). All these cognate deities are described using poetic
phrases similar to those used for the uShas in the veda. Thus, it
appears that dawns were a prominent phenomenon in the Indo-European
homeland, just as implied by the Vedic memory of the same.

Returning to Tilak’s interpretation of the Vedic dawn, there is one
mantra in the RV relevant to his hypothesis, which has been difficult to
understand. Tilak himself took it as evidence in support of his
contention while other interpreters of the RV have tended to look at it
differently. We revisit this mantra and see what it might mean.

shashvat puroShA vy uvAsa devy atho adyedaM vy Avo maghonI |  
atho vy uchChAd uttarAM anu dyUn ajarAmR^itA charati svadhAbhiH ||RV
1.113.13 by kutsa A\~ngirasa

shashvat= continually; purA= formerly uShAH= uShas, nominative singular;
vi= verb prefix; uvAsa= had shone, perfect, third person of verb vas
(class 6); devI= goddess; atha= moreover; u= emphatic particle; adya=
today; idaM= this, 3rd person singular neuter; vi= verb prefix; AvaH=
shone (see below for discussion) maghonI= munificent lady.

atha= now ; u= emphatic particle; vi= verb prefix; uchChAt= may light
(see below); ut .atarAn= future, the terminal nasal is pronounced as
pure anunAsika in recitation; anu= along; dyUn= days, masculine
accusative plural; ajara= undecaying; amR^itA= immortal; charati= moves,
present, 3rd person singular; svadhAbhiH= by her own powers, feminine
instrumental plural.

Thus with the above analysis one may translate the mantra thus:  
*Formerly, the goddess uShas had continually shone forth;*  
*now then the munificent lady shined this \[light\] today.*  
*Now then, may she light up the days that will come along;*  
*immortal and undecaying she moves on by her own powers.*

Now this mantra poses the following problems of note:  
1\) The first pAda has been interpreted by most as meaning from the
former times the goddess uShas has been continually shining forth. This
is taken as a symmetric contrast to the future expectation expressed in
the 3rd pAda for the days that will come along. But the point to note is
that the verb vi-vas is used in the perfect tense (vi-uvAsa; pANini
liT): it is a regular active perfect of the class 6 verb vas. Now
traditionally liT is used to convey parokSha-bhUta or a distant past
that has not been witnessed directly by the speaker. Indeed such a
narrative tense is shared between Sanskrit and Greek and commonly used
in both traditions while recounting AkhyAna-s or epic events. Hence, in
the strictly grammatically sense the pAda would mean: “Formerly, the
goddess uShas had continually shone forth” just as the great commentator
sAyaNa and Tilak had interpreted it. Thus, Tilak’s idea that the
mantra-composer was familiar with a former time when there was a
continuous dawn is not technically incorrect. This might imply that the
author of this mantra himself was not in the region with the long or the
continually shining dawn but his ancestors were and thus he had heard of
the same.

2\) vi-AvaH is a peculiar verb form that does not appear in the regular
conjugation of the class 6 verb vi-vas. It is found only in the older
parts of the veda. sAyaNa informs us in different places in his
commentary that it is derived from either la\~N (imperfect past) or
lu\~N (aorist past) via luk, i.e. elision of the vikaraNa or the
conjugational affix inserted between the root and the termination,
followed by further Vedic-specific transformations (lopa of hal, i.e.
pANini’s designation for terminal consonant). Of the past tenses, la\~N
is termed anadyatana-bhUta (used for a past that has not taken place
today). While la\~N is often used in conjunction with liT
(parokSha-bhUta), in this context the adverb adya is used suggesting it
is a past proximal to the present events. Hence, it should be taken as a
lu\~N, i.e. the aorist which can express adyatana-bhUta (past continuous
with the present).

This interpretation of vi-AvaH is consistent with another occurrence of
it in a mantra of dIrghatamas auchAthya in a similar context relating to
the dawn Ashvina ritual:

abodhy agnir jma ud eti sUryo vy uShAsh chandrA mahy Avo archiShA |  
AyukShAtAm ashvinA yAtave rathaM prAsAvId devaH savitA jagat pR^ithak ||
(RV 1.157.1)  
The verbs herein are: abodhi= was awakened, 3rd person singular
atmanepada aorist of class 1 verb budh; ud-eti= rises up, 3rd person
singular present of class 2 verb i; vi-AvaH= shone forth, like above
R^ik in the context of uShas; AyukShAtAm= was yoked, 3rd person dual
atmanepada aorist of class 7 verb yuj, technically ayukShAtAm but the
first syllable is metrically elongated; pra-asAvIt= 3rd person singular
aorist of class 6 verb sU;

Thus the above mantra has 5 verbs of which 4 are indicate past actions
that precede the rising of the sun indicated in present tense. Of these
3 are clear lu\~N, i.e. aorists, indicating past actions just prior of
the rising of the sun. Thus, the 4th of this group AvaH is also likely
to follow them in being a specialized lu\~N derivative occurring only in
the veda. In his commentary on this mantra, sAyaNa indicates it is
exactly that – a lu\~N, which has been modified in Chandas.

3\) vi-uchChAt occurring the 3rd pAda of RV 1.113.13 is another unusual
verb form. sAyaNa tells us that it is a conjugational form of vi-vas
just like AvaH and the perfect form uvAsa. He further informs us that it
is a veda-specific conjugational form, leT. This form is taken to imply
AshIH, i.e. the hope that something will happen (generally taken to
imply a mood stronger than opative, li\~N, and weaker than imperative,
loT); the subjunctive mood of the white indologists.

One may ask if there are any other definitive indicators in support of
Tilak’s contention that the Vedic dawns were long. We do think that the
very prominence of the dawns, the mention of multiple changing colors
from purple to “white” are suggestive of this. Moreover, we also think
the legend of indra smashing the cart of uShas is another point
supporting this. On multiple occasions indra is described as setting
free or giving rise to the uShas and sUrya (e.g. “yaH sUryaM ya uShasaM
jajAna” in RV 2.12.7). On the other hand he is described in 4 different
sUkta-s as smashing the cart of uShas with his vajra: RV 2.15.6; RV
4.30.8-11; RV 10.73.6; RV 10.138.5. The cart of uShas is described as
being slow (ajavasaH in RV 2.15.6) as compared to the fast chariot of
indra. It is also explicitly described as being an anas, the cognate of
Latin onus – a slow burden-bearing vehicle. This suggests that the
legend arose from the dawn being drawn out as alluded to in RV 1.113.13.
While the beauty of the dawn is celebrated in the deity uShas, on the
flip side the long dawn delays actual day break. Hence, she is described
as causing trouble (RV 4.30.8) while expanding her glory (RV 4.30.9).
Thus, indra is seen as clearing the way for the sun to rise by causing
uShas to flee (ending dawn) by destroying her cart with a strike of his
bolt. Hence, this legend, which was seen as a mysterious one by the
white indologist Oldenburg, is in our opinion a fairly clear memory of
long dawns in the R^igveda.

In conclusion, while it may be a far stretch to place the home of the
Indo-Aryans inside the Arctic circle, we do feel Tilak’s observation
regarding the long dawns in the veda is valid and consistent with the
idea of the ancient home of the Indo-Aryans north of the Caucasus.
