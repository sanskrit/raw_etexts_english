## XXXVI

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

HOTEL BELLEVUE  
BEACON STREET, BOSTON

*24 September 1894*

DEAR MOTHER,

I have not heard from you a long while. I am still in Boston and will be
a few days more.

I am afraid the phonograph has not reached India at all, or something is
the matter with it. Kindly ask Mr. —— to inquire. The receipt is with
you on which they will enquire.

Ever affectionately yours,  
VIVEKANANDA
