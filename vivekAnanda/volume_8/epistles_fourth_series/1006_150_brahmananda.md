## CL

*To Swami Brahmananda*

21 WEST 34 ST.,  
NEW YORK,  
*21st November, 1899*.

MY DEAR BRAHMANANDA,

The accounts are all right. I have handed them over to Mrs. Bull who has
taken charge of reporting the different parts of the accounts to
different donors. Never mind what I have said in previous harsh letters.
They would do you good. Firstly, they will make you business-like in the
future to keep regular and clear accounts and get the brethren into it.
Secondly, if these scolding don't make you brave, I shall have no more
hopes of you. I want to see you die even, but you must make a fight. Die
in obeying commands like a soldier, and go to Nirvana, but no cowardice.

It is necessary that I must disappear for some time. Let not anyone
write me or seek me during that time, it is absolutely necessary for my
health. I am only nervous, that is all, nothing more.

All blessings follow you. Never mind my harshness. You know the heart
always, whatever the lips say. All blessings on you. For the last year
or so I have not been in my senses at all. I do not know why. I had to
pass through this hell — and I have. I am much better — well, in fact.
Lord help you all. I am going to the Himalayas soon to retire for ever.
My work is done.

Ever yours in the Lord,

VIVEKANANDA.

PS. Mrs. Bull sends her love.

V.
