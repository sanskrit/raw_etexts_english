## TO THE FOURTH OF JULY

\[It is well known that Swami Vivekananda's death (or resurrection, as
some of us would prefer to call it!) took place on the 4th of July,
1902. On the 4th of July, 1898, he was travelling with some American
disciples in Kashmir, and as part of a domestic conspiracy for the
celebration of the day — the anniversary of the American Declaration of
Independence — he prepared the following poem, to be read aloud at the
early breakfast. The poem itself fell to the keeping of Dhirâ Mâtâ.\]

Behold, the dark clouds melt away,  
That gathered thick at night, and hung  
So like a gloomy pall above the earth!  
Before thy magic touch, the world  
Awakes. The birds in chorus sing.  
The flowers raise their star-like crowns —  
Dew-set, and wave thee welcome fair.  
The lakes are opening wide in love  
Their hundred thousand lotus-eyes  
To welcome thee, with all their depth.  
All hail to thee, thou Lord of Light!  
A welcome new to thee, today,  
O Sun! Today thou sheddest *Liberty*!  
Bethink thee how the world did wait,  
And search for thee, through time and clime.  
Some gave up home and love of friends,  
And went in quest of thee, self-banished,  
Through dreary oceans, through primeval forests,  
Each step a struggle for their life or death;  
Then came the day when work bore fruit,  
And worship, love, and sacrifice,  
Fulfilled, accepted, and complete.  
Then thou, propitious, rose to shed  
The light of *Freedom* on mankind.  
Move on, O Lord, in thy resistless path!  
Till thy high noon o'erspreads the world.  
Till every land reflects thy light,  
Till men and women, with uplifted head,  
Behold their shackles broken, and  
Know, in springing joy, their life renewed!
