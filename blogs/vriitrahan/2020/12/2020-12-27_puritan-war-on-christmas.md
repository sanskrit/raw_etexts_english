Increase Mathers, President of Harvard College (1681–1701) & a Christian
Puritan said–– “In the Apostolical Times the Feast of the Nativity was
not observed. The very name of Christmass savours of superstition. It
can never bee proved that Christ was born on December 25.”

Increase Mathers was a Puritan from Massachusetts Bay Colony. President
of Harvard College. They were staunch protestants and only followed the
word of the Bible. Puritans said there was no biblical evidence for
Christmas & that it was an ancient Roman Pagan festival.  
  
In his book “A Testimony Against several Prophane and Superstitious
Customs.” he wrote an entire chapter declaring why Christmas was a
heretic non-christian practice. “It was in compliance with the Pagan
Saturnalia that Christ-mass Holidays were first invented.” –– Chapter
III  
  
Not only this, Puritan and Anglican Ministers also considered Christmas
festivities to be unchristian. Drinking, playing cards, rude swearing
are all heretical.
