The second two dimensional map we studied in our early days was that of
Lozi:  
![x\_{n+1}=1-a|x\_n|+by\_n\\\\
y\_{n+1}=x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D1-a%7Cx_n%7C%2Bby_n%5C%5C+y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3Dx_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_{n+1}=1-a|x_n|+by_n\\\\ y_{n+1}=x_n")  
where ![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a") and
![b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "b")
are constants.

It becomes immediately evident that this map is conceptually similar to
the Henon map, using the absolute value operator instead of the squaring
operator. Both generate a positive signed value causing the observed
change in direction of the curve. However, the squaring operator
produces a smooth parabola, while the absolute value operator produces a
sharp inflection. In 1 dimensional chaotic maps these correspond to the
situation seen with the logistic map and the tent map: the former
corresponding to the Henon map and the latter to the Lozi map.

At ![a=1.7;\\;b=.5; \\;
(x\_0,y\_0)=(0,0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D1.7%3B%5C%3Bb%3D.5%3B+%5C%3B+%28x_0%2Cy_0%29%3D%280%2C0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=1.7;\\;b=.5; \\; (x_0,y_0)=(0,0)") this map produces a “tent”
equivalent of the parabola-like Henon strange attractor.

However, this map produces richer behavior than the Henon attractor in
terms of interesting forms of attractors. One such attractor is seen at
![a=1.5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D1.5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=1.5") and
![b=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"b=1"),
![(x\_0,y\_0)=(0,0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_0%2Cy_0%29%3D%280%2C0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x_0,y_0)=(0,0)"), where the Lozi map produces the striking “isosceles
triangle” attractor with vertices at ![(0,-2); (2,0);
(-2,2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%2C-2%29%3B+%282%2C0%29%3B+%28-2%2C2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(0,-2); (2,0); (-2,2)"). Thus the base angles of the triangle are
![\\arctan(3)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%283%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\arctan(3)") and the two sides form angles of
![\\arctan(2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%282%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\arctan(2)") and
![\\arctan(1)=\\frac{\\pi}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%281%29%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\arctan(1)=\\frac{\\pi}{4}") with the x-axis — a configuration which
results in the famous
![\\arctan(1)+\\arctan(2)+\\arctan(3)=\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%281%29%2B%5Carctan%282%29%2B%5Carctan%283%29%3D%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\arctan(1)+\\arctan(2)+\\arctan(3)=\\pi") expression.

Incidentally, this triangle and its bounding square also presents the
creases for an origami base, which can be used to prove the above
identity in a self-evident way ([Also see our earlier note for
trigonometric proof of
same](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/idiosyncratic-synesthetic-experiences-in-some-trivial-trigonometric-identities/)).
It was used by a man from Japan to make a simple grebe that even a
beginner can make. Inside this isosceles triangle the points are
chaotically distributed except for fractal exclusion zones. The two
biggest exclusion zones are ellipses placed orthogonal to each other and
along the vertical axis of the isosceles triangle; they have a major
axis to minor axis ratio of 3 which indicates that they are defined by
two triangles fused at their bases, similar to the outer isosceles
triangle. Also along the axis of the main isosceles triangle are small,
nearly regular, pentagonal zones of exclusion — perhaps a reflection of
the characteristic angle
![\\arctan(3)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%283%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\arctan(3)") being close to the pentagonal angle
![\\frac{2\\pi}{5}=72^o](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7B5%7D%3D72%5Eo&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\frac{2\\pi}{5}=72^o"). As one moves from the axis of the main
triangle to the sides one gets further and further distorted elliptical
and pentagonal zones of exclusion.

When
![a=-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=-1") and
![b=-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3D-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"b=-1"),
![(x\_0,y\_0)=(4,-2.1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_0%2Cy_0%29%3D%284%2C-2.1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x_0,y_0)=(4,-2.1)") the Lozi map produces the famous “Gingerbread man”
attractor.

Giving at little “nudge” to the parameters
![(a=-1.0001;b=-.9999)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%3D-1.0001%3Bb%3D-.9999%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(a=-1.0001;b=-.9999)") for the same
![(x\_0,y\_0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_0%2Cy_0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x_0,y_0)") results in the map wandering all over the Gingerbread man
before eventually (somewhere between ![5 \\times
10^4..10^5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=5+%5Ctimes+10%5E4..10%5E5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"5 \\times 10^4..10^5") iterations) to start spirally converging to five
stable points:( ![(-1,-1);\\; (3,-1);\\;
(5,1);\\;(3,5);\\;(-1,1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-1%2C-1%29%3B%5C%3B+%283%2C-1%29%3B%5C%3B+%285%2C1%29%3B%5C%3B%283%2C5%29%3B%5C%3B%28-1%2C1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(-1,-1);\\; (3,-1);\\; (5,1);\\;(3,5);\\;(-1,1)")).

When one increases
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a") in
the Gingerbread man configuration slightly, e.g.
![a=-1.001;\\;b=-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D-1.001%3B%5C%3Bb%3D-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=-1.001;\\;b=-1"), we get a Gingerbread man with a somewhat smooth
“aura”.

Further increases in the
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a")
result in larger and larger strange attractors where the Gingerbread man
acquires increasing number of “legs” and a multi-spiked aura.

"a=-1.48, b=-1") with a tripodal Gingerbread man.

"a=-1.7523, b=-1") with a pentapodal Gingerbread man.

Just as with the Henon attractor, we also explored the escape plot of
the Lozi attractors where we plot regions in a different color depending
on the number of iterations in which they escape towards
![\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\infty"). When we do this for ![a=-1,
b=-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D-1%2C+b%3D-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=-1, b=-1"), i.e. the standard Gingerbread man parameters we get a
interesting fractal region of entrapment (for the number of iterations
we used to test escape
![n=100](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D100&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=100")) at the middle of which lies the Gingerbread man attractor we
plotted above.

Outside of this basin of entrapment is a collage-like pattern of
different escape zones. These are bounded from the outermost escape zone
by a cardiomorph boundary. We wondered as to why this boundary arises
and what might be the form of the function which specifies it? The
answer to lies in the generating equations of the Lozi map itself. In
order to compute the potential for escape to infinity we use the radius
from the center of the plot region. This, with the Lozi map leads to the
equation:  
![\\left(1-a\\left|x\\right|+by\\right)^2+x^2=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%281-a%5Cleft%7Cx%5Cright%7C%2Bby%5Cright%29%5E2%2Bx%5E2%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\left(1-a\\left|x\\right|+by\\right)^2+x^2=1")  
<https://www.desmos.com/calculator/psvopnbtq7>

Indeed the shape of the cardiomorph depends on the
![(a,b)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2Cb%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(a,b)") values as can be see from the below version of the escape plot
for ![a=.2,
b=1.02)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D.2%2C+b%3D1.02%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=.2, b=1.02)") where the attractors are two points in the two
entrapment regions or they escape to
![\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\infty") along the central line between them.

This study in our youth of the Lozi map then lead us to discover another
related attractor, which we arrived at by a rather simple modification
of the Lozi map:

![x\_{n+1}=1-a \\sqrt{|x\_n|}+by\_n\\\\
y\_{n+1}=x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D1-a+%5Csqrt%7B%7Cx_n%7C%7D%2Bby_n%5C%5C+y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3Dx_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_{n+1}=1-a \\sqrt{|x_n|}+by_n\\\\ y_{n+1}=x_n")  
where ![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a") and
![b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "b")
are constants.

At positive ![a \\approx 1.25 \\;..\\;
1.9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Capprox+1.25+%5C%3B..%5C%3B+1.9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a \\approx 1.25 \\;..\\; 1.9") and ![b \\approx -.1567 \\;..\\;
.1567](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b+%5Capprox+-.1567+%5C%3B..%5C%3B+.1567&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"b \\approx -.1567 \\;..\\; .1567") it leads to an incomplete
deltoid-like attractor that is at border of chaos and regular
convergence. When
![b=-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3D-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"b=-1") this map yields a reasonably rich and aesthetically fairly
pleasing set of strange attractors. We term these the butterfly
attractors because most them have a vaguely four-winged form with a
bilateral symmetry along the
![x=y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Dy&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x=y") line. They appear when
![b=-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3D-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"b=-1").

![lozi\_sqrt\_attractors](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/lozi_sqrt_attractors.png?w=640)Figure

They are fairly stable over a large range of
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a")
values with the attractor increasing in size with increasing
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a").
