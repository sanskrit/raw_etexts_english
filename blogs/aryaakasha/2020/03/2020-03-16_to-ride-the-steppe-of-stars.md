So one of the more … unexpected-yet-then-falls-into-place concepts I’ve
come up with in the course of my writing, is the “Steppe of Stars”;

Literally up there with the “Sea of Stars”/”Seas of the Sun” ‘Space Is
An Ocean’ typology – which also has a perhaps surprising Indo-European
precedency, and which forms a patina far closer to the ‘surface’ of how
we think about Space in the modern age. After all, we have Space*Ships*
under a Captain, Astro-Nauts (or Cosmo-Nauts, for the gentlemen on the
left) – literal Sailors, in the Naut-ical nomenclaturial manner.

Yet for whatever reason, the notion of the vast and all-encompassing,
near-infinitely expansive Steppe as our viewpoint for the conceptry of
“Space” has never quite taken off in anything like the same way.

And then an associate points out a painting like this \[“Soyuz-Apollo”
by Lubsan Dorzhiev, USSR, 1976\], and it becomes rather rapidly evident
that actually, *somebody* out there has already grasped this, on a
subconscious level.

And the notion of Indo-European #GangSteppe Astro-Mannerbund galloping
across the limitless expanse above the clouds … well … I never claimed
that typology to be my own invention. Simply something I’d ‘recollected’
via my own wanderings through the mythic spheres; even if they
themselves occasionally only quite dimly recalled it.

But that is the nature of Myth, isn’t it. It doesn’t really matter in
some ways what the minds of contemporary men may harbour via direct
lines of descending from the days and tales of yore.

It makes itself felt almost regardless of that. Because it’s something
which Endures, Above Us, in this case in multiple senses of the phrase.
