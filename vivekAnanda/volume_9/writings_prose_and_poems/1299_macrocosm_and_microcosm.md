## MACROCOSM AND MICROCOSM

(*The Life of Swami Vivekananda*, Vol. I. p. 250.)

*After his experience of the macrocosm within the microcosm while
absorbed in meditation under the peepul tree at Kakrighat, in 1890,
Swami Vivekananda jotted down in Bengali fragments of his realization in
his notebook*.

In the beginning was the Word etc.

The microcosm and the macrocosm are built on the same plan. Just as the
individual soul is encased in the living body, so is the universal Soul
in the Living Prakriti \[Nature\] — the objective universe. Shivâ \[i.e.
Kâli\] is embracing Shiva: this is not a fancy. This covering of the one
\[Soul\] by the other \[Nature\] is analogous to the relation between an
idea and the word expressing it: they are one and the same; and it is
only by a mental abstraction that one can distinguish them. Thought is
impossible without words. Therefore, in the beginning was the Word etc.

This dual aspect of the Universal Soul is eternal. So what we perceive
or feel is this combination of the Eternally Formed and the Eternally
Formless.
