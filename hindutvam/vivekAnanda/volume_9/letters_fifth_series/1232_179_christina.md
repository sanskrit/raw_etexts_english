## CLXXIX

*To Sister Christine*

A BORD DE PAQUEBOT LA CHAMPAGNE,

*Friday morning, 9 a.m.,*

*3rd August 1900*.

DEAR CHRISTINA,

It is foggy this morning. We are in the channel — expect to reach \[Le
Havre\] at 12 a.m. \[noon\]. It has been a very bad voyage — rolling and
raining and dark nearly all the time. Terrible rolling all through. Only
last night I had good sleep. On other occasions the rolling makes me
sleep well, but this time I don't know what was the matter; the mind was
so whirling. Anyway, I am well and soon to reach land.

Hope to reach Paris this evening.

I send this to Detroit, expecting you there.

With all love and blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA.
