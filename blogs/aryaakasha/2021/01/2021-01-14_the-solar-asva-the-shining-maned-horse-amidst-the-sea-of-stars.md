As it is a salient Solar occasion today, here is an excerpt from my
earlier work – ‘The Sea Horse Of Sovereignty – On Hellenic Poseidon ,
Vedic Varuna, Scythian Thagimasidas , And The Essential Equine
Elevator-Empowerer Of The Ancient Indo-European King’

In it, we examine part of the underlying reasoning for the Horse’s
involvement in the Sovereignty-conferring Horse-Sacrifice Rite – and why
it is that a Horse coming out of the Water is so closely correlate with
the Saliency of the Sky Father :

Now, at this juncture it should be tempting to make the obvious and
somewhat euhemeric presumption – that the reason for the Horse is due to
the strong conceptual saliency of the Horse, the Mounted Warrior, for
the Military applications thereof. And certainly, it can fairly be
argued that there is *an* element of that which is relevant.

Except that is really only a part of it. We are looking, after all, at a
specifically *Water* originated horse. And Sea Horses nor Hippopotami
have tended to see significant success in martial application.

No, for this we must look out farther – out to Sea ! For a peculiar form
of quite prominent Flying Horse …

The Sun!

Now, the more usually encountered conceptual syllabry amidst various
Indo-European mythic contexts, is for the Sun to be associated with a
Chariot – either as a great, shining Chariot Wheel … or alternatively,
pulled along behind or mounted within such a vehicle. It is not hard to
see why. And yet, we also find the Horse and the Horseman as Solar as
well. (The Nordic “Dagr” has elements of this in being mounted upon the
Shining Maned Skinfaxi – although is, nevertheless, more conventionally
depicted drawing a chariot that is the Day proper, thus rendering this a
case of ‘both’ rather than ‘either’ as applies Solar Horse and Horseman
or Solar Chariot and Charioteer. I chiefly mention that figure at this
juncture, as the ‘Golden Maned’ quality is also exactly that possessed
by the Horses of Poseidon’s sea-origin chariot as reported at various
junctures within the Greek mythos. It would seem plausible that the
mounted Horse is a-priori to the Chariot, and therefore that the older
layers of conceptry should be more directly tethered to the former, with
the latter building thereupon and helping to inform the literal
‘day-to-day’ understandings for the Solar Horse’s journey across the sky
(and that, really, is a large part of why the Horse – the journey!),
whilst the much more rare and ornately archaic coronation rites should
retain the presaging and underlying Horse at their more conservative
core)

To quote from one of the key Vedic hymnals required for the Asvamedha –
the Horse Sacrifice that confirms the plenipotentiary power upon this
earth of the King – RV I 163:

“1 WHAT time, first springing into life, thou neighedst, proceeding from
the sea or upper waters,  
Limbs of the deer hadst thou, and eagle pinions. O Steed, thy birth is
nigh and must be lauded.  
2 This Steed which Yama gave hath Trita harnessed, and him, the first of
all, hath Indra mounted.  
His bridle the Gandharva grasped. O Vasus, from out the Sun ye fashioned
forth the Courser.  
3 Yama art thou, O Horse; thou art Āditya; Trita art thou by secret
operation.  
Thou art divided thoroughly from Soma. They say thou hast three bonds in
heaven  
that hold thee.  
4 Three bonds, they say, thou hast in heaven that bind thee, three in
the waters,  
three within the ocean.  
To me thou seemest Varuṇa, O Courser, there where they say is thy
sublimest birth-place.  
5 Here-, Courser, are the places where they groomed thee, here are the
traces of thy hoofs as winner.  
Here have I seen the auspicious reins that guide thee, which those who
guard the holy Law keep safely.  
6 Thyself from far I recognized in spirit,—a Bird that from below flew
through the heaven.  
I saw thy head still soaring, striving upward by paths unsoiled by dust,
pleasant to travel.  
7 Here I beheld thy form, matchless in glory, eager to win thee food at
the Cow’s station.  
Whene’er a man brings thee to thine enjoyment, thou swallowest the
plants most greedy eater.  
8 After thee, Courser, come the car, the bridegroom, the kine come
after, and the charm of maidens.  
Full companies have followed for thy friendship: the pattern of thy
vigour Gods have copied.  
9 Horns made of gold hath he: his feet are iron: less fleet than he,
though swift as thought, is Indra.  
The Gods have come that they may taste the oblation of him who mounted,
first of all, the Courser.  
10 Symmetrical in flank, with rounded haunches, mettled like heroes, the
Celestial Coursers  
Put forth their strength, like swans in lengthened order, when they, the
Steeds, have reached the heavenly causeway.  
11 A body formed for flight hast thou, O Charger; swift as the wind in
motion is thy spirit.  
Thy horns are spread abroad in all directions: they move with restless
beat in wildernesses.  
12 The strong Steed hath come forward to the slaughter, pondering with a
mind directed God-ward.  
The goat who is his kin is led before him the sages and the singers
follow after.  
13 The Steed is come unto the noblest mansion, is come unto his Father
and his Mother.  
This day shall he approach the Gods, most welcome: then he declares good
gifts to him who offers.”

As we can see, this is a Horse … a Horse with Wings … that has as its
origins the (Celestial) Ocean, is identified as an Aditya \[i.e. one of
the 7 or 8 or 12 Solar Figures / Phases of the Sun\], indeed
specifically as Varuna – the Vedic Ocean/Celestial Ocean God Who Is Also
the King In Heaven, and quite definitely radiantly Solar\]. A ‘Winged
Horse’ would most certainly resemble Pegasus (although as a point of
interest, the *broader* array of animal symbolism might perhaps speak to
a Dragon – especially with the prominent ‘Draconic’ association with the
symbolism of Leadership, Rulership, that we have discussed in other
works, and briefly quoted from the Nordic Rigsthula in support of
well-above). ‘Swift as the wind in motion’ also almost exactly mirrors
the description for Arion, one of Poseidon’s horse-formed Sons from the
realms of Greek mythology.

And, to nobody’s especial surprise, these key elements also align with
what we find in the much-earlier aforementioned Shatapatha Brahmana
verse that I had quoted:

“Then on the left side (he puts the head of) the horse, with (Vâg. S.
XIII, 42), ‘The speed of the wind,’–this one, the horse, is indeed the
speed of the wind;–‘Varuna’s navel’–for the horse is Varuna;–‘the horse,
born in the midst of the flood;’ the flood is the water, and the horse
is indeed the water-born”

With additional support for the Solar identification of the Horse
provided by an earlier verse drawn from the same Brahmana \[VII 5 2 6\]:

“And, again, why he puts the heads of the victims thereon. Pragâpati
alone was here at first 1. He desired, ‘May I create food, may I be
reproduced!’ He fashioned animals from his vital airs, a man from his
soul (mind), a horse from his eye”

Prajapati is, of course, the ‘All-Father’ – and here, the Horse is
identified with the Eye of this Deity. We know from the Shatapatha
Brahmana presentation of the SataRudriya Rite, that this figure is
correlate with the Sky Father \[‘Dyaus Pitar’, Zeus Pater\] – as the
Emanation of the Manyu by Him is directly correlate with the Birth of
Minerva / Athena in the Classical rites and legendariums. Here, the Eye
is presented as the Horse’s origin … the Eye of the Sky Father being
quite specifically the Sun in a number of Indo-European mythic
understandings (including not only Zeus, but also Shiva, Dyaus,
underpinning Odin’s ‘Blazing Eye’, and specifically both Prajapati and
Varuna … but, then, I repeat myself, don’t I).

It would be also fair to surmise, I suspect, that the Solar Horse
understanding underpins the shared Greek – Vedic myth of The Sky Father
in Horse Form pursuing His Wife in ‘Shadow’/’Dark’ Form. For the Greeks,
this was Poseidon pursuing the Black Demeter Erinyes ; for the Vedic and
later Hindu mythology it is Vivasvan \[‘Wide-Shining One’\], Surya
\[although per my identification the Sky Father referred to as Surya,
rather than the Surya that is the Son of the Sky Father\] pursuing the
Chhaya \[‘Shadowy’\] form either emanated or assumed by Saranyu. The
progeny of both of these mythic unions is at least one prominent
Horse-styled offspring \[Arion in the Greek, Revanta and/or the Asvins
in the Hindu – and it should be noted just how important a role the
Asvins have when it comes to the position and elevation of the King\];
although what makes these interesting for a ‘Solar Horse’ identification
other than the direct and literal ‘Surya’ labelling in the latter
account, is the potential for this to present the Solar Horseman as
pursuing the Night – Who Flees from Him.

The Sky Father, Dyaus Pitar, after all, has always had an irreducible
‘Solar’ element \[it is literally right there in the linguistics , the
theonymy – ‘Dyaus’, the Bright/Shining Daylit Sky\]; and, as it happens,
this ‘Solar’ element being transmissible via heredity is also well
attested. Zeus’ pursuit of Nemesis in Swan form (part of a parade of
animal shapes perhaps not unlike what is preserved in the aforementioned
Vedic verses in an attempt to describe the characteristics of the Sun)
begets an equivalent to the aforementioned Asvins, Castor and Pollux …
and also Helen (of Troy), a Solar Goddess (as discussed in my various
previous works upon the subject; even still recalled as such by the
Doric Greeks during the Classical age), Who makes Menelaus a King via
Her marriage to him.

A Solar Woman rather than a Solar Horse – yet nevertheless, the pattern
remains: The Solar / Equine Expression of the Sky Father’s Kingly Mantle
is what is required to make a King. And also, not at all coincidentally,
what is lost to dethrone a king.
