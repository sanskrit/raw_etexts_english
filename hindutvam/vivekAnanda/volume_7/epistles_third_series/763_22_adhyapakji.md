## XXII

541 DEARBORN AVENUE,  
*18th June, 1894*.

DEAR ADHYAPAKJI (Prof. John Henry Wright),

Excuse my delay in sending the other letters; I could not find them
earlier. I am going to New York in a week.

I do not know whether I will come to Annisquam or not. The letters need
not be sent over to me until I write you again. Mrs. Bagley seems to be
unsettled by that article in the Boston paper against me.[1](#fn1) She
sent me over a copy from Detroit and has ceased correspondence with me.
Lord bless her. She has been very kind to me.

Stout hearts like yours are not common, my brother. This is a queer
place — this world of ours. On the whole I am very very thankful to the
Lord for the amount of kindness I have received at the hands of the
people of this country — I, a complete stranger here without even
"credentials". Everything works for the best.

Yours ever in gratitude,  
VIVEKANANDA.

PS. The East India stamps are for your children if they like.

1.  [^](#txt1)Her silence subsequent to sending Swamiji the article in
    the Boston paper was surely misconstrued by him, but the fact
    remained that, beleaguered on all sides, he thought that Mrs. Bagley
    had lost faith in him, and this must surely have hurt him deeply. —
    Ed.
