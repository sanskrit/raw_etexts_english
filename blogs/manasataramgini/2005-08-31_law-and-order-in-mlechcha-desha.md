title = "Law and order in mlechChaxa0desha"

+++
The land of the mlechChas is in krau\~ncha dvIpa is renowned for its
orderliness arising from the maintenance of law and order. However, when
the chakra of indra and vAyu struck the land it was striking to note
that the law and order collapsed rapidly. The state largely lost control
and the dire circumstances resulted in an intense human competition and
lawlessness. This did not seem to be case in bhArata despite the similar
strike by the manyu of indra. The lawlessness appears to be of a
different kind in bhArata from mlechCha desha. One wonders if this is
because of svabhAva of the concerned people or the social inequalities
between the kR^iShNavarNas and shvitinchyas. One can imagine in terms of
evolution, how people placed in these circumstance will be so easily
subject to natural selection and adaptation to such niches. The vagaries
of life in the dark continent, as well as the fate of degraded human
slaves of the New World, have surely produced such adaptations. But it
is clear that most people in mlechChadesha may not acknowledge the
point.
