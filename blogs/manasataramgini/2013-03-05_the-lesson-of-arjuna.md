title = "The lesson of arjuna"

+++
The third paNDava, as an impetuous warrior, the embodiment of the great
indra on earth gave a powerful lesson to his brother yudhiShThira when
urged by his wife yAj\~nasenI. The pith of this lesson is truly one for
the kali age, especially the situation in which the rAShTra that founded
by the kuru and the pA\~nchAla finds itself in, ruled by duShTa-s,
taskara-s and kulu\~ncha-s who are but frontmen of barbarous mlechCha-s.
Indeed, it is quite likely that a nation that forgets the essence of
this lesson of the embodiment of indra, instead perpetually follows the
false teachings of the muNDaka who was proclaimed to be a mahAtman by
the uneducated, might fail to exist in the future.

We present the core of that teaching here:  
nAchChittvA para-marmANi nAkR^itvA karma dAruNam |  
nAhatvA matsyaghAtIva prApnoti mahatIM shriyam ||  
Without piercing the weak points \[Footnote 1\] of enemies, without
performing ruthless acts, without \[slaying foes\] with the ruthlessness
of a fisherman (slaying fish), no person can obtain great prosperity.

nAghnataH kIrtir astIha na vittaM na punaH prajAH |  
indro vR^itravadhenaiva mahendraH samapadyata ||  
Without slaughter, no man has been able to achieve fame in this world or
conquer wealth or subjects. Verily indra became the great indra
(mahendra) by slaughtering vR^itra.

ya eva devA hantAras tAMl loko .archayate bhR^isham |  
hantA rudras tathA skandaH shakro .agnir varuNo yamaH ||  
Those amongst the gods who are slayers are more extensively worshiped in
the world. The gods rudra, skanda, shakra, agni, varuNa and yama are all
slayers.

hantA kAlas tathA vAyur mR^ityur vaishravaNo raviH |  
vasavo marutaH sAdhyA vishvedevAsh cha bhArata ||  
kAla, vAyu, mR^ityu and kubera, ravi, the vasu-s, the marut-s, the
sAdhya-s, and the vishvedeva-s, O bhArata, are all slayers.

etAn devAn namasyanti pratApa-praNatA janAH |  
na brahmANaM na dhAtAraM na pUShANaM kathaM chana ||  
Laid low by the prowess of the above gods, all people pay obeisance to
them, but not all time to brahmA or dhAtR^i or puShaN.

madhyasthAn sarvabhUteShu dAntA\~n shamaparAyaNAn |  
yajante mAnavAH ke chit prashAntAH sarvakarmasu ||  
Only a few men that are pacific disposition worship in their rituals
those gods that are equally disposed towards all creatures and that are
pacific and peaceful.

na hi pashyAmi jIvantaM loke kaM chid ahiMsayA |  
sattvaiH sattvAni jIvanti durbalair balavattarAH ||  
I do not see an organism in this world that lives without doing any harm
to others. Organisms live upon other organisms, the stronger upon the
weaker \[Footnote 2\].

nakulo mUShakAn atti biDAlo nakulaM tathA |  
biDAlam atti shvA rAja\~n shvAnaM vyAlamR^igas tathA ||  
The mongoose eats the mouse; the cat the mongoose; the dog eats the cat;
O king the dog is then \[consumed\] by the cheetah .

tAn atti puruShaH sarvAn pashya dharmo yathAgataH |  
prANasyAnnam idaM sarvaM ja\~NgamaM sthAvaraM cha yat ||  
All of these are eaten by man , behold \[this\] dharma \[i.e. yama\]
which comes for all. All that is mobile and immobile are food for \[the
continuation\] of prANa \[Footnote 3\].

vidhAnaM deva-vihitaM tatra vidvAn na muhyati |  
yathA sR^iShTo .asi rAjendra tathA bhavitum arhasi ||  
This process is the way of the gods; hence, the learned man is never
mystified by it. It is becoming you, O lord of the kings, to accept the
very nature of your origins.

vinIta krodha harShA hi mandA vanam upAshritAH |  
vinA vadhaM na kurvanti tApasAH prANayApanam ||  
Giving up anger and pleasure \[it is\] the slow-witted \[who\] take
refuge in the woods. \[Because\] even the performers of austerities
cannot support their lives without carrying out slaughter.

udake bahavaH prANAH pR^ithivyAM cha phaleShu cha |  
na cha kash chin na tAn hanti kim anyat prANayApanAt ||  
In water, on earth, and in fruits, there are numerous living forms. It
is not possible that one does not slaughter them how could one support
one’s life else?

sUkShma-yonIni bhUtAni tarka-gamyAni kAni chit |  
pakShmaNo .api nipAtena yeShAM syAt skandhaparyayaH || Mbh
12.15.14-12.15.26  
There microscopic germ-like organisms whose existence can only be
inferred by logic. At the wink of an eyelid whole multitude of such
microscopic organisms are destroyed \[Footnote 4\].

What arjuna does is to present this basic biological logical to this
brother and explain that there can be no existence of one life form
without injury to another. Hence, arguments for absolute ahiMsa are
illogical. It is in this regard he taught a famous principle that was
willfully distorted to emasculate the Hindus in modern times:

lokayAtrArtham eveha dharma-pravachanaM kR^itam |  
ahiMsA sAdhuhiMseti shreyAn dharma-parigrahaH ||  
The dharma has been taught only for the appropriate maintenance of ways
of the world. Between nonviolence (ahiMsa) and violence guided by proper
motives (sadhuhiMsa), the superior action is that by which dharma is
maintained.

nAtyanta guNavAn kash chin na chApy atyanta nirguNaH |  
ubhayaM sarva-kAryeShu dR^ishyate sAdhv asAdhu cha || Mbh 12.15.49-50  
There is no act that is entirely meritorious, nor any that is entirely
wrong. In all acts, something of both, right and wrong, is \[always\]
seen.

It is with this background arjuna urges the placing yudhiShThira to
pursue the path of daNDanIti that said to have been taught in the world
of men by the bhR^igu ushanA kAvya.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  
Footnote 1: In the Hindu martial tradition marman-s are special
“junction” points where a warrior strikes to instantly disable or kill
the opponent. The tradition of these marman-s and striking them survives
today only the south Indian martial tradition from the Tamil and chera
countries. What arjuna is talking about here is striking these marman
points of enemies in battle.

Footnote 2: All students of biology know this to be a truism – perhaps
even an inherent to life, as the pANDu clarifies in this shloka.

Footnote 3: Here the pANDava is describing the food chain and the fact
that flow of prANa is the consumption of food by all – death is the
dharma of life were every organism ends up as food for another.

Footnote 4: Here arjuna is encapsulating a very important facet of early
Hindu knowledge i.e. that of microbial life. Even though they could not
be seen, the early Hindus had inferred their occurrence by reasoning
based on fermentation and postulated that the whole earth, water and
plants are covered by these microbial life forms. We regard this a major
scientific inference of our early tradition. This knowledge, which the
nirgrantha-s inherited from their predecessors, combined with obsession
for ahiMsa of their founder led to their numerous practices to avoid
killing microscopic life.
