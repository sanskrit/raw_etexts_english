## CVIII

*To Sister Nivedita*

DARJEELING,

*3rd April 1897*.

DEAR MISS NOBLE,

I have just found a bit of important work for you to do on behalf of the
downtrodden masses of India.

The gentleman I take the liberty of introducing to you is in England on
behalf of the Tiyas, a plebeian caste in the native State of Malabar.

You will realize from this gentleman what an amount of tyranny there is
over these poor people, simply because of their caste.

The Indian Government has refused to interfere on grounds of
non-interference in the internal administration of a native State. The
only hope of these people is the English Parliament. Do kindly
everything in your power to help this matter \[in\] being brought before
the British Public.

Ever yours in the truth,  
VIVEKANANDA.
