## CCXIX

*To Sister Christine*

THE MATH, BELUR,  
DIST. HOWRAH, BENGAL,

*30th March 1902*.

MY DEAR CHRISTINE,

You know how welcome you are — I need not express it. This is a land
where expressions are studiously subdued. Margot \[Sister Nivedita\] and
Joe \[Miss Josephine MacLeod\] have already written and made
arrangements at Bombay. I expect and wait for you here in Calcutta. I
wish I could be in Bombay to receive you, but all our wishes are not to
be fulfilled.

Come over straight; only take great, great care of the heat by
protecting the back of the head.

The trains here are not so safe as in your country, so have a little
care of your things during night travel.

If you feel tired, take rest in Bombay. Mrs. \[Ole\] Bull, Joe and
Margot are anxiously awaiting you, and so is

VIVEKANANDA.
