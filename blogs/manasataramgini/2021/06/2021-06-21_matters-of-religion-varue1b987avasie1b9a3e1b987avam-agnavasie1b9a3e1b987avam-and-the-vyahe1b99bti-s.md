Like the clouds lifting after the monsoonal deluge to unveil the
short-lived comforts of early autumn, the metaphorical pall over the
nation cast by the [engineer’s
virus](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/05/06/the-engineer-the-dead-fish-and-the-bag-of-earth/)
was lifting. Somakhya and Lootika were at the former’s parents’ house,
relieved that they had survived and overcome the tumultuous events.
Somakhya’s parents asked them to offer the Varuṇāvasiṣṇava and
associated oblations as ordained by the Bhṛgu-s and Āṅgirasa-s of yore.
Vrishchika and Indrasena were also present as observers of the rite.
Somakhya donned his turban and identified himself with the god Indra to
initiate the rite, for indeed the śruti has said: tad vā etad atharvaṇo
rūpaṃ yad uṣṇīṣī brahmā । — that brāhmaṇa who is turbaned is indeed of
the form of the Atharvan. He explained to Indrasena that the śruti holds
the Indra took the shape of the Atharvaveda in his turbaned form to
protect the ritual of the gods from the dānava-s. Indrasena: “Indeed,
even the primordial śruti records that form of Indra in the ṛk of the
Kāṇva-s:

yajña indram avardhayad yad bhūmiṃ vy avartayat । cakrāṇa opaśaṃ divi
॥  
The ritual magnified Indra \[with praise\] when he made the earth
rotate, making \[himself\] a turban in (= of) heaven.  
One may note play on the word opaśa; by taking it as neuter one could
also interpret is as the pillar or the axis of heaven.”

Then, Somakhya and Lootika took their seat before the fire on the hide
of a reddish brown ox strewn with darbha grass. Thereafter, they
performed an ācamana and prokṣaṇa with the incantations: apāṃ puṣpaṃ
mūrtir ākāśaṃ pavitram uttamam । indra jīva sūrya jīva devā jīvā
jīvyāsam aham । sarvam āyur jīvyāsam ॥ \[The flower is the form of the
waters, the empty space \[and\] that which the most pure. Enliven, o
Indra; Enliven o Sūrya. Enliven, o gods. May I live. May I complete my
term of life\].

Thereafter, Somakhya meditated on the special connection of the founder
of his race to god Varuṇa and uttered the incantation establishing his
connection to the founder of his lineage, great Bhṛgu: tad bhṛgor
bhṛgutvam। bhṛgur iva vai sa sarveṣu lokeṣu bhāti ya evaṃ veda ॥ \[That
\[connection with Varuṇa\] is the Bhṛgu-ness of Bhṛgu. He who knows thus
shines in all the worlds like Bhṛgu\]. He recited the formula: OṂ
sarvair etair atharvabhiś cātharvaṇaiś ca kurvīya॥ \[OṂ May I perform
\[this rite\] by means of all these incantations of Atharvan and the
Ātharvaṇa-s\]. OṂ mantrāś ca mām abhimukhībhaveyuḥ । \[OṂ may the \[AV\]
mantra-s face me \[favorably\]\]. Somakhya then explained to Indrasena
and Vrishchika: “The śruti holds that like a mother can be killed by the
fetus she bears, the mantra-s can kill the holder if he improperly
applied them or has not been diligent in their study. Hence, he must
utter this incantation beginning with OṂ. The praṇava indeed protects
him from such backfiring.”

He muttered the Sāvitra incantation-s to the god Savitṛ as per the
teaching of the great brāhmaṇa Śvetaketu, the son of Uddākaka Āruṇi:  
OṂ BHUR BHUVAḤ SVAḤ tat savitur… prachodayāt ॥: This first cycle is done
with the 3 mahāvyāhṛti-s.  
OṂ BHŪR JANAT tat savitur… prachodayāt ॥: Somakhya touched Lootika with
a darbha-bunch and she made an oblation as is appropriate for the
sacrificer’s wife in the fire at the utterance of svāhā (idaṃ na mama
॥)  
OṂ BHUVO JANAT tat savitur… prachodayāt ॥: Somakhya’s parents stepped
forward and made an offering with a silent svadhā call and touched
water.  
OṂ SVAR JANAT tat savitur… prachodayāt ॥: Somakhya made an oblation with
a svāhā (idaṃ na mama ॥)  
OṂ BHŪR BHUVAḤ SVAR JANAD OM tat savitur… paro rajase ‘sāvado3m॥:
Somakhya made an oblation with a vauṣaṭ uttered loudly (idaṃ na mama ॥)

Then he proceeded to the main oblations:  
śrauṣaḍ  
yayor ojasā skabhitā rajāṃsi  
yau vīryair vīratamā śaviṣṭhā ।  
yau patyete apratītau sahobhir  
viṣṇum agan varuṇaṃ pūrvahūtiḥ ॥

By whose power the domains of space were stabilized,  
by whose energy, the most energetic and mightiest,  
who lord it unopposed by their powers,  
to \[that\] Viṣṇu and Varuṇa have gone the first offerings.

yasyedaṃ pradiśi yad virocate  
pra cānati vi ca caṣṭe śacībhiḥ ।  
purā devasya dharmaṇā sahobhir  
viṣṇum agan varuṇaṃ pūrvahūtiḥ ॥  
vauṣaṭ + idaṃ varuṇāviṣṇūbhyāṃ na mama ॥

In whose direction is that which shines forth,  
{\[}whatever\] that vibrates and observes with power  
from ancient times by the god’s law with might,  
to \[that\] Viṣṇu and Varuṇa have gone the first offerings.

OṂ BHŪH pra tad viṣṇu stavate vīryāṇi  
OṂ BHUVO mṛgo na bhīmaḥ kucaro giriṣṭhāḥ ।  
OṂ SVAḤ parāvata ā jagamyāt parasyāḥ ॥  
OṂ BHŪR BHUVAḤ SVAR JANAD VṚDHAT KARAD RUHAN MAHAT TAC CHAM OṂ viṣṇave
svāhā + idaṃ viṣṇave na mama ॥

Thus, he praises forth his heroic deeds, Viṣṇu is  
like a dreadful lion wandering, stationed in the mountains  
From the distant realm may he come close.

śrauṣaḍ  
agnāviṣṇū mahi tad vāṃ mahitvam  
pātho ghṛtasya guhyasya nāma ।  
dame-dame sapta ratnā dadhānau  
prati vāṃ jihvā ghṛtam ā caraṇyāt ॥

O Agni and Viṣṇu mighty is your might;  
you two drink from name of the ghee’s secret.  
In home after home you two place the seven gems.  
may your tongue move here to meet the ghee.

agnāviṣṇū mahi dhāma priyam vāṃ  
vītho ghṛtasya guhyā juṣāṇau ।  
dame-dame suṣṭutyā vāvṛdhānau  
prati vāṃ jihvā ghṛtam uc caraṇyāt ॥  
vauṣaṭ + idaṃ agnāviṣṇūbhyāṃ na mama ॥

O Agni and Viṣṇu mighty is your dear domain;  
may you two savor the secret enjoyment of the ghee  
In home after home you two are magnified by good praise-chants.  
may your tongue flicker upward to meet the ghee.

OṂ BHŪH yasyoruṣu triṣu vikramaneṣv adhikṣiyanti bhuvanāni viśvā ।  
OṂ BHUVA uru viṣṇo vi kramasvoru kṣayāya nas kṛdhi ।  
OṂ SVAḤ ghṛtam ghṛtayone piba pra-pra yajñapatiṃ tira ॥  
OṂ BHŪR BHUVAḤ SVAR JANAD VṚDHAT KARAD RUHAN MAHAT TAC CHAM OṂ viṣṇave
svāhā + idaṃ viṣṇave na mama ॥

In whose wide three strides all the worlds are laid down;  
stride widely O Viṣṇu for wide lordship; make \[that lordship\] for
us;  
Drink the ghee, O source of ghee; prolong the lord of the ritual over
and over!

mama devā vihave santu sarva  
indravanto maruto viṣṇur agniḥ ।  
mamāntarikṣam urulokam astu  
mahyaṃ vātaḥ pavatāṃ kāmāyāsmai ॥  
OṂ BHŪR BHUVAḤ SVAR JANAD VṚDHAT KARAD RUHAN MAHAT TAC CHAM OM

May all the gods be at my ritual invocation;  
The Marut-s with Indra, Viṣṇu and Agni.  
Let the broad realm of the atmosphere be mine.  
May Vāta blow for favoring this wish of mine.

yo naḥ svo yo araṇaḥ sajāta uta niṣṭyo yo asmāṃ abhidāsati ।  
rudraḥ śaravyayaitān mamāmitrān vi vidhyatu ॥

Whether one of ours or one who is in a truce, a kinsman or an alien,
whosoever attacks us  
may Rudra releasing a shower of arrows pierce those enemies of mine.

yaḥ sapatno yo ‘sapatno yaś ca dviṣan chapāti naḥ ।  
devās taṃ sarve dhūrvantu brahma varma mamāntaram ॥

Whichever competitor or whichever non-competitor and whichever hater
curses us,  
the gods shall injure him. The incantation is my inner armor.

Having concluded the after-rites Somakhya, Lootika, Indrasena and
Vrischika left to savor the fresh air and the natural world, and engage
in some brahmavāda on the hills beyond the late medieval temple of the
awful Caṇḍikā. They stopped at the quadrangle in the low ground facing
the stairs leading to the temple on the hill before a towering bastard
poon tree. Vrishchika: “There used to be an old woman with a goat who
used sit in the vicinity of this skunk tree. We used to feed her goat as
a representative of the god Kumāra. She has likely passed into the realm
of Vivasvān’s son along with her aja. Hope Rudra was kind to her when
her time came. Indrasena, sometimes, thinking about you, as though
seized by Skanda or Viṣṇu, I used to feed her goat hoping that Skanda
might be kind to me.” Indrasena: “O Gautamī, after all the meanderings,
it seems, Skanda has brought you to your destination as he did to the
Kāṇva and his goat.” Lootika: “I also recall that Somakhya’s family
observes a Kaumāra rite on the Āśvina fullmoon, where they make a rare
dish from payasya (curdled milk cheese; Iranic: paynīr). They would
offer some of that to the woman with the goat getting the leaf in which
the dish was wrapped” Indrasena: “Is that a folk Atharvan rite?”.
Somakhya: “Yes, the folk Atharvan tradition holds that Skanda is the
teacher of Paippalāda, one of the promulgators of the AV saṃhita-s, and
the paurṇamāsya rite is held in the honor of the enlightenment of
Paippalāda.”

It was a quiet time of the day with just a light stream of votaries and
gawkers on the stairway to the temple. The four made their way up the
steps, mostly in silent thought, to pay their respects to the enshrined
parivāra-devatā-s and the wife of Rudra at the main shrine. Even as they
were about to exit the circumambulatory path to resume their climb
beyond the stair way further up the crag to the plateau beyond, Lootika
was approached by a woman who wanted to fall at her feet. Lootika
prevented her from doing so and she began pouring out a litany of
medical troubles. Lootika signaled to her sister: “This lady seems to
have mistaken me to be you.” Vrishchika: “Stepped in and having briefly
heard her out gave her some reassuring words and asked her to attend to
her father’s clinic.” Somakhya and Indrasena instinctively felt their
concealed guns and knives for a dasyu could always be lurking in the
shades. Having reached their favored vantage point, the site of an old
megalithic stone circle, they looked on at their city below. There
seemed to be some hesitancy in returning to the old normal; hence, the
air seemed cleaner and the horizon clearer. The, nakṣatra of the day,
the eye of Mitra and Varuṇa, had mounted the vault of the cloudless
southern sky. Looking into the distance they saw that the fires in the
yonder cemetery were far fewer than when Somakhya and Lootika had looked
on from the same place during the height of the conflict. Lootika: “The
lull between the storms.” Vrishchika: “You think it is not yet over?” L:
“The clash with the rākṣasa-mata-s is like the fight between the
Daitya-s and the Deva-s — the bigger disease from the mleccha-s is that
of the mind — it will play out next with much spilling of blood — but
then our people could end in a whisper too.”

Indrasena: “Coming to the rite of morning, I’d like understand more
about the AV vyāhṛti-s — both the combination of the mahāvyāhṛtis with
the incantations as also the connection of the vyāhṛti-s to Maruta
Indravantaḥ.”  
Vrishchika: “Could we please also have a broader discussion of role the
mahāvyāhṛti-s and their transcendence by other vyāhṛti-s across the
Vaidika collections?”

Somakhya: “Alright, Vrishchika, let us lay the groundwork for the
exploration desired by Indrasena by first addressing the brahmavāda on
the vyāhṛti-s in the śruti-s other than those of the Atharvan-s. Let us
begin this discussion with testing your knowledge of the traditions
regarding the vyāhṛti-s in the traditions you are familiar with. Why
don’t you tell us what you know regarding the three mahā-vyāhṛti-s?”  
V: “The śruti of the Aitareya-s holds that the 3 vyāhṛti-s are like
connective tissue that holds together the three disjunct parts of the
śruti in the form of the ṛk-s, yajuṣ-es and sāman-s — thus they are
compared to procedures akin to reducing dislocations of joints or sewing
up cut skin. Indeed, this analogy of the Aitareya-s provides early
evidence for these medical procedures among the ārya-s, which parallel
those surgical and bone-setting procedures explicitly mentioned in the
Veda of the Atharvan-s and having echoes among other Indo-Europeans,
like in the Merseburg spell of the śūlapuruṣa-s:  
(bhūr bhuvaḥ svar) … etāni ha vai vedānām antaḥ śleṣaṇāni yad etā
vyāhṛtayas . tad yathātmanātmānaṃ saṃdadhyād . yathā parvaṇā parva yathā
śleṣmaṇā carmaṇyaṃ vānyad vā viśliṣṭam saṃśleṣayed । evam evaitābhir
yajṅasya viśliṣṭaṃ saṃdadhāti ॥

These are verily the internal bindings of the Veda-s, these vyāhṛti-s.
Even as one joins the one individual thing other separated thing; like
setting one joint with another joint; like suturing with a cord, skin
with another torn one. Even so, verily with these one joins the disjunct
parts of the the ritual.

Thus, the suturing role of the vyāhṛti-s is critical for the terminal
sviṣṭakṛt-s for fixing the errors in the ritual.

S: “That is good. So, what do you know of the thesis of the
transcendence of 3 mahāvyāhṛti-s?”  
V: “Well, the Upaniṣat of the Taittirīyaka-s holds that there are three
primal or mahāvyāhṛti-s, bhūr, bhuvas and suvar; however, the sage
Māhācamasya held that there is a fourth, i.e. mahas. In his teaching
mahas is privileged over the remaining three. He establishes four
homologies between them and other entities. Those are the following: 1)
He sees the three primary one bhūr, bhuvas and suvar as corresponding to
the earth, the atmosphere and the space beyond. The fourth, mahas, is
seen as the Āditya, the sun, which causes the world material worlds to
take form — perhaps in more than one way — by supplying the matter to
make them and also the light by which their existence is perceived. 2)
The next homology is to the first 3 and the sources of light — the fire,
the wind (he implies lightning here) and the sun. The reflected light of
the moon is homologized to mahas — here again we might see it as the
ambient light that makes perception possible even the source themselves
are invisible. 3) He also homologizes the first 3 with the 3 categories
of incantations in the śruti, the ṛk-s, the yajuṣ-es and the sāman-s,
and mahas with the brahman, which is to be understood here as the
praṇava. 4) The next homology is between the vyāhṛti-s and the
inhalation, exhalation, and retention in the prāṇāyāma cycle.
Specifically, in that context mahas may be understood as the air.
However, I hold that from the śruti we may infer that what was meant was
more general — the physiological process of nutrient uptake, export of
unwanted and secreted compounds and the anabolic processes. The
free-energy-providing material in this process, i.e. the nutrients, is
the fourth, mahas. Thus, as there are four homologies in each set with a
total of 4 sets, the vyahṛti-s are seen as being 16-fold. The summary of
these linkages is presented as the understanding that the first three
are the limbs of the physical body and mahas corresponds to the
consciousness. Thus, mahas in different domains is equated respectively
with the link substance, the work-generating substance, the diffuse or
reflected light that pervades the universe and the mantra essence — all
of these are seen as analogies for the nature of consciousness with
respect to matter.”

Somakhya: “Excellent upa-gautamī. Dear Lootika is there something you
might want to add to what your sister has just expounded from other
Vedic traditions?”  
Lootika: “Sure. I actually learnt of the multiple expressions of
vyāhṛtyutpatti in the scriptural readings I did with your mother. This
theory of Māhācamasya, introducing the fourth vyāhṛti perhaps led up to
the theory of multiple vyāhṛti-s in both Atharvan and Yajuṣ traditions.
This is clearly a departure from the triple vyāhṛti system expounded in
the brāhmaṇa of the Vājasaneyin-s, that of the Aitareya-s and the
Upaniṣad brāhmaṇa of the Jaimini singers. There explicitly Prajāpati is
described as generating only 3 vyāhṛti-s.”

Indrasena: “Indeed. However, each of those accounts have notable points
— one may see a gradual build up of concepts within the 3 vyāhṛti system
that led to the emergence of the fourth. In the śruti of the
Vājasaneyin-s, we have an account that might be seen as retaining the
archaic form which the thesis of Māhācamasya eventually emerged. That
account describes the heat (tapas) of Prajāpati as the basis for the
emanation of the 3 worlds. Since these worlds were heated by his tapas
they emanated the same 3 primary sources of light (the deities Agni,
Vāyu and Āditya) mentioned by the TU. That tapas causing those lights to
radiate heat spawned the collections of the 3 types of mantra-s of the
śruti. His tapas then caused those mantra collections to radiate heat
from which Prajāpati extracted three generative substances (śukra-s)
that are the vyāhṛti-s. We might trace the origins of the two other
traditions, which Lootika just mentioned, from such a foundation — one
present in the Sāmavaidika tradition of the Jaiminīya-s and the other in
the Aitareya-brāhmaṇa.

In the former, Prajāpati is not presented in a protogonic context, but
is competing with the other gods, probably reflecting the tension
between the surging Prājāpatya religion among our people and the older
Ārya-deva-dharma. Prajāpati conquered the triple-world with the 3-fold
mantra collection. Fearing that the other gods might see the same and
take over his conquest, he extracted the essence of the ṛk-s uttering
bhūḥ. That became the earth and its essence streamed forth as Agni. From
the Yajuṣ-es he extracted the essence with bhuvaḥ and that formed the
atmosphere and streamed forth as Vāyu. The sāman-s were distilled with
the suvaḥ call and they formed the the heaven, from which the essence
streamed forth as the Āditya. However, there was one akṣara he could not
distill into an essence, namely the praṇava. That remained by itself and
became Vāc.

In the Aitareya text, we have a cosmogony closer to that the of
Vājasaneyin-s, wherein Prajāpati’s heat generated the triple-world. As
in the former account, by his heating of those, the 3 luminaries emerged
and by heating those the 3 mantra-s collection were generated. By
heating those again the generative essences (śukra-s), which are the 3
primary vyāhṛti-s emerged. But in this account those were heated further
to generate 3 phonemes: A, U, M, which Prajāpati got together to
generate the praṇava, OṂ. Thus, here too, as in the
Jaiminīya-Upaniṣad-brāhmaṇa we see that there is something beyond the 3
basic vyāhṛti-s, namely the praṇava. It is the praṇava that Māhācamasya
equated to the fourth vyāhṛti mahas in his thesis and that which appears
as the final vyāhṛti of the Atharvan-s. Thus, we see an evolutionary
process within the śruti which paved the way for the vyāhṛti-s beyond
the primary three via the concept of the praṇava.”

Lootika: “There is no mention of the triple vyāhṛiti-s in the oldest
layer of our tradition, the Ṛk-saṃhitā. Now, that could be because they
are specialized calls that don’t fit into the metrical incantations.
However, in all the accounts of vyāhṛtyutpatti, which we have discussed
so far, we see the central role of the protogonic god Prajāpati. Is that
the vyāhṛiti incantations arose within a Prājāpatya milieu? As Indrasena
pointed out, one of the narratives might hint at Prajāpati competing
with the gods of the old religion. Moreover, in specifying the deities
of the vyāhṛiti-s, Śaunaka mentions in the Bṛhaddevatā that, whereas
Prajāpati is the god of all the 3 vyāhṛti-s as a group, individually
they have Agni, Vāyu and Sūrya as their deities. Likewise, for OṂ,
Śaunaka mentions Vāc and Ka Prajāpati as in the brāhmaṇa narratives, but
also Indra and the gods in general as its deity. This is indeed
supported by the fundamental teaching of the upaniṣat:

yaś chandasām ṛṣabho viśvarūpaś  
chandobhyaś candām̐sy āviveśa ।  
satām̐ śikyaḥ provācopaniṣadindro  
jyeṣṭha indriyāya ṛṣibhyo  
namo devebhyaḥ svadhā pitṛbhyo  
bhūr bhuvaḥ suvaś chanda om ॥

After all even in its declining days our tradition was quite unanimous
about this teaching and held that: “sa praṇava-svarūpī
paramaiśvarya-yukta paramātmā indra upaniṣat pratipādyo bhūtva
vyāhṛti-trayātmā oṃkāraḥ ।” Indra, in the form of the vyāhṛti-s and the
praṇava, is indeed is the first causal link in the “bringing together”
(upaniṣat) of the sambandha-s for our ancestors — fitting well with the
Aitareya statement on the vyāhṛti as the internal bonds of the śruti.
These hint at a pre-Prājāpatya origin for the vyāhṛti-s and the praṇava
within the old religion. So, can we find evidence for the ritual
deployment of the vyāhṛti-s in the pre-Prājāpatya layer of the
religion?”

S: “A superficial student could indeed reach the conclusion that the
vyāhṛiti-concept emerged as part of the linking of the cosmogonic role
of Prajāpati with the cosmic origin of the mantra-s, like in the
accounts that Indrasena just expounded. However, as your sister noted
there is an association of the vyāhṛti-s with the sviṣṭakṛt rite for
setting right the errors of ritual. Indeed, as you know well, such
vyāhṛti oblations and calls are a general feature of most gṛhya rites
and also śrauta rituals such the sāmidhenī incantations where they make
up the syllables corresponding to the rest of the year beyond the 365. I
would say this pervasive use is an indication of their ancient and
pre-Prājāpatya ritual roles, substantiating their conception as the
internal fastenings of the Veda. An unambiguous case for their
pre-Prājāpatya role is made by their central role in the silent
incantations that are inaudibly recited as as part of various śastra-s,
as also the similar incantations used in the morning and evening
offerings of the Agnihotra. Thus, the śruti of the Aitareya-s states
that one concludes the Ājya and Praüga recitation with bhūr agnir jyotir
jyotir agniḥ ॥; the Niṣkevalya and Marutvatīya recitations with indro
jyotir bhuvo jyotir indraḥ ॥ and the Āgnimāruta and Vaiśvadeva
recitations with sūryo jyotir jyotiḥ svaḥ sūryaḥ ॥ as the inaudible
incantations. This give us a glimpse of their ancient use in a śrauta
context going back to pre-Prājāpatya times. But we see pervasive signs
of their place in even more routine rites that reinforce the proposal
that their common place use was of pre-Prājāpatya provenance — I guess
you might agree Indrasena?”

I: “I was just about to interject in this regard. To build up the
context, we may first note the Vyāhṛti-kalpa from the gṛhya appendix of
the Bodhāyana-s, which teaches the 12000x japa of the mahāvyāhṛti-s for
the attainment of specific goals and purification. It was this tradition
of the japa of the vyāhṛti-s that one hand was incorporated into nitya
and naimittika rituals focused on Deva Savitṛ — like the very fact that
we use either the three mahāvyāhṛti-s or the seven vyāhṛti-s: BHUḤ
BHUVAḤ SUVAḤ MAHAḤ JANAḤ TAPAḤ SATYAM coupled the Sāvitrī in our routine
daily japa. The same applies to the coupling of the mahāvyāhṛti-s with
the Sāvitrī and the Trisuparṇa in the mahat (the great) rite taught by
Uddālaka Āruṇi to Yājñvalkya Vājasaneya, the founders of the śukla
tradition. Indeed, this coupling of the mahāvyāhṛti-s with the Sāvitrī
is extended in tradition of the Jaiminīya singers, wherein two
additional vyāhṛti-s are added to the list to make it a total of five,
just as the seven in the other traditions. These are SATYAM and PURUṢA,
after which comes the gāyatra sāman composed on the Sāvitrī. On the
other hand the pure mahā-vyāhṛti japa also developed into the song of
vyāhṛti-s in the tradition of the Rāṇāyanīya and Kauthuma singers. In
that song, the musically rendered vyāhṛti-s are sandwiched between two
musical praṇava-s and interspersed with 3 repetitions of the magical
stobha-s with the concluding bhakti-s of the suvar-jyotiḥ, reminiscent
of both the śastra incantation you mentioned and the brahmaśiras that
closes the Sāvitrī with the ten praṇava-s (OṂ BHUḤ । OṂ BHUVAḤ । OM̐
SUVAḤ । OṂ MAHAḤ । OṂ JANAḤ । OṂ TAPAḤ। OM̐ SATYAM । OṂ tat savitur
vareṇyam । bhargo devasya dhimahi । dhiyo yo naḥ prachodayāt ॥ OM āpo
jyotī raso amṛtam brahma BHŪR-BHUVA-SVAROM ॥). Similar to this
connection to the Sāvitrī, the vyāhṛti-s are also incorporated into the
important vyāhṛti-homa-s of the Yajuṣ tradition (bhūr annam agnaye
svāhā… ityādi) which culminate in the incantation of Indra as the bull
among the meters that your wife just mentioned. Notably, the last of the
vyāhṛti-homa incantations include the fourth vyāhṛti, mahas. All these
not only indicate the pervasive presence of the mahāvyāhṛti-s but also
the other vyāhṛti-s in a range of prayoga-s, like say the offerings to
Mahārāja in the Āraṇyaka of the Taittirīyaka-s. These strongly favor the
idea that the Prājāpatya-s were merely incorporating a widely use
mantra-tradition into their philosophizing.”

S: “Good. In this regard I would note that the special vyāhṛti, PURUṢA,
of the singers is also used in other recitations. One such is during the
expiatory singing of the Vāmadevya Stotra based on RV 4.31.1-3 composed
by the illustrious ancestor of our wives. The last of these ṛk-s is
short by 3 syllables from the gāyatrī; hence, he should insert the the 3
syllables of the vyāhṛti PURUṢA and recite this ṛk as a proper gāyatrī
before the Vāmadevya Stotra is sung. Thus, we have:  
OṂ abhī ṣu ṇaḥ sakhīnām PU avitā jaritṝṇāṃ RU । śatam bhavāsy ūtibhiḥ
ṢAḤ ॥

Similarly, during the recitation of the Rājana incantation in the
nocturnal ritual of the winter solstice we insert a PURUṢA into the
intertwining of the ṛk of my ancient clansman Bṛhaddiva Ātharvaṇa and
that of Priyamedha Āṅgirasa:  
tad id āsa bhuvaneṣu jyeṣṭham PU  
nadaṃ va odatīnāṃ \|  
yato jajña ugras tveṣanṛmṇo RU  
nadaṃ yoyuvatīno3m ।

Bṛhaddiva Ātharvaṇa:  
He indeed was the foremost in the universes,  
who was born with fierce, mighty manliness  
Simultaneously, with his birth, he melts down the enemies  
as all his friends \[Viṣṇu, Vāyu and the Marut-s\] cheer him on.

Priyamedha Āṅgirasa:  
At the roaring bull among the eager females,  
at the roaring bull among the coy young ladies,  
at the lord of your milk-giving cows,  
shoot your arrow \[in the form of the chant\]

As you can see, the intertwining couples a mantra indicating the
manliness of Indra with one indicating him as the bull among the
females; thus, the vyāhṛti PURUṢA here becomes the seed that is infused
into the incantation.”

I: “Somakhya, having gone so far into the realm of the vyāhṛti-s and
their prayoga-s, let us return to my original question regarding the
roots of the vyāhṛti-s of the Atharvan-s. Where all are they found and
what are their prayoga-s?”  
S: “Prājāpatya brahmavāda for the AV vyāhṛti-s given in the Gopatha
Brāhmaṇa is closely but briefly paralleled by the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,
which states that the local worlds was generated in fluid from the three
mahāvyāhṛti-s. In contrast, the higher realms of space are said to have
been generated from vyāhṛti-s KARAT, JANAT, VṚDHAT and SATYAM. This
indicates that there was a wider knowledge and tradition of most of the
AV vyāhṛti-s. In terms of ritual, we can see from the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa
itself that the prayoga is in the context of the older Aindra religion,
in the offering to the Marut-s and other deities who are in the company
of Indra (the Indravant-s). Even as the vyāhṛti PURUṢA is deployed
within the incantations that we just discussed, one could make a case
for a similar wider presence for most of the AV vyāhṛti-s. You noted the
emergence of equivalents of MAHAT and JANAD among other vaidika
traditions. To that I would add the use other AV vyāhṛti-s in various
traditions. For instance, the Vārāha-gṛhya-sūtra of the Maitrāyaṇīya-s
specifies the use of the triad karat, janat and bṛhat (unique to that
tradition, and semantically mirroring mahat or mahat) in the Garbhadhāna
ritual. Coming to the Taittirīyaka-s, we have Iḍa recitations laid down
by my ancestor Jamadagni Bhārgava for the drawing of the milk offerings
in the Agnihotra as taught by Āpastamba: BHŪR IḌĀ BHUVA IDĀ SUVAR IḌĀ
KARAD IḌĀ PṚTHIG IḌĀ ॥ In this tradition, the first three mahāvyāhṛti-s
are, as usual, associated with the Agni on earth, Vāyu in the atmosphere
and Sūrya in the heavens. Of the two further vyāhṛti-s, karat, matching
the AV tradition, corresponds to the moon moving against the backdrop of
the nakṣatra-s and the YV-specific PṚTHIK corresponding to the medicinal
herbs discovered by Jamadagni Bhārgava. The Āśvalāyana-s have only four
drawings of milk, and use vṛdhat instead of karat, again matching one
the AV vyāhṛti-s. Interestingly, the Maitrāyaṇīya-s instead use janat in
this context. Thus, these vyāhṛti-s are individually used in the other
traditions but come together as a whole in the AV tradition and the
svāhā offerings with them are specified in the Kauśika-sūtra-s.

This brings us to TAT and ŚAM. I’d posit that those arose from the
ancient opening of the Śamyuvāka incantation which is repeatedly
mentioned throughout the śruti. Its ancient use is suggested by opening
of the Śamyuvāka being sought from Rudra in the ṛk of Kaṇva, the son of
Ghora Aṅgirasa in the RV. In regard to TAT, one might also note that it
might have a link to its use in the Yajuṣ incantation of the supreme
Vāyu: OṂ tad brahma । OṂ tad vāyuḥ । OṂ tad ātmā । OṂ tat satyam । OṂ
tat sarvam । OṂ tat puror namaḥ ॥ Finally, coming to the praṇava as an
AV vyāhṛti, it seems to be a natural inclusion given the intimate link
the mahāvyāhṛti-s share with it mīmāṃsā and prayoga. We see that, for
example, in the Upaniṣat statement that identifies them with Indra as
the bull among the Chandas, which Lootika just mentioned. Finally, I
should also mention one of the homologies that the Atharvan tradition
recognizes between these vyāhṛti-s and the wider horizon of texts. Thus,
it has janat as equivalent to the compilation of the Āṅgirasa-s — the
Āṅgirasa-veda; similarly we have vṛdhat and Sarpaveda, karat and
Piśāchaveda, ruhat and Asuraveda, mahat and the Itihāsa-s, and tat and
the Purāṇa-s. This perhaps reflects both the growing corpus of texts and
awareness of texts of other traditions — like the Asuraveda — it could
be some kind of memory of the Iranian texts.”

V: “What are some of the meditations one should be mindful of when
performing a japa or contemplation on the progression of vyāhṛti-s?”  
I: “The most important one is the japa of the threefold mahāvyāhṛti-s
preceded by a praṇava. During this, as in the Vaiśvadeva songs of the
Chandoga-s, one meditates on the Vasu-s associating them with BHUR; them
one meditates on the Rudra-s associating them with the utterance of
BHUVAS; then one mediates on the Āditya-s while uttering SUVAR. With the
preceding OṂ, one meditates on Indra or Viśvedeva-s, i.e. the entire
pantheon. While moving from one mahāvyāhṛti to another one perceives the
connector deities: SUVAR and BHUḤ are connected by Dyāvā-Pṛthivī; BHUR
and BHUVAS by Agnī-ṣomā; BHUVAS and SUVAR by Vātā-Parjanyā. When
uttering the five vyāhṛti-s, i.e., mahāvyāhṛti-s + TAPAS and SATYAM one
additionally meditates on the primal heat from which all arose and the
very nature of existence. May be Somakhya could add more while returning
to our starting point of the AV vyāhṛti-s?”

L: “Also, before rounding up this discussion it would be worthwhile if
you could touch upon some of the mīmāṃsā-s on the different sets of
vyāhṛti-s that are not widely aired by the extant brahmavādin-s focused
on Prājāpatya and Uttaramīmāṃsā traditions.”  
S: “Sure. Their connection to the Sāvitrī and the god Savitṛ is the most
apparent one. The śruti holds that the inviolable laws of Savitṛ, like
the probabilities of the draws of the vibhīdaka nuts from the hole, are
the ones which run the universe: deva iva savitā satyadharmā: like the
laws of the god Savitṛ that hold true. The mahāvyāhṛti-s illustrate
their most apparent domain of action: the near realm, the mid-region and
the realm of the sun. The more expanded set of seven vyāhṛti-s yoked to
the Sāvitrī indicate their broader sphere of action — Mahas: the wider
space. Then we move into the temporal axis: janas: the origin of space
itself. What drives its emergence? tapas: heat. Finally, the very fact
that something exists: satyam: also expressing the inviolable or true
nature of the laws of Savitṛ, the ṛta. Indeed, Kṛṣṇa Āṅgirasa states:  
ṛtena devaḥ savitā śamāyata  
ṛtasya śṛṅgam urviyā vi paprathe ।  
By the natural law the god Savitṛ exerts himself,  
\[by that\] the antler of the natural law has spread widely.

The Samaveda adds the vyāhṛti, PURUṢA, after SATYAM. This may be seen as
the root of the concept that was later expanded in Sāṃkhyā — the Puruṣa
as consciousness. In placing the final Puruṣa, the singers posited a
system in which the laws and existence itself might be objects in the
conscious experience of the sole reality, the Puruṣa. The next notable
mīmāṃsā of the vyāhṛti-s pertains to the way we deployed the mahāvyāhṛti
triad with the three feet of the AV mantra-s to Viṣṇu. This connection
is declared by the Jaiminīya-s, who state that the vyāhṛti-s were
offered to Viṣṇu. The three feet of the deployed mantra-s indeed
correspond to the three steps of Viṣṇu, who appeared as a dwarf and
suddenly grew to a gigantic size to conquer the worlds from the Dānava-s
with his famed triple strides: bṛhaccharīro vimimāna ṛkvabhir
yuvākumāraḥ praty ety āhavam ॥ As the founder of your race, O Gautamī-s,
states in the primal śruti, that gargantuan form of Viṣṇu is said to
measure out the worlds with the ṛk-s — those are the corresponding AV
ṛk-s we deploy conjoined to the vyāhṛti-s. The Kāṇva-s further add that
those steps were the ones with gathered the atoms — samūḍham asya
paṃsure ॥ — from which the universe condenses. Hence, while uttering
that incantation the ritualist meditates on the great Viṣṇu stamping out
the Asura-s and likewise calls on him to exclude his rivals from his
space. This association with the vyāhṛti-s also extends to Viṣṇu’s wife
in the incantation seen in the Mahānārāyaṇopaniṣat of the late AV
tradition that you all know very well:  
OṂ bhūr lakṣmī bhuvar lakṣmīḥ suvaḥ kālakarṇī tan no mahālakṣmīḥ
pracodayāt ॥  
This incantation is notable in placing Kālakarṇī in suvar. This is from
her association with visible time in the form of the apparent movement
of the sun in the sky. As you all know well from your Āgamika practice
she is none other than the gigantic, dreadful, fanged, death-dealing
eponymous goddess, armed with a bow, arrows, axe, sword, cakra, trident
and a cleaver, emitted by Rudrāṇī from her mouth to terrorize the gods
for their support of Prajāpati Dakṣa. The fourth vyāhṛti mahat is
subliminally hinted by her name Mahālakṣmī, encompassing the wider
space.

Coming the the AV vyāhṛti-s, the coupling OṂ BHŪR JANAT ॥ expiates ṛk
errors and is offered in the Gārhapatya; OṂ BHUVO JANAT ॥ expiates yajuṣ
errors and is offered in the Dakṣiṇa; OṂ SVAR JANAT ॥ expiates Sāman
errors and is offered in the Āhavanīya; OṂ BHŪR BHUVAḤ SVAR JANAD OM ॥
expiates Atharvan errors and is also offered in the Āhavanīya. Here the
JANAT is seen as regenerating the flawed incantations. Vrishchika, it
may interest you that the AV tradition uses a metallurgical analogy of
fusing metals for the welding role of these vyāhṛti-s, unlike the
medical analogy of the Aitareya that you noted. The AV also holds that
the same combination of vyāhṛti-s are the incantations uttered by the
brahman before he asks the udgātṛ to sing the stoma to the god Bṛhaspati
in the somayāga. Likewise he utters the entire gamut of vyāhṛti-s OṂ
BHŪR BHUVAḤ SVAR JANAD VṚDHAT KARAD RUHAN MAHAT TAC CHAM OM when urging
the udgātṛ to sing the song of the Indravant-s derived from the famous
Evayāmarut ṛk to the Marut-s and Viṣṇu that was composed by your
illustrious ancestor, O Indrasena (pra vo mahe matayo yantu viṣṇave
marutvate girijā evayāmarut । pra śardhāya pra yajyave sukhādaye tavase
bhandadiṣṭaye dhunivratāya śavase॥). As an aside that mantra-s is
notable in more than one way but you may note the phrase girijā — Viṣṇu
emerging from the mountain — a mythologem that presages his emergence
from the pillar in the later Nṛsiṃha cycle — but here he emerges with
the marching troop of the Marut-s to head for battle, evidently to join
Indra in the battle against the Dānava-s.

In the purely AV performance, as we did earlier today (or in the
muttered incantation of the brahman), it is deployed with the Indravant
ṛk which illustrates the connections to various vyāhṛti-s. With Agni we
are connected to Bhūr, with Vāta (Vāyu) Bhuvas, with Viṣṇu, the realm of
the Āditya-s. All the special vyāhṛti-s can be seen as having deep
connections with Indra and the Indravant-s. As we saw before the two
praṇava-s at the beginning and the end are the mark of Indra. Janat
indicates the emergence of Viṣṇu and the Marut-s from the mountain,
which is a metaphor for the world axis — thus on one hand it represent
the origin of time that Viṣṇu manifests as. On the other birth of the
Marut-s that made the universe manifest. That manifestation and the
growth of the universe, which is how the sons of Rudra manifest is
indicated by Vṛdhat. Karat is action of filling the universe, as the
ancient Bhārgava, Uśanas Kāvya, is quoted by Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi: karat
tisro maghavā dānucitrā : Maghavan made three realms fill with
glistening droplets. Ruhat, stands for the ascendance of the gods,
manifesting as the rising sun in which they are worshiped. Mahat, as we
saw before represent the great expanse of the universe. Finally Tat and
Śam are the bliss that one attains from the gods upon the success of the
ritual.”
