## CHAPTER XVI.

  

INDECLINABLES.

1096\. THE indeclinable words are less distinctly divided into separate
parts of speech in Sanskrit than is usual elsewhere in Indo-European
language — especially owing to the fact that the class of prepositions
hardly has a real existence, but is represented by certain adverbial
words which are to a greater or less extent used prepositionally. They
will, however, be briefly described here under the usual heads.

Adverbs.

1097\. Adverbs by Suffix. Classes of adverbs, sometimes of considerable
extent, are formed by the addition of adverb-making suffixes especially
to pronominal roots or stems, but also to noun and adjective stems.

a\. There is no ultimate difference between such suffixes and the
case-endings in declension; and the adverbs of this division sometimes
are used in the manner of cases.

1098\. With the suffix `tas` are made adverbs having an ablative sense,
and not rarely also an ablative construction. Such are made:

a\. From pronominal roots, in `átas`, `itás`, `tátas`, `yátas`, `kútas`,
`amútas`, `svatas` (not found earlier); from the pronominal stems in `t`
or `d` (494) of the personal pronouns: thus, `mattás` (only example in
V.), `tvattas`, `asmattas`, `yuṣmattas`; and from pronominal
derivatives: thus, `itarátas`, `katarátas`.

b\. From noun and adjective stems of every class, since the earliest
period, but more freely later: e. g. `mukhatás`, `agratás`, `ṛbhutás`,
`ṛktás`, `hṛttás`, `çīrṣatás`, `janmatas`, `nastás`, `yajuṣṭas`,
`pārátas`, `anyátas`, `anyatarátas`, `sarvátas`, `dakṣiṇatás`,
`abhīpatás` (once, in RV., from a case-form: `patsutás`).

c\. From a few prepositions: thus, `abhítas`, `parítas`, `ántitas`.

d\. Examples of ablative construction are: `áto bhū́yaḥ` (RV.) *more than
that;* `tátaḥ ṣaṣṭhā́t` (AV.) *from that sixth;* `áto ‘nyéna` (ÇB.) *with
any other than this;* `sarvato bhayāt` (AGS.) *from all fear;*
`kutaç cid deçād āgatya` (H.) *arriving from some region or other;*
`purād itaḥ` (R.) *from this city;* `tasmāt pretakāyataḥ` (KSS.) *from
that dead body*.

e\. But the distinctive ablative meaning is not infrequently effaced,
and the adverb has a more general, especially a locative, value: thus,
`agratás` *in front;* `asmatsamīpatas` *in our presence;* `dharmatas`
*in accordance with duty;* chāgatas (H.) *with reference to the goat;*
`guṇato ‘dhikaḥ` (M.) *superior in virtue*.

1099\. With the suffix `tra` (in the older language often `trā`) are
made adverbs having a locative sense, and occasionally also a locative
construction.

a\. These adverbs are very few, compared with those in `tas`. They are
formed chiefly from pronominal stems, and from other stems having a
quasi-pronominal character: namely, in `tra`, `átra`, `tátra`, `yátra`,
`kútra`, `amútra`, `anyátra`, `viçvátra`, `sarvátra`, `ubhayátra`,
`aparatra`, `uttaratra`, `itarátra`, `anyataratra`, `pūrvatra`,
`paratra`, `samānátra`, `ekatra`, `anekatra`, `ekāikatra`; in `trā`,
`asmatrā́`, `satrā́`, `purutrā́`, `bahutrā́`, `dakṣiṇatrā́`. But a few in trā
come from ordinary nouns: thus, `devatrā́`, `martyatrā́`, `puruṣatrā́`,
`manuṣyatrā́`, `pākatrā́`, `çayutrā́`, `kurupañcālatrā́`. Those in `trā` are
distinguished from the others by their accent.

b\. Examples of locative construction are: `hásta ā́ dakṣiṇatrā́` (RV.)
*in the right hand;* `yátrā́ ’dhi` (RV.) *in which;* `ekatra puruṣe`
(MBh.) *in a single man;* `atra mārātmake` (H.) *in this murderous
creature;* `prabhutvaṁ tatra yujyate` (H.) *sovereignty befits him*.
And, as the locative case is used also to express the goal of motion
(304), so the adverbs in `tra` have sometimes an accusative as well as a
locative value: thus, `tatra gaccha` *go there* or *thither;*
`pathó devatrā́ yā́nān` (RV.) *roads that go to the gods*.

1100\. One or two other suffixes of locality are:

a\. ha, in `ihá` *here*, `kúha` *where?* and the Vedic `viçváha` (also
`viçváhā`, `viçvā́hā`) *always* (compare below, 1104b); and `ihá` (like
`átra` etc.: 1099 b) is sometimes used with locative-case value: e. g.
`iha samaye` (H.) *at this conjuncture*.

b\. `tāt`, which is added to words having already a local or directive
value: thus, to adverbial accusatives, `prā́ktāt`, `údaktāt`, `tā́vattāt`;
to adverbial ablatives, `ārā́ttāt`, `uttarā́ttāt`, `parākā́ttāt`; and to
prepositional adverbs, `paçcā́tāt`, `adhā́stāt`, `avástāt`, `parástāt`,
`purástāt`, `bahíṣṭāt`. Apparently by analogy with these last, the
suffix has the form `stāt` in `upáriṣṭāt` (and BhP. has `udastāt`).

c\. `hi`, in `uttarā́hi` (ÇB.) and `dakṣiṇāhi` (not quotable).

1101\. By the suffix `thā` are made adverbs of manner, especially from
pronominal roots or stems.

a\. Thus, `táthā`, `yáthā`; `kathā́` and `itthā́` (by the side of which
stand `kathám` and `itthám`; and ÇB. has `itthā́t`); and the rare
`imáthā` and `amúthā`. And `átha` (V. often `áthā`) *so then* doubtless
belongs with them. Further, from a few adjective and noun stems, mostly
of quasi-pronominal character: thus, `viçváthā`, `sarváthā`, `anyáthā`,
`ubhayáthā`, `aparathā`, `itaráthā`, `yataráthā`, `yatamáthā`,
`katarathā`, `katamathā`, `pūrváthā`, `pratnáthā`, `ūrdhváthā`,
`tiraçcáthā`, `ekathā` (JB.), `ṛtuthā́`, `nāmáthā `(once, AV.); and
`eváthā`.

b\. `Yáthā` becomes usually toneless in V., when used in the sense of
`iva` after a noun forming the subject of comparison: thus,
`tāyávo yathā` (RV.) *like thieves*.

1102\. One or two other suffixes of manner are:

a\. `ti`, in `íti` *thus*, very commonly used, from the earliest period,
especially as particle of quotation, following the words quoted.

b\. Examples are: `brahmajāyé ’yám íti céd ávocan` (RV.) *if they have
said "this is a Brahman's wife";*
`táṁ devā́ abruvan vrā́tya kíṁ nú tiṣṭasī́ ’ti` (AV.) *the gods said to
him: Vrātya, why do you stand?"* Often, the `iti` is used more
pregnantly: thus, `yáḥ çraddádhāti sánti devā́ íti` (AV.) *whoever has
faith that the gods exist;* `taṁ vyāghram munir mūṣiko ‘yam iti paçyati`
(H.) *the sage looks upon that tiger as being really a mouse;*
`yūyaṁ kim iti sīdatha` (H.) *why* (lit. *alleging what reason*) *do you
sit?*

c\. But `iti` is sometimes used in a less specialized way, to mark an
onomatopœia, or to indicate a gesture: e. g. `bahíṣ ṭe astu bā́l íti`
(AV.) *let it come out of you with a splash;* `íty ágre kṛṣáty áthé ’ti`
(ÇB.) *he ploughs first this way, then this way;* or it points forward
to something to be said: e. g.
`yan nv ity āhur anyāni chandāṅsi varṣīyāṅsi kasmād bṛhaty ucyata iti`
(PB.) *when now they say thus: "the other metres are greater; why is
the* `bṛhatī` *spoken?"* It also makes a number of derivatives and
compounds: e. g. `ititha` *the so-many-eth;* `itivat` *in this fashion;*
`ityartham` *for this purpose;* `itihāsa` *a story* or *legend* (lit.
*thus forsooth it was*). As to the use of a nominative with `iti` as
predicate to an accusative, see 268 b.

d. With the suffix of `íti` is to be compared that of `táti` etc.
(519). The word is abbreviated to `ti` two or three times in ÇB.

e\. `va` in `iva` (toneless) *like, as*, and `evá` (in V. often `evā́`),
earlier *thus*, later a particle emphasizing the preceding word; for
*thus* is used later the related `evám`, which hardly occurs in RV., and
in AV. only with √`vid`: as, `evám vidvā́n` *knowing thus*.

f\. In later Vedic (AV. etc., and the later parts of RV.) `iva` more
often counts for only a single syllable, `’va`.

1103\. a. By the suffix `dā` are made adverbs of time, but almost only
from pronominal roots.

b\. Thus, `tadā́`, `yadā́`, `kadā́` (in RV. also `kádā`), `idā́` (only in
V.); and `sádā`, beside which is found earlier `sádam`. Besides these,
in the older language, only `sarvadā́`; later a few others, `anyadā`,
`ekadā`, `nityadā`. A quasi-locative case use is seen occasionally in
such phrases as `kadācid divase` (R.) *on a certain day*.

c\. By the perhaps related `dānīm` are made `idā́nīm`, `tadā́nīm`,
`viçvadā́nīm`, `tvadānīm` (toneless). `Viçvadā́ni` occurs as adjective in
TB.

d\. With `rhi` are made, from pronominal roots, `tárhi`, `etárhi`,
`yárhi`, `kárhi`, `amúrhi`.

e\. The suffix `di`, found only in `yádi` *if*, is perhaps related with
`dā`, in form as in meaning. `Sadadí` (MS.) is of doubtful character.

1104\. By the suffix `dhā` are formed adverbs especially from numerals,
signifying -*fold, times, ways*, etc.

a\. Thus, `ekadhā́`, `dvidhā́` (also `dvídhā` and `dvedhā́`), `trídhā` (in
the older language usually `tredhā́`), `ṣaḍḍhā́` (also `ṣoḍhā́` and
`ṣaḍdhā`), `dvādaçadhā́`, `ekānnaviṅçatidhā́`, `sahasradhā́`, and so on.
Also, naturally, from words having a quasi-numeral character: thus,
`anekadhā`, `katidhā́`, `tatidhā́`, `bahudhā́`, `purudhā́`, `viçvádhā`,
`çaçvadhā́`, `aparimitadhā`, `yāvaddhā́`, `etāvaddhā́`, `māsadhā`. In a
very few cases, also from general noun and adjective stems: thus,
`mitradhā́` (AV.), `priyadhā́` (TS.; `predhā́`, MS.), `ṛjudhā́` (TB.),
`urudhā` and `citradhā` (BhP.); and from one adverb, `bahirdhā́`.

b\. The particle `ádha` or `ádhā`, a Vedic equivalent of `átha`,
probably belongs here (`purudhá` and `viçvádha`, with shortened final,
occur a few times in RV.); also `addhā́` *in truth*; and perhaps `sahá`
*with*, which has an equivalent `sadha`- in several Vedic compounds. And
the other adverbs in `ha` (1100 a) may be of like origin.

1105\. From a few numerals are made multiplicative adverbs with `s`:
namely, `dvís`, `trís`, and `catúr` (probably, for `catúrs`): 489 a.

a\. The corresponding word for *once*, `sakṛ́t`, is a compound rather
than a derivative; and the same character belongs still more evidently
to `pañcakṛ́tvas`, `navakṛ́tvas`, `aparimitakṛ́tvas`, etc., though `kṛt`
and `kṛtvas` are regarded by the native grammarians as suffixes; the
earlier texts (AV. ÇB. MS.) have `saptá kṛ́tvas`, `dáça kṛ́tvas`,
`dvā́daça kṛ́tvas`, `aṣṭā́v evá kṛ́tvas`, etc. AB. has the redundant
combination `triṣ kṛtvah`.

b\. The quasi-suffix `dyus`, from a case-form of `div` *day*, is in a
similar manner added to various determining-words, generally made to end
in e: e. g. `anyedyús` *another day*, `ubhayedyus` (AV. -`yadyús`) *on
either day*, `pūrvedyús` *the day before*.

1106\. By the suffix `çás` are made, especially from numeral or
quantitative stems, many adverbs of quantity or measure or manner,
generally used distributively.

a\. Examples are: `ekaçás` *one by one*, `çataçás` *by hundreds*,
`ṛtuçás` *season by season*, `pacchas` *foot by foot*, `akṣaraçás`
*syllable by syllable*, `gaṇaçás` *in crowds*, `stambaçás` *by bunches*,
`paruççás` *limb by limb*, `tāvacchás` *in such and such number or
quantity:* and, in a more general way, `sarvaçás` *wholly*, `mukhyaças`
*principally*, `kṛchraças` *stingily*, `manmaçás` *as minded*.

1107\. By the suffix `vát` are made with great freedom, in every period
of the language, adverbs signifying *after the manner of, like*, etc.

a\. Thus, `an̄girasvát` *like Angiras*, `manuṣvát` (RV.) *as Manu did*,
`jamadagnivát` *after the manner of Jamadagni*; `pūrvavát` or
`pratnavát` or `purāṇavát`, *as of old*, `kākatālīyavat` *after the
fashion of the crow and the palm-fruit*.

b\. This is really the adverbially used accusative (with adverbial shift
of accent: below, 1111 g) of the suffix `vant` ( 1233 f), which in the
Veda makes certain adjective compounds of a similar meaning: thus,
`tvā́vant` *like thee*, `mā́vant` *of my sort*, etc.

1108\. By the suffix `sāt` are made from nouns quasi-adverbs signifying
*in* or *into the condition* or *the possession of* what is indicated by
the noun; they are used only with verbs of being, of becoming, and of
making: namely, oftenest `kṛ` and `bhū`, but also `as`, `gam`, `yā`, and
`nī` (and, according to the grammarians, `sam-pad`). Some twenty-five
examples are quotable from the later literature; but none from the
earlier, which also appears to contain nothing that casts light upon the
origin of the formation. The `s` of `sāt` is not liable to conversion
into `ṣ`. The connection with the verb is not so close as to require the
use of the gerund in `ya` instead of that in `tvā` (990); and other
words are sometimes interposed between the adverb and verb.

a\. Examples are: `sarvakarmāṇi bhasmasāt kurute` (MBh.) *reduces all
deeds to ashes;* `loko ‘yam dasyusād bhaved` (MBh.) *this world would
become a prey to barbarians;* `yasya brāhmaṇasāt sarvaṁ vittam āsīt`
(MBh.) *whose whole property was given to Brahmans*;
`niyataṁ bhasmasād yāti` (Har.) *it is inevitably reduced to ashes;*
`agnīn ātmasāt kṛtvā` (Y.) *having taken the fires to one's self*.

1109\. a. Suffixes, not of noun-derivation or of inflection, may be
traced with more or less plausibility in a few other adverbs. Thus, for
example, in `prātár` *early*, and `sanutár` *away;* in `dakṣiṇít` *with
right hand*, and `cikitvít` *with consideration;* in `nūnám` *now*, and
`nānānám` *variously*. But the cases are in the main too rare and
doubtful to be worth notice here.

b\. In the epics begin to be found a small class (about a dozen are
quotable) of adverbs having the form of a repeated noun-stem with its
first occurrence ending in `ā` and its second in `i`: e. g. `hastāhasti`
*hand to hand*, `rathārathi` *chariot against chariot*, `karṇākarṇi`
*ear to ear*.

c\. The adverbs thus far described are almost never used
prepositionally. Those of the next division, however, are in many
instances so used.

1110\. Case-forms used as Adverbs. A large number of adverbs are more or
less evidently cases in form, made from stems which are not otherwise in
use. Also many cases of known stems, pronominal or noun or adjective,
are used with an adverbial value, being distinguished from proper cases
by some difference of application, which is sometimes accompanied by an
irregularity of form.

1111\. The accusative is the case most frequently and widely used
adverbially. Thus:

a\. Of pronominal stems: as, `yád` *if, when, that*, etc.; `tád` *then*
etc.; `kím` *why, whether*, etc.; `idám` *now, here;* `adás` *yonder;*
and so on. Of like value, apparently, are the (mostly Vedic) particles
`kád`, `kám` and `kam` (?), `íd`, `cid` (common at every period), `smád`
and `sumád`, `īm` and `sīm` (by some regarded as still possessing
pronoun-value), -`kīm`. Compounds with `íd` are `céd` *if* , `néd`
*lest*, `éd`, `svid`, `kuvíd`; with `cid`, `kū́cid`; with -`kīm`, `nákīm`
and `mā́kīm` and `ā́kīm`.

b\. Of noun-stems: as, `nā́ma` *by name;* `súkham` *happily;* `kā́mam` *at
will, if you please;* `náktam` *by night;* `ráhas` *secretly;* `oṣám`
*quickly* (V.); and so on.

c\. Of adjective stems, in unlimited numbers: as, `satyám` *truly;*
`cirám` *long;* pū́rvam *formerly;* `nítyam` *constantly;* `bhū́yas`
*more, again;* `viçrabdham` *confidently;* `prakāçam` *openly;* and so
on.

d\. The neuter singular is the case commonly employed in this way; and
it is so used especially as made from great numbers of compound
adjective stems, often from such as hardly occur, or are not at all
found, in adjective use. Certain of these adverbial compounds, having an
indeclinable as prior member, are made by the Hindu grammarians a
special class of compounds, called `avyayībhāva` (1313).

e\. But the feminine singular also is sometimes used, especially in the
so-called adverbial endings of comparison, `tarām` and `tamām`, which
are attached to particles (cf. 1119), and even (473 c) to verb-forms:
e. g. `natarā́m`, `kathaṁtarām`, `uccaistarā́m`, `çanāistarām`,
`jyoktamā́m`. In the oldest language (RV. and AV.), the neuter instead of
the feminine form of these suffixes is almost alone in use: see 1119.

f\. Many adverbs of obscure form or connection are to be explained with
probability as accusatives of obsolete noun or adjective stems: examples
are `tūṣṇī́m` *in silence;* `sāyám` *at evening;* `sākám` *together,
with* (prep.); `áram` or `álam` *sufficient* (in the later language used
with √kṛ in the manner of a prefix: 1078 a); `prāyas` *usually;* `īṣát`
*somewhat;* `amnás` *unexpectedly;* `bahís` *outside;* `míthu` and
`mithás`, `múhu` and `múhus`, `jā́tu`, and so on. `Madrík` etc., and
`niṇík` (in RV.), are perhaps contracted forms of adjectives having
√`ac` or `añc` as their final (407 ff.). The presence of other roots as
final members is also probable for `uçádhak`, `ānuṣák` and `āyuṣák`,
`anuṣṭhú` and `suṣṭhú`, `yugapát`, etc. Compare also the forms in `am`
beside those in `ā`, above, 1101 a, 1102 e, 1103 b.

g\. In (Vedic) `dravát` *quickly* is to be seen a change of accent for
the adverbial use (pple `drávant` *running*); and `drahyát` *stoutly*
(RV., once) may be another example. The comparative and superlative
suffixes (above, e) show a like change; and it is also to be recognized
in the derivatives with `vát` (1107).

1112\. The instrumental is also often used with adverbial value:
generally in the singular, but sometimes also in the plural. Thus:

a\. Of pronominal stems: as, `enā́` and `ayā́`, `káyā`, `anā́`, `amā́`,
`amuyā́`.

b\. Of noun-stems: as, `kṣaṇena` *instantly;* `açeṣeṇa` *completely;*
`viçeṣeṇa` *especially;* `dívā` *by day;* `diṣṭyā` *fortunately;*
`sáhasā` *suddenly;* `aktubhis` *by night;* and so on.

c\. Of adjectives, both neuter (not distinguishable from masculine) and
feminine: as, `akhilena` *wholly;* `prāyeṇa` *mostly;* `dákṣiṇena` *to
the south;* `úttareṇa` *to the north;* `ántareṇa` *within;* `ciréṇa`
*long;* — `çánāis` and `çánakāis` *slowly;* `uccāís` *on high;* `nīcāis`
*below;* `parācāís` *afar;* `táviṣībhis` *mightily;* and so on.

d\. More doubtful cases, mostly from the older language, may be
instanced as follows: `tiraçcátā`, `devátā`, `bāhúta`, and `sasvártā`
(all RV.), homonymous instrumentals from nouns in `tā`; `dvitā́`,
`tādī́tnā`, `īrmā́`, `mṛṣā́`, `vṛ́thā`, `sácā`, `asthā́` (?), `mudhā` (not
V.), `adhunā́` (B. and later).

e\. Adverbially used instrumentals are (in the older language), oftener
than any other case, distinguished from normal instrumentals by
differences of form: thus, especially, by an irregular accent: as, `amā́`
and `dívā` (given above); perhaps `gúhā`; `apākā́`, `āsayā́`, `kuhayā́`
(?); `naktayā́`, `svapnayā́`, `samanā́`; `adatrayā́`, `ṛtayā́`, `ubhayā́`,
`sumnayā́` (?); `daksinā́`, `madhyā́`; `nīcā́`, `prācā́`, `uccā́`, `paçcā́`,
`tiraçcā́`; `vasántā`; — in a few `u`-stems, by a `y` inserted before the
ending, which is accented: thus, `amuyā́` (given above), `āçuyā́`,
`sādhuyā́`, `raghuyā́`, `dhṛṣṇuyā́`, `` ``, `mithuyā́`; — and `urviyā́` (for
`urvyā́`) and `víçvyā` (properly `víçvayā`) are more slightly irregular.

1113\. The dative has only very seldom an adverbial use.

a\. Examples are `aparā́ya` *for the future* (RV.; with changed accent);
`cirāya` *long;* `arthāya` *for the sake of;* `ahnāya` *presently*.

1114\. The ablative is not infrequently used adverbially. Thus:

a\. Of pronominal stems: as, `kásmāt` *why?* `akasmāt` *casually,
unexpectedly;* `ā́t`, `tā́t`, `yā́t` (V.: normal forms, instead of the
pronominal `asmāt` etc.).

b\. Of noun-stems: as, `āsā́t` *near;* `ārā́t` *afar;* `balāt` *forcibly;*
`kutūhalāt` *emulously;* `sakāçāt` *on the part of*.

c\. Oftenest, of adjective stems: as, `dūrā́t` *afar;* `nīcā́t` below;
`paçcā́t` *behind;* `sākṣā́t` *plainly, actually;* `samantāt`
*completely;* `acirāt` *not long;* `pratyakṣatamāt` (AB.) *most
obviously;* `pratyantāt` (S.) *to the end*.

d\. In a few instances, adverbially used ablatives likewise show a
changed accent in the early language: thus, `apākā́t` *from afar;* `amā́t`
*from near by;* `sanā́t` *from of old* (but instr. `sánā`); `uttarā́t`
*from the north;* `adharā́t` *below*.

1115\. The genitive is almost never used adverbially.

a\. In the older language occur `aktós` *by night*, and `vástos` *by
day;* later, `cirasya` *long*.

1116\. The locative is sometimes used with adverbial value. Thus:

a\. From noun and adjective stems: `āké` *near;* `āré` and `dūré`
*afar;* `abhisvaré` *behind;* `astamīké` *at home;* `ṛté` *without*
(prep.); `ágre` *in front;* `sthāne` *suitably;* `sapadi` *immediately;*
-`arthe` and -`kṛte` (common in composition) *for the sake of;*
`aparī́ṣu` *in after time;* `ādāu` *first;* `rahasi` *in secret*.

1117\. Even a nominative form appears to be stereotyped into an
adverbial value in (Vedic) `kís`, interrogative particle, and its
compounds `nákis` and `mā́kis`, negative particles. And masc. nominatives
from `añc`-stems (as `parān̄ ` AB., `nyān̄  `Āpast.) are sometimes found
used by substitution for neuters.

1118\. Verbal Prefixes and kindred words. The verbal prefixes, described
in the preceding chapter (1076 ff.), are properly adverbs, having a
special office and mode of use in connection with verbal roots and their
more immediate derivatives.

a\. Their occasional looser connection with the verb has been noticed
above (1084). In the value of general adverbs, however, they only
rarely occur (except as `ápi` has mainly changed its office from prefix
to adverb or conjunction in the later language); but their prepositional
uses are much more frequent and important: see below, 1125 b.

b\. In composition with nouns, they (like other adverbial elements) not
infrequently have an adjective value: see below, 1281 ff., 1305.

1119\. Several of the prefixes (as noticed above, 473–4) form
comparative and superlative adjectives, by the suffixes `tara` and
`tama`, or `ra` and `ma`: thus, `úttara` and `uttamá`, `ádhara` and
`adhamá`, `ápara` and `apamá`, `ávara` and `avamá`, `úpara` and `upamá`,
and `prathamá` is doubtless of the same character; also, `ántara` and
`ántama`. And accusatives of such derivative adjectives (for the most
part not otherwise found in use) have the value of comparatives, and
rarely superlatives, to the prefixes themselves: thus,
`sáṁitaṁ cit saṁtaráṁ sáṁ çiçādhi` (AV.) *whatever is quickened do thou
still further quicken;* `vitaráṁ ví kramasva` (RV.) *stride out yet more
widely;* `prá táṁ naya prataráṁ vásyo ácha` (RV.) *lead him forward
still further toward advantage;* `úd enam uttaráṁ naya` (AV.) *lead him
up still higher.*

a\. Besides those instanced, are found also `nitaráṁ`, `apataráṁ`,
`abhitaráṁ`, `avataráṁ`, `parātaráṁ`, `parastaráṁ`. In the Brāhmaṇas and
later (above, 1111 e), the feminine accusative is used instead: thus,
`atitarā́m` and `atitamām`, `abhitarā́m`, `anutamā́m`, `ātamā́m`,
`pratitarā́m`, `nitarā́m`, `uttarā́m`, `pratarā́m` and `pratamā́m`,
`vitarā́m`, `saṁtarā́m` (also RV., once).

1120\. Kindred in origin and character with the verbal prefixes, and
used like them except in composition with verbs, are a few other
adverbs: thus, `avás` *down;* `adhás` *below* (and `adhastarā́m`);
`parás` *far off* (and `parastarā́m`); `purā́` *before;* `antarā́`
(apparently, `antár`+`ā́`) *among, between;* `ánti` *near;* `upári`
*above;* and `sahá` (already mentioned, 1104b) *along, with*, and `sácā`
*together, with*, may be noticed with them. `Vinā́` *without*, and
`viṣu`- *apart*, appear to be related with `ví`.

1121\. Inseparable Prefixes. A small number of adverbial prefixes are
found only in combination with, other elements. Thus:

a\. The negative prefix `a` or `an` — `an` before vowels, `a` before
consonants.

b\. It is combined especially with innumerable nouns and adjectives;
much more rarely, with adverbs, as `akútra` and `ápunar` (RV.), `áneva`
(AV.), `ánadhas` (TB.), `akasmāt`, `asakṛt`; in rare cases, also with
pronouns (as `atad`, `akiṁcit`); and even, in the later language, now
and then with verbs, as `aspṛhayanti` (BhP. Çiç.) *they do not desire*,
`alokayati` (SD.) *he does not view*. Now and then it is prefixed to
itself: e. g. `anakāmamāra`, `anaviprayukta`, `anavadya` (?).

c. In a very few cases, the negative `a` appears to be made long: thus,
`ā́sat` *non-existent*, `ā́deva` *godless*, `ā́rāti` *enemy*, `āçāuca`
*impurity*, `ā́tura` *ill* (?).

d\. The independent negative adverbs, `ná` and `mā́`, are only in
exceptional instances used in composition: see below, 1122e.

e\. The comitative prefix `sa`, used instead of the preposition `sám`,
and interchangeably with `sahá`, before nouns and adjectives.

f\. The prefix of dispraise `dus` *ill, badly* (identical with √`duṣ`:
225 a).

g\. It is combined in the same manner as `a` or `an`. Of combinations
with a verbal form, at least a single example appears to be quotable:
`duçcaranti` (R.) *behave ill*.

h\. The corresponding laudatory prefix `su` *well* is in general so
closely accordant in its use with the preceding that it is best
mentioned here, though it occurs not rarely as an independent particle
in the oldest language (in RV., more than two hundred times; in the
peculiar parts of AV., only fourteen times), and even occasionally
later.

i\. The particle `su` sometimes appears in B. and later before a
verb-form, and considering its rapid loss of independent use in V., and
the analogy of `a` and `dus` (above, b, g) it is probably at least in
part to be regarded as in composition with the verb. The `pada`-text of
AV. xix. 49. 10 reads `su`-`ápāyati`, but its testimony is of little or
no value. K. has `na su vijñāyete` and `na vāi su viduḥ`, and KeU. has
`su veda`; TB. has `susámbodháyati` (?); MBh. and BhP. have
`sūpatasthe`; R. has `suçakyante`.

j\. The exclamatory and usually depreciative prefixed forms of the
interrogative pronoun (506) are most analogous with the inseparable
prefixes.

1122\. Miscellaneous Adverbs. Other words of adverbial character and
office, not clearly referable to any of the classes hitherto treated,
may be mentioned as follows:

a\. Asseverative particles (in part, only in the older language): thus,
`an̄gá`, `hánta`, `kíla`, `khálu`, `tú` (rare in older language), `vāí`,
`vā́vá` (in Brāhmaṇa language only), `hi`, `hiná`, `u`, `áha`, `ha`,
`gha`, `samaha`, `sma`, `bhala`.

b\. Of these, `hánta` is a word of assent and incitement; `hí` has won
also an illative meaning, and accents the verb with which it stands in
connection (595 e); `sma` sometimes appears to give a past meaning to a
present tense (778 b); `u` is often combined with the final `a` of other
particles: thus, `átho`, `nó`, `mó`, `utó`, `úpo`, `pró`; but also with
that of verb-forms, as `dattó`, `vidmó`. The final `o` thus produced is
`pragṛhya` or uncombinable (138c). Particles of kindred value, already
mentioned above, are `íd`, `kám` or `kam`, `cid`, `jā́tu`, `evá`. Some
of the asseverative particles are much used in the later artificial
poetry with a purely expletive value, as devices to help make out the
metre (`pādapūraṇa` *verse-fillers*); so especially `ha`, `hi`, `tu`,
`sma`.

c\. Negative particles are: `ná`, signifying simple negation; `mā́`,
signifying prohibition.

d\. As to the construction of the verb with `mā́`, see above, 579. In the
Veda, `nú` (or `nū́`: 248 a) has also sometimes a negative meaning. For
the Vedic `ná` of comparison, see below, g, h.

e\. In `nahí`, `ná` is combined with `hí`, both elements retaining their
full meaning; also with `íd` in `néd` *lest*. It is perhaps present in
`nanú` and `caná`, but not in `hiná` (RV., once). In general, neither
`ná` nor `mā́` is used in composition to make negative compounds, but,
instead, the inseparable negative prefix `a` or `an` (1121 a):
exceptions are the Vedic particles `nákis` and `mā́kis`, `nákīm` and
`mā́kīm`; also `naciram` and `mā́ciram`, `napuṅsaka`, and, in the later
language, a number of others.

f\. Interrogative particles are only those already given: `kád`, `kim`,
`kuvíd`, `svid`, `nanú`, of which the last introduces an objection or
expostulation.

g\. Of particles of comparison have been mentioned the toneless `iva`,
and `yathā` (also toneless when used in the same way). Of frequent
occurrence in the oldest language is also `ná`, having (without loss of
accent) the same position and value as the preceding.

h\. Examples of the `ná` of comparison are:
`ṛṣidvíṣa íṣuṁ ná sṛjata dvíṣam` (RV.) *let loose your enmity like an
arrow at the enemy of the singer;* `váyo ná vṛkṣám` (AV.) *as birds to
the tree;* `gāuró ná tṛṣitáḥ piba` (RV.) *drink like a thirsty buffalo*.
This use is generally explained as being a modification or adaptation of
the negative one: thus, *\[although, to be sure\] not \[precisely\] a
thirsty buffalo*; and so on.

i\. Of particles of place, besides those already mentioned, may be
noticed `kvà` *where?* (in V., always to be read `kúa`).

j\. Particles of time are: `nú` *now* (also `nū́`: `nūnám` was mentioned
above, 1109 a), `adyá` and `sadyás` and `sadívas` (RV., once) *today, at
once* (all held to contain the element `div` or `dyu`), `hyás`
*yesterday*, `çvás` *tomorrow*, `jyók` (also related with dyu) *long;*
`púnar` *again*.

k\. Of particles of manner, besides those already mentioned, may be
noticed `nā́nā` *variously* (for `nānānám`, its derivative, see 1109 a);
`sasvár` (RV.) *secretly*.

l\. In the above classifications are included all the Vedic adverbial
words, and most of those of the later language: for the rest, see the
dictionaries. 

Prepositions.

1123\. There is, as already stated, no proper class of prepositions (in
the modern sense of that term), no body of words having for their
prevailing office the "government" of nouns. But many of the adverbial
words indicated above are used with nouns in a way which approximates
them to the more fully developed prepositions of other languages.

a\. If one and another of such words — as `vinā`, `ṛte` — occurs almost
solely in prepositional use, this is merely fortuitous and unessential.

1124\. Words are thus used prepositionally along with all the noun-cases
excepting the dative. But in general their office is directive only,
determining more definitely, or strengthening, the proper case-use of
the noun. Sometimes, however, the case-use is not easy to trace, and the
noun then seems to be more immediately "governed" by the preposition —
that is, to have its case-form more arbitrarily determined by its
association with the latter. This is oftenest true of the accusative;
and also of the genitive, which has, here as elsewhere (294 b), suffered
an extension of its normal sphere of use.

1125\. a. The adverbs by derivative form (1097 ff.) have least of a
prepositional value (exceptions are especially a few made with the
suffix `tas`: 1098).

b\. Most of the verbal prefixes (exceptions are `ud`, `ni`, `parā`,
`pra`; and `ava` and `vi` are almost such) have their prepositional or
quasi-prepositional uses with cases; but much more widely in the older
time than in the later: in the classical language the usage is mainly
restricted to `prati`, `anu`, and `ā`.

c\. Most of the directive words akin with the more proper prefixes are
used prepositionally: some of them — as `saha`, `vinā`, `upari`,
`antarā`, `purā` — freely, earlier and later.

d\. The case-forms used adverbially are in many instances used
prepositionally also: oftenest, as was to be expected, with the
genitive; but frequently, and from an early time, with the accusative;
more rarely with other cases.

e\. We will take up now the cases for a brief exposition, beginning with
those that are least freely used.

1126\. The Locative. This case is least of all used with words that can
claim the name of preposition. Of directives, `antár` and its later
derivative `antarā́`, meaning *within, in*, are oftenest added to it, and
in the classical language as well as earlier. Of frequent Vedic use with
it are `ā́` and `ádhi`: thus, `mártyeṣv ā́` *among mortals;*
`pṛthivyā́m ádhy óṣadhīḥ` *the plants upon the earth;*
`téjo máyi dhārayā́ ’dhi` (AV.) *establish glory* *in me;* — `ápi` and
`úpa` are much rarer: thus, `yā́ apā́m ápi vraté` \[`sánti`\] (RV.) *who
are in the domain of the waters;* `amū́r yā́ úpa sū́rye` \[`sánti`\] (RV.)
*who are up yonder in the sun;* — `sácā` *along with* is not rare in
RV., but almost entirely unknown later: thus, `pitróḥ sácā satī́`
*staying with her parents*.

1127\. The Instrumental. The directives used with this case are almost
only those which contain the associative pronominal root `sa`: as `sahá`
(most frequent), `sākám`, `sārdhám`, `samám`, `samáyā`, `sarátham`; and,
in the Veda, the prefix `sám`: as,
`te sumatíbhiḥ sám pátnībhir ná vṛ́ṣaṇo nasīmahi` (RV.) *may we be united
with thy favors as men with their spouses*. By substitution of the
instrumental for the ablative of separation (283 a), `vinā` *without*
(not Vedic) takes sometimes the instrumental; and so, in the Veda,
`avás` *down* and `parás` *beyond*, with which the ablative is also, and
much more normally, construed. And `ádhi`, in RV., is used with the
instrumental `snúnā` and `snúbhis`, where the locative would be
expected.

1128\. The Ablative. In the prepositional constructions of the ablative
(as was pointed out and partly illustrated above, 293), the ablative
value of the case, and the merely directive value of the added particle,
are for the most part clearly to be traced. Many of the verbal prefixes
are more or less frequently joined in the older language with this case:
oftenest, `ádhi` and `pári`; more sporadically, `ánu`, `ápa`, `áva`,
`práti`, and the separatives `nís` and `ví`. The change of meaning of
the ablative with `ā́` *hither*, by which it comes to fill the office of
its opposite, the accusative, was sufficiently explained above (293 c).
Of directive words akin with the prefixes, many — as `bahís`, `purás`,
`avás`, `adhás`, `parás`, `purā́`, `vinā`, and `tirás` *out of knowledge
of* — accompany this case by a perfectly regular construction. Also the
case-forms `arvā́k`, `prā́k`, `paçcā́t`, `ūrdhvám`, `pū́rvam`, `páram`, and
`ṛté` *without*, of which the natural construction with an ablative is
predominant earlier.

1129\. The Accusative. Many of the verbal prefixes and related words
take an accompanying accusative. Most naturally (since the accusative is
essentially the *to*-case), those that express a motion or action toward
anything: as `abhí`, `práti`, `ánu`, `úpa`, `ā́`, `áti` and `ádhi` in the
sense of *over on to*, or *across, beyond*, `tirás` *through*, `antár`
and `antarā́` when meaning *between*, `pári` *around*. Examples are:
`yā́ḥ pradíço abhí sū́ryo vicáṣṭe` (AV.) *what quarters the sun looks
abroad unto;* `ábodhy agníḥ práty āyatī́m uṣā́sam` (RV.) *Agni has been
awakened to meet the advancing dawn;* `gacchet kadācit svajanam prati`
(MBh.) *she might go somewhither to her own people;*
`imam prakṣyāmi nṛpatim prati` (MBh.) *him I will ask with reference to
the king;* `máma cittám ánu cittébhir é ’ta` (AV.) *follow after my mind
with your minds;* `é ’hy ā́ naḥ` (AV.) *come hither to us;*
`úpa na é ’hy arvā́n̄ ` (RV.) *come hither unto us;* `yó devó mártyāṅ áti`
(AV.) *the god who is beyond mortals;* `adhiṣṭhā́ya várcasā́ ’dhy anyā́n`
(AV.) *excelling above others in glory*. Also `abhítas` and `parítas`,
which have a like value with the simple `abhí` and `pári`; and `upári`
*above* (oftener with genitive). Less accordant with ordinary accusative
constructions is the use of this case with `adhas`, `paras`, `paras`,
`vinā`, beside other cases which seem more suited to the meaning of
those particles. And the same may be said of most of the adverbial
case-forms with which the accusative is used. Thus, a number of
instrumental of situation or direction: as
`yé ‘vareṇā ”dityám yé páreṇā ”dityám` (TB.) *those who are below the
sun, those who are beyond the sun;* `ántareṇa yónim` (ÇB.) *within the
womb;* `te hī ’dam antareṇa sarvam` (AB.) *for all this universe is
between them;* `úttareṇa gā́rhapatyam` (ÇB.) *to the north of the
householder's fire;* `dákṣiṇena védim` (ÇB.) *to the south of the
sacrificial hearth;* `dakṣiṇena vṛkṣavāṭikām` (Ç.) *to the right of the
orchard;* `nikaṣā́ yamunām` (Har.) *near the Yamunā*. Similarly, ūrdhvam
and pūrvam have an accusative object as well as an ablative; and the
same is true later of `ṛte`. `Abhimukham` *toward* has a more natural
right to construction with this case.

1130\. The Genitive. The words which are accompanied by the genitive are
mostly case-forms of nouns, or of adjectives used substantively,
retaining enough of the noun-character to take this case as their
natural adjunct. Such are the locatives `agre` *in front of*, `abhyāçe`
*near*, `arthe` and `kṛte` *for the sake of*, `nimitte` and `hetāu` *by
reason of*, `madhye` *in the midst of;* and other cases, as `arthāya`,
`kāraṇāt`, `sakāçāt`, `hetos`. And really, although less directly and
obviously, of the same character are other adjective cases (some of them
showing other constructions, already noticed): as `adhareṇa`, `uttareṇa`
and `uttarāt`, `dakṣiṇena` and `dakṣiṇāt`, `paçcāt`, `ūrdhvam`,
`anantaram`, `samakṣam`, `sākṣāt`. More questionable, and illustrations
rather of the general looseness of use of the genitive, are its
constructions (almost wholly unknown in the oldest language) with more
proper words of direction: thus, with the derivative `paritas`,
`paratas`, and `antitas`, and `parastāt` and `purastāt` (these found in
the Brāhmaṇa language: as, `saṁvatsarasya parastāt` *after a year;*
`sūktasya purastāt` *before the hymn* \[AB.\]); with `anti`, `adhas`,
`avas`, `puras`; with `upari` *above* (common later); and with `antar`.

Conjunctions.

1131\. The conjunctions, also, as a distinct class of words, are almost
wanting.

a\. The combination of clauses is in Sanskrit in general of a very
simple character; much of what in other Indo-European languages is
effected by subordinating conjunctions is here managed by means of
composition of words, by the use of the gerunds (994), of `iti` (1102),
of abstract nouns in case-forms, and so on.

1132\. The relative derivative adverbs, already given (1098 ff.), may
properly be regarded as conjunctions; and a few other particles of
kindred value, as `céd` and `néd` (1111 a).

1133\. Purely of conjunctive value are च `ca` *and*, and वा `vā` *or*
(both toneless, and never having the first place in a sentence or
clause).

a\. Of copulative value, along with `ca`, is in the older language
especially `utá` (later it becomes a particle of more indefinite use);
and `ápi`, `tátas`, `táthā`, `kíṁ ca`, with other particles and
combinations of particles, are used often as connective of clauses.

b\. Adversative is `tú` *but* (rare in the older language); also, less
strongly, `u` (toneless).

c\. Of illative value is `hí` *for* (originally, and in great part at
every period, asseverative only): compare above, 1122 b.

d\. To `ca` (as well as to its compound `céd`) belongs occasionally the
meaning *if*.

e\. It is needless to enter into further detail with regard to those
uses which may be not less properly, or more properly, called
conjunctive than adverbial, of the particles already given, under the
head of Adverbs.

Interjections.

1134\. The utterances which may be classed as interjections are, as in
other languages, in part voice-gestures, in part onomatopœias, and in
part mutilations and corruptions of other parts of speech.

1135\. a. Of the class of voice-gestures are, for example: `ā`, `hā`,
`hāhā`, `ahaha`, `he`, `hāí` (AV.), `ayi`, `aye`, `hayé` (RV.), `aho`,
`báṭ` (RV.), `bata` (RV.) or `vata`, and (probably) `híruk` and `hurúk`
(RV.).

b\. Onomatopoetic or imitative utterances are, for example (in the older
language): `ciçcā́` *whiz* (of an arrow: RV.); `kikirā́` (palpitation:
RV.); `bā́l` and `pháṭ` (`pháṣ`?) or `phál` *splash* (AV.); `bhúk`
*bow-wow* (AV.); `çál` *pat* (AV.); `āṣ`, `hīṣ`, `as`, and `has` (PB.);
and see the words already quoted in composition with the roots `kṛ` and
`bhū`, above, 1091.

c\. Nouns and adjectives which have assumed an interjectional character
are, for example: `bhos` (for the vocative `bhavas`, 456); `are` or `re`
(voc. of `ari` *enemy*}; `dhik` *alas!* (may be mere voice-gesture, but
perhaps related with √`dih`); `kaṣṭam` *woe is me!* `diṣṭyā` *thank
heaven!* `svasti` *hail!* `suṣṭhu`, `sādhu` *good, excellent!* None of
these are Vedic in interjectional use.
