## CONCLUDING WORDS OF THE EDITOR

From Ganderbal the Swami returned by the first week of October and
announced his intention of leaving for the plains in a few days for
urgent reasons. The European party had already made plans to visit the
principal cities of northern India, e.g., Lahore, Delhi, Agra, etc., as
soon as the winter set in. So both parties decided to return together
and came to Lahore. From here the Swami and his party returned to
Calcutta, leaving the rest to carry out their plans for sight-seeing in
northern India.
