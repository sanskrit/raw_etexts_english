## REQUIESCAT IN PACE

(Written in memoriam to J. J. Goodwin, August, 1898.)

Speed forth, O Soul! upon thy star-strewn path;  
Speed, blissful one! where thought is ever free,  
Where time and space no longer mist the view,  
Eternal peace and blessings be with thee!

Thy service true, complete thy sacrifice,  
Thy home the heart of love transcendent find;  
Remembrance sweet, that kills all space and time,  
Like altar roses fill thy place behind!

Thy bonds are broke, thy quest in bliss is found,  
And one with That which comes as Death and Life;  
Thou helpful one! unselfish e'er on earth,  
Ahead! still help with love this world of strife!
