## THE LIVING GOD

(Written to an American friend from Almora, 9th July 1897.)

He who is in you and outside you,  
Who works through all hands,  
Who walks on all feet,  
Whose body are all ye,  
Him worship, and break all other idols!

He who is at once the high and low,  
The sinner and the saint,  
Both God and worm,  
Him worship — visible, knowable, real, omnipresent,  
Break all other idols!

In whom is neither past life  
Nor future birth nor death,  
In whom we always have been  
And always shall be one,  
Him worship. Break all other idols!

Ye fools! who neglect the living God,  
And His infinite reflections with which the world is full.

While ye run after imaginary shadows,  
That lead alone to fights and quarrels,  
Him worship, the only visible!  
Break all other idols!
