title = "The circle ofxa0yakShiNI-s"

+++
We bow to the great goddess of the trotalottaraM and pay worship to the
great throng of yakShiNI-s that emerge from her. The yakShiNI-s are of
diverse forms, all very wonderful and amazing. They bear many diverse
facets of knowledge — he who can acquire them all becomes sarva-vyApin.
But the knowledge is not easily acquired from the yakShiNI. There are so
many ways in which they slip away after it has been shown to you by her.
After you land from the flight of the yakShiNI, it may evaporate from
you. Or in the delusion of the wonderous form of the yakShiNI, the
knowledge might escape from you. Some wonderous yakShiNI-s carry what
may be called “useless knowledge”. It can be endlessly fascinating but
cannot be acquired by those not fit for it, or knowing it takes you down
a path a failure.
