title = "11 dances of thexa0gods."

+++
The silapadhikAraM (6.44), the great champu written in the dramiDa
language, mentions 11 dances that, as far as I know, have no mention in
the literature in deva-bhAShA. We do not know if these were once
prevalent over jambu-dvIpa and later became extinct. While many of the
themes are clear it is hard to understand all the details from the
archaic dramiDa. Dixitarâ€™s translation clarifies most of them pretty
well.  
1\) The koDukoTTi: It was danced by shiva, with umA keeping the tAla
beside him, in the grave yard where bhAratI had danced with faultless
rhythm and avoiding wrong tAla-s, when the great fire-tipped arrow had
obeyed his command to destroy the tripura at the request of the devas.  
2\) The pANDaranga- This dance was done by shiva in the form of bhAratI
(\!) before the 4 faced brahma who was driving his car.  
3\) The alliyam- This was performed by the collyrium colored viShNu
after exposing the evil devices of kaMsa.  
4\) The mallu- This was performed by viShNu after cutting the hands of
bANAsura.  
5\) The tuDi- this was performed by kumAra in the middle of the ocean
after he killed the demon shUrapadma, who was hiding in the middle of
the ocean. \[As far as I know the killing of this demon termed
shUrapadma is a exclusively Dravidian development of the kumAra cycle.
In all devabhASha AkhyAna-s, except recent ones back-translated from
dramiLa, only tAraka and not shUrapadma is mentioned\]  
6\) The kuDai- This was performed by kumAra after lowering the umbrella
before the danavas routed by him in battle. \[dramiDa commentators state
that kumAra shielded himself with his umbrella and danced in derision at
having pounded tAraka and his hordes.\]  
7\) The kuDaM- viShNu danced this after striding through the city of
bANAsura.  
8\) The pEDi- kAma turning into a hermaphrodite form is supposed to have
danced this.  
9\) marakkAl- This was the dance of viShNumAyA (mahAkAlI) when she
sought to suppress the evil dAnavas.  
10\) pAvai- This was the dance displayed by lakShMI when she faced the
demons.  
11\) kaDayaM- This is the dance of indrANI in the fields outside the
northern gates of the city.
