I have come to the conclusion that twitter isn’t an entirely suited
medium to write long posts, you loose them, they get cluttered, they’re
a pain to read and the necessity of brevity eats up way too much
content. This blog will help me collect my own information and ideas,
also aide me in my (ongoing) readings of the Rāmāyaṇa and Mahābhārata by
making me translate original text. I also intend to post things about
linguistics, european history and archaeology. Whatever I find
interesting. I don’t really plan to write posts with specific
utilatarian purposes, so they will be quite random.
