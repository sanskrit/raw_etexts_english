title = "Further proceedings on the battle front"

We invested today in some heavy duty diplomatic negotiations in the hope
that we may strengthen our hand for the impending battle. The
negotiations went off well but we cannot be lulled into security because
the enemy too is possibly using this as a ploy to obtain a dependable
escape route if they are pressed hard. Funnily the situation is somewhat
like Iraq (them) and the USA (us). On the occassions we smashed them, we
gained little, but their constant assaults have a tremendous nuisance
value. We felt some omens but refrained from consulting the shakuna
shAstra to see whether they good or bad, because omens are only
tradesmen and not brave kShatriyas.
