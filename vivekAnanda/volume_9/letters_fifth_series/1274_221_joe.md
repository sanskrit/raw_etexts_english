## CCXXI

*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

THE MATH

*2nd April 1902*

MY DEAR JOE —

The telegram is already gone, and I expect you will fill all
arrangements there.

The Dak bungalows en route to Mayavati provide no food, nor have they
cooks.

Provisions have to be taken at Kathgodam and arrangements made.

If you find any difficulty, go straight to Almora and make your
arrangements at leisure. The Dak bungalows on the way to Almora provide
food and in Almora there is a nice Dak bungalow.

Hoping everything will come your way, as it always does — (except
Grandpa's[1](#fn1) health).

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA

I like Mr. \[Tokuno\] Oda much — he means business.

V.
