## CXXI

*To Raja Pyari Mohan Mukherjee*

THE MATH, BELUR,  
*25th February, 1898*.

MY DEAR RAJAJI,

My gratitude for your very kind invitation to speak. I had a talk with
Mr. Bhattacharya on the subject a few days back, and I am trying my best
as a result to find time for your Society. I also promised to let them
know the result on Sunday.

A friend to whom I owe much is here, presumably, to take me to his place
in Darjeeling.

There are some American friends come, and every spare moment is occupied
in working for the new Math and several organisations therein, and I
expect to leave India next month for America.

Believe me, I am trying my best to be able to take advantage of this
invitation of yours and shall communicate the result to you on Sunday
through Mr. Bhattacharya.

Yours with love and blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.
