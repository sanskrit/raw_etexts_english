## LIV

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

54 W. 33 NEW YORK

*The 1st of May 1895*

DEAR MOTHER,

Many, many thanks for sending the coat. Now I am well equipped for
summer. I am so sorry the rugs could not come before I leave this
country. They will come if Dewanji is alive.

I have been out of town a few days and have now come back all right —
healthy as ever.

Lord bless you ever and ever for your untiring kindness to me.

Ever your grateful Son,  
VIVEKANANDA

P.S. *The History of Rajasthan*[1](#fn1) I present you, and the satchel
to the babies. Yours,

VIVEKANANDA
