title = "The Dravidians emerge from the woodwork"

+++
The recent incidents in India have resulted in the Dravidians emerging
like worms from the woodwork. In practically every Indian list one can
now see them floating their anti-Brahmin rhetoric. A few hopeful
brAhmaNas had told me just a few months ago that the Dravidianists were
on the wane. I always doubted this. The Tamils are too useful a tool for
foreign subversionists to use against the metaphorical head of the
puruSha. I had also earlier pointed out that the brAhmaNas had cashed
their cheques and are currently a rather spent force.

One can only dream that the brAhmaNas unite and mobilize a mass movement
similar to one that destroyed that despicable structure in Ayodhya that
stood for 5 centuries of slavery. Lessons need to be taken from the
great chANakya and viShNusharman in destroying the foes.
