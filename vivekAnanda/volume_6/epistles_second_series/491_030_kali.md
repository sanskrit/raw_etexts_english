*Salutation to Bhagavan Ramakrishna!*

GHAZIPUR,  
*2nd April, 1890*.

MY DEAR KALI (ABHEDANANDA),

Glad to receive your letter as well as Pramada Babu's and Baburam's
(Premananda's). I am doing pretty well here. You have expressed a desire
to see me. I too have a similar longing, and it is this that makes me
afraid of going. Moreover, the Babaji forbids me to do so. I shall try
to go on a few days' leave from him. But there is this fear that by so
doing I shall be drawn up to the hills by the attraction I have for
Hrishikesh, and it will be very difficult to shake it off, specially for
one weak-minded, you see, like myself. The attack of lumbago, too, will
not leave me on any account — a botheration! But then I am getting used
to it. Please convey my countless salutations to Pramada Babu; his is a
friendship which greatly benefits both my mind and body. And I am
particularly indebted to him. Things will turn up some way, anyhow.

With best wishes, 

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
