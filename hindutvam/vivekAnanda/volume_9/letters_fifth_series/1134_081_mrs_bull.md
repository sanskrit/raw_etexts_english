## LXXXI

*To Mrs. Ole Bull*

228 W. 39TH STREET  
NEW YORK

*the 3rd Jan. ’96*

DEAR MRS. BULL—

I have had a letter from Mr. Trine[1](#fn1) asking me to have some
classes at the Procopeia[2](#fn2) in February. I do not see my way to go
to Boston in February, however I may like it. I have given up for the
present my plan of going to Detroit and Chicago in February. Later on I
will try. Miss \[Josephine\] Locke will see to my having classes in
Chicago and I have some friends in Detroit I may go to Baltimore for a
few days in the meanwhile. I enjoyed my visit with the Leggetts
exceedingly. It has braced me for further work. I am very well both
physically and mentally.

Wishing you a happy New Year,

I remain yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA
