## XXXVII

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

HOTEL BELLEVUE  
BEACON STREET, BOSTON

*27 September 1894*

DEAR MOTHER

The bundles all came safely. One was newspapers from India. The other
was the short sketch of my Master published by Mr. Mazumdar long ago. In
the latter bundle there are two sextos or pamphlets. One, my Master's
sketch; the other, a short extract to show how what Mr. \[Keshab\]
Chandra Sen and \[Pratap Chandra\] Mazumdar preached as their "New
Dispensation" was stolen from my Master's life. The latter therefore you
need not distribute, but I hope you will distribute my Master's life to
many good people.

I beg you to send some to Mrs. Guernsey, Fishkill on the Hudson, N.Y.;
Mrs. Arthur Smith and Mrs. \[Miss Mary A.\] Phillips, 19 West 38th
Street, New York (both); to Mrs. Bagley, Annisquam, Mass.; and Prof. J.
Wright, Professor of Greek, Harvard, Mass.

The newspapers — you may do whatever you like, and I hope you will send
any newspaper scrap you get about me to India.

Yours etc.,  
VIVEKANANDA
