## CLXXXVII

(*Translated from [Bengali](b8500e8187.pdf)* )

*To Swami Turiyananda*

102 E. 58TH STREET,  
NEW YORK,  
*25th July, 1900*.

DEAR TURIYANANDA,

I received a letter from Mrs. Hansborough telling me of your visit to
her. They like you immensely, and I am sure you have found in them
genuine, pure, and absolutely unselfish friends.

I am starting for Paris tomorrow. Things all turn that way. Kali is not
here. He is rather worried at my going away, but it has got to be.

Address your next letter to me care of Mr. Leggett, 6 Place des Etats
Unis, Paris, France.

Give my love to Mrs. Wyckoff, Hansborough, and to Helen. Revive the
clubs a bit and ask Mrs. Hansborough to collect the dues as they fall
and send them to India. Sarada writes they are having rather hot times.
My kind regards for Miss Boocke.

With all love,

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.
