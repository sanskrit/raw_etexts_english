## UNITY

(*Notes of a lecture delivered at the Vedanta Society, New York, in
June, 1900*)

The different sectarian systems of India all radiate from one central
idea of unity or dualism.

They are all under Vedanta, all interpreted by it. Their final essence
is the teaching of unity. This, which we see as many, is God. We
perceive matter, the world, manifold sensation. Yet there is but one
existence.

These various names mark only differences of degree in the expression of
that One. The worm of today is the God of tomorrow. These distinctions
which we do love are all parts of one infinite fact, and only differ in
the degree of expression. That one infinite fact is the attainment of
freedom.

However mistaken we may be as to the method, all our struggle is really
for freedom. We seek neither misery nor happiness, but freedom. This one
aim is the secret of the insatiable thirst of man. Man's thirst, says
the Hindu, man's thirst, says the Buddhist, is a burning, unquenchable
thirst for more and more. You Americans are always looking for more
pleasure, more enjoyment. You cannot be satisfied, true; but at bottom
what you seek is freedom.

This vastness of his desire is really the sign of man's own infinitude.
It is because he is infinite, that he can only be satisfied when his
desire is infinite and its fulfilment infinite.

What then can satisfy man? Not gold. Not enjoyment. Not beauty. One
Infinite alone can satisfy him, and that Infinite is Himself. When he
realises this, then alone comes freedom.

"This flute, with the sense-organs as its keyholes,  
With all its sensations, perceptions, and song,  
Is singing only one thing. It longs to go back to the  
      wood whence it was cut!"  
"Deliver thou thyself by thyself!  
Ah, do not let thyself sink!  
For thou art thyself thy greatest friend.  
And thou thyself thy greatest enemy."

Who can help the Infinite? Even the hand that comes to you through the
darkness will have to be your own.

Fear and desire are the two causes of all this, and who creates them? We
ourselves. Our lives are but a passing from dream to dream. Man the
infinite dreamer, dreaming finite dreams!

Oh, the blessedness of it, that nothing external can be eternal! They
little know what they mean, whose hearts quake when they hear that
nothing in this relative world can be eternal.

I am the infinite blue sky. Over me pass these clouds of various
colours, remain a moment, and vanish. I am the same eternal blue. I am
the witness, the same eternal witness of all. I see, therefore nature
exists. I do not see, therefore she does not. Not one of us could see or
speak if this infinite unity were broken for a moment.
