## RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE)

MONDAY, *July 15, 1895*.

Where there is polyandry, as in Tibet, women are physically stronger
than the men. When the English go there, these women carry large men up
the mountains.

In Malabar, although of course polyandry does not obtain there, the
women lead in everything. Exceptional cleanliness is apparent everywhere
and there is the greatest impetus to learning. When I myself was in that
country, I met many women who spoke good Sanskrit, while in the rest of
India not one woman in a million can speak it. Mastery elevates, and
servitude debases. Malabar has never been conquered either by the
Portuguese or by the Mussulmans.

The Dravidians were a non-Aryan race of Central Asia who preceded the
Aryans, and those of Southern India were the most civilised. Women with
them stood higher than men. They subsequently divided, some going to
Egypt, others to Babylonia, and the rest remaining in India.
