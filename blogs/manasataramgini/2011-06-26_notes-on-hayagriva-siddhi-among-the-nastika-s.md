title = "Notes on hayagrIva siddhi among thexa0nAstika-s"

+++
While most extant mantravAdin-s practicing pA\~ncharAtrika apotropaic
rituals have a predilection for the ratna-traya mantra-rAjA-s, namely
nR^isiMha, garuDa and chakra, some are well-versed in the secrets of
hayagrIva. Even less known is the sAdhana of hayagrIva laid out in the
context of the shaiva mantra-mArga, i.e. the tantra of the bhUta-srotas
known as hayagrIvaM (a member of the deities of the bhUta-srotas along
with khadgarAvaNa). The once vigorous practice of hayagrIva, centered
around the great pA\~ncharAtrika pITha of hayagrIva-mAdhava (adjacent to
the kAmAkhyA site), might have been the source of its transmission to
the great schools of the nAstika-s in the vicinity. Few years ago, we
read an amazing account of the practice of a hayagrIva siddhi by a Lama
at the Yeshe vihAra, Nyagrong, in occupied Tibet by a Canadian academic
Marc des Jardins. He even had convincing photos of the Lama performing
vahni-stambhana with the hayagrIva mantra. From his account we may
reconstruct the ritual thus:

For the sake of removing persistent illness affecting certain sAdhaka-s
living in the vihAra, the Lama decided to perform a ritual to hayagrIva.
After a homa with apUpa-s called “torma” in Tibetan, ghee and some
secret plants the sAdhya-s (those needing treatment) were led to the
kitchen of the vihAra. There great fires were set up and being exalted
further by blowing air. They were surrounded by a circular maNDala drawn
using colored powder. On one stove was a cauldron with a boiling potion
in it. On the other stove, stones were being heated till they were
glowing red. The Lama took his seat near the stove and began muttering
the hayagrIva mUlamantra \[Footnote 1\]. An uttara-sAdhaka lifted a
red-hot stone with a pair of tongs and put it on the open palm of the
Lama. As soon as he did so there was a puff of smoke and fire rising
upwards. He then twirled the red-hot stone over the heads of the
sAdhya-s and threw it into the potion in cauldron on the other fire,
with much hissing and boiling over of the liquid. This was repeated five
times. Then he dipped a juniper twig into the cauldron and sprinkled
each of the sAdhya-s. Strikingly, the Canadian examined the Lama’s hands
and found no signs of burns.

While hayagrIva (or his nAstika reflex paramAshva) is an important
heruka figure with his yoginI mArIchI or vajravArAhI in several
mantrayAna sAdhana-s transmitted to Tibet, the ritual reported by des
Jardins is from the Bön system. This is of interest because it often
contains an early layer of transmission of Indic memes, distinct from
that seen in the four main Tibetan bauddha schools, i.e., Nyingma,
Sakya, Kagyu, and Gelug. While hayagrIva entered the nAstika maNDala-s
before the yoga and yoginI tantra-s, right in the charyA tantra-s, many
of the Sanskrit sources of this layer have been lost due to the Islamic
depredations of India. This layer is also most likely to have a close
link to the bhUta-srotas of the shaiva mantra-mArga and earlier
pA\~ncharAtrika hayagrIva sAdhana-s. Hence, it is of interest to study
the mantra sAdhana-s of hayagrIva (called Tamdrin in Tibetan) among the
Bönpo and material pertaining to this devatA in the hagiography of Tönpa
Shenrab Miwoche (gShen-rab mi-bo) who is considered the Adibuddha of the
Bönpo.

It should be noted that hayagrIva represents one of the early
theriomorphic vibhava-s of viShNu, who predates the nR^isiMha form.
Thus, we have an early macranthropic description of viShNu as hayagrIva
which is preserved in both the mahAbhArata and the harivaMsha. The rise
of nR^isiMha appears to have displaced hayagrIva to a degree in the
pA\~ncharAtrika texts. Nevertheless, the older presence of hayagrIva (as
in the nArAyaNIya section of the epic pA\~ncharAtra) and his connection
to the vAjasaneyin form of the sun suggests that he was important in the
early layer of the pA\~ncharAtrika system (it should be remembered that
the pA\~ncharAtrika-s explicitly associated their tradition with the
vAjasaneyI saMhitA). An examination of the macranthropic hayagrIva,
which might also be compared to the description of the ashvamedha horse
in the veda, provides an early witness for key iconographic elements,
several of which continued to survive in the nAstika manifestations of
the devatA:

Thus, viShNu assuming his second form, i.e., that of hayagrIva is
supposed to have attacked the demons madhu and kaiTabha and slain them
in a fierce battle. A similar account is given in the harivaMsha
regarding this battle were viShNu’s hayagrIva form is described as
encompassing all the gods (HV appendix 1.41.1421-130):  
stUyamAnash cha vibudhaiH siddhair munivarais tathA |  
sasmAra vipulaM dehaM harir hayashiro mahAn ||  
kR^itvA vedamayaM rUpaM sarva-devamayaM vapuH |

evaM kR^itvA tathA rUpaM surANAm adbhutaM mahat ||  
asuraM pIDayAm Asa krodhAd raktAnta-lochanaH |

Of note in these accounts is the role of viShNu in recovering the lost
veda. This might be compared to the legend of the vAjasaneyin-s where
the veda lost by their founder yAj\~navalkya due to his teacher’s curse
was restored to him by the sun in a horse-headed form. This motif also
occurs in an inverted form in the legend of the dAnava hayagrIva who
stole the veda-s from brahma before he was killed by viShNu and the
shruti was restored. This solar connection is also evident in the
iconography of hayagrIva in the above accounts – his horse mane is
described as being comprised of the solar rays (also related to the name
of his shaktI mArIchI). Another aspect made explicit in the version
found in the harivaMsha is his wrathful nature with fiery red eyes. This
aspect is particularly emphasized in his nAstika manifestation.

Both his wrathful aspect as well as that of removing ignorance aspect
are clearly present in the early charyA tantra-s of the nAstika-s which
appears to have been lost in their Sanskrit original. Some examples of
texts translated by the chInAchArya-s, like Yixing, might be considered
in this regard. The first is a translation of a massive collection of
sAdhana-s by AchArya atigupta for instructing the chIna-s known as the
dhAraNI saMgraha made in 653 CE. The 6th chapter of atigupta’s dhAranI
is largely devoted to hayagrIva sAdhana-s. Here a mantra of hayagrIva is
given which might be reconstructed in Sanskrit as:  
namo .advidyA-bhakShakAya grasa grasa vapa vapa sphuTa sphuTa grasa
hayagrIvAya svAhA | mahAbalAya sarva-j\~nAna-netre svAhA |

The last part of this chapter has a dIkSha vidhi with the hayagrIva
maNDala, where he is identified with the bodhisattva avalokiteshvara. A
study of this maNDala suggesting that is bauddha appropriation of an
Astika dIkSha ritual. In the middle of the maNDala an image of hayagrIva
is place. In the eastern quarter one of the ekAdashamukha
avalokiteshvara is placed. In the northern quarter the image of the
aShTabhuja amoghapAsha is placed. In the south the the 8 nAgarAja-s are
paced. The sAdhaka should enter the bodhi maNDala from the \[western
side\] and perform pUjA for hayagrIva concentrating on avalokiteshvara.
Then in the course of the pUjA the bodhisattva-s with siddhi-s will
manifest. Another set of Chinese translations of mantra texts from the
charyA layer identified by the Dutch scholar van Gulik have mantra-s and
rituals (Here we are not attempting to reconstruct them in completion
but only provide the translations). One text is translated as the
“Methods (upAya) and rules (vidhi) for incantations (mantrANi) and
offerings (Ahuti) to effect the manifestation (AviShkaraNa ) of the
great fierce king, the holy hayagrIva”. This tAntrika text is of some
importance to our current study because it provides background for the
Bön rituals for hayagrIva. It has the mantra:  
“hayagrIvAya svAhA || Able to destroy all the obstacles of mAra\! It is
through the upAya of karuNa that he yet manifests a krodha rUpa.”
\[translated from the Tibetan\]

These are paralleled by the nAstika hayagrIva sAdhana in the Gilgit
manuscripts wherein vaDavAmukha hayagrIva is invoked in an idol made of
sandalwood at whose base is placed the triad of vajrapANi, lokeshvara
and avalokiteshvara. The use of the term vaDavAmukha in this text offers
a link to the descriptions of hayagrIva in the mahAbhArata:  
ahaM hayagrIvo bhUtvA samudre pashcimottare |  
pibAmi suhutaM havyaM kavya\~n cha shraddhayAnvitaM || Mbh. 12.340

As also the tale in which the wrath of viShNu made the ocean salty:  
nArAyaNo lokahitArthaM vaDavAmukho nAma purA maharShir babhUva| Mbh
12.342.60ab

In the Gilgit manuscript the mantra of hayagrIva is stated as destroying
rival abhichArika mantra-s (para-vidyA saMbhakShaNa) and has the phrases
such as “khAda khAda para-mantraM… para-mantra vinAshaka… tan sarvan
vaDavAmukhena nikR^intaya phaT” etc. This hR^idaya mantra is said to
have been expounded by avalokiteshvara as is clear from the statement:
“tasmai namaskR^itva idam AryAvalokiteshvara mukhodgIrNaM hayagrIva
nAma parama hR^idayam AvartiShyAmi”. As the great vaiShNava pointed out
to us it might be noted that this statement is comparable to a mantra
text for the worship of nIlakaNTha (i.e. rudra) recorded by the Indian
AchArya vajrabodhi in the siddhaM script in the chInadesha: “tasmai
namaskR^itva idam AryAvalokiteshvara bhaShitaM nIlakaNTha nAma”. Here
again avalokiteshvara is described as the expounder of the hR^idaya for
the worship of nIlakaNTha. This, suggests that several astika devata-s
were being incorporated into the tAthagata-mata as their mantra-s now
have the sanction of being expounded by the bodhisattva himself.
Subsequently, they were identified with the bodhisattva himself.

Together, these suggest that the worship of hayagrIva was very prominent
in the period around 500-700 CE in India. The nAstika-s adopted and
transmitted hayagrIva along with several several other deities, like
nIlakaNTha rudra, as suggested by the Gilgit and Chinese texts. It is
possible that some of the tAntrika material of the Bön texts derive from
such transmissions of the sAdhana of Hindu deities via the medium of the
tAthagatha-s.

Now let us take a brief look at the Bön texts themselves. In the
hagiography of Tönpa Shenrab we find a detailed account of how he taught
the sAdhana of hayagrIva at kAilAsa parvata, to help sAdhaka-s ward of
vighna-s that were difficult to conquer. He did this by reciting the
mUla-mantra of hayagrIva \[Footnote 1\] and emanated a nirmANakAya as
flaming red hayagrIva in the pratyAlIDa pose with two hands and holding
a blazing sword. He had the green horse-head and was ornamented in gold
and was flying in the air emitting rays like those of the sun (a trait
reminiscent of the earliest accounts of hayagrIva found in the bhArata)
that subjugate hostile beings. He then emanates hosts of bhUta-s,
mAtR^i-s, yakSha-s and gaNa-s. The main Bön text compendium that deals
with hayagrIva (including the above mentioned burning stone ritual) come
as a triadic package that combines his sAdhana-s with those of vajrapAni
and garuDa. This compendium includes rituals for removal of poisons in
ritual kShetra-s, individual rites to the above triad of devatA-s,
followed by a rite to sipe gyAlmo, the primary shakti of the Bön system
\[Footnote 2\]. Regarding the burning stone rite these texts offer the
following narrative. To benefit sAdhaka-s in the kaliyuga, the great
yogin padmAkara went from the Kham region of Tibet to the region near
bhArata to subjugate the ghosts known as srin living in the shmashAna-s.
There he encountered a terrible lord of the ghosts known as the one-eyed
Hadha. He took the form of a nine-headed boar and had a nine-headed
rAkShasa on his back. Wandering around he spread greed and lust from his
noses and mouths, madness and poison from his eyes, and warfare from his
heads. But padmAkara invoked the mantra-s hayagrIva, vajrapAni and
garuDa in succession who completely subjugated this ghost. The ritual
which is instituted in light of this event was the burning stone ritual
narrated above in which all the three devatA-s are invoked in the actual
ritual.

A striking feature of this ritual is the minimal involvement of bauddha
elements and the invocation of these deities by themselves. This reminds
one of the early texts in which the boddhisattva avalokiteshvara is an
expounder of mantra-s to the old deities. We suggest that the early
layer of the Bön system involved transmission of these elements of
Astika ritual perhaps via the medium to the nAstika teachers who
presented them as a being expounded by the boddhisattva-s. However, the
striking tAntrika stotra to sipe gyAlmo \[footnote 2\] and her
tremendous prominence in the Bön world raises the possibility that there
might have been a direct transmission by Astika-s that has now been
forgotten and bauddhaized at a later point. If this were the case, then
the counter-illness and poison rituals might suggest a connection to the
shaiva bhUta-srotas in which hayagrIva was a deity and the
garuDa-srotas. Indeed the bhUta-tantras and garuDa-tantra-s have tended
to have a certain association with each other as suggested by later
shaiva texts of these systems. Then could have been transmitted as a
package, and the vajrapAni could very well be indra who was prominent in
the early gAruDa system. As circumstantial support for this, one might
consider the Tibetan rAmAyaNa which appears to be largely independent in
its transmission of the bauddha version and appears early in the
Dunhuang texts, which was temporally closer to the apparent period of
transmission to the Bön.

vsauH OM vajra rakSha krodha rava rava hayagrIva huM phaT ||

Footnote 2: [sipe
gyAlmo](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/some-notes-on-the-goddess-sipe-gyalmo/)
is a very interesting deity who has been poorly understood.
Superficially her iconography with the ashvatara vAhana is reminiscent
of the iconography of shrI devI (Palden Lhamo) among the Tibetans.
However, the origin of sipe gyAlmo is very distinct from shrI devI and
she appears to have influenced the later depictions of shrI devI
resulting the convergence observed today. The Bön compendium mentioned
above records a remarkable stotra to sipe gyAlmo translated from a now
lost tantra. This stotra has little bauddha about it, and appears to be
directly derived from a shAkta-shaiva tAntrika system. A key feature in
the iconography of this great Bön deity is her relationship to the
trividyA of the pashchimAmnAya, which presents a combination of the
shakti-trayaM. But in the pashchimAmnAya the three faces stand for
aparA, parAparA and parA; however, in the case of sipe gyAlmo the faces
are depicted in the order of the three goddess of the pUrvAmnAya (trika)
parA, parAparA and aparA. It is not entirely surprising that the
bauddha-s have made some attempts to demonize her.
