## CXIX

*To Sister Nivedita*

MATH, BELUR.  
HOWRAH, BENGAL.

*16th March 1898*.

MY DEAR MARGARET,

It is needless to let you know, you have fulfilled all my expectations
in your last lecture.

It appears to me that the platform is the great field where you will be
of great help to me, apart from your educational plans. I am glad to
learn that Miss \[Henrietta\] Müller is going to have a place on the
river. Are you also going to Darjeeling? So you will all the better work
after a trip up there! Next season I am planning a series of lectures
for you all over India.

Ever yours with all love and blessings,
