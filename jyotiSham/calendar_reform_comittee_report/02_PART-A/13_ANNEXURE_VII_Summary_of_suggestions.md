(i) The initial point of the zodiac cannot be anything else but the vernal equinox (even S.8. gives the initial point as vernal equinox). (ii) Length of the year should be 365.2422 days. (iii) Sāyana system should be accepted for our religious and other rites. (iv) If any attempt is made to fix the amount of ayanāṁśa from the fixed stars as given in the S. S., there will be 27 kinds of ayanāṁśas and no two of them will agree, 80 it is futile to determine the ayanāṁsa from the S. S.

In addition to the suggestions made in No. 39, above the following further suggestions have also been offered. 



(i) Zoro ayanāṁśa should be taken in each year, and the 



vernal equinoctial day be the beginning of the year. (ii) Tropical and not the sidereal year should be the 



basis of reckoning. (iii) The intercalary month should be determined by 



the Sun's entry into sāyana signs occuring during 



the lunar months. (iv) Sāyana planetary positions and sāyana calculations 



alone must be taken for the religious pañcāngas. (v) The celestial geocentric longitudinal conjunction of 



the sun, the moon and the planet with junction stars must be mentioned in the pañcānga. 



43. Pandit Dwijapada Goswami, Secretary, 



Panchanga Sodhana Parisat, 102-3, Bakul 



Bagan Road, Calcutta-25. Sending a Memorandum dated 16. 4. 54 prepared by a sub-committee consisting of Pt. Haricharan Smrititirtha Vidyaratna, Bhatpara, Pt. Sasthi Charan Bhattacharya of B.S. Panjika, Calcutta, Shri Jatindra Nath Bhattacharya, editor, Jyotirbijnan, Calcutta, Shri Sudhibhusan Bhatta charya M.A., Calcutta, Pt. Dwaresh Chandra Sarmacharya M.A., Calcutta and the Secretary. 



(i) The latest astronomical elements should be adopted in the compilation of Indian pañcāògas. (ii) The calculation should be dřk-siddha. (iii) Tho Nakgatra cakra which is purely a sideroal system of astronomy and is being followed in India for at least the last 4000 years, should not be abandoned in the compilation of pañcāngas. (iv). The ayanāṁsa of the pro-siddhāntic period which was used in the Vedic period and in the glorious period of Hindu civiliza tion should be accepted. (v) The Citrāpaksa be adopted in the pañcāngas. (vi) According to Citrāpakṣa, 23° 15' ayanāṁśa should be accepted for the year 1956. (vii) Rece ding back of the equinoxes should not be stopped artificially as it will no doubt be completely opposed to our śāstric traditions. (viii) Uttarāyana should start from the actual date i.e. Dec. 23 instead of Jan. 14 as it is now followed. (ix) The festivals which developed after the Vedic period are not necessary to be observed in the seasonal months. (x) The criterion of Aṣtami Robiņi in commemorating the birth day of Lord Kroņa should be followed, though it may go out of the rainy season, (xi) The tropical year which is being followed in certain religious festivals, should start from the V. E. point and not from 23° 15' ahead of the V. E. point. (xii) The sidereal names of the months cannot be used with the tropical year. For the tropical year, the names Madhu, Mādhava etc. or Prathama, Dvitiya etc. should be used. (xiii) The dates of the sidereal solar months should be standardized. (xiv) The sidereal year will have 12 months commencing from Vaiśākba, and general festivals should, however, be linked with the sidereal year.

P. O. Anandanagar, Ahmedabad, Letters dated 12. 6. 54 & 19. 6. 54. 



(i) Prefers fixed zodiac system for lunar caloulations. (ii) Religious rites should be performed according to lunar month. (iii) A uniform calendar in India is desirable. 



Letter dated 14. 5. 54. 



(i) The.vernal equinoctial point should be the starting point of the year. The year should be tropical, consisting of 365.2422 days. (ii) The calendar should contain Tithi, Nakpatra, Yoga & Karana (if necessary) and exact time of the conjunction of the Moon with the 1st and 2nd magnitude stars. (iii) Against the idea of taking 23° 15' ayanāśa ahead of the V. E. point. (iv) Against the nirayana system for the following reasons : 



• (a) The authors of the different Siddhāntas could not 



fix the initial point for nirayana calculation. (b) Longitudes of some fixed stars as found in the 



Sūrya Siddhānta do not yield the location of the 



starting point. (c) At present the days and nights are not equal on 



the equinox days according to the present nirayana 



pañcāngas. (a) There is no · satisfactory proof in our sāstras 



that our religious festivals are based on nirayana 



system. (e) The zero year of the Hindu zodiac is different in 



different pañcāngas. 45. Shri Kashiram Sharma, Secretary, Jyotisha 



Sammelana (4th), Upper India, Ambala Cantt. 



Letter datod 7. 6. '54 intimating the recommendations of 



the conference 



(i) The new calendar to be prepared should be on Indign system and the important factors of the Pañcānga i.e.. lunar days and asterisms etc. should be computed purely according to Sūry& Siddhānta, so that there should be uniformity in the pañcāngas all over India and there should be no confusion in the observances of national festivals etc. (ii) The long. 82° 30' E. of Greenwich adopted as the standard meridian of India should be changed to 75o E. to be in conformity with ancient practices which will not in any way interfere with the universally accepted and prevalent zonal time covention. (iii) This conference demands from the Union Govt. that funds should be provided to start as many astronomical observatories as possible to promote the study of Jyotiṣa, during the next five years. In these observatories Indian astronomers well versed in Sanskrit and Hindu astronomy should be treated at par with modern astronomers. The central observatory should be situated at Ujjain or Kurukṣetra. (iv) To promote and encourage study of Jyotiṣa, it is desirable to start a Central Collego-cum Research Institute and a Central Library of Jyotiga. In this opllege arrangements should be made to teach Jyotiṣa with all its allied subjects on scientific lines.

Kalipada Tarkacharya, etc. of Calcutta. 



(i) For civil purposes 22nd March may be adopted as the beginning of the year but for religious purposes year beginning should be followed according to the different conventions of the States. (ii) The recommendation for starting the calculation for religious purposes 23° 15' ahead of the V. E. point cannot be accepted, as the equinoxes are not fixed. (iii) Supports the recommendation for preparing a National Calendar for the whole of India and for establi shing a National Observatory with modern equipments. (iv) Disapproves the inclusion of tithis and nakṣatras in the National Calendar. (v) For religious purposes the duration of a tithi must not excood 65 dandas and must not fall short of 54 dandas. (vi) The calculation of tithis and nakṣatras should be done according to the Siddhāntas of India. (vii) To determine the months, dates and time for religious duties, calculation should be made from Surya Siddhānta on nirayana basis commencing from the fixed "First point of Aries" in the zodiac with fixed length of the solar year viz., 365.2587 days. 



48. Hony. Secretary, Jyotirvidya Mandal, 



3/25 Contractor's Building, Girgaon, Bombay. Letter dated 6. 9, 54. 



Forwarding resolutions adopted at the Brihan Maha rastra Jyotish Parishad conference, Jalgaon, held on 3rd, 4th & 5th July, 1954. 



(1) Disapproval :--The decision of the Calendar Reforma Committee of the Government of India, to fix 23° 15' as the fixed ayanāṁśa is unscientific and would produce great confusion in future in religious matters, which are fixed in accordance with nakgatras and would produce irreligious ness and harm to religious practice and religious culture. The procession of equinoxes should be taken into account every year while determining the ending moments of nakṣatras and the luni-solar calendar be compiled accordingly. 



(2) Approval :- With respect to the other items proposed by the Committee e.g. Sālivāhana Saka and the Caitrādi beginning of tropical solar year etc. are acceptable.
