Studies on the snout morphology of crocodylians points to 5 recurrent
skull types repeatedly evolving their midst: 1) The generalized skull
type as seen in Crocodylus niloticus the Nile crocodile. 2) Blunt-nosed
skull as seen in Osteolamus tetrapsis the African dwarf crocodile. 3)
The long-slender snouted crocodile as seen in gharial and Tomistoma the
false gharial. 4) The deep skull with laterally compressed knife-like
serrated teeth (ziphodont) as seen in the pristichampsines. 5) The
duck-faced crocodiles, like Purussaurus and Mourasuchus, which have
broad long duck-bill like snout and eyes placed in posterior end of the
long skull. These skulls may be deep as in Purussaurus or very flat as
in Mourasuchus.
