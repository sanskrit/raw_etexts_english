## CLXIX

*To Sister Christine*

C/O DR. LOGAN,  
770 OAK STREET,  
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA,

*19th May 1900*.

DEAR CHRISTINA,

How are you? When is your vacation to commence? I am still in
California. Hope to start for the East in two or three weeks more.

Write me all about yourself and how things are going on. How is Mrs.
Funkey \[Funke\]? And the other friends?

Yours as ever,  
VIVEKANANDA.
