## XCIX

*To Sister Christine*

AIRLIE LODGE, RIDGEWAY GARDENS  
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND

*October 6, 1896*

DEAR CHRISTINA,

I am sure you got my letter from Switzerland.

I am now in London, back after having travelled through Germany and
Holland.

How are things going with you? Had you a nice summer? How are you
physically and spiritually? How is Mrs. Fhunkey \[Funke\] and all the
other friends? Have you any news of Baby?[1](#fn1) Where is Kr
\[Kripananda\] and what is he doing now?

I have another Sannyasin over here with me now, who will work here
whilst I am away to India, where I go this winter.

I will write to you *in extenso* later; tonight it is so late and I am
so weary.

With all love and blessings,  
Yours,  
VIVEKANANDA
