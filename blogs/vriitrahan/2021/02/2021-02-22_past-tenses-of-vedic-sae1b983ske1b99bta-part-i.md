The functions of the past tense in the indicative mood of the verbal
stems of the earliest layers of the vedic language is one of the most
daunting tasks at hand. Right before I begin, I must admit that this
post will be loaded with linguistic terminology and I will not try to
spend too much time explaining it. I intend for this post to serve as a
“primer” on vedic tense usage for those already familiar with
Saṃskṛta.  
  
There are three stems in saṃskṛta which are used in past-tense or
related usages – present, aorist and perfect. The present stem forms the
imperfect tense (**लङ्**)\*, the aorist stem forms the aorist past
(**लुङ्**) and the perfect stem forms the **लिट्** and the ‘pluperfect’
(**लिट्** + an augment “a”).  
  
*Note: the imperfect tense does not have the meaning of “continuous
process” as used in latin/greek. the terminology is a mere calque by
occidental grammarians using greek as an analogue.*  
  
***What does “stem” mean?***  
  
Just to quickly elucidate, the stem is the prātipadika of pāṇini formed
from the dhātu (verb root) by addition of some infix (suffix or
affix).  
  
As defined by pāṇini, **1.2.45अर्थवदधातुरप्रत्ययः प्रातिपदिकम्**
“prātipadika (verb stem) is that which has meaning but is not a dhātu
(verb root) or a pratyaya (infix)”  
  
There are 4 stems – present, aorist, perfect and future. In our present
post, we’re only concerned with the first two. Part-II will cover
perfect (this is a huge topic, so another post for it).  
  
***Example – take the verb root (dhātu) पच्***  
  
***1. The Present Stem – प॑च  
2. The Aorist Stem – अपाक्ष्  
3. The Perfect Stem – पपच्  
4. The Future Stem – पक्ष्य***  
  
All four of these stems have a continuum of “tense-aspect” embedded in
them.

These tenses in the earliest forms of the vedic language has multiple
uses that derive from their “aspectual” function. An argument for them
being polysemous can be made. Our task here is to list all their uses
neatly without getting into debates about how/why these uses originated
or make them fit in a reichenbach-ian framework of aspect. We are
currently not concerned with that and simply want to see how these
tenses work.

Let us begin with the easiest tense to understand:  
  
**The Imperfect (लङ्)**: This tense is formed from the present stem. It
has one simple usage. It is a basic preterite used as a narrative tense
in the samhita and brāhmaṇā-s. It is formed by an augment (a) +
secondary endings. This tense has *\*no\** relation to present time at
all. This is important to note because the other two tenses often have a
relation to the present time which complicates their functions. The
imperfect picks out a specific, localized past time of the historical or
remote past. It is a pure tense which locates an incident that happened
before speech time.  
  
Pāṇini defines it as **अनद्यतने लङ् (3.2.111)** which means “in
reference to non-recent (remote) past time, we use the la\~N” Another
subtle distinction is this is usually technically witnessed historical
past (defined so because the perfect (liT is parokṣe “unseen” remote
past). Keep this in mind just, *the imperfect is the standard tense of
narration in vedic*, it narrates stories and events that are following a
common them without interruption.  
  
*Let us now look at an example:*  
  
*म॒हाँ ऋषि॑र्देव॒जा दे॒वजू॒तोऽस्त॑भ्ना॒त्सिन्धु॑मर्ण॒वं नृ॒चक्षाः॑  
वि॒श्वा**मि॑त्रो॒ यद**व॑हत्सु॒दास॒मप्रि॑यायत कुशि॒केभि॒रिन्द्रः॑  
  
mahān r̥ṣiḥ deva-jāḥ deva-jūtaḥ astabhnāt sindhum arṇavam nr̥-cakṣāḥ  
viśvāmitraḥ yat avahat su-dāsam apriyāyata kuśikebhiḥ indraḥ*  
  
“The great sage \[RSi\] born of gods, impelled by gods, having the sight
of men–– stopped the flowing river. When Vishvāmitra carried Sudās
\[across the river\], Indra made friends with the Kushikas”  
  
All 3 verbs in this verse (astabhnāt,avahat,apriyāyata) are in **लङ्**
and convey a narration that happened in the remote past. There is no
reference to present time. The verb locates an incident that happened
before speech time.  
  
One other minor usage of the imperfect is a “plurperfect” usage (I had
done, I had said, I had eaten.. etc) in a relative clause. This usage is
shared with the aorist and mostly carried out by the aorist only.  
  
Example –  
  
*न वै त्वं तद् अकरोर् यद् अहम् अब्रवम्*  
  
“No, certainly you did that which **I had told you** \[to do\]”  
  
Here, we see the pluperfect proper usage “I had done XYZ” in the
relative clause introduced by “yad/yat/etc” This is all for the
imperfect.  
  
**The Aorist (लुङ्)**: Here starts the hard work. Brace in! Be sure to
pay close attention to every different usage here. The Aorist and
Perfect are very polysemous. The Aorist has simple aspect\* and also
expresses an action that occured in the past but *with* reference to the
present. It does not describe duration or continuity, it simply states a
fact *\[this use is prominent in non-indicative moods which we won’t
cover here\]*. (here comes in the “simple aspect” function of the
tense). What does this mean exactly?  
  
*_(\*What does aspect meant? it gives information on how the verbal act is being done  
1) I did – simple aspect (no information about duration of process of doing).  
2) I am doing – continuous aspect (information about duration of process of doing is given).  
3) I have/had done – completed aspect (the action is completed and flows into a state in present time with “have” but is not flowing in present time with “had”).)*  
  
The aorist has 3) and 1) type uses of aspect but never 2). The 3) use,
the so called “proper perfect use” arises because of the function of the
aorist as described by Pāṇini. Let’s see this and then understand  
  
Pāṇini officially defines it as **भूते लुङ् (3.2.84 + 3.2.110)**, “lu\~N
in the past” . The lu\~N is really the generic standard past of acts
witnessed by the speaker in vedic (much like Ancient Greek) with a very
specific role of representing ***recent immediate past***. This is it’s
primary usage and hence most often it is to be translated with a “has
done, has eaten, has jumped, has risen etc” sense. In general, it
indicates what has just taken place; and oftenest something which the
speaker has experienced, commonly by the statement made as witness of an
action.  
  
**It is *due to this immediate past* usage that the aorist takes on
“completed aspect”** because the action was completed recently, it has
led to a state that flows into the present. ***This is what we meant by
saying the aorist/perfect “refer to the present time”*** *An example* –
“I have just eaten, let us discuss now” here the action of eating just
recently got over and the state of having eaten is flowing into present
speech time. “I had eaten \[a while ago\], lets discuss” here the action
of eating was completed a long time ago and there is no flowing of the
state into the present. (remember, this is one of the functions of the
imperfect as we described above. now do you understand what reference to
present speech time is?)  
  
Let us see examples of this immediate past function in vedic texts.  
  
*वस॑न्नरण्या॒न्यां सा॒यमक्रु॑क्ष॒दिति॑ मन्यते  
vasan araṇyānyām sāyam akrukṣat iti manyate*  
“In the forest at night, one imagines that someone **has just
screamed**“  
  
Someone has \*just\* screamed as shown by akrukṣat. Sayanacharya
translates this as “koShati” meaning “cries” indicating the “flow” of
the action of crying into the present state of speech time. Think of a
forest, someone just shrieked and you are hearing the reverberations of
the shriek in your head. This is the mental imagery that is trying to be
conveyed.  
  
*चि॒त्रं दे॒वाना॒मुद॑गा॒दनी॑कं॒ चक्षु॑र्मि॒त्रस्य॒ वरु॑णस्या॒ग्नेः  
आप्रा॒ द्यावा॑पृथि॒वी अ॒न्तरि॑क्षं॒*  
*citram devānām ut agāt anīkam cakṣuḥ mitrasya varuṇasya agneḥ ā aprāḥ
dyāvāpr̥thivī iti antarikṣam*  
“The brilliant face of the gods **has risen**.. the eye of mitra, varuṇa
and agni. It **has filled** heaven and earth and the space between
them”  
  
*प्रति॒दि॒वो अ॑दर्शि दुहि॒ता*  
“The daughter of heaven **has appeared**“  
  
*परी ’मे गाम् अनेषत पर्य् अग्निम् अहृषत, देवेष्व् अक्रत श्रवः*  
“These here have led about a cow, they have carried around the fire,
they have done honor to the gods“  
  
These are sufficient examples for the main function of the aorist. There
is one “subfunction” of t. It’s used in an occasion in which, 1) It
expresses what results from a ritual act or is antecedent to it.
*पुत्रस्य नाम गृह्णाति, प्रजाम् एव अनु सम् अतनीत्* “He gives his son a
name, he **has thus extended** his race”  
  
Now let us look at the **second major function of the aorist**. The
aorist in relative clauses (who/whom/whose/when etc clause introduced by
the yad/yatha/yadā type of words) *marks “relative anteriority” of the
3) aspect. The proper pluperfect usage* “had done, had eaten, had
killed” If you remember, we have mentioned the imperfect also has this
function, but this is mostly carried out by the aorist. In this usage,
the event does not need to be “recent”  
  
We begin with a main clause usually that has a narration in the
imperfect tense, then the aorist comes in to switch the narrative to
denote an act that had happened relatively before the verb of the main
clause.  
  
Example –  
  
*विश्वे॑ दे॒वासो॑ अमद॒न्ननु॑ त्वा  
शुष्णं॒ पिप्रुं॒ कुय॑वं वृ॒त्रमि॑न्द्र य॒दाव॑धी॒र्वि पुरः॒ शम्ब॑रस्य  
víśve devā́so amadann ánu tvā;  
śúṣṇam pípruṁ kúyavaṁ vr̥trám indra yadā́vadhīr ví púraḥ śámbarasya*  
“All the gods cheered you, O Indra, **when you had smashed** śuṣna,
pipru, kuyava, vṛtra and the forts of śambara”  
  
Notice how the pluperfect “had done” usage is introduced by the relative
clause adverb “yadā”, also note how the main verb is in imperfect
(amadan) while the relative clause verb is in aorist (avadhīḥ). This
pattern of verb switch + relative marker should indicate the pluperfect
usage.  
  
*तदिद्ध्य॑स्य॒ सव॑नं वि॒वेर॒पो यथा॑ पु॒रा मन॑वे गा॒तुमश्रे॑त्  
tat it hi asya savanam viveḥ apaḥ yathā purā manave gātum aśret*  
“The oblation indeed has fulfilled it’s purpose, **just as it once had
prepared** the way for Manu”  
  
*उ॒ग्रम॑यात॒मव॑हो ह॒ कुत्सं॒ सं ह॒ यद्वा॑मु॒शनार॑न्त दे॒वाः*  
“The two of you went to the terrible one. You took Kutsa, **when the
gods had united** you with Uśanā”  
  
With this, we finish the second main function and come to the last major
function of the aorist in indicative tenses. The aorist ***functions as
a statement of fact***. The aorist who have this function typically
occur amidst imperfects being used in a narrative dialogue, often at end
of a narrative or to show a change in point of view. They can carry the
story forward, comment upon it or summarize it. While the imperfect
“reports narration”, the aorist carries it forward or summarizes it or
changes the narrative in some manner.  
  
Examples –  
*  
न्या॑विध्यदिली॒बिश॑स्य दृ॒ळ्हा वि शृ॒ङ्गिण॑मभिन॒च्छुष्ण॒मिन्द्रः॑  
याव॒त्तरो॑ मघव॒न्याव॒दोजो॒ वज्रे॑ण॒ शत्रु॑मवधीः पृत॒न्युम्*  
“Indra struck down Ilībiśa’s forts and split apart the horned Shuṣna . .
. with your thunderbolt **you have slain the enemy** (o Indra)  
  
Notice how the imperfects are used for the entire narration of the indra
story and then aorist comes in the fact to summarize the narration and
comment upon it in a closer.  
  
For this function, just remember the aorist comes inbetween or at end of
a narration that uses the imperfect tense all along to close it or state
a fact summarizing it. Imperfect is the standard “reportiong narration”
tense.  
  
With this we come to a close but make two final remarks. The aorist
rarely has a “present” usage because the boundary between what has just
been and what is is an evanescent one, and is sometimes overstepped, so
that an aorist appears where a present might stand, or was even rather
to be expected.  
  
In non-indicative moods (optative, subjunctive etc), the aorist simply
marks aspect telicity. \[but don’t worry too much over this for now, its
just a final note irrelevant to the above usages, which are in
indicative mood\]  
  
Sometime in the next month or so, we shall try to list out all uses of
the most complex tense the perfect (liT) in a “Part II” to summarize the
theory of vedic tense.
