## RELIGION IS REALISATION

The greatest name man ever gave to God is Truth. Truth is the fruit of
realisation; therefore seek it within the soul. Get away from all books
and forms and let your soul see its Self. "We are deluded and maddened
by books", Shri Krishna declares. Be beyond the dualities of nature. The
moment you think creed and form and ceremony the "be-all" and "end-all",
then you are in bondage. Take part in them to help others, but take care
they do not become a bondage. Religion is one, but its application must
be various. Let each one, therefore, give his message; but find not the
defects in other religions. You must come out from all form if you would
see the Light. Drink deep of the nectar of the knowledge of God. The man
who realises. "I am He", though clad in rags, is happy. Go forth into
the Eternal and come back with eternal energy. The slave goes out to
search for truth; he comes back free.
