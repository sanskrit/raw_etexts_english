Our sachIva had proposed a long and intricate escape plan that had
promising aspects to it. It needed a particular maneuver that was
difficult but could be achieved with the help of my greatest ally. I had
started considering it seriously as an option in the event we face a
defeat on the front \#3. However, I suddenly realized that this escape
route could very well turn out the route for exit from this earth. I
sent my able spy who knew all happenings of those regions to check out.
Not un-expectedly, I learnt from his reliable investigations that a
scorpion’s journey down a solifugid’s lair awaited us. The well-know
sapatnas, whom we had thrashed in the past, rudhira-dhvaja prAchya and
tiryagnetra could easily burn us if we took that route. “na mama” I said
and scrapped the plan. I issued orders to the sachIva to drop
preparations and consider alternatives.
