## XXIV [1](#fn1)

(*Translated from [Bengali](b6035e6024.pdf)* )

*Victory to the Lord!*

GHAZIPUR,  
*25th Feb., 1890.*

DEAR SIR,

The lumbago is giving a good deal of trouble, or else I would have
already sought to come to you. The mind does not find rest here any
longer. It is three days since I came away from Babaji's place, but he
inquires of me kindly almost every day. As soon as the lumbago is a
little better, I bid good-bye to Babaji. Countless greetings to you. 

Yours etc.,

VIVEKANANDA.

1.  [^](#txt1)Letters i - iv, vi - xiv, xvi - xxii, xxiv - xxvi, xxix,
    xxxi - xxxiii and cxxiv are translated from Bengali letters written
    to Pramadadas Mitra of Varanasi, an orthodox Hindu, for whose
    profound erudition and piety Swamiji had the highest regard. These
    letters are most interesting being written (except the last) at a
    time when, after his Master's passing away, Swamiji was leading a
    wandering monk's life. In the early days he used to sign his name as
    Narendranath, though his now famous name, Vivekananda, is printed in
    all these pages for easy comprehension.
