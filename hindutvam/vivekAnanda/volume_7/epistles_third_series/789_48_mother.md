## XLVIII

1719 TURK STREET,  
SAN FRANCISCO,  
*17th March, 1900*.

MY DEAR MOTHER (Mrs. Leggett.),

So glad to get your nice letter. Well, you may be sure I am keeping in
touch with my friends. Yet a delay may sometimes cause nervousness.

Dr. and Mrs. Hiller returned to the city, much benefited, as they
declare, by Mrs. Melton's rubbings. As for me, I have got several huge
red patches on my chest. What materialises later on as to complete
recovery, I will let you know. Of course, my case is such that it will
take time to come round by itself.

So thankful to you and to Mrs. Adams for the kindness. I will surely go
and call on them in Chicago.

How are things going on with you? I have been following the "Put up or
shut up" plan here, and so far it has not proved bad. Mrs. Hansborough,
the second of the three sisters, is here, and she is working, working,
working — to help me. Lord bless their hearts. The three sisters are
three angels, are they not? Seeing such souls here and there repays for
all the nonsense of this life.

Well, all blessings to you for ever is my prayer. You are one of the
angels also, say I.

With love to Miss Kate, 

Ever your son,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. How is the "Mother's child"?

How is Miss Spencer? All love to her. You know already I am a very bad
correspondent, but the heart never fails. Tell this to Miss Spencer.

V.
