A recent exchange with STi reminded me of my attempts with the vulgar
apabhraMsha in which a rich literature of the sahajayAna nAstika-s
exist. While the fallen brAhmaNa sarahapAda’s works are reprehensible in
a certain sense to one entrenched in smArta praxis, there is still
something in the fellow’s free spirit that one cannot but help smile and
chuckle at.

 

*dohAkosha-gIti 96-97: (in apabhraMsha for which Itrans is adapted just
as for Prakrit – but not suitable to conversion to nAgari):  
* ethu se sarasa-i sovaNAh ethu se ga\~NgA sA-aru |  
vArANasi pa.Aga ethu se chAnda divA.aru ||  
khetta piTTha u.a.piTTha ethu ma.i bhami.a samiTTha.u |  
dehA-sarisa tittha ma.i suNa.u Na diTTha.u ||*  
*  
What saraha is telling us is that tIrtha-s of bhArata are right in your
body: the sarasvati saMgama, the ga\~NgA-sAgara, vArANasi and prayAga
and even the moon and the sun. He roamed all the kShetra-s, pITha-s and
upa-pITha-s right here in the body and has not heard of or seen a tIrtha
that compares with the body.
