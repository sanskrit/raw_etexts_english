title = "Idiosyncratic synesthetic experiences in some trivial trigonometricxa0identities"

+++
Mathematical objects, despite existing in a purely abstract “Platonic”
realm, have the ability (perhaps by the very virtue of their Platonic
idealism) to produce synesthetic experiences. We have often wondered in
our life as to why the realization or experience of such objects that do
not belong to the real world produce such real even if very
idiosyncratic experiences. Indeed, this synesthetic experience seems to
form the fundament of what both layman and mathematician alike might
term as beauty in mathematics \[Footnote 1\]. These need not stem from
the experience of the understanding of extremely complex mathematical
relationships; rather they can emerge from things as trivial as the
experience of increasing dimensionality from a point, to a triangle to a
tetrahedron. Not surprisingly, such mathematical objects often serve as
metaphors (since metaphor is an expression of the synesthetic
experience) in philosophy, religion and ritual of many cultures. In our
own tradition such metaphors are abundant in many philosophical streams,
like the decimal place value system being used in the sAMkhya of the
vyAsa-bhAShya and by shaMkara the advaitin.

viShNu, on behalf of the fellow deva-s, during the pitched contest for
the universe with the daitya-s, took three great strides. With these
strides he won the whole universe for the deva-s and excluded the
daitya-s from it. He is said to be viShNu because with this three
strides he measured out or pervaded the whole universe – the old
etymologists would say: “viShNur vishvaM vishate |”. We saw a paradox in
this: The measuring out or the pervading of the universe is a volumetric
action – i.e. you fill out the volume of the universe. But then the
taking of strides has a sense of linearity to it: three steps would map
as the summation of three lengths in a one dimensional space but how
come a volume is implied as being filled?

Many, many revolutions of the earth ago, our father, in attempt to lead
us to the path of mathematics, asked us to consider several triangles
and take the sum of the tangents of the three angles of the triangle and
see how they compared with their products. Being not very mathematically
gifted, we set ourselves to the task in a slightly un-Hindu manner by
drawing triangles and doing what we were asked to do:

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8338Ojd-Kto/UuiXqkYQnEI/AAAAAAAAC2U/pevS8CctBqA/s640/triangles.jpg)](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/AdvE461cg6F6VzhDAMfQ9tMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite)

It amazed us to learn that given any triangle with angles a, b and c the
following held true:  
tan(a)+tan(b)+tan(c)=tan(a)\*tan(b)\*tan(c)

We saw immediately that it was rather trivial for an equilateral
triangle or any right triangle or the extreme situation of a collapsed
triangle (0,0, pi) but stopped at that. It also struck us that the value
for the equilateral triangle (5.196) was the lowest positive value the
that product or sum of the tangent triad took. We excitedly pointed this
to our father. He seemed unimpressed and simply mumbled something and
went to attend to his work.

Sometime later, armed with that wonderful elixir known as testosterone,
when we teaching our brother trigonometry we effortless showed him why
this beautiful relationship was rather trivial.  
For a triangle:  
a+b+c = pi;  
a+b = pi-c;  
tan(a+b) = tan(pi-c);  
(tan(a)+tan(b))/(1-tan(a)tan(b)) =-tan(c);  
thus: tan(a)+tan(b)+tan(c)=tan(a)\*tan(b)\*tan(c)  
It then hit us that no wonder our father was unimpressed by our mental
vapidity.

Of course, we showed more celerity when confronted by a problem based on
this theorem in one of those life-deciding battles that come upon you in
the realms of bhArata:  
There is a result in algebra which says that arithmetic mean of n
positive numbers is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean
of the same. The tangents of the angles represent such a triad of
numbers when the triangle is acute i.e.,is all angles are less than pi/2
as red triangle in the figure.  
Hence, for such a triangle –  
the arithmetic mean (tan(a)+tan(b)+tan(c))/3 \>=
(tan(a)\*tan(b)\*tan(c))^(1/3);  
tan(a)\*tan(b)\*tan(c)/3 \>= (tan(a)\*tan(b)\*tan(c))^(1/3);  
(tan(a)\*tan(b)\*tan(c))^2 \>= 27;  
thus tan(a)\*tan(b)\*tan(c) \>= 5.196 in an acute triangle. That lowest
value is (tan(pi/3))^3, which is what we had stumbled upon in the
exercise given to us in our childhood.

After the event as we were spilling out of the hall we remarked to our
friends that it was rather trivial and went on (several of whom agreed
since most of our circle were at the peak of our mathematical abilities
at that point). But we also had a synesthetic experience that cut
Gordian knot of the viShNu paradox: The product of 3 scalar entities is
an abstraction of a volumetric mensuration. The sum of the same entities
is like a linear measurement of 3 steps. Thus, we saw the equivalence
between the 3 steps and a volumetric measurement. Moreover, that
excluded region between 5.196 and 0 was the realm from which the
daitya-s had been excluded.

We had at that point asked our student to show that it is obvious
that:  
sin(x)/x = ∏\[n=1..∞\]cos(x/2^n)  
\[  
For those interested but unaware, this may be achieved thus, as was
first shown by the great Leonhard Euler:  
sin(x)/x= (sin(x/2)/(x/2))\*cos(x/2) by half-angle formula for sin(x)  
we do the same with sin(x/2) to get:  
sin(x)/x= (sin(x/4)/(x/4))\*cos(x/2)\*cos(x/4)  
We can continue thus ad infinitum:  
Hence, we will have:  
sin(x)/x= (sin(x/2^n)/(x/2^n))\*∏\[n=1..∞\]cos(x/2^n)  
but as n-\>∞, x/2^n-\>0, therefore sin(x/2^n)/(x/2^n)-\>1  
thus, sin(x)/x = ∏\[n=1..∞\]cos(x/2^n)  
\]

The synesthetic experience of this relationship was both calming and
foreboding (as in the sense of the end of existence): one of
perturbations caused by an upheaval being reabsorbed by enormous
magnitude of the unchanging fabric of existence (we felt a certain
connection the sAMkhya term for the same: mahat – the enormity).  
Imagine the function y=x/x it is the epitome of constancy, an
unperturbed straight line – the metaphor of the unchanging fabric of
existence. Now a perturbation emerges in the numerator in the form of a
sine wave. Its normalization by the denominator makes that perturbation
to fade out into nothingness, the y=0 straight line (like the sAMkhya
universe fading out into mahat). The same thing as the product of
increasingly halved cosines explicitly illustrates this, as those halved
cosines come closer and closer to our original line y=x/x.

Footnote 1: Some mathematicians find something they call rigor to be the
basis for the beauty. We had a mathematics teacher who loved using the
word rigor ad nauseum. But to us rigor was never a major source of
inspiration or interest – for we simply saw gaNita as either a generator
of beauty or a tool for vyavahAra in the real world.
