title = "brAhmaNa-s and nAstika-s"

+++
We had discussion with our friend as to whether the brAhmaNa-s subverted
the nAstika mata from within. In a sense, this is not a new theory:
Astika narratives state that rudra sent bR^ihaspati to delude the
asura-s by posing as the tathAgata, the peddler of false shAstra-s.
Alternatively they state that nArAyaNa incarnated as the tathAgata and
also generated the nirgrantha to delude the asura-s with fake teachings.
We also have the narrative about bhaTTa kumArila, who poses as a student
of the nAstika-s for long and then attacks their doctrines from within
and defeats them. Of course, there are other ways of looking at it — as
we have mentioned before, there could have very well been a brahminical
brain drain due to the intellectual attractions of the nAstika cult and
its suitability for pursuing a certain ease of life. Consequently, this
brain-drain could have resulted in a passive imitation of the
brahminical style by the nAstika-s and an inundation of their system
with brahminical memes. One could also argue that there was really
nothing strange about the brahminical participation the nAstika cults.
Some would point out that even today in anti-Astika movements like
socialism (including institutional sepoy leftism of Western academia and
its implants), “liberalism” and secularism there is a significant
population of people of formerly brAhmaNa pedigree. We also see a
prominent brahminical presence in modern bAbAisms — fatal attraction for
pAShaNDa-s. Likewise, in the past some brAhmaNa-s became bauddha-s.
While distinct, these alternatives are not mutually exclusive and there
could be a bit each in action. Indeed, there is also the reverse
possibility that the nAstika-s were attempting to subvert the
brAhmaNa-s. After all we know well that the tathAgata himself was the
master at this. So the presentation of brAhmaNa-s as purveyors of the
nAstika-mata could be a means of trying to say: “See the brAhmaNa-s
themselves after studying all the veda-s are endorsing this stuff, so
better follow it.” After all we also know that nAstika Acharya-s,
searching for amenable kulA\~NganA-s, posed as shaiva guru-s among
avarNa-s and claimed to teach them the kalottara tantra. A basic problem
with this line of argument is a lack of understanding of how the varNa
system operates. Demonstrating what happened objectively from textual
studies is not entirely easy and we need to create a proper framework of
measurement for it. One feature that could be used to measure this is
the frequency with which the nAstika texts introduce statements that
reduce the divergence between the substratum of the Astika and nAstika
narratives (e.g. the role of the veda). In this regard we found a
corrupt narrative in the ma\~njushriya-mUla-kalpa to be of interest,
though puzzling. The MMK has a long section that is like the bhaviShyata
purANa of the Astika-s, which “predicts” future events of kings and
teachers. Certainly, I do not understand all of this narrative as it
stands due to the corruption and the lacuna on top of the vulgar form of
the bhASha.  
MMK 53.887-895 (I am now using the gaNapati shAstrI edition as against
vaidya’s):

mantra tantrAbhiyogena khyAtAH kIrtikarAH smR^itAH |  
adhunA tu pravakShyAmi dvijAnAM dharmashIlinAm ||  
mantra-tantrAbhiyogena rAjya-vR^ittim upAshritA |  
This part speaks of brAhmaNa-s, who are upholders of dharma, who will be
engaged in stately or royal activities by means of mantra-s and
tantra-s.

bhavati sarvaloke .asmiM tasmiM kAle sudAruNe ||  
vakArAkhyo dvijaH shreShThaH ADhyo vedapAragaH |  
These verses state that there will be a dreadful time in the world when
a great brAhmaNa will be born, with his name containing the syllable va
(an allusion to vajra) rich and completely knowledgeable in the veda-s.

semAM vasumatIM kR^itsnAM vicherur vAda-kAraNAt ||  
tri-samudra-mahAparyantaM para-tIrthAnAM vigrahe rataH |  
This brAhmaNa is said to go around the land till the three oceans for
debates and delight in disputations with rival scholars.

ShaDakSharaM mantra-jApI tu abhimukhyo hi vAkyataH ||  
kumAro gIta-vAhy AsIt sattvAnAM hita-kAmyayA |  
He will keep doing the japa of the ShaDakShara mantra, muttering it and
meditating on the deity; he will bear the song of kumAra for the benefit
of the good people.

etasyai kalpa-visarAn mahitaM buddhitandritaH ?\! ||  
This half-verse is particularly puzzling — if there is no deletion in
the extant text then the etasyai is certainly out of place. It is
probably a scribal or editorial misreading for etasya referring the
brAhmaNa with the name containing a ‘va’ in the earlier verses:
masculine genitive singular: etasya will be more suitable than an
unaccountable feminine dative singular. Then there is the compound:
buddhitandritaH which would mean he was of lazy intelligence or a mUDha.
But this is completely out of character with the description in the rest
of the text, assuming no break occurred. So perhaps here again the word
is erroneous and the original was intended to mean the opposite (?). In
any case it is likely that the text implies ‘va’ dvija was renowned for
his knowledge of numerous texts (kalpa-s) or knowledge of mantra-s.

jayaH sujayash chaiva kIrttimAn shubhamataH paraH |  
kulIno dhArmikash chaiva udyataH sAdhu mAdhavaH ||  
Here other kumAra mantra sAdhaka-s are mentioned: jaya, sujaya,
shubhamata and the good mAdhava born of a noble, Dharmic family.

madhuH sumadhush chaiva siddha …h…. namastadA |  
raghavaH shUdra-varNas tu shaka-jAtAs tathApare ||  
Then there will be madhu, sumadhu, the siddha (break in the text), and
rAghava of the 4th varNa who will born in the midst of the shaka-s.

te .api jApinaH sarve kumArasyeha vAkyataH |  
te chApi sAdhakaH sarve buddhimanto bahu-shrutaH ||  
All these are said to do japa, muttering the kumAra mantra (i.e. the
ShaDakShari) and these sAdhaka-s will all be intelligent and learned.

AmukhA mantribhis te cha rAjya-vR^itti samAshritA |  
tasyApareNa vikhyAtaH vikArAkhyo dvijas tathA ||  
They will portray themselves as mantrin-s and be involved in business of
kingdom.Then it goes on with the narrative of the dvija born with a ‘vi’
syllable in name, who comes there after.

Though there are problems with the text, we can easily discern the basic
meaning of what is being conveyed. A key point to note is that if this
textual fragment were shown to someone one without the context one could
almost mistake it to be an Astika narrative. There are some key words
such as the para-tIrtha-s which betrays the work to be nAstika one.
There is another more subtle point of note — the mantra practitioners
here are not buddha-bhikShu-s i.e. monks cut off from society. They are
apparently politically highly engaged individuals with interests in the
deployment of the mantra-shAstra for kings, and engaging in duties of
states. They are well-read scholars who are lead by dvija-s who have
learned the veda-s, but also include shUdra-s. While both the tathAgata
and the nagna were most probably active mantra-vAdin-s, and they had
some contact with rulers, their respective mata-s still started as
monastic institutions. The monks did engage in abhichAra on each other
and the lay populace, but they were hardly involved in royal activities
like an atharvavedI brAhmaNa expert’s rAjakarmANi. So in this we see a
conscious imitation of the brAhminical activities. Further, these
nAstika mantrin-s like the ‘va’-named one are not described as specially
learning any nAstika texts but more generally veda-s (as an Astika would
do) and tantra-s and their mantra-s. Even the mantra in this section is
couched in general terms — the ShaDakShari could easily be the kaumAra
ShaDakShari of the Astika world, though what is meant the nAstika
ma\~nju ShaDakShari -i.e. a ra pa cha na dhIH ||. The mantrin-s are said
to bear the song of kumAra. These could well be kArttikeya-s stuti-s as
well, but probably what is implied is some version of the ma\~njushrI
nAma saMgItI.

It is in the context of this connection to the kaumAra system that we
get to a generally unnoticed point regarding the bauddha-brAhmaNa
convergence we are discussing. We have previously discussed how in the
early phase of the development of the bauddha mantra-shAstra (the kriyA
tantra-s) there was absorption of the kaumAra system to give rise to
that of ma\~njushrI. In the MMK, the various siddha along with ‘va’ are
described as chiefly practicing the vidyA of kumAra. This vidyA is
described as the ShaDakSharI mantra which is normally taken to be the
one of ma\~njushrI cited above but this is not specified here in the
MMK. However, it should be noted that in the Astika parlance the mUla
ShaDkaSharI is the kaumAra mantra: vachadbhuve namaH || (e.g. expounded
in the old kaumAra tantra, the skanda-sadbhAva). The literal meaning of
the root word in this mantra, vachadbhU is that kumAra is the one born
of speech. This connection is important because ma\~njushrI is also
remembered as the deity of speech (e.g. vAdirAT), and in the above
narrative the worshipers of kumAra are described as engaging in verbal
debates. We do observe an old appropriation of kumAra by the nAstika-s —
e.g. there is the tale that indra sent his army chief skanda as nAgasena
to convert the yavana milinda to the bauddha-mata. The nagna-s likewise
hold that indra sent nejameSha to root out the brAhmaNa molecules from
the body of vardhamAna and make him a pure kShatriya. However, in the
context of the MMK role of kumAra is distinct. In fact the tathAgata-s
take the backseat while the dvija-s and shUdra-s actively worship kumAra
— i.e. while add the façade that he is doing the work of the tathAgata,
it is kumAra and not the tathagata whose active worship they are
conducting — the spirit of which is maintained in the
ma\~njushrI-nAma-saMgItI. Now, we should place these in the context of
various events happening in the Astika world: 1) Even here kumAra-s role
as the victor in philosophical debates is remembered by tradition. The
famous bhaTTa kumArila is remembered as an avatAra of kumAra who arrived
to defeat the nAstika-s in debate. 2) Grammars and other forms of
extraordinary scholarly achievements are acquired through the invocation
of kumAra (this tale of vararuchi’s enlightenment forms an important
component of certain versions of the bR^ihatkatha, e.g. that narrated
much latter by bhaTTa somadeva). 3) In the Astika realm kumAra was also
invoked for the victory of rulers in wars and several dynasties make
mention of royal worship of kumAra. In some cases, as in the yaudheya
republic, kumAra was even seen as the real ruler of the kingdom on whose
behalf the council administers the kingdom.

Reflections of these elements are seen in the above snippet and also
abundantly elsewhere in the MMK. The MMK started crystallizing over a
period of time beginning during the peak of kaumAra shAsana and the
emergence of national as well as regional powers all over bhAratavarSha
whose kShatriya-s invoked kumAra as a key deity. These observations
suggest that this phase of nAstika-brAhmaNa convergence was due to the
drive within the bauddha-mata to compete for roles of Astika brAhmaNa
mantra-vAdin-s in royal circles. While formerly the nAstika-s occupied a
role of receiving the largess of kShatriya-s like ashoka, now they
wanted to interact with kShatriya-s not just as bikShu-s but also as
members of the court who could perform mantra services. The MMK suggests
that the major move in this direction happened in the milieu of the
kumAra-worshiping kingdoms of the early Tantric age. The drive we
suspect allowed brAhmaNa-s and others including shUdra-s to be within
the bauddha fold and perform roles closer to their traditional Astika
roles in a royal context and allowed convergence.
