In the Hindu world view ritual and philosophy are intimately linked.
From the substratum of the shrauta ritual the ancient upaniShads arise.
From the matrix of the tantras the highest kaulika thought emerges. Only
one who can fully internalize this organic connection between the ritual
perform and philosophy, can truly grasp the language and thought of the
ancient Hindu. While the veda and the mantra-tantra shAstra may appear
superficially very distinct they are unified by the same underlying
entwinement of ritual practice and philosophical contemplation. They
unified by the same discoveries of the ancient Hindu linguists and the
geometric thought of the archaic Indo-Europeans. In one of the surviving
fragments of the rudra yAmala is seen the basis of kaulika thought.

The parAtrIshikhA section of the great rudra yAmala (1-9)

shrIdevI uvAcha:

The auspicious goddess said:

anuttaraM kathaM deva/ sadyaHkaulikasiddhidam   
yena vij\~nAtamAtreNa/ khecharIsamatAM vrajet/

O deva, how can the anuttara of its own grant kaulika attainment? By
means of which, as soon as it is known, he would obtain the condition of
sameness with the khechari?

etad guhyaM mahAguhyaM/ kathayasva mama prabho 

O lord, my very self, tell me that mysterious secret great unconcealed.

hR^idayasthA tu yA shaktiH/ kaulinI kulanAyikA/  
tAM me kathaya devesha/ yena tR^iptiM labhAmy ahaM  

Make known that shakti, which abides in the hR^idaya, known as kaulini,
the mistress of the kula. O lord of the gods, reveal to me that by which
I may obtain satisfaction, the “ahaM”

shrIbhairava uvAcha

The lord bhairava said:

shR^iNu devI mahAbhage/ uttarasyApy anuttaram/  
yad ayaM kauliko vidhir/ mama hR^idvyomny avasthitaH 

kathayAmi na saMdehaH/ sadyaH kaulikasiddhidam/

Hear, O devI, the fortunate one, about the higher than the high, the
highest. The kaulika function resides in the “vyoman” of my hR^idaya. I
will describe to you the anuttara, so that no doubt remains, the
anuttara, which grants the kaulika perfection.

athAdyAs tithayaH sarve/ svarA bindvavasAnakAH   
tadantaH kAlayogena/ somasUryau prakIrtitau/

All vowels from A to the bindu are the lunar digits, joined with time.
The moon and the sun are said to shine within these.

pR^ithivyAdIni tattvAni/ puruShAntAni pa\~nchasu   
kramAt kAdiShu vargeShu/ makArAnteShu suvrate/

O chaste one, within the five classes of phonemes, from ‘k’ in the
beginning to ‘m’ at the end, stand in order the 25 principles from earth
to the puruSha.

vAyvagnisalilendrANAM/ dhAraNAnAM chatuShTayam   
tadUrdhve shAdivikhyAtaM/ purastAd brahmapa\~nchakam/

Beyond that group of 25 is the tetrad of supports, that is vAyu, agni,
apaH and indra. Beyond them are the phonemes beginning with ‘sh’, know
usually as the pentad of brahman.

amUlA tatkramA j\~neyA/ kShAntA sR^iShTir udAhR^itA   
sarveShAM chaiva mantrANAM/ vidyAnAM cha yashasvini/  
iyaM yoniH samAkhyAtA/ sarvatantreShu sarvadA 

The process of manifestation, whose root is ‘a’and whose end is ‘kSha’,
has thus been declared. Its course is to be known. O glorious one, this
is proclaimed in all tantras as the source of all mantras and all
vidyAs, the giver of all.

chaturdashayutaM bhadre/ tithIshAntasamanvitam/  
tR^itIyam brahma sushroNi/ hR^idayam bhairavAtmanaH 

O pretty-hipped one, the hR^idaya of the atman of bhairava is the 3^(rd)
brahman united with the 14^(th) phoneme, O dear, and it is followed by
the last of the master of the lunar digits.

Code:  
3rd brahman= sa  
14^(th) phoneme=au  
Last of the lunar digits=H  
The mantra= sauH
