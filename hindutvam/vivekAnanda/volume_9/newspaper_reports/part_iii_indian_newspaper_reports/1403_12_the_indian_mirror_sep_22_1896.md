## ON THE SWISS ALPS

(*Vivekananda in Indian Newspapers*, p. 117.)

\[*The Indian Mirror*, September 22, 1896\]

Swami Vivekananda writes from Lake Luzern \[Lucerne\] Switzerland, under
date the 23rd of August last. (Evidently an unpublished extract from one
of the three
([1](../../../volume_5/epistles_first_series/065_blessed_and_beloved.htm),
[2](../../../volume_6/epistles_second_series/106_shashi.htm),
[3](../../../volume_6/epistles_second_series/107_mrs_bull.htm) ) letters
the Swami wrote from Lucerne (Vide "Epistles", Complete Works, V and
VI).) He has been walking over several parts of the Cis-Alpine country,
enjoying the pleasing views of nature there. He says that the scenery is
in no respect less grand than that of the Himalayas. Still, he makes out
two points of difference between the two mountainous regions. In the
former the rapid and thick colonization has been marring the beauty of
the place. In the latter, there has not yet been any such marked
tendency. The former has become a resort mainly for the sanatorists and
summer-residents; and the latter mainly for the pilgrims and devotees.
The Swami is shortly going to visit Germany, where an interview will
take place with Prof. Deussen, after which, by the 24th of September, he
will go back to England. To India, most likely, as he says, he is
returning by the next winter. He intends to reside in the Himalayas.
