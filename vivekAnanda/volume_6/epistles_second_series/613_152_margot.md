## CLII

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA,  
*24th Jan., 1900*.

DEAR MARGOT, (Margaret E. Noble or Sister Nivedita)

I am afraid that the rest and peace I seek for will never come. But
Mother does good to others through me, at least some to my native land,
and it is easier to be reconciled to one's fate as a sacrifice. We are
all sacrifices — each in his own way. The great work is going on — no
one can see its meaning except that it is a great sacrifice. Those that
are willing escape a lot of pain. Those who resist are broken into
submission and suffer more. I am now determined to be a willing one.

Yours etc.,

VIVEKANANDA.
