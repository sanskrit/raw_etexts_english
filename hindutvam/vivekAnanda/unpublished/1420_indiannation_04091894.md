### (*Indian Nation* April 9, 1894)

He (the Swami) is beating his head against the rocks when he tries to
prove that a religion which lays claim to organic unity and to
spirituality may embrace theism and atheism, vedantism and low ideas of
idolatry. ‘Religion,’ of course, may be so defined as to be applicable
to atheism, agnosticism, &c. Carlyle gave such a definition. But no one
religion can claim at once to affirm and to deny God, to ignore Him and
worship Him, to believe in Him as a subtle essence inconceivably fine,
and to have 'low ideas of idolatry.' It is useless speaking of the
conflicting doctrines as different paths leading to a common goal. We
should very much like to know what this common centre is, for we must
confess we can conceive of none which can be reached by theism and
atheism alike. We are past that stage when a mere phrase would charm us
into slavery, and until more light dawns upon us we must hold ‘common
centre’ and ‘convergence of diverging radii’ to be mere phrases.
