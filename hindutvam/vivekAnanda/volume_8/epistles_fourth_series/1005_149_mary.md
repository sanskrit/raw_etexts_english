## CXLIX

*To Miss Mary Hale*

1 EAST 39 ST., NEW YORK,  
*20th November, 1899*.

MY DEAR MARY,

I start tomorrow most probably for California. On my way I would stop
for a day or two in Chicago. I send a wire to you when I start. Send
somebody to the station, as I never was so bad as now in finding my way
in and out.

Ever your brother,  
VIVEKANANDA.
