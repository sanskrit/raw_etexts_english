title = "The kaumAra vidyA"

+++
Having paid respect with to rAja bhojadeva, who stands in the line of
the teachers from ShaShThinAtha we salute the god who is in the embrace
of sUryasunuduhitR^i.

The cryptic mantra goes thus:  
vAk (holy speech) is the varman (armour)  
the karNabindvADhya (ear ornaments) go with the charama (last one)  
The Fish banner flutters (mInaketana)

salutations to kumAra.

We also worship that awful being, riding a horse or a violent elephant,
embracing pUrNA and puShkalA along with his hosts like goptR^i
