The one of the greatest of the bhArgavas, pANini of the aShTAdhyAyi fame
devised the first representation of what may be called a context free
grammar. We take his mAheshvara sUtras as elementary rules for
branching. Applying recursive rules on them, similar to the fashion
vedic ritual is specified in the shrauta sutras, we get these dendritic
structures, which we call pANini’s trees. A rich as well as pleasing
structure may emerge from some rules, even as the bhASha known as
saMkR^ita. Above are some of those emerging from my recent experiments
