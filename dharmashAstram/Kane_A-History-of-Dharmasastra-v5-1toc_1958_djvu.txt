SECTION I 

VRATAS (Religious Vows) and UTSAVAS (Religions Festivals) 

CHAPTER I 

VRATA IN THE RGVEDA 

Vrata is one of many Sanskrit words, the ubo and history of 
which extend over several thousand years The derivation and 
semantic development of the word vrata have been the subject of 
great controversies. These questions have been dealt with by 
me at some length in the JBBRAS, vol 29 (1954) pp. 1-28. 
I shall here summarise the discussion contained therein. 

In the great St. Petersburg Dictionary the word vrata is 
derived from the root 'vr* (to choose) and the important senses 
of the word given in that Dictionary are : (1) will, command, law, 
prescribed order; (2) subservience, obedience, service; (3) domain; 
(4) order, regulated succession, realm; (5) calling, office, custom- 
ary activity, carrying on, custom; (6) religious duty, worship, 
obligation; (7) any undertaking, religious or ascetic performance 
or observance, vow, sacred work; (8) vow in general, fixed 
purpose; (9) other specialized senses Max Muller derived it 
from vr 'to protect' and held that it meant originally what is 
enclosed, protected, set apart, then what is settled or determined, 
law, ordinance and then * sway or power'. Whitney, in a note 
on this word in the Proceedings published in J. A O. S. vol XI 
Pp. 29-81, after setting out the treatment of the word in the St 
Petersburg Dictionary, brushed aside Max Muller's etymology 
as unsatisfactory and as possessing little plausibility and declared 
that he did not accept the derivation of the word from vr 'to 
choose", that 'vr* did not signify willing or command, but only 
choice or preference, though he admitted that there is a relation- 
ship between ' choose ' and ' command '. He objected that ' to ' as 
an a ® x (except in the formation of past passive participles) was 
7ai y rare and that the only analogous word he could think of 
TOttld be 'marta' from 'mr' to die. He preferred to derive the 
woTdfrom'vrt' «t proceed' and, though he admitted that the 
"ro vrata from 'vrt* with affix a would be exceptional, he 
ought that the words 'vraja* and 'trada' supported the deriva- 
011 and put forward the ground that the word 'vrata* occurs 



2 History of £>7iat maiastra [ Sec, I, Oh. I 

frequently in the Bgveda with verbs of motion such as 'car', 
'sate' oat 'sac'. 

Prof. Y. M Apte contributed a long article on vrata to the 
3rd volume of the Bulletin of the Deccan College Besearoh 
Institute at Poona (pp. 407-488) Prof Apte agreed with 
Whitney in deriving the word vrata from 'vrt', boldly asserted 
that the derivation of the word from 'vr' to choose or 'vr* to 
guard or enclose is impossible (p 410), that there is not a single 
vrata passage in the Bgveda which favours the meaning 'will, 
command, obedience or fixed purpose', that 'vrt' not only means 
' to proceed ' (as Whitney holds) but also ' to turn, to turn oneself, 
turn round, revolve, move on ' and that therefore 'vrata' means 
not only procedure, course of action, conduct, but also 'circular 
movement' and then 'route or circular path' (pp. 411-412). 

My own view is that both Whitney and Prof Apte are 
wrong in deriving the word vrata from 'vrt '. I further hold that 
passages in which 'vrt' occurs with upasai gas suoh as ablu, s, 
m,pmi, pi a or w, would not be helpful in determining the 
original meaning of 'vrt* by itself, since upasargas often totally 
change the meaning of the root 1 , that it is doubtful whether the 
root 'vrt' standing by itself means in the Bgveda 'to proceed' 
(as Whitney thought) and I deny that 'vrt' occurring by itself 
■mtihaat'upasargas in the Bgveda ever means 'to turn round, 
move on ' (as Prof Apte asserts) In my opinion the root ' vrt ' 
by itself (and not used in a causal or frequentative sense) means 
simply ' to be, to remain, to abide ' Occurrences of the root 'vrt ' 
without any upasarga before or after it are few in the Rgveda. 
Some typical examples may be given 'When, OIndra, thou 
didst strike down the wiles of Svarbhanu (the demon B&hu) that 
remained below the sky 2 ' (Bg Y 40.6), 'the wheel does not 
affect (jolt) your chariot (O Asvins I ) that is followed by songs 
one after another and that remains possessed of food ' ( Rg YUL 5. 
34); 'they (the dice) remain downwards (lie down on the board 
or ground) but they throb or strike above (is they shake or 
terrify the hearts of gamblers), though they have no hands yet 
they defeat those that are endowed with hands' (Bg X 34 9). 
Vide also Bg X. 27 19, X 107 11 for other verses where 'vrfr'

occurs without an upasarga and means 'to remain or abide'. 
Even with an upasarga like 'sam' vrt means simply 'to be or 
to abide * and not ' revolve or tarn * or ' move on \ Vide Bg. VI. 
4L 2, X 90. 14, X 121. 1 and 7, X 139 4, in which ' sam-vartatam' 
or 'samavartata* simply means 'let it remain' or 'it was or 
existed'. Simply because 'vrt' with 'abhi' means 'to turn 
towards or attaok' (as in Bg.IV. 43 5 or V. 31. 5) or with' m' 
means ' come down or return * ( as in Bg X. 19. 1, 3, 5, X. 95. 17 ) 
or with 'pan' means 'roam over or round' (as in Bg. I 164. 11 
and IV. 36 1 ), or with 'pro ' means * to proceed ' ( as in Bg. V. 30. 8 
or X 89. 12 ), or with u means ' roll or revolve ' ( as in Bg I 185. 
1, V.30.8.V. 53 7, VI 9.1) it does not at all follow that the 
original sense of 'vrt' is, as Prof Apte asserts (p. 411 end), ' to 
revolve or roll on'. Besides, the last two senses are somewhat 
contradictory. 

Prof. Apte complains that scholars were content as to vrata 
with the meanings 'law, statute, command, sacrifice, vow, fixed 
purpose, duty' and did not take enough notice of the important 
part that the sense of 'route or circular path' plays in the Bgveda. 
He opines that the divine vratas often mentioned in the Bgveda 
rather mean 'the heavenly routes, the divine rounds, the periodi- 
cal movements round the sky closely adhered to by the gods 
themselves' rather than "holy laws' laid down by a particular 
deity. Adopting a suggestion of Tilak in 'Orion' (p. 154) that 
the path of rta sometimes mentioned in the Bgveda is the broad 
belt of the Zodiac which the luminaries never transgress, Prof. 
Apte sets out to prove that the word 'rta' in the Bgveda primarily 
means the belt of the Zodiac (vide his paper in the Silver Jubilee 
volume of the Annals of the BO.BL, pp 55-56). This theory 
has failed to appeal to eminent Vedic scholars In my humble 
way I endeavoured to show in the 4th vol of the H. of Dh. (pp 2-5) 
that 'rta' has three senses in the Bgveda, one of which is 'the 
course of nature or the regular general order in the cosmos'. 'The 
path by which the group of Adityas reaches rta' in Eg. 1. 41. 4? 
or the statement in Bg 1 164 11 'the wheel of rta, that has 
twelve spokes (12 constellations or months), continually goes 
round the sky without being worn out' are only illustrations of 
the first meaning of rta But this meaning of rta by itself sheds 
hardly any light on the meaning of vrata Bta and vrata are

I History of Dharma&astra [Sec. I, Oh. I 

not synonyms and it is difficult to see how, conceding for argu- 
ment that 'rta' is the belt of the Zodiac, vrata means, as Prof. 
Apte obviously thinks, the same thing Rta is an Indo-European 
word but so far as I know 'vrata* is not even shown to be Indo- 
Iranian, much less Indo-European 

» 
Prof. Apte advances the theory that there are two parallel 
phases of the semantic evolution of the word 'vrata' viz a 'divine 
phase' and a 'human' phase I feel no hesitation in denying the 
existence of any such distinction in the meaning of the word 
"vrata' Prof Apte arranges (pp 414-415) the so-called divine 
phase of the meaning of vrata into six groups, viz. (I) turning 
round, passage, procedure, physical activity, (II) circular path, 
settled [or beaten route, (III) sphere or region of movement or 
influence, (IV) routine, laws of movement; periodic appearance 
or visit, customary activity, recurring march, (Y) victorious 
advance or strength, (71) ordinance, law, rule or code of conduct. 
In the so-called 'human phase* of semantic development he sets 
out four groups of BenBes, viz (I) physical activity (as disting- 
uished from mental), duty, profession; (II) the sum total of those 
peculiar ethical and religious duties and practices which made 
up the culture pattern of the Aryans; (HI) the specific social and 
religious duties of the three classes of Aryan society ; (IV) devo- 
tion to duty in general on the part of men and women. 

I have summarised Prof Apte's long list of meanings in ten 
groups The very fact that Prof Apte had to marshall over sixty 
English equivalents for the meaning of the word 'vrata', which 
occurs in the Rgveda only about £20 timeB by itself or in com- 
bination with other words is enough to make scholars suspicious 
about the correctness of the entire scheme Though he had the 
hardihood to assert in one place (p 410)* that no passage in the 
Rgveda favours the meaning 'will or command* he admits (on 
pp. 476-477) that in three passages (Rg II 38 7, X 10 5, X 33 9) 
the meaning of vrata as 'ordinances laid down by a divinity for 
devotees or human beings' is quite acceptable to him and further 
that in about 25 passages (which come under groups H to IV of 
the so-called human phase of Prof. Apte) vrata either means 
'ethical or religious code of practices of the three classes of 
Aryans' or 'beneficent sway or devotion'

Derivation of Vrata 5 

I shall now state my own views on the derivation and the 
meanings of the word vrata in the Rgveda. I derive the word 
from the root 'vr' (to choose). From this toot comes the word 
'vara' (bridegroom who is chosen from among several men by a 
maiden ox her guardian), which occurs in Rg IX. 101. 14 and 
X 85. 8 and 9. Choosing involves willing or volition on the 
part of the person choosing. Hence 'vr' also means 'to will'. 
Therefore, when the word vrata is derived from *vr' with the 
suffix 'ta', the meaning of vrata can he 'what is willed' or simply 
'will'. The will of a person in power or authority is a command 
or law unto others Devotees believe that gods have laid down 
certain commands to he followed by themselves as well as by all 
beings. Thus comes the sense of law or ordinance'. A command 
of a superior imposes and implies a corresponding duty to obey. 
When commands are obeyed or duties are performed in the same 
way for long, they become the patterns of obligations i e. cus- 
toms or practices When persons believe or feel that they must 
perform certain acts as ordained by gods, then arises the sense 
of religious worship or duty. H a man imposes upon himself 
certain restrictions as to his behaviour or food to win the favour 
of gods that becomes a sacred vow or religious observance. Thus 
the several meanings of the word ' vrata ', which 1 derive from the 
root 'vr', axe command or law, obedience ox duty, religious ox 
moral practices, religious \rorship or observance, sacred or solemn 
vow or undertaking, then any vow or pattern of conduct. It should 
not be supposed that these several meanings followed one another 
in a time sequence Two or more meanings might have been 
simultaneously in vogue such as 'ordinance, duty or obedience*. 
These meanings of vrata set out by me are quite sufficient for 
the interpretation of almost all Rgveda passages in which the 
Word occurs. 

t ^ When Whitney derived the word 'vrata' from 'vrt' with affix 
a, he could cite only two words 'vraja' and 'trada' as parallel 
But it is quite possible to argue that 'vraja' is not analogous to 
vrata (rf derived from vrt'). Vraja (oowpen) occurs in the

the root c vraj\ it is not on all fours with vrata derived from 'vrt'. 
Whitney probably derived 'vraja' from *vrj'. But the moaning 
of 'vraja' (cowpen) oan hardly arise from the root 'vn' (to give 
up, abandon). The word 'trada' occurs only onoo in the Bgveda 
(VB1 45 28J 7 and is applied to Indra It is difficult to say from 
what root, if any, it is derived. Whitney probably derived it 
from *trd' to injure or pierce. The word 'trdil&V (crushing) is 
applied to the stones (gravanah) which crush soma stalks 8 (jig. 
X 94 11) Whitney says he knows only one word 'marta' 
derived from 'mr' (to die) with the affix 'ta' which is analogous 
to vrata if the latter be dorivod from 'vr' But Whitney failed 
to notice other words with the affix 'ta' (not past passive partici- 
ples) such as 'karta' (deep hole, cavern) (in Bg. 1 121.13, II 29 6, 
IX 73. 8 and 9) and 'garta' (cavity or seat in a war chariot) (in 
Eg. B. 33 11, V. 62. 5 and 8, VI. 20 9, VB. 64. 4), vata (wind) 
from 'va' (Bg. V 31. 10, X 168.1 &o.), dhurta and several 
others. 

Prof Apts cites the word vailam (which means Vay' in 
Bg I. 23 9, V 61 9, VB 8 16, VB1 23. 19, Vin 63 8) as analog- 
ous to vrata (from vrt) Bnt that word lends very little help. 
In 'vartani* there is gtina (vrt becomes varfc), beudes vartani 
cannot be derived from 'vrt* meaning 'turn round or revolve' 
(which Prof Apte gives as the original meaning), but from the 
meaning 'to abide' or at the most 'to proceed' and further 
'vartani' has practically only one meaning in the Bgveda, while 
vrata has to be paraphrased by sixty different words in English 
by Prof Apte 

Prof Apte following Whitney relies on the fact (p 409) that 
vrata is frequently employed m the Bgveda with verbs of motion 
such as anu-t, anti-car, anu-ga, crnu-vrt. But these roots take on 
another meaning (viz 'to follow or observe') owing to the presence 
of 'ami' and in almost all the passages where the forms of these roots 
with ami occur there is no indication whatever of physical motion, 
but only that of ' obeying or observing' Besides, the root ' car ' 
itself is not used in the sense of physical motion in several 
passages of the Bgveda, but m the sense of 'performing' and

would be absurd. Indra sets free cows imprisoned by Vrtra. 



Meaning of Vrata V 

l observing '. VidB 9 Eg. I 52. 6, IBL 54.2, VL 9.6, VII. 89.5. 
Moreover, in words like brahmacarl (Kg X. 109.5) and 
vratacarindh (Rg VH. 103. 1) the meaning of a physical motion, 
if it was the original one at all, is totally absent and the mean- 
ing ' performing ' or ' observing ' is the only one possible. Some 
occurrences of the roots 'sasc' and 'sac' in whioh the meaning of 
physical motion is inapplicable but the meaning 'resort to, 
accept or be united to' appears to be intended are found in Kg. 
H 1 13, VH. 28. 4 (for forms of 'sasc') and IV. 12. 2„ VH. 85. 5, 
TBI. 4 9, IX. 95. 4 (for forms of 'sao' ). 

It is now necessary to examine the contention of Prof. Apte 
that vrata means in the Bgveda the tracks or routes that the 
various luminaries trace in the heavens Vrafcas are spoken of 
not only in relation to Agni, Indra, Mitra, Soma, Usas, Savitr 
and Adityas but also in relation to VaruDa (in Eg I. 25.1, 1H. 
54.18, V. 69 4, VH 83.9), Brhaspati (inH 23.6), Indra and 
Brahmanaspati (H. 24. 12), Aditi (1. 144. 12, VH 87 9), Parjanya 
(V.83.5) and Asvins (1 183 3) Conceding for a moment that 
by some stretch of imagination or some linguistic acrobatics one 
can speak of thevratasof Agni, Adityas, Mitra, Indra, Savitr 
and TJsas as referring to the tracks of luminaries in the heavens 
the mid regions and on the earth, one should like to know 
whether Aditi, Asvins, Varuna, Brhaspati or Brahmanaspati are 
luminaries and what tracks they were supposed to trace in the 
heavens or elsewhere. Scholars are not agreed as to the meaning 
of Aditi or as to the physical or celestial phenomena Varuna or 
the Asvins were supposed to represent. Aditi is a riddle, being 
identified with the heaven and the mid regions and also spoken 
of as the father, mother or tht, son or as the mother of Daksa and 
also his daughter; vide Eg. I 89. 10, H 27.1, X 72. 4-5 and 
Nmikta XI 23 as to Aditi and Rg. II 1 U where Agni is 
identified with Aditi Long before the times of the Nirukta 
there was difference on the question of the nature of Asvins, 
some identifying them with Heaven and Earth, or day and

a derivation and meaning to the word vrata as would be appro- 
priate in all cases where the word vrata is brought in relation to 
eome gods. Jn my opinion the only meanings that oan be well 
construed with all passages in which the vratas of the several 
gods mentioned above are referrod to is 'commands or ordin- 
ances, religious or moral practices or worship or vows ' One does 
not understand what Prof. Apte moans when he remarks at 
(p. 442) in a tone of ridicule that obsorving or obeying the 'ordin- 
ances or religious worship of gods' is a soft job and looking after 
the paths or the tracks of luminaries is a strenuous one If 
anything, the reverse of this should be true 

The word 'samraj' appears to be applied to a human king in 
Bg 10 VH. 58 4 'the sovereign, protected by you, O Marutsi kills 
the enemy', and in Bg. X, 85 46 the newly married girl has the 
blessing 'be you a queen' (samrajfil). Varuna, Mitra, Indra, 
Agm, Visve-devah and Adityas are called kings (rajan) and 
emperors (samrfij) in Eg. H 41. 6, in 10 1, SI. 54 10, V. 85 1, 
VII 38. 4, Vm 27 22, X 63. 5. Varuna (who is praised in about 
12 hymns) is called samraj oftener than even Indra praised m 
about 200 hymns What is more natural than to suppose 
that the gods called kings and emperors were believed to 
have laid down commands or ordinances to be obeyed by all. 
Though Bgvedio sages extol several gods they had already 
arrived at the conception that there was only one Supreme 
Being that was addressed under different names such as Indra, 
Mitra, Varuna, Agm and assumed several forms (Bg J 164. 46, 
VI. 47 18, X 121. 1, X 129. 1-2) Vratas are spoken of as 
dhruva (immutably fixed) as in H 5 4, HI 56 1, V. 69 4 and as 
adabdha (unharmed, unassailable) as in 1 24 10, IL 9 1, HI 54 18, 
VH. 66. 6 and dama (divine) as in Bg I 70 1, 1 92 12, VH 75 3. 
One must carefully remember these facts when ascertaining the 
exact meaning of vrata mentioned in connection with almost all 
the prominent gods of the Bgveda It is often stated m the 
Bgveda that the vratas of the god whom the sage for the moment 
praises are not violated by other gods Some striking examples 11

may, be given here : Rg. m. 7. 7 'the gods observe the vratas of 
gods' (deva devan£m-anu hi vrata gob); H 38 9 'I invoke for my 
welfare with salutations god Savik whose vrata is not violated 
by Indra, Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, or Budra or by the (god's) 
enemies'; III. 56. 1 'the primeval and immutably fixed vratas are 
not destroyed by the wily (demons), nor by the wise (sages), nor by 
the well-disposed Heaven and Earth and the firmly fixed mount- 
ains are not there for being bent down*; 7112. 42. 1 'the all-know- 
ing and powerful (Varuna) made Heaven firm, he measured 
(created) the expanse of the earth; the great king sits over (rules) 
all the worlds; all these are the vratas of Varuna'. Vide also 
$g. 1. 101. 3, H. 24. 12, H 38. 2, IH, 30. 4, V. 69. 4. 

The above mentioned passages clearly show that the Vedio 
sages believed that not only did the several gods observe or carry 
out the immutably fixed ordinances laid down by themselves or by 

any one of them but that even wily demons had to observe them and 
that waters or rivers flow as ordained by gods We have to take 
into account along with these beliefs that the Bgveda often adverts 
to the fact that human beings also break (or violate) the vratas 
of gods, are liable to be punished therefor and pray to the gods 
to pity them and to withhold the punishment. Tor example, 13 
Rg 1. 25. 1-2 'Whatever ordinance (vrata) of thine, O Varuna 1 
we may break day to day as people (subjects) do (L e. break the 
king's Jaw) do not reduce us to death &&' ; X 25. 3 « O Soma I if 
Itransgressyour perfect Git wen-baked) vratas, Hien in thy 
exhilaration (at our sacrifices) take pity on us as a father does 
towards his son'. Vide also VII. 89. 5, VUI. 48 9

It would have boon noticed that in some of the passages 
quoted above (in note 11) on vrata, verbal forms of the root 'mi' 
or 'ml' ooour For the correct understanding of these passages 
the exact meaning of the root "mi* is very important The 
Nighantu. (II 19) includes ' minati ' among verbs meaning 'vadha' 
(ki llin g or harming) In the Dhatupatha the meaning of the 
root 'ml' is himsa' (killing, annihilating, breaking) Vide Panini 
VTI 3 81 (mlnater-mgame) The forms of 'mi' or 'ml' with or 
without the preposition 'a' or 'pra' occur more than 50 times in 
the Rgveda and often in connection with vrata Whitney felt 
that the occurrences of the forms of *mi* or 'ml' presented some 
difficulty about his theory of the derivation of vrata and its 
meanings, but Prof. Apte, who derived his inspiration from 
Whitney, feels no such misgivings as Whitney felt, holds, relying 
on his own interpretation of Rg I 124 3, that *mi* or 'ml' is a 
verb of motion and has the primary sense of 'miss, deviate, 
wander or stray from* (p 411) Over a dozen verses at least will 
dearly show that Prof. Apte has beenled astray by his preconceived 
theory about vrata meaning 'tracks of luminaries' and that 'mi' 
or 'ml' cannot at all be construed in the sense of 'miss* or 'deviate* 
in the Rgveda $g 1. 71. 10 'old age destroys me as (the dark or 
clouded) sky destroys (distinctness of) forms' (nabho na rSpam 
jarima minati'); X 124 2 B '(the dawn) which does not violate 
divine laws but destroys the spans of human life', 7.179.1 
( Lopamudra says to Agastya) 'old age destroys the beauty of 
limbs' (minati sriyam jarima tanunam); "VH 84 4 (Varuna) 
who is an Aditya, who destroys the false ones and who, the 
valiant one, imparts immeasurable wealth'. Vide also $g I 92 11, 
1 117 3, DL 32 8, IV. 30 23 , V 7. 4, V 82. 2 for other examples 
where forms of ' mi ' or ' ml ' occur It is unnecessary to adduce 
more examples about 'mi*. It is impossible, if Prof Apte is to 
be followed, that old age misses or deviates from beauty or that 
Asvins miss or deviate from the wiles of the demon or that 
Varuna misses falsehood (or false men) Prof Apte relies (p 411)

on Bg. 1 124 3. M as decisively establishing that originally 'mi ' 
was a verb of motion. In the first place, one verse cannot 
demolish what many verses quoted above convey Besides, there 
is nothing in l$g. X 124. 3 that establishes what Prof. Apte thinks 
it does That verse says ' Here this daughter of heaven wearing 
a garment of light is seen in the east (by us) simultaneously; 
she (Dawn) weE follows the path of rta (cosmic order), she like 
(a woman) knowing well does not annihilate the several 
quarters '. 

The sense of 'command or law' is quite appropriate in 
more than half the $gvedic passages in which the word vrata 
occurs. In some passages the sense of 'religious practices or 
modes of sacred worship' is suitable. For example, $g. X. 65. 11 
says ' (the Visve-devas) that are good donors make the sun rise in 
heaven and spread about the Arya vratas over the earth '. Vide 
also Utg. VI 14. 3. 

There are several places in the Rgveda in which the words 
'aroita' (11 times), * apavrata' (in Rg. J. 51. 9, V. 42. 9, V. 40. 6), 
'anyavrata'(in V. 20. 2, V3D. 70. 11, X 22. 8) ocour and in 
almost all of which vrata must be taken to mean 'mode of 
worship or ethical and religious practices of the Vedio worship- 
pers'. Prof. Apte has to admit this (pp. 479, 483). It will not 
do to ignore these passages in finding out the derivation and 
meanings of the word vrata or to clap them in a separate group 
(as Prof. Apte does on p. 413) and distinguish them from other 
passages supposed to indicate the divine phase. There is nothing 
to show that Vedic sages distinguished between divine vratas 
and other vratas meant to be followed by Heaven and Earth, 
rivers, mountains and human beings. Some of these passages 
in which the word 'avrata' occurs strongly militate against the 
theory of Prof Apte. For examples i n Rg. 1 101. 2 India is

said to have killed Piptu who was avrata and m the very next 
verse it is said that Varuna and Sfirya abide in the vrata of 
Indra and the livers also accept his vrata Therofora, vrata in 
this hymn must mean something akin to the meaning of vrata 
in avrata and not akin to ' tracks of luminaries'. Compare IX 
73 5 and 8 where avrata occurs with 'raksati vratam" mIX.73 3 
(both being verses about Soma) 

There are seven passages in the Rgveda whero the word 
'vivrata' occurs In six of them 'vivrata' is applied to the 
horses of Indra. According to Prof. Apte, the only natural 
meaning is 'moving or wandering along diverse paths' (p 419) 
But this is arguing in a circle They can be explained if VTata 
is taken to mean 'ordinance, duty or practice' , when applied to 
horses 'vivrata' may be held to mean no more than this that two 
horses are yoked on two sides of the chariot and obey the various 
orders indicated through the pulling of the reins The 7th 
passage X. 55. 3 in which 'vivrata' occurs as an adjective of 
'jyotih' is difficult to construe and Prof. Apte has not succeeded 
in satisfactorily explaining it 

In several passages of the Rgveda phrases like 'tava vrate' 
occur. Whitney (p 409) stated that the phraso should rather 
mean ' in thy established or approved course, following thy load 
or example', than' under thy control or protection' or 'in thy 
service' as some scholars hold. Prof. Apte thinks that 
tho translation of 'tava vrato' as 'abiding in thy ordinance' 
(by Macdonell) misses the point and avers that tho propor 
meaning is' dominion, authority, region or sphere * Some of 
the passages containing tho words 'tava vrato' are Bg. 
VI 54. 9, IX. 103 5, X. 36 13, X 57 6 In my opinion 'tava 
vralo' moans 'while wo abide by your ordinances'. In X 36 13 
the first half 1 * is a relative clause without a vorb and wo have to 
supply a form of tho root 'as' (to bo) or of 'bhu*. In some 
vorso3 such a form of 'as' does occur with tho words as m Bg. 
1124 15" Therefore wherever tho words 'lava vrato' occur, 
wo should gonorally understand that tho moaning is 'while 
abiding hy your ordinances'. This is further supported by tho 
fact that thoro are passages whore the word 'vrata* and other words

13, X. 131. 7 (tasya vayam sumatau ..syama) 

There are eight passages in the Rgveda in which the word 
'sucivrata' occurs and is always applied to some god or gods 
In three passages VIE 43. 16, VUL 44 21, X. 118 1 'sucivrata* 
is an attribute of Agni and Prof Ante renders it as ' (Agni) with 
a blazing trail, track or sphere ' (p 4511) He says ' suci ' is derived 
from ' suo' (to shine or flame up), that the word ' suci' can only 
mean "brilliant or flaming', that the meaning 'pure' is purely 
figurative and secondary and is found only in about six or seven 
out of a total of over a hundred or more in the Egveda when it 
is au epithet of ' manisa, stoma, matt or girah'. These remarks 
are mis-statements; 'suci' in the sense of 'pure' is not so rare as 
Prof, Ante tries to make out (6 or 7 times out of 100). In one 
verse alone addressed to the Marats (Eg. VH. 56. 12) the word 19 
'suci* occurs six times and Bhould ordinarily be taken only in 
one sense in those six and can only mean 'pure*, Bince 'suci' 
is there applied to offerings (havya) and sacrifice In VEI. 44. 21 
Agni is styled 'sucir-viprah' and 'suoih' and 'kavih'. The 
word' suci 'occurs in that verse four times out of which 'suci* 
as applied to 'vipra' and 'kavi' can only mean 'pure or holy'. 
Vide II 27 13, where the yajarmna (sacrifioer) is called 'suci*, 
1 142. 9 where the three goddesses Bharatl, Da and SarasvatI are 
said to be 'suci'. Conceding for argument that the root 'sue' 
originally meant * to shine or blaze ', the distinction of two mean- 
ings (primary and secondary) in 'suci' had disappeared long 
before the Egvedio hymns were composed, as Eg. VII 56. 12 and 
other verses establish Vide Eg. IB. 62. 5 (where Brhaspati is 
called suci), I 181 2 (where the horses of the Asvins are styled 
suci'), If 33. 13 (where the herbs or drugs of Maruts are spoken 
of as suci), VH 49. 2 and 3 where waters are called 'suci' and

VH 89.8 (where Varuna is addressed as 'suci') In tie above 
passages the word suci in at least a dozen cases is clearly used 
in the sense of 'pure', is applied to offerings, sacrifices, drags, 
horses, waters or rivers and is not restricted to manisa, stoma, 
matt and gvrah as Prof Apte wrongly asserts Prof Apte mini- 
mises the number of times that ' suci ' means ' pure ', and observes 
a discreet silence about its being an attribute of the physical 
objects mentioned above Therefore, there is no difficulty in 
holding 'sucivrata' as applied to gods meaning 'whose ordin- 
ances are pure or holy ' In 1 15 11 and I 182 1 the word 
'sucivrata' is an attribute of the Asvins, in IQ 62 17 and VI 
16 24 of Mitraand Varuna and in VI 70 Z of Heaven and 
Earth. Besides, we have the analogous word 'sucikranda' (the 
loud laud addressed to whom is pure) applied to Brhaspati 
in VII. 97 5. 

The word* mahivrata' occurs five times and is applied to 
Soma (IX 97 7, IX 100. 9), to Agni (I 45. 3, X 115. 3) and 
to Varuna (VI 68 9) and the word 'mahamahmata' to Soma 
(EX 48 2). In all these cases the meaning ' whose commands or 
laws are great or many ' would be quite appropriate The word 
•mahi'by itself occurs in over 110 passages in the Bgveda, in 
all of which 'mahi 'stands for 'mahat* and qualifies words like 
'sravas'ffoodorfame^ksatraC'prowess* as in 1 54 8 and 11), 
namah, sarma (in I 93 8),datra ('gift', as in I 116 6), enas 
(inll 12. 10), karma (11 22 1), Mahitvana (m H 28 4),varfitha, 
dravina (IE 1 22), raksas (IV 3 14) Prof Apte (p 475) quite 
unnecessarily suggests three separate meanings of 'mahivrata*, 
the first of which is 'of great dominion', 'of great tracks', 'of 
great exploits 'and expands that meaning by interpolating the 
words 'mighty or resplendent sway or sphere'. 'Mahi' hardly 
ever means 'resplendent' by itself 

The word *priyavrata' occurs only once in the Bgveda (in 
X 150 3), is applied to gods and means ' to whom the ordinances 
laid down by them are dear' Prof Apte (p 472) criticizes people 
who explain the word as ' whose laws we love' ; but he names no 
one who does so Similarly, the word 'puruvrata* occurs once 
only in Bg IX 3 10, is applied to Soma and means 'whose 
ordinances are many*. Both these words do not at all help Prof. 
Apte in his interpretation and are rather against his pet theory 
(of tracks of luminaries &c ) 

The word 'dhunivrata' occurs twice (in Bg V 58 2 and V. 87 1) 
and is applied to Marat or the band of Maruts Prof Apte (p. 485 



Meaning of Vrata 15 

section 47) takes 'dhuni' as an adjective, and as meaning 'roar- 
ing, storming 'and translates' dhunivrata' as 'whose paths are 
characterised by roaring or raging'. The word ' dhuni' occurs 
about ten times in the Rgveda and when an adjective means 'one 
that shakes his enemies or clouds' or is a noun meaning 'river' 
(as in II. IS. 5). Dhuni is also the name of a demon ( in Bg. VI 
18. 8, VII. 19. 4, X 113. 9). In 1 174. 9, V. 34 5 and 8, VI. 20. 12 
'dhuni' is an attribute of Indra and in I. 79. 1 of Agni The 
Nirukta(V. 12) while explaining $g. X 89. 5 (in which both 
Soma and Indra are praised ) explains 'dhuni' as derived from 
'dhu' to shake Therefore 'dhunivrata' should mean 'whose 
ordinances are such as make others (breakers) tremble*. 

It is not necessary to examine separately each of the verses 
in which the word 'vrata' occurs and Prof Apte's interpretations 
thereof. The preceding discussion is sufficient to show what 
vrata means in almost all passages in the Bgveda In his zeal 
to buttress up his theory, Prof. Apte oommits mistakes in the 
construction and translation of some verses On p. 420 (section 
29) he Tenders Rg. VBl 94. 2 M as ' she (Prsni) in whose lap all 
the gods maintain their vratas, the Sun and the Moon also, in 
order (hat they may be seen', explains that the Sun and the 
Moon are seen only when they keep their vratas and oonoludes 
that vratas must mean tracks followed by the Sun. Prof. Apte 
takes 'sfiryamasa' as the subject of 'Dharayante' along with 
ViWdevSh ', but ' Sfiryamasa ' is in the objective case in relation 
to ' drse', the proper translation being ' m the lap of whom (i. e. 
of Prsni, the mother of Maruts), all the gods uphold their laws in 
order that (people) may see the Sun and the Moon'. What is 
meant is that the Sun and the Moon rise at the proper times 
because the gods uphold their ordinances If we compare VHt 
94.2 with 1 23.21 ( »X9.7), X 50.1, 1 52.8, X 57 4, X 60 5 it would 
be clear that my translation is the only correct one and if that 
be so no question of 'tracks of light' will arise. 

Misinterpretations of words like 'kaitlh' in HI. 8. 9 as 
meaning dwellings (rather it means "the common mass of 
People asiniau 4, VI. 65. 1, VEL 65. 2, VH. 75. 4, VII 79. 1

■&o ) and of * srustim * (on p 450) are passed over here On VI. 
70 5 Prof. Apte remarks (p 420, See 17) that to take 'vrata* in 
'madhuvrata' applied to the deities Heaven and Earth as mean- 
ing 'law, duty or will' is almost absurd One fails to see why 
it would be absurd to hold, when heaven and earth are spoken 
of as 'dropping 21 madhu ' (madhuscuta) and 'yielding madhu' 
(madhudughe), that the Vedio poet thinks that the laws of Heaven 
and Earth as deities are sweet (and not harsh). 

We have next to turn to the word ' dhrtavrata' which ocoura 
eighteen times in the Rgveda Out of these Varuna is certainly 
called dhrtavrata in seven passages viz in I 25 S and 10, I 44. 
14, X 141 9, n 1. 4 » VIH 27 3 and X 66 5 Both Mitra and 
Varana are styled ' dhrtavrata' in I 15 6, VHI 25 2 and 8 (and 
also 'ksatrryS' in verse 8), Indra and Varuna are said to be 
dhrtavrata in 71 68 10, Indra alone in "VI 19. 5 and V2I1 97 11, 
the Adityas in II 29. 1, Visvedevah in X 66. 8 (and also 
'ksatriyah'), Agni in TUL 44 25 and Savitr in IV. 53 4 Prof. 
Apte (p 430 para 37) avers that Varuna is pre-eminently called 
dhrtavrata (this is not quite accurate as more than half the 
passages in which the word 'dhrtavrata' ooours refer to gods 
other than Varuna), because he maintains intaot the paths he 
has excavated for the luminaries or he sees that the fixed laws 
of the movements of luminaries are properly observed Unless 
one has made up one's mind that vrata signifies tracks of 
luminaries or their fixed movements, these ' dhrtavrata ' passages 
are of no help in settling the original meanings of vrata They 
can all be well construed by taking 'dhrtavrata' m the sense of 
'one who upholds or supports his ordinances' Supposing that 
Prof Apte is right in thinking that the epithet pre-eminently 
applies to Varuna it is quite arguable that what is mainly 
aimed at in calling Varuna ' dhrtavrata' is the high moral level 
Varuna is held by the Bgvedio sages to maintain by punishing 
sinners, by looking into the truth and falsehood of men (VII 49 
3 'satyanrte avapasyan jananSm'), by the fact that he is styled 
'ksatriya', 'rajan' and 'samraj' (who exacts obedience to his 
laws) as shown above Therefore, the view that vrata means 
ordinances in connection with Varuna is far more appropriate 
than the theory about his seeing that the luminaries follow their 
In this connection the word ' dhrtavrata ' a in I 25 6

'becomes very important. Almost all soholars hold that that verse 
means '(Mftia and Varuna) fond of the donor who observes the 
1»wb of religious worship partake of the same offering (made by 
the donor) and they axe not heedless about it (or do not miss 
it)'. Scholars hold that in this verse the word 'dhrtavrata' 
applies to a human 'worshipper and not to a god as in all other 
passages. Prof. Apte (p 430 para 37) explains that the words 
' dhrtavrataya d&suse', mean 'donor who makes a gift to 
(Varuna) that is dhrtavrata.' This construction is objectionable 
for several reasons There are two deities referred to in the 
principal sentence (the verb is ' as&te), while dhrtavrataya, being 
singular, can only be construed with one deity. Prof. Apte 
further relies on VHI. 94. 2 of which he gives an interpretation 
which as shown above is wrong. Constructions parallel to 
'dhrtavrat&ya d&suse* and containing an adjective of the word 
*ds£use' are found in other Bgveda passages. For example, in 
1 142 1 we have* «0 Agnil spread the ancient thread (ie. 
sacrifice) for the worshipper who has extracted Soma juice'. 
Here the words 'sutasomaya dSsuse' do not mean 'to the wor- 
shipper who gives offerings to the god who extracts soma'. 
Similarly, mVHL 5. 6 the words 'sudevSyadSkise* mean "to or 
for the worshipper (or donor) who worships god* (or for donor 
to whom gods are beneficent). These several considerations 
make it highly probable that 'dhrtavrataya' is an attribute of 
a human being in L 25.6 and not neoessarily of Varuna. If 
that be so, vrata in ' dhrtavrata' must mean ' ordinances or mode 
of religious worship' and not 'tracks of luminaries'. We have 
the word 'dhrtadaksa' (who upholds strength I e. who is strong 
or oonstant) applied to a priest in X 4a. 3. It is worthy 
ofnotethattheSatapathaBr in explaining » 'nisasada dhrta- 
vrafo Varunah' in Bg. 3. SB. 10 (« V5j. S. X 27) remarks that 
tto king and a brahmana deeply learned in the Veda are both 

anrtavrata . It is probable that even in the times of the 
Bgveda people had come to assign the same meaning to the word 

dtatavrata that the Sat. Br. ascribes to it. Conceding for 
argument that dhrtavrataya in I 25. 6 refers to Varuna, that 
<toes not at all solve the problem of the derivation and meaning 
of vrata. The word 'vratanlh' occurs only once in Bgveda X

65. 6 and probably means '(the cow) that is the carrier of vrata* 
i e. of the milk on which a saorificer has to subsist In T. S. 
VI 2. 5 2-3 it is said that milk is the Brahmana's vrata On 
p 442 Prof Apte refers to Surya being called 'vratapa' very 
aptly. Vratapa occurs nine times in the Rgveda, but the Sun is 
called 'vratapa* only once in I, 83. 5. Vratapa means nothing 
more than vratapati, which word occurs m T S 1 6 6 3 a , I 6 7. 
2 and Vsj. S I 5 and is applied to Agni In these passages 
'vrata' means a religious vow such as that of a Vedic student 
who undertakes to study Veda after Upanayana There is no 
reason why the word 'vratapa' in the Rgreda should not be 
deemed to have been used in the sense in which 'vratapati' is 
employed in the T S and V£j S Similarly, m Bg VH 103 V 
it is said that the frogs lying silent for a year (in crevices), like 
brabmanas observing a vrata, send forth their croaking inspired 
by the rains Here 'vrata* has the meaning 'a sacred vow or 
observance' which is the sense in which the word is used in 
medieval times and is so used even upto this day. 

There is one more word vis vrsavrata, which is analogous 
to ' dhrtavrata ' and which remains to be considered That word 
occurs only twice (i e in Bg. IX 62 ll 28 and IX, 64 1) and is an 
attribute of Soma Prof Apte (p. 485, section 48) tries to fit this 
word in his scheme by referring to the description of Soma as 
bellowing like a bull, as a bull among cows and as brandishing 
and sharpening hiB horns One must not forget the twofold 
character of Soma as a very pre-eminent deity (the whole of Bg 
IX. ia a glorification of Soma ) and as a beverage produced 
from the twigs and tendrils of the Soma plant and that 
these two characters become mixed up. In the process 
of producing Soma beverage, four sounding holes called 
uparavas are employed 39 (vide H of Dh. vol TL pp 1154-55

for'uparavas'): This is described as the bellowing of Soma, 
when Soma is called a vrsa (bull) or vrsabha. Most of the great 
Vedio gods (Indra, Agni, Soma and others), their chariots, their 
•weapons and even the exhilaration on drinking Soma are spoken 
of as bulls » When Soma twigs are being pressed with Btones 
(gravan) the tendrils of Soma look like horns All these descrip- 
tions about bellowing &c. apply strictly to the soma plant and 
are poetically transferred to the deity Soma, Prof. Apte translates 
'vrsavrata' as 'whose behaviour or deportment is like that of a 
butt' On the other theory also we can easily explain the word 
as meaning ' (Soma) whose ordinances are powerful like a bull', 
Vrsavrata is an attribute of god Soma and cannot be easily 
construed with god Soma, if vrata primarily means some physical 
aotivity and its implications are rather against Prof. Apte's 
theory. 

The result of this long discussion is that Prof. Apte's theory 
of the derivation of vrata from the root ' vrt ' and his long scheme 
of meanings is not proved and that the derivation from the root 
' vr* expressly stated by Yaska at least twenty-five centuries ago 
and accepted by moat scholars has not been at all shaken. Prof 
Apte probably did not anticipate ihat the meaning he assigned 
to 'vrt' would be challenged, but 1 dispute that meaning also. 

There are three passages of the Bgveda in which the words 
'vrttam na cakram* (like a round wheel) occur, viz I. 155 6 
(addressed to Visnu), IV. 31 4, V. 36. 3 (both addressed to 
Indra). Prof. Apte did not mention them and they have no bear- 
ing on the derivation of vrata At the most those might have 
been relied upon for the meaning of the root 'vrt*. In this 
discussion we have restricted ourselves to verbal forms or 
present participles and omitted past passive participles which 
sometimes depart very much from the root-meaning as in the 
case of 'krta'inRgvedaX. 43.5 (krtam na svaghnl vi oinoti 
dsvane). ' Yrtta' cannot mean revolving even if vrt meant ' to 
revolve ', it is vartamBna that might have that meaning if 'vrt' 
originally meant 'to revolve' BesideB,Rg 1 155 6 is obscure. It 
probably refers to the belt of the zodiac that goes round the sky. 

It is necessary to clarify the meanings and mutual relations 
of the three words rta. vrata and dharman. The meanings (three) 



30 Only one verse need be quoted to Illustrate the above Rg. II, 16

of' rta' have beon specified in H ofDh vol IV pp 2-5 and the 
meanings of vrata have been discussed m what prooedos (vide 
pp 5-8) Tn the Bgveda the word is dharman and not dliarma. 
For a brief discussion of dharman vido H of Dh vol X p 1 In 
the Bgveda sometimes dharman is masculine and often an 
adjective, moaning 'upholder or sustamer* as in Rg I. 1S7 1, 
X 92 2 In X 21 3 (tve dharmana fisate) the word is masculine 
In other cases it is obviously in the neuter gender as in I. 22 18 
(ato dharmani dharayan), V 26 6, IX 64 1. In those passages 
the meaning seems to be 'religious rites or sacrifices', thus 
approaching vrata in one of its senses In I 164 43 and 50 
(= X. 90 16) sacrifices are said to bo the primeval dharmans 
Vide also 'prathamu dharmS' in Eg III 17 1 and 'sanata 
dharmani* in Bg HI 3 1 In some cases this sense of dharman 
would not do, as in IV 53 3, V. 63. 7. whero the meaning Booms 
to bo 'fixed principles or rules of conduct'. In some cases 
dharman appears to mean almost tho same thing as 'vrata'. For 
example, in VII 89. 5 31 the sago says 'when wo destroy (or 
violate) your dharwans through heedlessness (or infatuation), do 
laot harm us, O Varuna, on account of that sin ', which is just 
tho same as Bg I 25 1, whero wo have 'vratam* for dharmani 
In VI. 70 I 31 it issaid'hoavon and oarbh, nover decaying and 
endowod with plenty of seod, are held firmly apart by tho 
dharman of Varuna'. In VIII 42 1 (citod above) making 
tho Heaven firmly fixed is dosenbod as ono of tho vratas of 
Varuna 

Though in this way in porno passage? even of tho Rgvoda 
tho sondes of 'vrata* and 'dharman' appear tohavo coalesced,

rta and vrata occur in I. 65 2, II. 27. 8, m. 4 7, X 65. 8. Speak- 
ing generally, 'rta' is the cosmic order that has been there from 
the most ancient times Yrata means the laws or ordinances 
supposed to be laid down by all gods or by individual gods. 
Dharman meant religious rites or sacrifices or fixed principles 
Gradually the conception 'rta* became faint and receded into 
the background and 'satya' took its place. Dharman became 
an all-embracing conception and vrata came to be restricted to 
sacred vows and rules of conduct to be observed by a person as 
a member of a community or as an individual

CHAPTER II 

VRATA ia Vedic Literature, Sutras and Smrtis; 
definition and importance of Vratas. 

After dealing with the etymology and semantic development 
of the word 'vrata 'from the passages of the Rgveda in which 
the word occurs, it is now time to tarn to the other Vedic 
Samhitas and the Brahmanas for finding out how that word is 
dealt with in them Some of the Rgvedic verses occur in other 
Vedic Samhitas In several such passages vrata appears to 
mean 'divine ordinances ' or 'ethical patterns of conduct*. For 
example, the verse 35 Rg I 22 19 'Mark the deeds of Visnu, the 
helpful friend of India, wherehy he watches over his ordinances ' 
occurs also in T S 1862, Atharva VH. 26 6, Vaj S VL 4; 
Rg VUL 11 l 36 'O Agni! thou art a God that protects 
ordinances among (gods and) men, thou art to he praised in 
sacrifices 'is also found in Atharva 19 59 l.Vaj S IV 16, T.S. 
1 1 14 4-5 andl 2 3 1; Rg. 1 24. 15 i s found in Vaj S. ZH 12 
and Atharva VUL 83 (88) 3 and XVHI. 4 69; Rg X 191.3 is 
almost the same as Atharva 37 VL 64 2, the latter substituting 
the word 'vratatn' for 'manah' in the former and thereby 
indicating that 'vrata' means 'resolve to undertake a religious 
observance'; Rg VEL 103 1, in which frogs that lie down silent 
for a year and begin to croak at the advent of the rains are com- 
pared to brahmanas observing a religious yaw, occurs in the 
Atharvaveda IV. 15 13 ; Rg X 12 5 is the same as Atharva 
XVDX 1 33; Rg X 24 is almost the same as Atharva XXX 59 2; 
Rg L 84. 12 is eoual to Atharva XX 109 3, in all of which the 
wards vratam and vrafflm. occur. Agni is frequently called 
•vratapah' in the Rgveda (V. 2. 8, VI 8 2, VJH 11 1, X 32 6) 
and also Surya is so called (Rg I. 83 5 ) In the other SamhitSs 
Agni is styled 'vratapa' as well as 'vratapati' (protector or lord of 
vratas) Atharva XX 25. 5 ( SSryo vratapa) is the same as Rg L 
83.5, Atharva XIX 59 1 (tvam-Agne vratapa asi) is same as

Vrala in other Satiihitas 23 

Bg VHL 11. 1 ; Vaj S I S. 38 says ' O Agni, lord of vrataa 1 1 shall 
undertake & religious observance (or obligation). May I be able 
to carry it out r may that (undertaking) of mine succeed; here do 
I approach truth from untruth*. The T. S I. 3 4. 3 also styles 
Agni 'vratapati'. Here and there Vedic SatnhitSs other than 
the Bgveda do employ the word ' vrata" in the sense of ' ordin- 
ances of a god or of gods' as in T. S. 17. 3 11. 1, 2, 3 or Atharva 
VH 40 (41) 1, VIL 68 (70). 1 ( ' Sarasvati vratesu te* ). But in 
many places in all the Samhit&s (other than the Bgveda) and 
in the Br&hmanas and Upanisads generally the ordinary senses 
of vrata are two, viz (1) religious observance oi vow, or restric- 
tions as to food and behaviour when one has undertaken a reli- 
gious vow, or (2) the special food, that is prescribed for susten- 
ance when a person is engaged in a religious rite or undertaking, 
suoh as cow's milk, yaiagu (barley gruel) or the mixture of hot 
milk and curds (catted amtksa) Both meanings of vrata are 
given by Yaska in his Nirukta 3 * A few passages from the 
SatnhitSs and Brahmanas are cited below to illustrate both 
meaningB. For the first meaning, vide the following: T. S H. 
5.5.6 'this 40 is his vrata (vow); he should not speak what is 
untrue, should not eat flesh, should not approach a woman (for 
sexual intercourse ), nor should his apparel be washed with water 
impregnated with cleansing salt; for, all these things the gods 
do not do' ; T & V 7. 6. 1* 'birds are indeed fire; when one who 
has performed Agnicayana eats the (flesh of) birds, he would be 
eating fire and would meet with disaster (or distress) ; (therefore) 
he should observe this vrata (not to eat bird's flesh) for a year,

for vrata does not extend heyond a year'. The fknkhayana* 2 
Br VI 6 prescribes 'He has to observe the vrata, viz that he 
should not see the rising sun nor the setting sun '. The Tai £. 
X 26 6 states ' this is the vrata for him (for him who has per- 
formed .Srunaketuka-cayana), viz he should not run while it is 
raining, should not urinate or void ordure in water, should not 
spit, should not bathe naked, should not step over lotus leaves or 
gold, should not eat (the flesh) of a tortoise ' 

The Brhadaranyakopanisad (I 5 21-23) remarks "now 
begins the consideration about vrata, Prajapati indeed created 
the organs, which when created, vied with each other, speech 
stood fast (by the view) 'I shall only speak' (and do nothing 
ebie)' ..Therefore one should perform only one vrata, viz one 
should only breathe in and should emit breath, for fear that 
otherwise ( if one were to engage in the activities of £he other 
organs) wicked Death may seize him "J 3 It is stated in the Tai 
Up HE 7-10 ' one should not speak iH of food , that is the vrata, 
...one should not shun food, that is the vrata . one should prepare 
'much food ..one should not refuse residence to a man whatever 
(when he comes as a stranger seeking shelter), that is the vrata; 
therefore one should secure plenty of food by some method or 
other.'** In the Ghandogyopanisad (adbyaya H, khandas 13-31) 
the words 'tadvratam' occur several tunes in relation to the 
injunctions when one is engaged in the upSsanS of several 
Samans not to complain about the hot sun, raining cloud, 
seasons, lokas (worlds), domestic animals, brahmanas and the 
'injunction not to eat marrow for a year (or not to eat it at all)

tioned above. The T. S. (VX Z 5.1.) remarks 45 'he (dlksita) 
observes She vrata taking the milk from one udder, then from two 
udders, then from three, then from four; this is called ksarapam 
(razor-edge) vrata; barley gruel is the vrata of a ksatriya (when 
dlksita), 5miks5 (hot milk and curds mixed) of a vaisya ' The 
Satapatha Br. provides 46 that a dlksita (one who has under- 
gone the consecration ceremony for a vedic sacrifice) should 
subsist on milk. In another place the 6atapatha says 'for him 
he heats w a to' (i e. the food or milk). The Ait Br. also provides * 7 
that the dlksita first takes (the milk) from four udders as vrata 
on the TJpasad days, then from three &c Vide T JL II 8 ffl 
'milk is the vrata of a br&hmana (saorificer); yavugu of a 
ksatriya and amiksa of a vaisya 

It appears that in the times of the Brahmanaa the word 
' vrata ' had come to have two secondary senses derived from the 
sense of 'religious observance or obligation'; viz 'a proper 
course or pattern of conduct for a person', and ' an upavasa ' i e. 
the saorificer's staying at night near Gaihapatya fire or fasting. 
As illustrative of the first may be oiteda passage that occurs 
towards the end of the Ait. Br viz 'this is the wata for him 
(for the king who has performed what is called 'brahmanah 
parimaTah') that he should not sit down before his enemy Bits 
down (but should do so after), if he thinks (from information 
received) that his enemy is standing the king should also stand 
up; he should not lie down before his enemy (does so); if the 
king thinks that (the enemy) has sat down he may then himself 
sit down, he should never sleep hef ore his enemy sleeps; if he 
thmkBthat the enemy is awake he should himself keep awake;

even if the enemy has his head as hard bb a stone (or has a stone 
helmet on his head), he (the king who peri or ms the pan mora) 
quickly overthrows him" 4 » 

The other secondary meaning of orata seems to be upenasa 
(i e Yajamana's passing the night in the Darsa-isti and the 
Purnamasa-isti near the Garhapatya and other fires, or reducing 
his intake of food or fasting) "that he performs upavasa in 
Darsa and Purnamosa istis is so because the gods do not partake 
of the offering made by one who has not undergone mala , there- 
fore he undergoes upavasa with the thought ' the gods may 
partake of my offering' " (Ait Br. VH H) 81 

Coming to the Srautasutras, 51 the two piincipal meanings 
of vrata mentioned above often figure in them For example, 
the Sp. Sr S 3V 2 5-7, IV. 16 11, V 7 6 and 16, V 8. 1, V. 25.

andip Sr S X 12 4, X 17 6, XI 15 3 and 6 for the second 
(viz. food or milk &o ) The Grhyasutras and Dhaiamasutras 
also present the same meaning of vrata For sample, the Asv. 
Gt HI 10 5-7 states' these are the vratas for him, viz he should 
not bathe at night, nor bathe naked, nor run while it is raining

eating flesh, not using earthen vessels foi drinking water, not 
seeing women, sudras, corpses and crows, not speaking with 
sSdras, not urinating nor voiding ordure nor spitting in front of 
the sun, or he should simply speak the truth (instead of observing 
the other requirements of this passage). Gautama (Vm. IS), 
Sankhayana-grhya (H 11-12 ), Gobhila-grhya (HI 1. 26-31) and 
others mention certain vratas ( now obsolete) which every Vedic 
student was to undergo. Vide H. of Dh. vol H pp 370-373 for 
descriptions of these. The Ap Dh. S. II 1. 1. 1 ff » specifies 53 the 
observances to be followed by the husband and wife from the day 
of their marriage such as eating only twice in the day, not 
eating to satiety, fasting on pat van days Similarly, the Ap. 
Dh S. (1. 11. 30 6, 1 11 31 ) sets out the observances for matakas 
( atha Bnataka-vratani ) Panini has a special sutra ' vrate ' (HL 
2. 80 ) for explaining the formation of words from vrata with the 
affix m (nini) preceded by a substantive such as ' sthandilasayin' 
and ' asraddha-bhojl' (one who has taken the vow of not par- 
taking of sraddha food) Panini (DX 1.21 J 53 also teaches the 
formation of a denominative verb from vrata in the sense of 
'doing* (vratayati vratam haioti). It is the KasikS that adds 
a«art»/co(absentintheMahabhSsya) that the verb so derived 
expresses both the eating of food and the eschewing of it. 

As prayascittas (expiations) involved the observance of 
several strict rules they came to be called vratas in Manu (XL 117, 
170,176,181), Yajfiavalkya (EL 251,252,254,258), gankha (17. 6, 
22, 42, 61, 62) and other amrtis. In the Mahabharata the word 
vrata is mainly used in the sense of a religious undertaking or 
vow in which one has to observe certain restrictions about food 
or one's general behaviour. Vide Vanaparva 296 3, TJdyoga 39. 
71-72, Santi 35 39, Anusasana 103 34. It was also applied in 
the epic to a course or pattern of conduct or behaviour not 
necessarily religious. For example, in the Sabhaparva 58 16 
Yudhisthira says that it has been his constant vow that he would 
not refuse dice-play when he was challenged to it M Apart from

28 History of Dhm ma&astra [ Seo I, Oh. H 

the secondary applications of the word vrata, its principal 
meaning from at least the first centuries of the Christian era 
onwards has been that of a roligious undertaking or tow, 
observed on a certain tithi, week day, month or other period, for 
securing some desired object by the worship of a deity, usually 
accompanied by restrictions as to food and behaviour This is 
the sense in which the word vrata will be used in this sebtion 
Vratas may be expiatory (i e they will be piayascittas) or 
obligatory ( such as the vratas of a brahmacarin or sn&taka or 
householder) or they may be voluntary and self-imposed for 
securing some specific end Expiatory vratas have already been 
dealt with in the 4th volume of the H of Dh under Prayascittas 
The vratas of a biahmacarin, of snataka and of the householder 
have been treated of in volume JU of the H of Dh. Vratas or 
vows that are more or less self-imposed will be discussed in this 
section of the 5th volume 

Vows are found in all religions The Old Testament and the 
New Testament both bear witness to the sacredness of vows, vide 
Isaiah 19. 21, Job 22 27, Psalms 22 25, Acts 21 23 The Jainas 
have five great vows and the Buddhists have the pauca-sflas. 

A great deal of discussion is found in the medieval digests 
on a comprehensive definition of vrata Sahara 5 * on Jai. VI 2. 
20 arrives at the conclusion that by vrata is meant a mental 
activity, which is a resolve in the form "I shall not do this" 
and gives as an illustration the sentence 'one should not 
see the rising or setting sun'. Medhatithi on Manu IV. 13 seems 
to accept this The AgnipurSna 56 provides ' a restrictive rule 
declared by the sastras is called vrata, which is also regarded as 
tapas; restraint of senses and other rules are but speoial incidents 
of vrata, vrata is called tapas because it causes hardship to the 
performer (of the vrata) and it is also called myama since there- 
in one has to restrain the Beveral organs of sense'. Manu HI 3

declares 57 ' resolve ia the toot of desires, of sacrifices, of vratas 
and the characteristics called yamas — all are known to spring 
from resolve' But every sankalpa entertained by any person 
whatever is not and cannot be called vrata It may be noted that 
the AmaTakosa holds 58 that the words 'niyama' and 'vrata' are 
synonyms and that the latter consists of fast and the like that 
produce merit (puitya ), while the JLp. Dh S I 2, 57 remarks that 
the word lapaa is applied to the rules of conduct prescribed for a 
brahmacarin ('myamesu tapahsabdah') The Mitaksara® on 
YSq 1. 129 appears to indicate that vrata is a mental resolve to 
do something or refrain from doing something, both being 
enjoined as duties It is therefore that Srldatta ( probably taking 
his cue from Sahara and the Mit ) in his Samaya-pradipa defines 
vrata as ' a definite resolve relating to a certain matter held as 
obligatory' and proceeds to lay down that it may be positive 
(being in the form 'I must do it') or negative ('I must not do 
this ' ) He further holds that a resolve 60 made with the addition 
of a condition not enjoined by sastras is not a vrata: e g. if a 
man were to declare that he would observe a fast if his father 
would not forbid it and that otherwise he would not, this 
would not be a vrata and that, since sankalpa is the principal 
matter in a vrata, if a man of weak intellect or an ignorant 
man observes a fast without sankalpa, it would be simply so

much physical hardship but no vrata. The Krtyaratnakara* 1 
mentions several definitions of vrata given by its predeoessois, 
one of which by Devesvara was that ' a vrata is that which is 
included in the vratakanda' This last is a desperate effort at 
definition and leaves the inquirer hardly wiser than before That 
sankalpa is closely connected with vrata oannot be gainsaid 
and follows from averse of Laghu-Visnu* 2 'the choosing of 
rlviks is the starting point of a sacrifice, sankalpa that of 
w ata and of a japa of mantras { in honour of a deity ) '. Sulap&m 
defined vrata on almost the same lines as Srldatta Laksml- 
dhara in his Kxtyakalpataru on vrata does not define 
vrata but begins his treatment of vrata with vrataprasamsa. 
Prof K V Bangaswami Aiyangar in his Introduction to the 
Vratakanda of the Ertyakalpataru remarks (p XXIH) *Baghu~ 
nandana in his Vrata-tattva also avoids any attempt to define 
vrata' Prof Aiyangar did not notice that Baghunandana 
discusses the question of the definition of vrata in his Ekadasl- 
tattva (Jiv vol IE p 7) and therefore he did not repeat the 
definition in the Vratatattvn Baghunandana mentions 83 the 
definitions of vrata given by Narayana and Srldatta, does not 
agree that vrata is a sankalpa but holds that vrata means 
various rites about which a resolve is made and also that vrata 
is a myama (a restrictive rule ) enjoined by the sastra, charac- 
terised by upavasa and the like and not every niyama such as 
'rtukalabhigaml syaV (YSj I 79, Manu HE. 45) The Vrata- 
prakasa (apart of Viramitrodaya) defines vrata as 'a special 
sankalpa concerning what is wall known to the learned as vrata,' 
just as mantras are those that are well-known among the learned 
as mantras 61 The Dharmasindhu (p 9) defines vrata as a kind

of religious rite consisting of pUjO. and the like. Although at 
the root of every vrata and as an urge for it, there must be a 
Bankalpa it appears to me that Raghunandana and the Dharma- 
sindhu properly represent the popular meaning of vrata A 
vrata comprehends several items suoh as snana (bath), the morn- 
ing prayer (pratah-sandhya), sanlcalpa, homa, puju of the deity 
or deities in whose honour or for securing whose favour the 
vrata is undertaken, upavasa, feeding of brahmanas, maidens or 
married women or the poor and helpless (according to the nature 
of the vrata), gifts (of cows, money, apparel, sweetmeats &c ) 
and the observance of certain rules of conduct during the period 
of the vrata. Some of these matters will be dealt with in detail 
later on, but a few may be disposed off here. Some writers 
relying on Satatapa said that before a vrata was undertaken a 
Vrddhi-sraddha must be performed 65 The Agnipurana (175 12) 
states 66 that one who undertakes a vrata must always take a 
bath (every day), should subsist on a limited quantity of food, 
should worship and honour his guru, gods and brahmanas and 
should eschew ksara, ksaudra, lavana, honey and meat. Devala 
states 67 'without partaking of food (the previous night), after 
bathing and concentrating one's mind, one should, after invok- 
ing the Sun and other deities to be present, commence a vrata 
in the morning 1 . The general tendency of medieval writers to 
go on adding details to what was originally brief is seen at work 
here also The Vratakalaviveka says that before sankalpa, there

should be remembrance of NSrSyana and namasksra to him, as 
laid down by Yogiyajfiavalkya There is difference of opinion 
about the worship of Ganesa « The Vratakalaviveka quotes the 
PadmapurSna for the order in which the several deities are to 
be worshipped and honoured after sanlalpa and refutes the idea 
that the worship of Ganesa should always precede the worship 
of other deities. Though the general rule is that® the sankalpa 
of a vrata is to be made in the morning, still there are some 
passages to the contrary. For example, the Bhavisyapurgna 70 
(Uttara 11 6-8) provides that on the evening of Assdha lull 
Moon one should declare a resolve as follows 'fiom tomorrow for 
one month in grSvana, I shall take a bath, observe brahmacarya, 
take one meal only after evening, sleep on the ground, will be 
compassionate to all living beings'. 

There is a difference between homo, and puju Ahomawith 
Vedic mantras, according to ancient authorities, cannot be 
performed by women and sudras Though theoretically the three 
varoas were entitled to perform homa with Vedio mantras some 
learned brahmanas held the view that in the Kahyuga no proper 
ksatriyas and vaisyas existed a Even as to Sudra n some 
writers like Kamalakarabhatta went so far that a sudra could not 
read and study even puranas but should only listen to their

taoital by brahmanas. The result -was that most people per- 
formed only pj&Sand not homainAgni. According to most 
•■writers the homa was to be performed in honour of that deity 
for whose favour the vrata was performed. According to "Vardha- 
mana and a few others the homa in a vrata may he in honour of 
the deity of the vrata or may be a vyabrtihoma 73 It is stated 
by the Agnipur&na 74 that there is japa, homa and also gifts at 
the end of all vratas in general and the Visnudharmottara 
observes that those who perform upavasavrata should inaudibly 
mutter the mantras of that deity, should meditate on that deity, 
should listen to stories about that deity, should worship the 
image of that deity, should take the names of that deity 
and listen to others singing the names PurvamlmamsS 
writers made a distinction between homa, yaga and dUna. 
Sahara 75 on Jai. IV. 2. X8 puts the distinction in a nutshell by 
saying that ' giving up what belongs to one is common to all the 
three, but yaga means simply giving up something intending it 
for a deity and accompanying it with a mantra; in homa there 
is in addition the throwing of a thing in fire; dana consists in 
abandoning a thing that belongs to one and creating the owner- 
ship of another in that thing.' In another place ( on Jai IX. 
. 1. 6 ), Sahara refers to the argument that yaga is nothing but the 
worship of a deity ( api oa yago n&ma devataptija ). 

Manu H 176 and Taj. L 99, 100, 102 show that EeuzpVja is 
different from 16 homa and was performed after the latter according 
to Marlci and Harlta quoted in the Smrticandrika, Smrti-mukta-

phala and other digests Certain matters connected with 
devapuja such as the questions whether images of gods were 
worshipped in the times of the Bgveda and the Samhitus, whether 
the worship of images arose spontaneously among the Vedio 
Aryans or whether it was derived from some other race or 
sectarians or from sudras and JDravidian tribes, have already- 
been dealt with at some length in H of Dh vol H pp 705-712 
Similarly, descriptions of devapuja and the several items and 
stages in the procedure of devapuja have been set out m H of 
Dh. vol. II pp 726-735 A few matters either not set out there 
at all or briefly set out may be spoken of here It should be 
noted that ordinarily there are 16 upacSras 77 (items of showing 
honour) in the procedure of devapuja, hut they may be increased 
to 36 or 38 or reduced to 14, 12, 10 or 5 and there is no complete 
unanimity on the question of the names of the 16 upacSras 
and their order. The BrahmavaivartapurSna sets out what 
the sixteen, twelve and five upaoaras are The VratSrka 
quotes verses enumerating 38, 16, 10 or 5 upacaras. If a 
person is unable to offer even five upacsras then he should 
offer two, viz sandalwood paste and flowers and if he 
cannot do even that, then he may offer only devotion. So 
says the KfilikSpurana quoted in Varsakriya-kaumudl p 157. 
From Sahara's bhSsya on Jai. V. 1. 4 it follows that long 
before his day (not later than 4th century A.D.) the order 
(krama) of the upacSras had been settled 78 Medieval works

Ijpacaras in pUja SS 

(quoting Nrsimhapurana 62 8-14) prescribe for all vratas in 
general the recital of each of the sixteen verses of the Purusasukta 
(Bg. X.90) with each of the sixteen upacaras in order (viz. 
avahana, asana, padya, arghya, acamaniyaka, guana, Taatra, 
yajaopavlta, anulepana (organdha), puspa, dhQpa, dlpa, nai- 
vedya, tambola, daksina, pradaksina), while some works associate 
with each of these one or more PaurSnika mantras also It 
should not be supposed that these upacaras (particularly puspa, 
gandha, dhupa, dlpa and naivedya) were absent in the Vedic 
age and came into prominence at a very late stage by being 
borrowed from non-Aryan people. The Asvins are described as 
wearing wreaths of blue lotoses (puskarasraja) inSgX 184. 2 
and Atharva HL 22. 4 ; the Maruts also are spoken of as wearing 
wreaths ( Rg. V 53. 4 ). In numerous passages the Bgveda ref era 
to the casting of offerings (kavya) mixed with clarified butter 
inAgni(e g. Rg.HI 59 1 and 5)" The gods are even asked 
to eat apupa, purodasa, dhana, milk, curds, honey &o. in$g. 
HI 53 8, III 52 1-7, IV. 32. 16, Vm. 91: 2, in Atharva XVffl 4. 
16-26. The underlying conception in these passages is the same 
as that involved in offering naivedya to an image. In the 
Satapatha Br * the word upacSShra appears to have "been used in 
the sense of 'honour' or 'mode of showing honour' IntheTai. 
A X 40 a occurs a mantra called 'Medha-janana' which was 
recited in the ear of a child in the jatalarma * may god Savitr, 
goddess Sarasvatl and the gods Asvins wearing wreaths of blue 
lotuses produce in you intelligence'. There is evidence that long 
before the time of the grhyasutras several of the sixteen upacaras 
were well-known. The Nighantu (IH. 14) enumerates 44 verbs 
that have the sense of 'worship' among which 'pujayati' is

included The Nirukta in explaining the word 'supSnih' 
occurring in Eg HL 33 6 states that the word 'pSni' is 82 derived 
from 'pan' to offer puja and supports this derivation hy saying 
that people worship gods by joining together their hands It is 
clear that the Nighantu treated 'pfijayati' as a verb occurring in 
the Yedasand that folding the hands (i e namaskara) was a 
item of worship long before the Nirukta While explaining the 
word 'saparyan' occurring in Kg HL 31 1 the Nirukta offers 
•pujayan* as a synonym. From Panini 8 * V 3 99 and the 
Mahsbhssya thereon it is clearly seen that in the days of the 
former images of gods were made for sale and also for worship 
PataSjali expressly says that the rule applies to images which 
were worshipped and which gave livelihood to the Pyjans of 
those images and not to images made for sale Vide also 
Mahabhasya on Panini 1 1 25. The Ssv Gr M provides that 
when madJiuparlxi is to he offered to a rtvik, an acarya, a bride- 
groom, a king or a snatakaor a relative (like father-in-law, 
paternal or maternal uncle), a seat, water for washing the feet,

Origin of puja 37 

upacaras that had been offered for showing honour and worship 
to worthy men were by a natural analogy employed in it In 
my view the theory that pujS and the upacaras were borrowed 
from the Dr&vidians or some non-Aryan people cannot be held 
to be proved, is quite speculative and that 'puja' of images of 
gods was an indigenous development. Medieval writeis were 
careful to point out that there was no essential difference between 
yaga { vedio or other sacrifice) and puja, as in both there was the 
giving of some substance intending it for a deity. Prof J 
Charpentiar contributed a paper on ' the meaning and etymology 
of puja' to the Indian Antiquary vol 56 pp 93-99 and pp 130 ff 
I demur to his conclusions He points out that *pu' in Tamil 
means 'flower', that the word puja is derived from Dravidian 
'pficu*, 'pfisu' to paint or daub' (p. 133) and asks the question 
why red colour is used in the worship of Gods; he himself answers 
it by suggesting that it was a substitute for blood There is no 
reason whatever for assuming that puja was derived from 'pu' 
and not from ' puspa' (flower) which was known to the Rgveda 
(H. 13 7 •puspinlh'andX 97 3 'puspavatUY ). There is no Bound 
reason to assume that 'pucu' (to paint) existed thousands of years 
ago in Dravidian languages and was not a more recent acquisi- 
tion, when the word poja can be traced a thousand years before 
any existing literary work in any Dravidian language. 86 

Some works on vratas treat at great length the several 
upacaras, particularly flowers that should be offered to the various 
images worshipped, the consequences of offering those flowers, the 
various kinds of fragrant substances (gandha) to be offered or 
the incense to be burnt, the nature of the foods &o. Vide for 
example, Hem5dri( on vrata) voL L pp. 49-51, Krtyaratnakara 
PP. 70-71, 77-79, Varsakriyakaumudl pp 156-181. Por reasons 
, of space it is not possible to treat of these matters here. Besides, 
H.ofDh vol H, (pp 731-734) deals at some length with the 
unguents, the flowers, the lamps, the naivedya to be offered in 
toe ordinary devapuja. A few matters not mentioned there are 
wt out here for the sake of completeness of treatment The 8m.

is better than sandalwood, dark agaru is still better and saffron 
is preferable to dark agaru Hemadri (on vrata vol I 
pp 43-44) quotes passages from several puranas defining 88 
catuhsama as tvafc i e cinnamon, patraka ( cassia leaf ), 
lavanga i e cloves, and saffron (or two parts of musk, four of 
sandalwood, three of saffron and one of camphor) and 
sarvagandha as saffron, sandalwood, uiira (fragrant roots of a 
plant), viusta, ISmajja (root of fragrant grass), camphor and the 
three perfumed things viz took, cardamom and patralca and 
Yaksakardama as camphor, agaru, musk, sandalwood and 
kakkola. The Agnipur&na (chap. 202 1) first states that Hari is 
pleased by the offerings of flowers, perfumes, incense, lamps and 
naivedija and then specifies the flowers that are fit for offering to 
the deities and that are unfit (verses 3-15) The Kalpataru on 
vrata (pp 180-181) quotes the Bhavisyapurana (BrShmaparva 
197 1-11) for stating the consequences of using various flowers 
in worship, viz worship with malatl flowers leads the worshipper 
in the presence of god, worship with karavha flowers confers 
health and incomparable prosperity, by the flowers of MallikS the 
worshipper becomes endowed with all pleasures, with pundarlka 
(lotuses) he secures bliss and lasting wealth, with flowers of the 
fragrant kubjaka he secures highest prosperity, with lotuses 
(white and blue) he secures Bpotless fame, with various mukurahas 
( Jasminium zambac) he is freed from disease, worship with 
Mandara flowers destroys all kinds of leprosy, and with bilva 
flowers he obtains wealth, with arka flowers the Lord Sun confers 
blessings, with a garland of bakula flowers the worshipper has a 
beautiful daughter, the San worshipped with Kimsuka flowers 
does away with trouble, with Agastya flowers the deity gives 
success and worship with lotuses gives a beautiful wife, with 
vanamala the worshipper becomes free from tiredness, the 
worshipper of the Sun with Asoka flowers makes no mistakes, 
and the Sun worshipped with japS(ohina rose) flowers frees 
the worshipper from trouble About dhupa (incense burnt in 
Worship) a good deal is said in the digests The Kalpataru

'Dhupa in puja 39 

(on vrata pp. 182-183)" observes as follows: The Sun comes 
near (i. a favours) a worshipper who burns sandalwood and 
confers desired objects when one hums agaru as dhupa; one who 
desires health should burn guggulu ; the Sun is always pleased by 
the use of pindSnga ( i e. silhaka ) and confers health, wealth and 
the highest bliss; a man secures hlessedness by using kundaka 
(the exudation of sallaJd) as dhupa and trade becomes fruitful 
by using srlvasaka (sarala) as dhupa and one gets wealth 
by burning rasa (myrrh) and sarjarasa (resin of the sal tree) 
Bana in the Kadambarl (purvardha, para 56) refers to the 
practice of burning guggulu in the temple of Candika Kalpataru 
(onvratapp 6-7), Hemadri (onvrata)vol I pp 50-51, Krtya- 
ratnakara p 78 quote several verses from the Bhavisyapurana 
defining dhupas called 'amrta', 'ananta', yaksanga, mahanga 
The Bhavisyapurana 90 remarks* the jati is the best among 
flowers, kundaka is the best dhupa, saffron is hest among fragrant 
substances, sandalwood among unguents; ghee is best for lighting 
lamps and modaha sweets among naivedya foods It may be 
noted that the burning of guggulu and other substances had a 
practical end in view, viz. the destruction of fleas and bees M 

It is no doubt true that in most vratas brahmanas are to he 
fed, but one should not run away with the idea that the blind, the 
poor and the helpless were altogether forgotten. In the case of 
many vratas it is expressly provided that food should be given 
to the blind, the poor and the helpless. In describing the Aviyoga- 
vrata, both the Kalpataru ( on vrata p. 75) and Hemadri quote a 
long passage from the Kalikapurana in which it is provided that 
on the day of the vrata tasteful and well-flavoured food and drink 
without stint should be distributed to the helpless, the blind and

recommends that one observing a vrata should provide food for 
the blind, the distressed and the helpless according to his means. 
As m the case 91 of sraddhas, particularly at Goya, the Puranas 
often enjoin lavish expenditure on vratas and condemn stinginess 
or spending less on thorn than one is able to spend. Vide Matsya 
100 36 The Bhovisyottara 95 on Ubhayadvadaslvrata states ' the 
perfotmor of Ubhayadvadaslvrata boing solely devoted to Kisna 
should not be tricky (spend less) in spending wealth*. In respect 
of Aviyogavrota the Kalika-purana provides ' the performer free 
from triokmess about wealth should give an equivalent to the 
brdhmanas or the couple if he is unable ( to givo pearls and 
precious stones )'. Vide also Fadma VL 39. 21, Matsya 62. 34,

must be cultivated as common to all vratas vte. * forbearance, 
tmthfulness, compassion, charity, purity (of body and mind), 
curbing the organs of sense, worship of deities (or images), 
offerings into fire, contentment, not depriving another of his 
property. Thi3 ten-fold dharma is declared as common to all 
vratas' Devala prescribes: ' brahmacarya (celibacy), purity, 
truthfulness and giving up of flesh-eating— these four are the 
highest (virtues) in vratas. Brahmacarya is lost by looking at 
(stranger) women, touching them and engaging in talk with 
them, but not by sexual intercourse with one's wife during the 
allowed days after her monthly illness' The NaradlyapurSna 
remarks' 7 'brahmacarya is prescribed for being observed in all 
vratas and it is daolared that generally sacrificial food is eaten'. 
ffavisyanna is variously defined Manu* says 'the food proper 
for hermits (such as niiiara), milk, juice of soma plant, flesh 
that has not become putrid, and aksaralavana (natural salt) — 
these are declared to be (fit) sacrificial food by nature'. Though 
flesh was offered in sraddhas in the times of the several early 
smrtis such as that of Taj flesh must be excluded from the list 
of proper foods in the oase of -vratas owing to the express provi- 
sions contained in Devala-Bmrti ( oited above) and others. Vide 
H of Dh -vol IV. p. 149 n. 343 for havisya food. The Krtyaratns- 
kaxa' 99 quotes a long passage from the Samayapradlpa on what food 
should be partaken in vratas viz. 'first come yavas (barley), on 
failure of them wihi ( rice), on failure of this, other food except 
mSsa( black beans), kodrava, gram, masUra (a kind of pulse), 
cmw and kapittha'. There are somewhat conflicting passages 
in the several Puranas about the foods that are acceptable or

should be rejected For example, {he Agnipuraua 100 (in 175. 
IS) first states that ksar-a, lavana, honey and flesh should be 
eschewed in vrata, then (in 175 13-14) inoludes among ksara 
all cereals m pods except sesame and mudga, and among corn 
wheat and kodravas and several others are included in ksara 
group (i e they are to be eschewed in vrata) and proceeds 
(175 14-15) 'rice, Bastika (corn that ripens in sixty days from 
the date of sowing), mudga, kalaya (peas), sesame and yava, 
syamaka (millet), nlvfira (wild rice grams), wheat and others

(in vrata) kusmanda (pumpkin gourd), alabu (bottle gourd), 
vartaka (eggplant), palankl (a kind of vegetable) andputiks. 
The Padmapurana 101 provides that one who is observing nakta- 
vrata must observe Bix things, viz havisya meals, bath, truthful- 
ness, small quantity of food, worship of Agni and sleeping on the 
ground (not on a cot) The Bhujabala 102 says all should avoid 
while observing vrata the use of bell metal (vessel), flesh, matnira, 
gram, kodrava, vegetables, honey and the food cooked in 
another's house Harlta lays 103 down what should be avoided on 
the day of vrata: one should avoid on the fast day talk with one 
guilty of heavy Bins, heterodox sectarians and atheists and speak- 
ing what is untrue and obsosne. The Santiparva says 'one 
engaged in vrata should not converse with women, sndras and

The Furanas extol, as in the case of pilgrimages, the 
performance of vratas to the skies Certain "vratas like 
those to be undergone by a Vedic student had ceased to he 
in vogue and vratas associated with Vedic sacrifices also 
had become rare in the centuries before the Christian era. 
In the grhya and dharma sutras and in ancient smrtis like 
those of Mann and Y&jnavalkya what were called vratas in the 
PurSnas did not occupy any very prominent position. During 
the early centuries of the Christian era Buddhism and Jainism 
were influential rivals of the ancient sacrificial system. In order 
to wean away common people from those two schisms it is very 
probable that learned followers of the Vedic system hit upon the 
glorification of vratas and promised heaven and otherworldly and 
spiritual rewards to those who performed vratas that were com- 
paratively easy and within reach of all instead of sacrifices and 
also adopted some of the practices of common folks as vratas, 
e g kukkutt-markatl-vrata in Bhavisyottara 46. 1-43, Sltala- 
vrata ( Vratarka folio 111 b -113 b, N. S. p 133 ). The Brahma- 
purana 105 says * the reward that is secured by the worship of the 
Sun for a single day cannot be secured by hundreds of Vedic 
sacrifices or by brahmanas to whom the fees stated in the texts 
are paid* The Padmapurana 106 extols Jayanttvrata by saying 
that in the body of the man who performs it all holy places and 
deities reside The Garudapurana u >' quoted by Hemadri states 
that the K&ficanapurivrata described by it is more purifying 
than even the Ganges, Kuruksetra, Kail and Puskara. The 
Bnavisya-purana (Uttara 1 1) provides that a man crosses easily 
the deep ocean of hells by means of the boat of vratas, vpavSsas

and myamas. In the MahabhSrata 108 ( and the Padmapurana VI 
53 &r% ) it is stated that the Vedic rites and rites prescribed by 
Manu cannot be performed in Kahyuga and that therefore it 
declares to Yudhisthira something that would be an easy remedy, 
requiring little wealth and causing little trouble but securing 
great rewards and that would be the essence of Furanas, viz one 
should not eat on the EkadasI of both fortnights; he who does 
not eat food on EkadasI does not go to hell About the XTbhaya- 
dvadaslvrata described in the Bhavisyapura'na it is said that 
PrabhSsa, 10 * Gaya, Puskara, VaranasI, Frayaga or holy places to 
the east or west thereof, or to the north are not superior or egual 
to the Eartika vrata The Anusasana-parva 110 proclaims that 
there is no higher tapas than upavasa (fasting) or even equal to 
it and that poor men can secure the rewards of sacrifices by 
resorting to the upavSsa described HemSdri quotes two verses 
on Arkavrata from the Bhavisyapurana stating that if a man 
observes for a year nakta on the 6th and 7th. tithis in each fort- 
night he obtains the merit secured by those who perform the 
Vedio sacrifices called sallras or wbo observe the vow of speaking 
the truth 

In the VarahapuiSna the question 111 asked is 'how can a 
poor man reach God' and the reply is that he can do so by vratas

Eulogy of vralas 45 

and fasts The Lingapurana (purvardha 83 4) provides that one 
Who for a year observes nakta (eating only once in the evening) 
and worship of Siva on the 14th. and 8th tithis in each paksa 
(fortnight) secures the reward of all sacrifices and reaches the 
highest goal The Bhavisya asserts that brahmanas who have 
no sacred fires (irauta or smSrta) benefit in this way that gods 
become pleased with them by (the observance of) vratas, fasts, 
restrictive roles of conduct and various kinds of gifts, particularly 
by a fast on special tithis. 

The keynote struck by the Matsya, Brahma and other 
PurSnas is how to secure great rewards with little effort The 
Brahma-pur&na remarks that by merely taking in Xallyuga the 
name of KeSava a man obtains the same rewards that one got in 
fcrta-attga by deep meditation, in Treta by performing sacrifices 
and in Dvapara by worship (of images) The Matsya says: 
The great sages do not commend sacrifices which involve killing 
(of animals); those whose wealth is tapas became firmly placed 
in heaven by making gifts, according to their means, of particles 
of grains (collected from fields &o ), roots, fruits, vegetables and 
water vessels and that tapas iB superior for (several) reasons to 
sacrifices The Padmapurana reaches the peak of exaggeration 
when it says 'no one except Hari will be able to recount the 
merit of him who offers a lamp on the day of Hari in Kartika 
with devotion' or 'Visnuvrata is the highest, a hundred solemn 
Vedic sacrifices are not equal to it'. The Skandapurana 112 (quoted 
by Hemadri on vrata vol L pp. 318-321 ) contains a long eulogy 
of vrata, one verse of which may be cited here 'Gods attained 
their position through restrictive observances (vratas); they 
shine forth as stars by virtue of the vratas (they performed)'. 

There were certain differences between Vedio sacrifices and 
vratas The promised reward of most sacrifices was heaven, 
. while PorSnas promised that most vratas would confer tangible 
benefits in this very life. lurfher, vratas could be performed by 
all, including sadraa, maidens, married women, widows, even 
prostitutes

46 History of DJiarmaiastra [Sec I, Oh. IE 

vratas (in the medieval sense) existed even in the first centuries 
before and after the Christian era follows from the Ap Dh S and 
from the dramas of Kalidasa, from the Mrcohakatika and the 
Batnavali The Ap Dh S H. 8 18 prescribes a vrata for one year 
which is equal m its merit to brahmaoarivrata for 48 years and 
Ap Dh S JL 8 18-19 to Ap Dh S H. 8 20 presoribe two modes 
of a vrata to be begun on Tisya (Pusya) naksatra to be observed 
by a person desirous of prosperity Vide S B 3D vol JL pp 145- 
148 Hemadri (vrata II p 628 quotes Ap Dh S H 8. 20 3-9), 
explains the sutras and calls this Apastambokta Pusyavrata 

In the SSkuntala (Act II) the dowager queen (mother of 

Dusyanta) sends a message that on the 4th day from fee date of 

the message her fast (vrata) would end 113 The Vikramorvaslya 

(HI) appears to refer to a vrata called in later times Eohinl- 

candrasayana-vrata (vide Hemadri voL JL pp 599-600) It 

may be noted that in the above works royal ladies are described 

as observing vratas In the Raghuvamsa KalidSsa alludes to an 

Asidhara-vrata (XDX 67) The Mrcchakatika (Act I) speaks of an 

upavasa (a vrata) called Abhirupapati which appears to have 

been somewhat like the Bhartrpraptmata described by Hemadri 

( vol L pp 1199-1200 ) The Batnavali ( Act I at end ) describes 

Madanamahotsava which reminds us of the same described in 

Hemadri (vol H pp 21-24) It appears, however, that the 

number of vratas in the first centuries of the Christian era was 

not very large Gradually, however, the number of vratas 

increased by leaps and bounds and their total number, as seen 

from the list furnished at the end of this section, would be in the 

region of one thousand One of the earliest digests on ftthis 

and astrological matters in relation to Dharmasastra is the 

Rajamartanda of king Bhoja (1st half of 11th century AD) 

It mentions only a few vratas ( about 24 ) The next important 

extant work is the Krtyakalpataru of LaksmIdhara(lsthaMot 

12th century A D ) who mentions in the vratakanda about 17S 

A comparatively later work viz the VratakSlaviveka of SulapaM 

(1375-1430 AD), which discusses thB rules about the proper 

times for observing vratas, mentions only 11 vratas Hein ^ rx s

Works on vratas 47 

about 2200 printed pages in the B L edition It deals with about 
700 vratas. This Bhows that towards the end of the thirteenth 
century, when foreign invaders had seized the larger part of India 
and were ruthlessly razing temples to the ground and converting 
by force and fraud thousands to their faith, the men of the day, 
both learned and ignorant, were expending vast intellectual 
labour and huge sums of money on vratas, pilgrimages and 
sraddhas, blissfully ignorant of and blind to the political and 
religious dangers that engulfed them all 

The vratakosa edited by M M Gopinath Kaviraja { in the 
Sarasvatfbhavana series in 1929 ) lists 1622 vratas, but that list 
is unduly Bwollen and inflated for various reasons. 114 For 
example, the Astaka-sraddhas and AnvastakS-sraddhas are 
included and have nine numbers assigned to them There are 
twelve numbers assigned to Anantavrata because it is performed 
for twelve months from Margasirsa, but Hemadri (on vrata voL II. 
pp. 667-671 ) treats it as one vrata. TTpavSsavrata is given four 
numbers, the only reference given being Hemadri (vrata) H 
p. 509 (only 1| lines from Matsya). Hemadri (vrata H. pp. 
748-52, 757 and so on) describes EkabhaMa twelve times in each 
month from Caitra to PhSlguna and then on H p 863 refers to 
him who performs Ekabhaktavrata for one year. The Vratakosa 
gives 13 separate numbers (2 for Ekabhakta and llforEka- 
bhukta, for this latter form there being no authority of Hemadri 
who calls all the 13 Ekabhaktavrata) Grabasanfci is given five 
numbers. It is unnecessary to multiply examples. If properly 
sifted the number would be much smaller than 1000. 

When a person undertakes a vrata he must see to it that he 
finishes it; for dire oonseciuences are laid down for him who 
gives it up 'through heedlessness. Chagaleya declares 115 'when 



114. It has to be remembered that several different vratas are men- 
tUnied under the same name, also that different names are given to the 
»me vrata and that some santis, ntsavas and snanas also are described in 
works on vratas

a person, having first undertaken a vrata, does not oarry it out, 
being led away by some desire, he while alive becomes ( i e. is to 
be treated as ) a oandala and after death becomes a dog'. In 
such a case where through greed, infatuation or inadvertence a 
man is guilty of breaking his vrata, he has to undergo three 
days' fast and also shave his bead and then begin the vrata (the 
remainder aco to Nirnayasindbu, the whole of it ace to Sfila- 
pani), The "Varahapurana states 'that man who undertakes a 
vrata on eksdasl day but does not, owing to foolishness, finish it, 
reaohes a very evil state'. 

Death in the midst of a vrata did not deprive the performer 
of the merit for which he began it Angiras 116 provides 'if a 
person that has begun some religious act for some benefit dies 
before the rite is finished, he secures the merit that is the reward 
( of that act ) after his death, Manu so declared*. 

No one should undertake a vrata in the midst of asauca 
(impurity on birth and death) But it is provided by the 
Visnudharmasutra 117 (22 49) that asauca does not affect the 
king in doing his royal duties, nor those undergoing a vrata in the 
carrying out of the vrata Similarly, Laghu-Visnu observes ■ in 
the case of vratas, sacrifices, marriages, in sraddha, homa, worship 
( of an image ), in japa, impurity does not affect after they are 
begun, but it affects before they are begun ( i e is an obstacle to 
beginning these after impurity) Yaj. Ill 28-39 are similar

observer of vrata) from all beings, disease, forgetfalness, the 

command of one's guru do not break a vrata provided these occur 

only once (during the period of the particular vrata). IUb 

provided by the Matsya-pui&na, Agni and Satyavrata 119 that in 

the case of women that have commenced a vrata of long duration 

there is no stoppage of the vrata if they have monthly illness in 

the midst of the vrata or they become pregnant or are delivered 

of a child and that they should get the rites performed by another 

as long as they are impure, but physical acts ( such as fasting ) 

may be done by them. There are certain other matters that do 

not affect the observance of a vrata, viz { drinking ) w water, 

( partaking of ) roots, fruits and milk and sacrificial offering, the 

desire ( or command ) of a brahmana, the order of one's guru and 

medicine. Hemadri remarks that the drinking of milk and the 

rest that follow do not affect vrata if the performer is a woman, 

a child or one who is in extreme pain. A person observing 

vrata 121 should eschew all this, viz anointing fee body or the 

head with oil, chewing tambifla, applying sandalwood paste and 

whatever else would increase physical strength or passion. 

What actions do not detract from the observance of upavasa 
will be discussed later, 

A few words about noma may be said here. Women could 
not offer homa with mantras (ManuIX.18). Homa could be 
performed for them through a priest. When no particular 
substance is specified the Wattt (offering) into fire is to be of

CHAPTER HI 

Persons entitled to engage in Vratas, objects 

desired by means of Vratas, classifications 

of Vratas and literature on Vratas, 

times for Vratas 

One important matter is that of vratadhikarinah ( persona 

entitled to engage in a vrata ). Persons of all castes including 

sadias are entitled to perform ■vratas. Devala states : l33 ' thexe is 

no doubt that (men of) all larnas are released from sins by 

observing vratas, fasts and restrictive rules of behaviour and by 

mortification (lit heating) of the body.* Women are also entitled 

to perform vratas In fact the puranas and digests prescribe 

several vratas .for women alone. Manu, Visnu Dh S and 

several purSnas provide that a woman cannot perform a separate 

sacrifice, a separate vrata or a separate fast by herself, she is 

honoured in heaven by waiting upon her husband. 12 * Visnu 

Dh. S. ( 25 16 )"* further provides that a woman who observes a 

vrata in which a fast enters while her husband is alive deprives 

her husband of his life and herself goes to hell Whatever act 

of benefit in the other world a woman does without the consent 

of her father, husband or son yields no fruit to her B6 The 

medieval digests interpreted these verses as meaning that before 

performing a vrata, a maiden has to secure the consent of her 

father, a married woman of her husband and a widow of her son 

and that with the consent of the persons specified a woman

could perform an independent vrata for herself The digests are 
supported in this view by the sfltra of Sankha-Likhita 127 that it 
is the rule for women that they should practise vratas, fasts, 
restrictive observances and worship (or sacrifices) with the con- 
sent of their husbands The Lingapurana 128 provides with the 
bidding 1 ( i e permission ) of their husbands, women should per- 
formjapa, gifts, lapas and all elsa Opinion was divided whether 
a woman could get homa performed through another About the 
incapacity of women for mantras, 139 vide Manu H, 66, IX. 18 and 
Yaj I 13 The Yyavaharamayukha following Farasara held 
that a sudra could get the homa in adoption 130 performed through 
a brahmana and that the same rules apply to women and sudras 
and therefore a woman could get a homa required in vrata per- 
formed through a brahmana Rudradhara (author of Suddhi- 
viveka) and YSoaspati held that a woman and a sudra have no 
right to perform homa with Vedio mantras The Niraayasindhu 131 
supports the Yyavaharamayukha on the question of homa m a 
vrata to be observed by a woman But it appears that Nfla- 
kantha, author of the Yyavaharamayukha, was of a different 
opinion when composing the Prayascittamayukha 133 Yide H.

maiden or other female who is impure (in monthly illness or 
otherwise) should get her vrata performed through another, but, 
whether pure or impure, she may perform bodily acts ( such as a 
fast) by herself (vide Tithitattva pp 1Z1-1%%) 

If a person is unable owing to disease or accident or the like 
to perform a vrata personally he could get it performed through 
apja&mdfct (a representative) Certain rules were laid down 
about this It is stated in the Satyasadhasrautasutra 13 * ' there is 
no pratinidhi (representative or substitute) in the case of the 
owner (the Yajcuriana), the wife, the son, the (proper ) place and 
time (for an aot ), the fire, the deity ( to be invoked such as Agni, 
Indra), a rite and a text (to be prescribed for being employed in 
a rite)'. ML religious acts are arranged in three classes, viz. 
ntfya (obligatory), naimittika (to be performed when a certain 
nimttia or occasion arises or event happens) and kamya (per- 
formed out of a desire to secure some object). Vide H. of Db, 
vol IV" pp 60-61 note 150 for further details The Trikanda- 
ntandana 13 * has the following rutes about pra&midJii in these three 
kinds of acts ' No pratinidhi ( substitute ) is allowed in the case 
of kSmya rites, a substitute is allowable in the ease of n%a 
and nahnittika rites; some recognized a substitute even in a 
kSmya rite after it iB once begun; there is no substitute for a 
mantra or the deity or the fire (Garhapatya, JShavamya or 
DaksinSgni ), a knya ( suoh as praudga ) or tivara ( the svamin or 
yajamSna); some say that a substitute is not allowed in the case 
of (a prescribed) place or time An agnthotrm can substitute, 
(if his wife is dead &o ) an image of her made of gold or kusas 
but a woman cannot proceed with a rite putting forward some

unable, after undertaking a vrata, to carry it out, be should get 
it done by a representative Such representatives are* son, wife, 
brother, husband, a sister, a pupil, purbhita (for daksraS) and 
a friend Faithinasi 135 states that a wife might carry on the 
vrata undertaken by the husband and the husband may do so for 
the wife , if both are unable a stranger may carry it out, in this 
way there is no break of vrata Katyfiyana 136 says : — one who 
observes a fast for the sake of his father or mother, brother, 
husband and particularly for his guru secures one hundred-fold 
merit, if a person observes a fast on Ekadasl in place of bis 
maternal grand-father and the like they and their representative 
each obtain the full fruit thereof. These rules about pratinidbi 
apply to men of all uarnas e7

Hemadri 13 * a passage of the Devfpurana to the effect that even 

mlecohas were authorized to perform vratas, if they had faith

Sabaras, Barbaras, Sakas, indhras and several others should

Veda, they could make offerings to their (deceased parents),

Purpose of most vralas 55 

Another remarkable matter is that the MahSbh&rata 
provides that brahmanas and ksatriyas should not engage in a 
oontinuoUB fast for more than three days and that vaisyas and 
sadras can observe a continuous fast for two days only and a 
fast for three days is not laid down for these two classes by those 
who know dkarma. Devala also has a aimjlar provision, 140 

The bulk ofthevratas practised in medieval and modern 
times are kSmya i e. performed for the purpose of securing some 
object in this world or sometimes the next world or both. Most 
of the vratas are really secular though under the garb of religion 
and, though certain disciplines (such as fast, worship and 
celibacy, truthfulness) have to be observed, breathe a frankly 
materialistic attitude; they are meant to appeal to the ordinary 
human cravings that rule the whole world. The desired objects 
are legion and it is impossible to set them out in detail Some 
idea about them may however be conveyed. The Agnipurana 
mentions diiaima (punya), progeny, wealth beauty or good 
fortune, virtues, fame, learning, long life, wealth, purity, 
enjoyment of pleasures, heaven and moksa (release from the 
round of births and deaths) as the objects to be sought by the 
observance of vratas. The Kalpataru 141 on vrata says that 
vrata is the highest means of securing the several lokas ( such as 
Brahmaloka, Sivaloka, Vaikunifca) and the enjoyment of 
pleasures and triumph; thatinKrta, Treta, Dvspara and Kali 
ages respectively kings Sujaya, Bama,Dhananjaya andVikrama 
became lords of the whole world by means of vratas, that 
Sankara declared toHariin various treatises that vrata is the 
one (supreme} observance for man, that though many observ- 
ances are laid down in each yuga they do not come up even to

dopriving a person of his proporty by wrongfully taking it, 
b;aA;wicai>/a( continence), froodom from orookodnoss or hypo- 
crisy — those nro montal vratas that load to tho satisfaction (or 
favour) of Hari; oating onco only in tho day, nakta (eating only 
onoo aftor sunset), fast (for the whole day), not bogging (L o. 
subsisting on food that ono gots without asking for il)-this is 
physical vrata for human beings ; study of tho Veda, recounting- 
(tho name of) Visnu, speaking tho truth, froodom from backbiting 
those aro vratas of spoooh. 

Anothor classification can bo basod on tho time for which 
a vrata may last, i. e. only for a day or a fortnight (paksa), a 
month, season, ai/ana (tnno of tho stay of tho Sun in tho northern 
or southoru homlsphoro), yoar, or yoars. A vrata may bo for ono 
year or for more yoars than ono or for a person's lifetime. In 
speaking of vratas porformod in a certain month, tho question 
of an intoroalary month will have to bo considorod and will bo 
dealt with in tho noxl sootion on Kala otc. Similarly, tho matter 
of tithis ooonpios a vory largo place in works on dharmossstra

Classifications of vratas 57 

in order to vSravratas (pari II pp. 520-592), naksatravratas 
(part II pp. 593-706 ), Yogavratas (part Upp. 707-717 ), Karana- 
vratas (part Upp. 718-726), Sankrantivratas (part II pp. 727- 
743), masavratas (part H pp 800-857), rtuvratas (part II pp. 
858-861), samvatsaravratas (part II pp 862-867), praklrnaka 
(miscellaneous) vratas (part II pp. 867-1002). The Krtyakalpa- 
tatu (on vrata) on the other hand begins with varavratas 
(pp. 8-4J4), then deals with tithivratas (pp. 35-398), naksatra- 
vrataa (pp. 399-417), masavratas (pp. 418-430), sankrantivratas 
(pp. 431-434), samvatsaravratas (pp. 434-451) and praklrna- 
vratas (pp 452-459). Most of the works on vrata "^ after 
dealing with some general matters begin their treatment of 
vratas with tithivratas. The Samayapradlpa has a different 
mode of treatment, viz. that it begins with Ganesavratas (i e. 
vratas in which Ganesa is the deity), then with vratas in which 
the San is the deity, then Sivavratas, Visnuvratas and so on. 
Some vratas are performed not only on a certain tithi, but also 
require the existence of a certain month or weekday or naksatra 
or aU of these Another classification may be based on the 
parsons competent to perform vratas; most vratas are meant for 
all men and women; some like Haritalika and VatasSvitrl 
are meant for women alone, some are to be performed by 
men alone; while there are others to be performed only by kings 
or ksatriyas or by vaisyas. 

^ There is an immense literature on vratas. There is no 
topic of Dharmasastra except probably that of tirthayatrS and of 
sraddha on which the Purgnas wax so eloquent as on vrata. 
Some of the Puranas contain thousands of verses on vrata For 
example, the Brahmaparva of 1ihe Bhavisyapurana (in chapters 
16-216) contains over 7500 verses and the Uttarakhanda of the 
samePur&na over five thousand verses on vratas; the Matsya- 
putana (chapters 54-32 and 95-101) has about 1230 verses on 
vrata (most of whioh occur in the FadmapurSna V chap. 20 ff) 
the Varahapurana (chap 39-65) spends about 700 verses and the' 
Vwnudharmottara about 1600 verses on vrataa On a modest 
calculation the Puranas contain about twenty-five ihousand 
verses at least on vratas. It is difficult to draw a strict line 
between vratas and utsavas, what are called utsavas have also 
an element of religious rites and conversely many vratas have 
some element of being a festival In this work I have included

several observances which some people may regard as purely 
utsavas and not vratas at all 

The topic of vratas is rather inextricably mixed up with 
discussions on KSla and tithi The mbandhas ( commentaries and 
digests) on vratas are numerous In this section I shall mention 
works that deal with vratas alone or with vratas in relation to 
Mhis, but not works on kala in general and muhiirta This is 
rather an arbitrary arrangement and it is possible that there 
would be some repetition and overlapping A verse in the 
Kalaviveka of Jlmutavahana names seven predecessors that 
had expounded kala in relation to religious rites, viz Jitendriya, 
Sankhadhara, Andhuka, Sambhrama, Harivamsa and Yogloka. 
Some of these writers must have been earlier than the first half 
of the 11th century A D as in the Malamasatattva Baghu- 
nandana states that Andhukabhatta mentions in his work how 
in sake 955 (1033-34 A. D.) there was on Amavasya Tula- 
sankranti and the Vrscikasankranti on the pratipad and again 
on Amavasya Dhanus-sankranti This establishes that Andhuka- 
bhatta wrote his works about 1035 A D. But the works of all 
those seven writers on kala have not yet been discovered. Two 
other works ascribed to king Bhoja of Dhara 143 dealt among 
other matters with kala and vratas (in the 2nd quarter of the 
11th century) One of them, the Bajamartanda, is available in 
Mss and, besides expounding the astrological significance of 
tithis, week days, naksatras, Yogas, deals (in verses 1188-1892 
and 1327-1405) with several vratas and the proper times for them 
viz. EkadasI, Saptamyarkavrata, AgastySrgbyadana, Sravana- 
dvfidasl, BohinyastamI, HaritSlI-caturthl, Durgotsava, Kauja- 
gara, PretacaturdasI, Sukharatri, BhrStr-dvitlya, DlpadSna, 
Kartikasnana, MaghasnSna, MaghasaptamI, BhismastamI, 
FusyadvSdasI, Aiokastaml, OaitrSvalt, Savitrlvrata, PSsanaca- 
turthl, AranyasasthT, Dasabara, SankrantL The Bajamartanda 
has^ro&at tfar as I know yet been published, though hundreds of 
tfh'e largest rom are quoted in the medieval digests It is at 
jhat HPrthe earliest extant work of a nibandha form treating of 
Akias. Another work dealing with vratas and ascribed to Bhoja 
is the one cited as BhupSla-samuccaya or BhupSla-krtya- 
samuccaya, or Krtyasamuccaya on vra'ai, dams &o This

last work has not yet been unearthed and is found quoted in 
such medieval digests as the Ertyaratnakara 

Apart from the Vedio Literature, sutra3, epics, PurSnas and 
Bajamartanda, I mainly rely in this section on vratas on the 
following works (those that I consulted in ma form being 
expressly indicated and the works being arranged in chrono- 
logical order as far as possible) : Krtyakalpataru (portion on 
vratas) of Laksmldhaxa; Ealaviveka of JTmutavahana; 
Hemadri's Caturvargaointamani (on vrata); Samayapradlpa of 
Srldatta (ms); Ertyaratnakara of Candesvara; EaladarSa of 
Sdityasuri (ms), Ealanirnaya or Eala-madhava and Eala- 
niinayakaiiks.; Tithiviveka, Yratakalaviveka and Durgotsava- 
viveka of Sulap&ni; Nixnayamrta of AllSdanatha; Yarsakriya- 
kaumudl of Govindknanda; Ealasaraof GadSdhara; the Tithi- 
tattva, Eksdasltattva, Janmastamltattva, DurgSrcanapaddhati, 
Ertyatattra and Yratatattva of Baghunandana, YxataprakSsa 
(part of Vlramitrodaya) of Mitramisra (ms. from Anupa Sanskrit 
Library) and SamayapxakSsa Cpart of Vlramitrodaya), Samaya- 
mayukha or Ealamayukha of Hiflakantha; VratSrka of 
&ankarabhatta (ms ) ; Tithyarka of DivSkara; Dasanirnaya *** of 
Hailta Venkatanatha; Vxatodyapana-kaumudl of Sankara- 
bhatta GhSxe ; Vrataxaja of Visvanatha ; Puxusarthacintamani of 
Visroibhatta; Ahalya-kamadhenu (ms in Scindia Oriental Insti- 
tute, 1767-1771 AD ), Dharmasindhu of Easlnatha Of these the 
most important fox vxatas axe Ertyakalpataru (from which even 
Hemadri, and Ertyaratnakara borrow many passages), Hemadri 
on vrata, Ealanirnaya of Madhava, Ertyaratnakara, Vaxsakriya- 
kaumudl, the works of Baghunandana and the Nirnaya-sindhu. 
Works like Vratarka and YratarUja, though exhaustive, borrow 
verbatim long passages from Hemadri and others The treatment 
of vratas in several of the above-mentioned works is often 
uneven; for example, the Yarsakriyakaumudl disposes of the 
observances of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd tithis in two pages (28-30), 
while it devotes twenty-two pages to Ekada& (pp 42-64). 

It must be emphasized here that this section is concerned 
with the vratas described ox mentioned in works on Dharmasaslra. 
Even so the number of vratas is extremely large. No attempt 
is made hereto include all vratas observed by women or by

primitive tribes or by the illiterate people all over India or con- 
tained in -works written m the several regional languages sudh 
as Bengali, Hindi or Marathi The inclusion of such observ- 
ances would entail an enormous amount of labour, would expand 
the work to huge proportions and would be beyond the proper scope 
of the History of Dharmssasfcra further, to tabulate all the vratas 
and festivals of all common people and to study the folk life of 
villagers, forest-dwellers and mountain inhabitants in the States 
of the continent of India would be beyond the oapaoity of a 
single worker and would require the co-operative effort of a large 
team of workers spread over years When done, that work would 
be a monumental one on the social anthropology of India In 
this connection I may mention Prof B. K Sarkar's work 'Folk 
element m Hindu culture' and the paper on 'a study of vrata 
rlteB in Bengal* contributed by Mr S. B Das 145 to 'Man in India* 
(1952) vol. 32, pp 207-245. Some writers have already published 
works dealing with the observances of common people such as 
Mrs Stevenson's 'Bites of the twice-born', Underbill's 'Hindu 
religious year', B A. Gupte's 'Hindu holidays and ceremonials', 
R.C Mukerj's * Ancient Indian fasts and feasts', Mr. Bigvedi's 
Marathi work on 'History of Aryan festivals' (ed of 1984) In 
these books (except in the last and rarely in Underbill's) texts 
from Dharmasasfcra are generally conspicuous by their absence. 

Times for beginning Vratas ■• Apart from the vratas that 
have to be performed on certain fixed tithis or times, elaborate 
provisions are made that vrataB in general and several other 
religious rites axe to be begun only at certain auspicious times 
or in certain astrological conditions A few of these are Bet out 



145. It should not, however, be supposed that I agree with all the 
propositions in the above two. for example, the meaning which Mr. S R. 
Das assigns to Laksmi in Rg X 71.8 {viz. beauty) is not acceptable to 
me. I hold that ' LakimI ' there also is the opposite of alaksmi as the word 
•bhadra' applied to Laksml suggests and as in Rg. X. 1SS 1 the idea of 
alaksmi is clearly conveyed. I do not subscribe to the view that the idea of a 
malignant spirit was unknown to the poets of Rgveda times and that they 
had to go to the aboriginal people for that idea. Note the verses srar WWW

Alaksmi. 



Proper times for vrdlas 61 

here by way of sample. Gsrgya 146 says 'when Jupiter and Venus 
have set (i. e. are not observable owing to their being near 
the Sun in the sky) or when they are in the Btage of being 
called bala and vrddlia and in an intercalary month one should 
not begin a vrata nor perform its udyapana (the rite of closing 
a vrata).' The childhood of Jupiter and Venus is a certain period 
after they set and senility (orddhaiva or vurdhaka) is a certain 
period preceding their setting There is no unanimity on the 
length of these periods and the periods differ in different countries 
and also depend on whether there is a season of distress or 
difficulty, but Var&hamihira 147 states the longest provided should 
be accepted The RajamSxtanda has several verses on this, one 
of which maybe set out here: Venus 148 is bala for ten days 
when it rises in the west, but is bala for three days after rising 
in the east; Venus isvrddha foronepaksa (15 days) when it 
rises in the east, but is vrddha for five days before it sets in the 
west. Gargya observes: 149 Venus and Jupiter are (held to be 
bila) in the Vindhyas whether in the east or west for ten days, 
but for seven days in the country of Avanti (of which TJn'ayinl 
was capital), in the country of Vanga (Bengal) and among 
Hunas (they are bala) respectively for six and five days. It is 
farther provided in the 150 Devlpur&na that one should not under- 
take any religious act when Jupiter or Venus is in the sign of the 
Lion. Similarly, Lalla 151 remarks that all (religious) actions are

condemned when done in what is called Gurvaditya (that is when 
the sun is in the house of Jupiter viz sign of Pisces and when 
Jupiter is in the house of the Sun, viz Lion) TheVrataraja 
remarks that one is to avoid Jupiter in the Lion sign for religi- 
ous acts only to the north of the Harmada and elsewhere only in 
Simhamsa (i e the first quarter of the naksatraPurvS-phalgunl). 
The BatnamSla 152 provides that Monday, Wednesday, Thursday 
and Friday are auspicious (confer success) in all (religious) acts, 
but on Sunday, Tuesday and Saturday only such actions succeed 
as are expressly prescribed for performance on those days. 
Bhujabala remarks that Tuesday is unfavourable for all 
auspicious acts hut that it is commended for agriculture, study 
(of the Samaveda) and for battles m 

The philosophical discussions on Time and on its division 
into year, wjcma (the Sun's apparent motion in the two regions 
of the celestial sphere), flus (seasons), xnasa (month), paksa 
(half month,) week, days &o will be taken up in the next section. 
But the exact determination of the question as to the day on 
which a Itthivraia is to be performed when the ttthi spreads over 
two days occupies a very large space in works on dharmasastra 

The word ttthi by itself does not occur in the Rgreda and 
the other Yedio Samhitas But the idea must have been there 
even in the Rgveda Amavasya is explained in later works as 
being of two kinds, viz. Sinlvall (day on which amavasya is 
mixed with the 14th tiihi) and Kuhu (when amavasya is mixed 
with the first tithi of the next fortnight) Similarly, Paurna- 
mSsI is of two kinds, Anumati (mixed with the 14th tithi) and 
Baka (mixed with the Pralipad of the next paksa) In the 
Pgveda Sinlvall is 13 raised to the position of a divinity, is 
described as the sister of the gods, offerings are made to her and 
she is implored to bestow progeny on the worshippers The 
Br. Up YL 4 21 implores Sinlvall and the Asvins to implant an

Bgveda (H. 32. 4-5=Atharva VII. 48. 1-2). Eg X 59. 6 and 

X 167. 3 treat Anumati as a deity, prayers are offered to her 

to enable the worshippers to see the Sun going up and to bestow 

happiness and she is spoken of in the same breath with Soma, 

Varuna and Brhaspati The Vaj. S. prays 1 * 'May Anumati 

approve to-day of our sacrifice'. It should be noted that the 

Nirukta (XL 29) holds 157 a discussion on Anumati and Eaka, viz. 

the STairuktas (etymologists) say that Anumati and Raka are 

goddesses (wives of gods), while the Yajnikas hold that they 

are two kinds of PaurnamasI; it is known (in Sruti) that the first 

PaurnamasI is Anumati and the later is Raka Similarly, the 

Nirukta holds a discussion on Sinivali and Xuhu (XL 31) The 

Atharvaveda (VXll. 3) mentions Prajapati, Anumati and 

Sinivali together. The word KuhQ occurs in the Atharvaveda 

and is applied to a deity that is invoked to come to the sacrifice 

and to bestow on the worshipper wealth and a heroic son. In 

the Tai S I 8 8. 1 and Sat. Br. IX 5. 1. 38 mention is made of 

these four, viz of Anumati, Raka, Sinivali and Kuhu, as 

recipients of caru (oblation of boiled rice) How these names 

were coined in the distant past is an insoluble riddle Anumati 

oan he derived from root man, but why the tithi of the lull Moon 

mixed with the 14th tithi was so called is more than anyone 

can say. Kuhu may be plausibly derived from latha 'where' (as 

in Rg. I 24 10, X 40 2) as the day when the moon is invisible 

and when primitive people asked in wonder the question ' where 

does the moon go'. But Raka and. Sinivali defy attempts at 

any plausible etymology. Eminent philologists, instead of

that day (but would be visible the next day) Another tithi 
that is famous in the Vedio Literature is Astaka 161 (8th tithi after 
the full moon in any month, but particularly in Magha) on which 
offerings were made to thepitrs (departed ancestors) Even in 
very remote times people could have easily marked the four main 
phases of the moon, viz Full Moon, half moon ( 8fih day there- 
after when half of the moon's orb shines), Moon's total absence 
and 8th day thereafter; and after noting these phases it must 
not have been very difficult to make close calculations about the 
periods intervening between the Eull moon and the half moon, 
the New moon and half moon. As a matter of fact the Tai Br ia 
expressly says that the moon is worn away on the 15th and 
becomes full on the 15th i e. before the Tai Br. it was well- 
known that there were 30 lunar days (tithis) in a lunar month. 
It is stated in the Sat Br 163 'the joints of Prajapati, while he 
was engaged in creating beings, became loose (or collapsed); the 
samvatsara is indeed Prajapati and the joints of it (of 
samvatsara) are the two junctions of day and night, PaurnamasI, 
AmavSsyS and the beginnings (first days) of the seasons'. The 
words PaurnamasI and AmavSsya occur very frequently in the 
Atharvaveda, the Tai S and other Vedic texts, though the two 
words do not occur in the Rgveda The Atharvaveda says 161 that 
PaurnamasI was the first among days and nights and was worthy 
of sacrifice The Ait. Br. vs has an interesting passage: "they

66 History of Dhattnaiasti a [ Seo, I, Ch. HI 

(wise men) say that when a sacrifioer dwells near his saorifioial 
fire, that is due to his thought that the gods will partake of his 
offerings, since they do not eat the offering of a sacrlficer who 
does not abide by certain observances'. The opinion of the sage 
Paingi is that the sacrifioer should stay near his saorifioial fires 
(or fast) on the previous PaurnaniasI (i o. PauraamSsI mixed 
with 14th), while the opinion of Kausltaki is that he should do 
so on the later one (i e the PaurnamfisI mixed with prahpad). 
The previous PaurnamSBl is called Anumati, the later one is 
oalled Raka, while the previous Amavasya is oalled SinlvSll and 
the later one is called Kuhu That is the tithi (on which a religi- 
ous rite should be performed), it is the one, being associated with 
which the sun sets and the sun rises." This passage shows that 
differences of opinion had arisen long before the time of the Ait 
Br as to on what day a particular rite associated with a certain 
fixed tithi was to be performed when the tithi was spread over 
two days. There are references in Tai S. and the BrShmana 
literature which show that in those ancient days the duration 
of tithis and therefore the actual position of the moon could not 
sometimes be very accurately determined beforehand. A man 
about to perform an istion New Moon (dartesh) does certain 
acts that are done on the day previous to amavdsya such as using 
the sour curds from last night's milking for coagulating the sacri- 
ficial food (i. e milk), separating the calves from the cows in 
the afternoon xnthapalSiaiwig; and taking some husked rioe, 
he thinks, owing to cloudy weather or through miscalculation, 
that the moon would not be seen in the sky the next morning, 
does not actually set apart a few handfuls of husked rice 
(meant as mrvapa for the gods) or sets them apart, then the next 
day the moon is seen m the sky (i e the next day is really 14th 
tithi instead of amav&sya) It is then prescribed that he has to 
perform an expiatory rite oalled Abhyuditesti Vide Tai S.

Word titki in andera Literature 6? 

The word tithi does not occur in the Saihhifcas, but it occurs 
in the Ait Br cited above and in the gchya and dhanna 
sutraa. 

The Gobhilagrhyasutra U7 when prescribing, a day for the 
setting up of sacred fires mentions the coincidence of an auspici- 
ous tithi and naksatra and in another place refers to the worship 
of the lord of the tithi and of the naksatra and of the tithi itself. 
The Kausltaki-grhya (L 25) speaks of offerings to the tithi on 
which a ohild was born and prescribes that the dedication of 
ponds, wells and tanks was to be made in the bright half of a 
month and on an auspicious tithi (V. 2). 

The Nirukta 1 * 8 while deriving the word atitht applied to 
Agni in ?g Y. 4. 5 gives two explanations, one of which is 'one 
who approaches the houses of others on special Mhts', Panini 
furnishes no sutra relating to the word tttht, but it is possible to 
argue that the affix titha which he mentions in explaining words 
like 'bahutitha' 1 ® was a relic of the word tithi. PataBjali 
expressly mentioned PaurnamSsI tithi. Vide 'India Antigua', 
the volume of studies presented to Dr. J. Ph. Vogel pp. 109-112 
for Prof Edgerton's paper on affix 'titha'. Erom the above 
discussion it would be clear that the ideas and divergences of 
views about the proper tithis for certain religious acts existed in 
the Vedic times (at least before Ait Br.) three thousand years

ago and that the word tithi itself muBt be held to have been in 
use about 800 B. , if not earlier still 1 ™ 

Tithi is denned as the time or period roguired by the moon to 
gain twelve degrees on the sun As the SuryasiddhSnta states 
'tifcbi is tho lunar day in which the moon leaving the sun (at the 
last moment of Amd.vS.sy3.), traverses twelve degrees (bhagas) 
towards the east every day.* 171 The moon's motion is irregular 
and therefore the moon traverses twelve degrees sometimes in 
60 ghatikas, sometimes in more (np to about 65) and sometimes 
in less ghatikas up to about 54 The result is that one unit day 
may be co-terminous with one tithi, but often a unit day has 
two tithis i e in the morning it may be the 6th tithi, but in the 
afternoon, evening and night it may be the 7th It is possible 
that m a single civil day (from sunrise to sunrise) there may ha 
three tithis e g. on Monday morning there may be only two 
ghatikas left of the 6th tithi, then the 7th tithi may be only 56 
ghatikfis in duration and then the 8th may follow for the last 
two ghatikas of that unit day Conversely, a single tithi may 
touch three days For example, the last two ghatikas of Monday 
may be the first two ghatikas of the 6th tithi, then the 60 
ghatikSs of Tuesday may be occupied by the 6th tithi and two 
more ghatikas (the last) of the 6th tithi may spread on to 
Wednesday morning A unit day which spreads over three 
tithis is declared by the EajamSrtanda to be very holy 1 " (or 
auspicious), while on the other hand a tithi touching three days 
is said to be inauspicious for marriage, for marching on an

advance prosperity. 173 If a tithi begins immediately befoie 
sunrise or its beginning coincides with sunrise and ends after 
the following sunrise the name of the titbi (as pratipad, dvitlys 
or so on as the case may be) is coupled with both divasas ( civil 
days) involved, bo that twotithis of the same denomination 
appear one after another This is called vrddhi of the particular 
tithi. If a tithi begins sometime after sunrise on one morning 
and ends before sunrise on the following day it cannot be 
coupled with any day and is therefore deleted or omitted in the 
panoanga (almanac) and there is htbirkaaya. As a tithi is 
normally shorter than the oivil day ksaya occurs more frequently 
than vrddhi. 

Irom the words of the G-obhilagrhya quoted above it follows 
that long before the days of that work the several tithis were 
deemed to have certain deities as their lords (or presiding 
deities) Among the earliest extant enumerations about 
tithtpatts (lords of tithis) is that in the Brhatsamhita of VaTSha- 
mihira (chap. 98. 1-2) which sets them 17 * out as follows (the 
tithis and their lords being mentioned in order) :-lst Brahma, 
2nd Brahma, 3rd Hari, 4th Yama, 5th the moon, 6th Kartikeya, 
7thlndra, 8thVasue, 9th Nagas, 10th Dharma, 11th Siva, 12th 
Savitr, 13th Madana, 14th Kali, 15th Visvedevas and of 
AmavSSya the pitrs. He further says that one should do on those 
tithis the acts that are appropriate to the lords of those tithis It 
appears that other writers differed somewhat from YarShamihira, 
e. g the BatnamalS setB 17S out the lords of tithis according to 
the Pursnas as follows .-1st Agni, 2nd Brahma, 3rd Girija, 4th 
Ganesa, 5th NSga, 6th Visakha ( Skanda), 7th the Sun, 8th Siva, 
9th DurgS, 10th Tama, 11th Vismi, 18th Hari, 13th Madana, 
14th Siva, 15th the Moon. The Skandapurana (1. 1. 33. 78-88)

and 14th to Siva, 4th to Ganesa, 9th to CandikS The Garuda 
t 1*1 }9~ 19) aod Narada-puraDa (I 56 133-135) specify 
wbat deities are to be worshipped on the tithis from the first to 
15th 

Varahamihira divides tithis into five 1 ™ groups, viz Nands 
BhadrS, Vijaya or Jaya, Rikta and Puma and states that on 
those tithis the acts that are appropriate or suited to the lords of 
the tithis should be done and become crowned with success and 
the fruits of actions done on these five classes of tithis yield 
results similar to their names The same applies to Imams 
and muhnrtas The result is Wanda tithis are 1st, 6th, 11th; 
Bhadras are 2nd, 7th, 12th; Vijayas 3rd, 8th, 13th, Biktas are 
4th, 9th and 14th; Pfirnas are 5th, 10th, 15th. This is also 
brought out in the itharvana Jyotisa, which also prescribes 
what should be done or not done on the tithis from the 1st to the 
15th and provides that certain combinations of tithis and certain 
weekdays yield success and all rewards, viz Wanda tithi on 
JHday, Bhadra on Wednesday, Jaya on Tuesday, Rikta on 
Saturday, and Puma on Thursday. 

The Tithitattva (pp 27-28) quotes a long passage specifying 
the lo3s a man suffers by eating fifteen specified things from the 
1st to the 15th tithi respectively. The Wirnayasindhu (p 32) 
quotes verses from Muhurta-dlpika and Bhupala 177 (i e Bhojaj 
which specify the edibles and certain actions that are respec- 
tively to be given up on the tithis from the first to the 15th and 
on amavfisya On the other hand, BhavisyapurSna (Brahmaparva 
16. 18-20) quoted by the Ealpataru on vratap 35 specially 
recommends the eating of certain things on each of the 15 tithis 
from prattpad (the first) viz milk, flowers (on 2nd), anything

boiled in milk), cow's urine, yavas, water in which kusas have 
been dipped. The VSmanapuraua 178 (14 48-51) prescribes what 
aotions should not be done on the groups of tithis called Rands 
&a, on certain week days and on certain naksatras. 

The method of reckoning time by tithis is a very early one 
and is indigenous to India Though Western scholars have from 
time to time put forward various theories about the so-called 
Greek influence on Indian astronomy and astrology and about 
the Indian Maksatra system being borrowed from the Chinese 
(Biot) or from the Babylonians ( Weber ) or from the Arabs 
(Sedillot), no western soholar has had the oourage, so far as I 
know, of alleging that the system of tithis is not Indigenous but 
is borrowed from some non-Indian source. The theories about 
Greek influence will be briefly dealt with in the next section. 

Vedic (andSmrti) injunctions are of two kinds, (1) those 
that urge a person to do a thing such as 'one should fast on 
Ek&daslin bothpaksas', (2) those that dissuade a person from 
doing something as in 'one should not eat food on Eksdasl*. 
Tithis are thus an ahga of the two kinds of injunctions. Accord- 
ing to GaTga," 9 tithi, naksatra and vara (week day) are a means 
of puitya (merit) and papa (demerit, sin) by being subsidiary to 
the principal rite prescribed, but they are not able to produce the 
above result independently 180

rise for sixty nadikas (or ghatikas) the tithi is puma, i e.the 
tithi begins exactly at sunrise and ends with the next sunrise 
and is exactly 60 ghatikas in extent. All others than this are 
Bakbanda, these latter again are of two kinds suddha and viddha 
(pierced by or intermixed with another). 182 A suddha tithi is one 
that extends from sunrise to sunset or (m the case of some tithis 
like sivaratrz) up till midnight; other sakhanda tithis are called 
viddha. Vedha is of two kinds, morning vedha and evening 
vedha; the former generally occurs when after six ghatikas from 
sunrise a tithi touches or gets merged with the next tithi, while 
the latter (evening vedha) generally occurs when a tithi touches 
another tithi six ghatikas before sunset In the case of certain 
tithis the period prescribed may exceed six ghatikas 

When the tithi in question is 60 ghatikas in extent and 
begins with sunrise (i e when it is puma) there is no difficulty 
at all When a tithi is suddha m the sense given by the 
Dharmasindhu then also there is generally no difficulty. Some 
general rules have to be kept in mind. Srati says 183 'forenoon 
is for the gods, midday for men and afternoon for pitrs '. Manu 
(IV. 159) Bays one should carry out morning duties, decorating 
the body, bath, brushing the teeth, applying collyrium to the 
eyes and worship of gods in forenoon alone'. Therefore all 
religious acts prescribed for being performed by day on certain 
tithis for gods most be begun in the morning even if the tithi is 
mixed with another on that day, but all vratas to be performed 
in the evening or night have to be performed on the tithi exist- 
ing in the evening or night even 181 though it may be mixed up 
(viddha) with another tithi Another matter to be noted is that 
in both halves of the month all tithis may affect the previous 
tithi and following tithi by three muhurtas (i e six nadls or 
ghatikas) 185 Some tithis produce vedha by a larger number of

ghatikas e. g. the 5th makes sasthl affected by twelve ngdla, 
10th makes 11th viddhaby 15 naals, &c.Viddh& titbis are in 
some cases fit for performing religious acts, sometimes they are 
not All rites 186 of the srauta or smarta type, vrata, dana and 
every other act enjoined by the Veda do not yield proper 
reward as long as there is no determination of the tithi proper 
for it. That tithi which covers up the time (such as morning), 
noon, whole day &c at which a religious act is prescribed to be 
done is the proper one for 187 that act. The first principle to 1BB 
remember is that Kala (the time prescribed for a rite) is not a 
mere detail, but it is a nimitta (an occasion) on the happening of 
which a rite is to be performed and that therefore what is done 
at some time other than the prescribed one is practically as good 
as not done. There is a text of the Tai. S. EL 2. 5. 4 which 
indicates this principle about Kala It says * that man is cut 
off from the heavenly world, who desiring to perform the daria- 
puinamasa rites transgresses the time of full Moon or New 
Moon'. Hemadri 189 strongly emphasizes the performance of rites

on the proper time and states that a gaunakala is resorted to 

for escaping from the censure of ststas or for the solace of one's 

mind or because there is no other alternative If a tithi can be 

had on two days and at the required time or if it does not exist 

on both days at the time required or it extends only up to a part 

of the time for -which it is required, then the decision is arrived 

at, as a general rule, by what is called ' yugmavakya' to be cited 

Wow MB Suppose, for example, that a vrata is to be performed 

at noon on a certain tithi, then that tithi may exist at noon on two 

days or suppose that the tathi begins one or two ghatikSs after 

noon and ends on the next day one or two ghatikas before noon, 

then the deoision as to which tithi (whether pHrui-tnddhS or 

pararviddha) is proper for the act would have to be decided as a 

general rule by the Yugmavakya The Yugmavakya maybe 

translated as follows. 'The pairs (or combinations) of the 

following tithis lead to great reward, viz. of the 2nd and 3rd 

tifihis, of the 4th and 5th, of the 6th and 7th, of the 8th and 9th, 

of the 11th and 12th, of the 14th with purnims (Full moon tithi) 

and of Amavasya with the 1st the reverse (l e combinations or 

pairs of other tithis) results in great loss, such combinations 

destroy all former (aooumulated) merit' In these verses there 

are seven pairs and they are mutually applicable The question 

may be asked . on what tithi a vrata prescribed for the 2nd tithi 

should be performed if the 2nd is combined with the first on one 

day (that is, it is punautddha) and is also combined with the 3rd 

on the next day (i e it is paramddhU) The reply is as a general 

rule the day on which the 2nd is combined with the 3rd tithi 

should be the proper one for the dvitlyavrata and not the day on 

which 2nd tithi is combined with the first Similarly, in the 

case of a vrata to be performed on trtiya, if the 3rd tithi occurs 

on one civil day combined with the 2nd and on the next day it 

is combined with the 4th, then the proper day as a general rule 

for a trtiya-vrata is the one on which the 2nd and 3rd tithis are 

in combination and not the other day on whioh the 3rd and 4th 

tithis combine The result of this passage fe that c^tanatoons 

of 1st and 2nd tithi, of the 3rd and 4th, of 5th and 6th, of 7th 

and 8th, of the 9th and 10th, of the 10th and 11th, of 12th and

13th, of 13th and 14th, of FOrnimS with the first and of 
Amavasya' with 14th are generally excluded as improper. 191 

It may be stated here that the rules laid down in the above 
verses (of yugmavakya) are riddled with exceptions. Some say 
that these rules apply only to tithis of the bright half and not to 
those of the dark half. But many works such as Apararka 
(p. 216), Kslanirnaya (p 172), Vratakalaviveka (P.O.voL TO. 
p 87), Nirnayasindhu (p 18) hold that the passage applies to 
tithis of the daik half also, since the express mention of 
Amavasya in combination with prahpad is an indication in 
that direction It would be noticed that the yugmatafoja (even 
though held to be applicable to the dark half) does not refer to 
the first tithi of the dark half, the 10th and 13th tithis of both 
halves Their combinations with the preceding or following 
tithis will be governed by express texts where available and by 
other considerations in other case3, such as the verse ' in the 
bright half that tithi should be preferred which exists at the time 
the sun rises and, in the dark half, that tithi should be preferred 
which exists when the sun sets' 192 Another important rule is 
that where there are express texts prescribing a particular com- 
bination of viddha tithis as more appropriate for a vrata or other

religious rite, that express rule prevails and not the role derived 
from this yugmavakya 193 For example, it is laid down in the 
very place (where the yugmavakya occurs) that the 6th tithi, 8th 
tithi, amSvSsys and the 13th of the dark half are to be preferred 
(for religious rites) when in combination with the following 
tithis (i a 7th, 9th, 1st of bright half and 14th of dark half 
respectively) and others (than those mentioned in the first half 
such as the 7th, 9th) are to be preferred when combined with 
those preceding them. 191 The application of special considera- 
tions may be further illustrated by the following The same 
tithi may be preferred if put laoiddha in one vrata and as para- 
viddha in other oases owing to the difference in the deities of the 
vratas. For example, Skandasasfbl is preferred as pQrvaviddhS, 
but MandSrasasthI is preferred as paraviddhS (because the deity is 
MandSra and not Skanda) Sometimes, although the devats is the 
Bame, it will have to be pOrvaviddha and sometimes paraviddhS 
as in the Vinayaka-vrata which requires mid-day as the proper 
time. If the 4th exists at midday and then is mixed up with 
5th, but did not exist at midday the previous day, then 4th 
mixed with 5th will be preferred, but if mixed with the 3rd 
before noon and not mixed with 5th at time of midday, 4th 
mixed with third will be preferred Sometimes it depends on the 
fact whether it is bright or dark fortnight Sukla pratipad will 
be preferred if pflrvaviddha, but krsna pratipad will be pre- 
ferred as uttaraviddha The rites for pttrs are not governed by 
yugma-vakya The grhyarparisista provides that the pitas 
attend on that tithi which exists at the tune when the sun sets ; 
that tithi and afternoon are assigned for the pitrs by Brahma 
himself 195 Sometimes even a combination not approved by 
vugmavSkyahastobe accepted for the performance of a rite 
e. g when astaml with BohinI naksatra exists (in Ersnajanma- 
-reata) the fast should be observed on that Astaml, though it may 
be combined with 7th tithi (and not on 9th as yugmavfikya

Exceptions to yugmavakya W 

requires J.* 94 Sometimes, even though a tithi he purna, it is 
passed over in favour of a viddha one. 197 Suppose there is 
EkadasI in the bright half from sunrise to sunrise on a certain 
day and there is EkadasI on the next day for two ghatikas, then 
there is Dradasl for 59 ghatikas in extent ; thus trayodasl comm- 
ences the day after just one ghatika after sunrise. According to 
this verse of Pracetas there is to be no upavasa on the EkadasI, 
though it iB puma, but the fast will be observed on DvadasI, 
and the parana in order to be celebrated on dvadasl will have to 
be during the first ghatika of the third day from ekadasl or 
earlier. But if the DvadasI in this case be only for 55 ghatikas, 
trayodasl will begin three ghatikas before sunrise; if parana be 
done at sunrise it will be on the 13th and not on the 12th. In 
this latter case, according to Pracetas, the Upavasa will have to 
be on the purna EkadasI in order that the parana may be on 
12th It has to be further remembered that the positive prescrip- 
tion about celebrating a vrata or the like on the fixed tithi is 
governed by the yugmavakya, but the rules forbidding the 
partaking of oil, meat or the like on the fixed tithi apply for the 
whole of that day 198 and that tithi, whether it is 65 ghatikas and 
extends over three days or is only 55 ghatikas and extends 
over two days only. Por explaining the words 'eka- 
dasyam niraharah' from Varaha-purana ( 39. 32 ) the EkadasI- 
tattva (pp. 3-4) states that one is to fast not merely for 
the time that the EkadasI lasts on a week-day but for the whole 
of the week day on which EkadasI falls and it applies the reason- 
ing contained in Jai YX 2 19-20 (called Kalaftjadhikarana). 
If the vrata is such that some items in it are to be done by day 
and some at night, then that vrata must be observed on that 
tithi which exists by day as well as at night and in such a case

the yugmavakya has no application Vide p 72 and note 184 
above. In certain cases where the vrata has several items extend- 
ing over the whole day or a large part of it, the tithi at the time 
of sunrise even if it be only for a ghafrka is declared by some 
texts to be sakala ( purna ) for purposes of both gifts and 
vratas. 19 ' 

The Kaladarsa propounds the strange 200 theory based on 
Gobhila's words that the shortening and lengthening of the tifchis 
is due to the piety and sinfulness of men and divides tifchis into 
hhwia (of proper extent, GO gbatikss), darpa (more extensive 
than 60 gbatikas) and htn,sru or hrntiS (of lesser extent than 60 
gbatikas) The Rljamartanda has the same 201 division and 
remarks that when the tithi is either Miaroa or darpa (and they 
are viddha) then a rite is to be done on the later tithi (the proper 
tithi joined to tho next one) and in the case of the shorter tithi 
(if it is viddha) one should prefer the former (i e the day on 
which the proper tithi is joined to an earlier one) aB The Varsa-

kriya-kaumudl ascribes a similar verse to Usanas and remarks 
{hat it is opposed to the dicta of many such sages as Devala and 
must be restricted only to Darsasraddha forming as it does a 
syntactical whole with certain verses of the Ghandogaparisista 
(which it quotes). 

A general rule is stated in some works that when the fall 
moon which is in the lunar mansion that gives the name to a 
month is in conjunction with Jupiter that tithi has the word 
malia prefixed to it. ibr example, the Paurnima of Kartika 
would be called Mahskartikl if the Moon and Jupiter are 
both in the Krttikas (Pleiades) on that tithi. The Raja- 
martanda and Bhavisyapurana provide that a hath on the 
Mahacaitrl and (on the remaining eleven paurnimas with 
prefix malia) in certain holy places yields great rewards, 
viss bath at Prayaga on Mahamaghl, on Mahsphalguni in the 
Naimisa forest, on Mahacaitrl at Salagrama, onMahavaisakhl at 
Mahadvara, on MahajyaisthI at Purusottama, on MahasadhI at

on Mahamargaslrei at Kanyakubja, on MahapausI at 
Ayodhya 203 

There are long lists of actions forbidden on certain tithis. 
A. few passages may be cited here. Devala 204 says 'on the 15th, 
the 14th and particularly on the 8th one should avoid oil, meat, 
sexual intercourse and the use of a razor.' The Naradlya provides

Individual vratas; Caitra Pratipad, Ramanavami, 
Aksayya-htlya, Parasttramajayanfci, Dasahara, 
Savitri-vrata. 

The Mahabhtirata 205 proscribes how to set about a vrata. 
'Taking in one's hand a copper vessel full of water and turning 
one's face to the north one should undertake the upavasa, or 
whatever else he resolves in his mind to undertake as a vrata.' 
Devala 386 also says Vithout taking food (the previous night), 
after taking a bath and having performed acamana (ceremonial 
sipping of water) and after having declared before the Sun and 
other devatas (his intent) a person should perform a vrata'. The 
Varahapursna 307 sets out the formula of sankalpa 'after passing 
the 11th tithi without any food, I shall partake of food the next 
day, O lotus-eyed one (Visnu), O Acyuta, be thou my refuge*. 
The sankalpa is to be generally made in the case of a fast 208 or 
vrata in the morning; the first fifth part of a day comprising 
three ghatikas is called morning. Even when a tithi does not

begin In the morning (but begins in the afternoon) the sankalpa 
has to be made in the morning provided a vrata is to be perform- 
ed on that tithi though it be viddhs. If no sankalpa is made 
the person secures very little benefit from the vrata 210 and half 
the merit is lost. 

It is now time to turn to individual vratas on the several 
tithis. Fust comes the pratipad-vrata. 

It will be shown in the next section how in ancient and 
medieval times the month m which the rear began was 
different at different tunes and in different countries We shall 
begin with the pratipad of the month of Caitra, shall take the 
month as ending with amSvasyS (amanta) and set out from 
Caitra the important vratas and festivals in each month and the 
tithis therein, and the rest will be entered in the list of vratas 
appended to this section on vratas. 

In those parts of India (such as the Deccan) where the year 
begins with Caitra, the first tithi is observed with some pomp 
and religious ceremony. Most of the medieval digests such as 
Kalpataru (Naiyatakala PP 877-882), Hemadri (on vrata vol I 
pp 360-365), Krtyaratnakara (pp. 103-110), VratarSja (pp 49-53) 
quote from the BrahmapurSna the rites of the beginning of the 
year on the first tithi of Caitra bright half That Pin-ana 310 
states that Brahma created the world on the first day of the 
bright half of Caitra at sunrise, and started the reckoning of 
time On that tithi amahSsanti (propitiatory rite) destroying 
all untoward occurrences and sins should be offered and first 
Brahma should be worshipped with the well-known wpqc&qgand 
then the other gods with mantras preceded by om and the word 
namah (om namo Brahmcme tubhyam), to all divisions of time 
from the minutest to yogas and to daughters of Daksa and 
lastly to Visnu, then honour brahmanas with food and fees, give 
presents to relatives and servants, homa should be offered to 
Agni called Yavistha, special food should be prepared and a 
great festival should be celebrated. The Bhavisyapurana says

that since it was declared by Brahma to he the best among titbis 
and thus placed in the first place it is called Pratipad, On Caitra 
pratipad there is worship of the lord of the year, viz. the lord of 
the week-day 311 on which pratipad falls, arches and banners 
should be raised by each householder, one should anoint one's 
body with oil and have a bath, one should eat leaves of the 
nimba tree (that are bitter) and should hear from the reciter of 
the calendar the name of the year (saka or samvat), its lord 
and the deities that would be the ministers for the year, the 
governing deities of all corns and fluids &c. Even in these 
days priests go about in the Deccan to the houses of their 
patrons and read from the pattcahga (almanac) the details about 
the lord of the year &c set out above, people raise a pole with silk 
cloth at top covered with a silver or brass pot, offer worship to 
the pole with sandalwood paste, flowers &c. and eat nimba 
leaves. This latter is done even in Saurastra, though the 
people employ samuzf reckoning. 

The rule is that the pratipad to be celebrated is that which 
exists at the time of sunrise. IE pratipad exists at sunrise on two 
days, then the earlier of the two is to be chosen or if there be no 
pratipad at sunrise on any day then the one which is purva- 
viddhs should be chosen. 3?or example, if there is amavasya for 
fear ghatik&B after sunrise, then there is pratipad for 56 ghatikas 
and one ghatika more on the next day, then the pratipad though 
affected by amavasya will have to be chosen for the beginning 
of the year and not the pratipad intermixed wife second tithi 
the next day. If Caitra be an intercalary month then 22 the 
opinion of many writers is that the pratipad of the intercalary 
month should be held to be the beginning of the year. The 
Samayamayukha holds that when Caitra is an intercalary month 
the year and spring commence with it, but the ceremonial bath 
with on and listening to the recital of the saka year should

be done in the pure month. The 213 Dharmasindhu makes a 
difference fay saying that the ceremonial bath wife on 
should be taken on the occasion of the commencement of 
the new year and repeating the name of the new year 
should be done on the first day of the intercalary month, 
but the raising of the pole, eating of nunba leaves, listen- 
mgtothe recital of the almanac should be done in the pure 
month, in popular belief eaitra^ddhapratipad is one of the 33 
most important muhurtas (auspicious days) of the year The 
Simrajya-laksmlpithika (pp 128-133) gives a very elaborate 
description of the great festival on oaitra-suddha first performed 
by a king or a chieftain or a zamindar owning several villages 

The next important tithi in Caitra is the 9th in the 
bright half on which is observed the Bamanavamlvrata and the 
celebration of the birth of Kama, 7th atatura of Visnu. The 
principal works on which reliance is placed in Hemadri(on 
vrata vol I pp 941-946), V. Z. K (pp 523-529), Tithitattva 
(pp 59-62), Nirnayasmdhu (pp 83-86) and other digests are the 
Agastya-samhita and Ramarcanaoandriks of Anandavanayati, 
pupil of MukundavanayatL It is somewhat remarkable that the 
Krtyakalpataru on vrata does not deal with this. The Eama 
cult appears to have become popular later than the Krsna 
cult Though the Amarakosa gives Visnu, Narayana, Krsna, 
Vasudeva, Devaklnandana and Damodara as synonyms, it doss 
not mention Rama (Dasarathi), but mentions Eama only as a 
synonym of Haladhara. Here only a brief treatment of RSma- 
navaml can be attempted The Eamgrcanacandrika and Vratarka 
(folio 173a) expressly provide that all persons including even 
candslas can observe Ramanavamlvrata (they have adJiikara). 

It is stated in the Agastyasamhita 31 * that Eama was bom 
at noon on the 9th of the bright half of Caitra, when Fnnarvasu 
asterism. was occupied by the Moon and both the Moon and

Jupiter were in conjunction and when five planets were in 
their «cca (exaltation), when the zodiacal sign rising on the 
eastern horizon was Karkataka (Cancer), and when the Sun was 
in the sign of Mesa(Aries) The Kalanirnaya of Madhava (pp 229- 
230 ) lays down the following. When navaml is spread over two 
days, then, If there is navaml at noon only on the earlier of the 
two days, the vrata should he performed on that day. If there 
is navaml at noon on both days, or if there is no navaml at noon 
on any day, then the vrata should he performed on navaml 
mixed with dasaml (and not on navaml mixed with' astaml). 215 
If the 9 th tithi is conjoined to Punarvasu asterism that day, 
thattithi is most holy. liven when there is conjunction of 
astaml, navaml and Punarvasu, still the vrata should be on the 
next day (i. e. on navaml with dasaml) There are further 
minute rules and differences on this which are passed over here. 

It is stated that the Ramanavamivrata is nitija (obligatory) 

for all, while others say that it is obligatory only for devotees of 

Rama and kamya (optional) for those that desire special rewards 

(such as removal of sin, muktt or release from samsSra). The 

Agastya-samhita 216 remarks 'This (vrata) is a course prescribed 

for all and it is the sole means of worldly happiness and mulch. 

Even a person who is impure or very sinful, having performed 

this best of vratas, is honoured by all and he becomes as if he 

were Rama himself. That wretched man who eats food on Rama- 

navaml suffers torments in the terrible hells called Kumbhipaka. 

If a man fasts on a single RamanavamI all his objects are fulfilled 

and he is released from all sins'. The AgastyasamhitS further 

prescribes 'on that day (on which Rama was born) vrata in the 

form of a fast should always be performed and on that day the 

devotee intent on Rama worship should keep awake at night, 

sitting on the ground*. The use of the word 'sada' (always) 

shows that the vrata is obligatory. Others say that the texts 

promise such rewards as removal of sin and therefore it is

ksmya. The conclusion of many works (like the Nirnayasindhu 
and the Tithitattva) is that this vrata is both kamya and mtya 
according to' the MlmamsS maxim of 'samyogaprthaktva' 317 
( Jai IV 3. 5-7 J In the section on ' Agnihotra* the Veda says 
'he makes an offering of curds in the fire'; there is another 
sentence in the same, viz 'one who desires bodily vigour should 
make an offering of curds in the fire*. The meaning is that 
curds being separately mentioned in two different sentences 
which are both independent, homa with dadhi is both mtya 
and kamya. 

The procedure of Bamanavamlvrata as set out in H. V I, 
pp 941-946 N. S pp 83-86, T T. pp 59-62, K. T. V. pp, 96-98, 
Vrataraja pp 319-329, Vratfirka (folios 172-182;, may be 
briefly described as follows. — The devotee should take a bath 
on the 8th tithi in the bright half of Oaitra, perform his 
sandhya prayer and should invite a brShmana learned in the 
Veda and sSstras and devoted to Rama worship and knowing the 
procedure of Rama mantras, should honour him and make a 
request' I shall make a gift of the image of Kama*. Then he 
should give oil to the brahmana for anointing his body, make 
him bathe, make him wear white garments and flowers, should 
offer him a dinner containing saUmka food and should himself 
partake of the same food and constantly think of BSma On 
that day he and the acarya honoured by him should go without 
food at night, should listen to the stories of B&ma the whole day 
and should himself sleep and make the acarya sleep on the 
ground (not on a cot) The next morning he should get up, 
bathe, perform his sandhya, should construct a brilliant mandapa 
with four doors and decked with arches, banners and flowers 
The eastern door should be decked with conch, wheel and ( an 
image of) Garuda, bow and arrows, the western one with mace, 
sword and armlets and the north with lotuses, svasttka signs and 
blue stones and prepare a raised altar four cubits (in the 
mandapa) and should provide holy songs, music and dance 
therein. He should have benedictions from brShmanas Then

be should make a safikalpa 'On the Ramanavaml I shall observe 
a fast for the whole day and being intent on worshipping Bsma 
shall make a golden image of Rama and shall donate it for 
pleasing Rama' and then say ' may Rama remove my numerous 
heavy sins'. The image of Rama should be placed on a pedestal, 
have two hands and J&nakl should be seated on the left thigh of 
(Rama) image, which should be bathed with paficamita, 2 '* then 
mvktnuxidra 20 should he recited and the usual nyasas should be 
made. The festival or puja is performed in the noon. Then at 
night he should keep awake and listen to the divine stories about 
Kama and be surrounded by devotees of Rama, should sing 
hymns about Rtma. Then the next morning he should bathe, 
perform sandhya, should worship the image of Rama with sixteen 
upacaras employing the 16 verses of 5g. X. 90 and with 
PaurSnika verses, also perform the worship of the several limbs 
of the image (SrI-Ramabhadraya namah padau pu jayami and so 
on), offer homa on the altar or in a kunda with the mviamanlra 
and then in the ordinary fire offer 108 oblations of clarified butter 
or payasa (rice cooked in milk with sugar), then he should honour 
the acarya with gifts of ear-rings, finger rings, flowers, clothes &c. 
and should recite the following mantra ' O Rfima 1 I shall today 
donate this golden image of yours decked with ornaments and 
clothes for securing your favour; may Rama favour me*. He 
should give daksina (fee) to the acarya and to other brahman as 
gold, cow, a pair of clothes, corn, according to his ability and 
then have dinner along with the brahmanas. By doing so he 
becomes free from even mortal sins like brahmana-mnrder. 
There is no need to say more The man who performs this vrata 
has mukti in his hand (as it were) and he acquires the same 
merit that one secures by the dana called Ttdapurusa 320 in

Kuruksebra on a solar eclipse Hemadri is comparatively brief, 
bat the Tithitattva (pp 61-62), JTirnayasindhu (p 85), Vratarka 
add farther details from AgastyasamhitS They say that images 
of Bharata and Satrughna (by the side of BSma image) and of 
Laksmana with a bow in his hand and of Dasaratha (to the right) 
and of KausalyS should also he made and worshipped with 
appropriate FaurSnika mantras (the one for Kausalya is quoted 
in the note) 221 The Bamarcanacandrika adds further details 
about the worship of ten and five amranos to which even the 
Nirnayasjndhu refers by name alone. 

BSmanavamI is not to be celebrated in the intercalary 
Caitra month (malamSsa). The same rule applies to JanmSstamI 
and other vratas 

In modern times not many people observe a fast on Bama- 
navaml and hardly one performs homa or donates images, but 
the birth of Kama is celebrated in Bama temples by many at 
noon with great ceremony. A Hartddsa treats a gathering of 
men and women assembled in the temple to a kirtan with musio 
and bhajan on the birth of Bama, At the end there is distribu- 
tion of sweets or 'Sunthavada' (dried ginger with sugar or 
jaggery) in the Deccan. In some places such as Nasik, Tirupati, 
AyodhyS and Bsmesvara this festival is performed with great 
pomp and thousands of people attend at these holy places There 
is no holy name other than that of Bama bo constantly on 
Hindu lips even in these days 

The important tithi in VaisSkha is the thud of the bright 
half. It is called Aksayya-trtlya The earliest reference to it is 
probably in the Visnu-dharmasutra where it is said that one 
should fast on this tithi, worship VSsudeva with whole grains 
of rice, should offer them into fire and donate them; thereby 
one becomes purified from all sins, whatever a man donates on 
that day becomes inexhaustible. The MatsyapurSna (chap 65, 
verses 1-7), Naradtya I 112 10 ff treat of this The former states 
that whatever is donated or sacrificed or muttered on this (Ma 
becomes inexhaustible (in reward), that a fast thereon yields 
inexhaustible results, that ifthistrtlyS has grttiks astensm

then it is specially commended. The Bhavisyottara-purana 212 
(chap 30 1-19} deals at some length with it. It Bays : ' this tithi 
ia one of the Yugadi tithis because the Krta age began on it; 
whatever is done on it, such as bath, gifts, muttering of sacred 
texts (japa), offerings into fire, Veda study, satiating deceased 
ancestors (with water) — all that becomes inexhaustible'. It 
provides that gifts of jars of water and of umbrellas and of 
footwear should be made (to brahmanaa) on thiB day and that 
what is sacrificed or donated on this day never comes to an end 
and therefore this tithi is called aksaya (inexhaustible) by the 
sages V. Dh also refers to it 223 The Lar plates of Govinda- 
candra of Kanauj recite that the king after bathing in the 
Ganges on the occasion of the Aksayya-trtiya festival on 
Monday in samval '1202 (i e 15th April 1146 A. D) made the 
grant of a village to one Srldhara Thakkura (B I vol VII p 98). 
The third is to be taken for these religious rites when it exists 
in the forenoon, but if it exists in the forenoon on two days 
the one that exists on the later day should be chosen fox vrata. 
VidaHemadiiouKalap 618 and on vrata vol. L pp 500-502, 
Vratarajapp 93-96, Sm & p. 109 for further details. It is 
provided in the Puranas that srSddha performed on the tithiB 
called Yugadi gives inexhaustible gratification to the pitrs. But 
no pindas (rice-balls) are to be offered in Yugadi-sraddha. 
AksayyatrttyS is one of the 3V days popularly believed to be 
roost auspicious in the year (it is itself $ ). 

On the third of Vaisakha bright half is celebrated 
'Paraaurgmajayanti*. 22 * It is to be celebrated in the first prahara

(watch J of the night ('snryastotfcaram trimuhurtah pradosah' 
Dhannasindhu p9) It is stated m the Skanda » and Bhavisya 
pttranas that Visnu was born from Renuka on the third of the 
bright half of Vaisakha when the naksatra was Punarvasu and 
in the first watch of the night and when six planets were ucca 
(in exaltation) and Rahu was in the zodiacal sign Mithuna 
(Gemini) The image of Parasurama is to be worshipped and 
arghya is to be offered to it with the mantra quoted below 226 If 
the third tithi is Buddha (i e not mixed with another tithi) the 
vxata ( i e fast) is to be performed that day, but if on two days 
there is third tithi in the evening first watch even partially, then 
the later one is to be the day of the fast , otherwise ( if the thud 
is oulclhTi, but does not extend up to the first watch of the night) 
the fast should be observed on the first of the two days There 
are some temples erected in honour of Parasurama, particularly in 
the Konkana such as the one near Ohiplun in which Parasurama- 
jayanti is celebrated with great ceremony Vide N S p. 95,

In the month of Jyestfaa there is a vrata called Dasahara on 
the 10th tithi of the bright half The Brahmapurana (63 15) 
states that the 10th of Jyestha bright half is called Dasahara,

in Manu XII 6-7 m The BSjamartanda (verses 1397-1405)' 

speaks of this vrata The K. 8. (p 98) and some other digests 

put forward another basis, viz 2W Jyestha su 10 on Tuesday 

(ace to VarSha) or Wednesday (aco to Skanda), on Hasta- 

naksatra, Vyatipata, Gara (karatta), Ananda-yoga, the moon 

and sun being in Virgo and Taurus respectively— ^when all these 

concur or when most of them concur, a person should bathe in 

the Ganges and then become free from all sins. Wednesday and 

Hasfca constitute Anandayoga It was supposed that the Ganges 

came to the earth on this tithi, on Tuesday and on Hasta 

asterism and therefore originally it appears to have been a vrata 

of a bath in the Ganges at Dasaivamedha, of worship and gifts. 

Then it was extended to a bath in any big river and offering of 

arqhi/a, sesame and water Vide Kaslkhanda, Tristhall-setu, K T. 

431, Vrataraja pp 353-355, P. O pp 144-145 for further details. 

At present in towns and villages on the big rivers such as Krsna, 

Godavarl, Nannada and the Ganges, a festival of the Ganges 

is celebrated At such places as Banaras, Prayaga, Haridvara, 

Nasik the utsava is celebrated on a large scale If there be an 

intercalary Jyestha, this vrata was to be performed in that 

month, 

On the Full moon day of Jyestha women whose husbands 
are living perform even now in many parts of India the Savitrl- 
vrata or Vatasavitrivrata The story of Savitrl whose memory 
has been cherished for ages by all Indian women as an ideal of a 
paltvrata, of wifely devotion to the husband unto death (and 
even thereafter) is very popular and is described at great length 
in the Mahabharata (Vanaparva chap. 293-299) and in the 
Puranas (such as in Matsya, chap 208-214, Skandapurana, 
Prabhasakhanda chap 166, Visimdbarmottara.H chap 36-41). It

is narrated 2 * that she married Satyavat who3e death at the end of 
one year was predicted by the sage NSrada and that three days 
before tho time indicated by Narada she undertook a fast, 
accompanied her husband into the forest whore he had gone to 
collect firewood, flowers and frnitB as his blind father had lost his 
kingdom and that she had an argument with Yama the God of 
Death, who became so pleased with her that he gave her several 
boons and ultimately her husband that had died as predicted was 
restored to life The Bhavisyapurana account of the'story of 
SSvitrl is cited at great length in Krtyaratnakara (pp. 264-278). 
HemSdri (on vrata II pp 258-372) sets out a vrata called 
Brahma-Savitrlvrata from Bhavisyottara which contains the 
story of S&vitrl as in the MahabhSrata and Matsya and also (vol 
II pp 272-279) a Vatasavitrlvrata from Skanda. But the first 
was performed for three dayB from the 13th tithi to Full Moon in 
Bhudrapada month and not m Jyestha, while the 2nd was to be 
performed on Jyestha Full Moon by a woman whose husband was 
living or even by a sonless widow. This last is called Maha- 
ssvitrlvrata by the Vratakalaviveka (p 20 of I H Q vol 17 
No. 4 supplement). 

The Ifirnayasmdhu refers to the vrata in Bhsdrapada 
mentioned by Hemadri and remarks 231 that it was not m vogue 
in its day The VrataprakSsa describes (folios 169-170) the 
Brahmasavitrlvrata 

But the Vatasavitrlvrata that is now in vogue must also 
have been performed long before the 10th century A D The

essentials is the same as the modern VatasSvitrlvrata The 
Rsjamartanda says ' on the 14th 233 of the hright half of Jyestha 
women full of faith perform the Savitrlvrata for being free from 
widowhood*. This is followed hy people in the Decoan The 
Nirnayamrta following the Bhavisya held that this vrata was to 
be performed on Amavasya, while the Krtyatattva ( p 430 }, and 
T. T. p 121 say that Savitrlvrata is to be observed on dark 14th 
after the Fall Moon of Jyestha. 

If the Pauroim& is spread over two days, then the vrata is 
to be performed on CaturdasI (14th tithi) mixed up with 
Paurnima The three days for which the vrata is to last may 
have to be begun on the 12th or 13th But if oaturdasl is of the 
extent of 18 ghatikas and then Paurnima supervenes, then 
caturdasl is to be given up (K N. p 301). 

The worship of the Vata tree oomes in probably because 

Satyavat when the moment of death approached took shelter 

under the shade of the Vata tree and supported himself by a 

branch of it and spoke in a choked voice to Savitrl that he had 

pain in the head s * The procedure of this vrata as set out in 

the Vratarka (folios 312-320) and other late medieval works is 

briefly as follows — The woman should make asankalpa in the 

form 'I shall perform Savitrlvrata for securing long life and 

health to my husband and my sons and for securing freedom

sprinkle water at the root of the Vata tree and surround it with 

cotton thread's and should perform its worship with the upacaras 

and then offer worship to Savitrl (with image or mentally) from 

her feet upwards and pray to her to bestow on her beauty, good 

name, prosperity, and freedom from widowhood. Then she should 

worship Yama andNarada and give presents (vayana) to the 

priest and break her fast next day In Bengal the mode of 

performing Sfivitrl-vrata is different from the above In Bengal 

there is no VatasSvitrlvrata, but there is Savitrloaturdasl on the

later lives. It is continued for 14 yeara

If a woman was unable to fast for three days, she was

came to her without her asking for it and fast on the 15th *» 

In JAOS vol 21 part 2 pp 63-66 Allen has compared the 
Savitrtvrata as desorihed in the Mahabharata and the purSnas 
and in Hemadri and Vratarka 

I hare not generally tried to speculate about the remote 
origins, if any, of even the most important vratas But some 
scholars endowed with a lively imagination and imbued with the 
theories underlying Blazer's 'Golden Bough' have tried then- 
hands at the origins of some vratas The late Mr B A Gupte 
endeavoured to explain 'the symbolism of the Savitrfvrata' in 
I A vol 35 (for 1906) pp 116-119 He bases his article on the 
forty figures that his wife drew with sandalwood paste in 
celebrating the Savitrl-vrata He holds that the story of Savitrl 
is based on a Nature Myth and that the first impression produced 
on him by the pictures drawn by his wife is that it is a marriage 
scene What mainly vitiates all his imaginative explanations 
is that the Savitrl-vrata is not mentioned anywhere in any work 
that can be said to be even two thousand years old and that he 
thinks his wife's figures or pictures represent the general way of 
celebrating that vrata in the whole of India throughout the 
centuries The Savitrlvrata is observed throughout India, but I 
have not been able to find that women all over India depict the 
scene as was done by Mr Gupta's wife (who probably was a well- 
educated lady and had an artistic training in some big city and 
turned her skill to lend charm and picturesqueness to that vrata, 
by adding her own artistic ideas to those of millions of unedu- 
cated simple women in small towns and villages )

CHAPTER V 

ekada£i 

The most important tithi in the month of Asadha is 
Ekadasl. A voluminous literature has grown round Ekadasl in 
the Puranas and medieval digests There are separate treatises 
on Ekadasl written by medieval writers, such as the Ekadasl- 
viveka of SQlapani and the Ekadasltattva of Baghunandana 
Besides, such medieval digests as Kalaviveka (pp 435-451), 
Hemadii on Kala pp. 145-288, Kslanirnaya of Madhava (pp. 
233-275), Vratarajapp 361-475, K&a-tattvavivecana (pp 98-172) 
devote hundreds of pages to discussions on Ekadasl. Endeavour 
would he made to write about most of the numerous matters 
relating to Ekadasl, but everything would have to be compressed 
in as small a space as possible 

if one were to examine the numerous passages of the 
Puranas and the like one would notice that some simply prohibit 
the partaking of food (on Ekadasl), while others lay down the 
observance of Ekadaslvrata. A few specimens of the fiTst kind 
may be cited. The Naradiya states 236 " all sins whatever and sins 
equal to brabmana-murder take resort to food on the day of Hari; 
one who partakes of food on Ekadasl incurs those sins ; the Puranas 
again and again loudly proclaim 'one should not eat food, one 
should not eat food, when the day of Hari comes'." In this case 
the observance of Ekadasi consists in simply not eating for the 
whole day anything that is cooked Those passages which 
contain the word mala are not to be looked upon as merely 
prohibiting (the eating of food) but are to be construed as 
prescribing something positive as in the case of Prajapativrata 
one should not see the rising sun', which is interpreted by

Jaimini IV. 1. 3-6 and VI 2 20 Vide n 42 above. For 
example, it is said by the Matsya and Bhavisya * When a man 
fasts on the 11th and partakes of food on the 12th, whether m the 
bright or dark half, that is a great vrata in honour ofVisnu* 
Those passages that contain the word 'upavasa' and those that 
prescribe rewards (of observing ekadasl) must be construed 
as laying down the observance of a vrata and not as merely 
prohibiting anything Those passages also which condemn 
eating food on ekadasl may be construed as merely intended to 
commend the vrata and not to contain a prohibition, following 
the Mlmamsa 237 maxim 'condemnation is not indulged in 
(merely) for the sake of condemnation of that which is condemned, 
but for the purpose of commending the performance of the 
opposite of what is censured' The passages that lay down a 
vrata are again two-fold, viz those that make the observance of 
Ekadasl obligatory (mtya)' 38 and those that lay down the observ- 
ance for securing some desired object (Icamya) Narada lays 
down an obligatory rule ' men who are devoted to Visnu and who 
look upon Visnu as their highest goal should always fast on 
ekadasl in each paksa (fortnight)' A passage laying down a 
kamya-vidhi about Ekadasl is contained in 239 Katyayana'a 
person who looks on Visnu as highest goal and who desires to 
cross the ocean of samsara or to secure prosperity, offspring, 
heaven, moksa or whatever else, should not partake of food on 
ekadasl in both fortnights ' The result is that ekadasl is both 
nitya and kamya and the maxim of samtjoga-prthaktva cited above 
(p. 86) under Bamanavami applies Ekadasivrata on the eksdasls 
of both fortnights is mlya only for persons other than house- 
holders, the vrata is obligatory for householders (grhastha) only 
on the ekadasl of the bright half , but not on the ekadasl of the 
dark half, Binoe Devala says 'one should not eat (cooked) 
food on ekadasl in both paksas (fortnights); this is the rule of 
conduct for forest hermits and ascetics, but a householder should

always observe only the Ekadasi of the bright half \ M0 There are 
conflicting texts on this subject. The Padma says 241 'a house- 
holder should observe a fast on only the dark ekadasls between 
SayanI (Ssadha su. 11) and BodhinI (Kartika su 11) and on no 
other ekadasi of the dark half. There is a precept of Nsrada 343 
' a householder having a son should not observe a fast on a 
Sankranti day, on the day of ekadasi in the dark half and on 
eclipses of the sun and the moon 1 . The best construction of these 
passages appears to be that a fast only on the ekadasi of the 
bright half is obligatory for a householder, but be may observe 
(Kamyavrata) a fast on the ekadasls occurring in the dark half 
between Sayani and BodhinI, but if he has a son he should not 
observe a fast even on those ekadasls that occur between Sayani 
and BodhinI A widow 243 is to be treated on the same level as 
a yati and a woman whose husband is living should fast only on 
the ekadasi of the bright half It has to be further noted that 
these restrictions 244 do not apply to professed devotees of Yisnu 
( technically called Yaisnava ) To them the verse quoted in 
note 238 above applies and they have to observe a fast on all 
ekadasls. Hemadri (on vrata voL I p. 999) held the view that 
all pBisons have adhikara for fasting on ekadasls in both paksas. 

On pp. 43-45 above the exaggerated importance attached to 
vratas in general has already been dealt with Upavfisa as a 
prSyasciUa (expiation for sins) has been described in vol IV.

The Garudapurana declares: 29 (if one places) on one side (in one 
pan) the gift of the whole world and on the other side (in 
another pan) the day of Hari, this ekadasl is more holy and 
superior The ekadasl in itsadha sukla is called maha-ekadasl 
and also Sayan*. 

General rules about those who have the adhikara to under- 
take vratas have already been dealt with above. But some rules 
meant specially for the observers of ekadasl will be set out here. 
Harada 25 ** provides 'A human being who is more than eight 
years old and is less than eighty years in age incurs sin if he 
eats food on ekadasl through foolishness. ' Katyayana has a 
shnilaT verse These two establish that every human being of 
whatever caste or asramn can observe ekadasl provided he fulfils 
the conditions as to age laid down in the verses. 

Knowing the weakness of human beings, sages relaxed the 
rule of an absolute fast on ekadasl. ThelSFaradapurana 251 says 
' roots, fruits, milk and water may be partaken of ( on ekadasl ) 
by great sages, but no sages have said that on ekadasl cooked food 
may be taken' The Vayupurina 252 provided 'partaking of 
havisya food at night, food other than boiled rice, fruits, sesame, 
milk, water, ghee, pafica-gavya, air — each succeeding one is here 
(i. e m ekadasl) more commendable (than each preceding one)'.

complete fast (on ek&dasl) or who axe over 80 years of age should 
resort to ekabhakta and the other (alternatives). The Matsya 
provides 251 that those who are unable to fast (on ekidasi) 
should prefer to take food by the nakta method and if 
a person is ill, he should make his son and others to undertake 
the fast (on his behalf). Who can act as pratinidhis in the case of 
a vrata has already been described above ( pp 53-54) 

It is said by Markandeya 355 that one may observe the 
methods of ekabhakta, nakta, ayScita, complete fast and rfSno, 
but should not deprive oneself of the benefits of the observance 
of dvadasl (with ekadasi) Here certain alternatives are allowed 
in place of an absolute fast and they have to be explained. 
But before doing so, attention has to be drawn to the rule 
propounded by Manu S5S viz if a person, being master of (i a 
quite able to carry out) the mam provisions for a rite, resorts to 
alternatives provided (by texts) be would not, foolish as he is, 
secure the otherworldly rewards (of that rite) Therefore, 
ekabhakta, nakta and ayacita are to be employed only if one ib 
unable to observe a strict fast Ekabhakta means eating only 
once a day after the middle of the day Madhyahna means the 
3rd part of the day divided into five parts (i e from the 13th 
ghati after sunrise up to the 18th of a day of 30 ghatls) Hemadri 
(on kala p 109) holds that madhyahna is the middle part of the 
day divided into three parts and according to him the proper 
time for ekabhakta is the time immediately after midday, since 
the Skanda employs the words 'after the middle of the day is 
passed' (dinardhasamayestlte), 257 while the gauna-kala is up to

Ekabhakla 101 

sunset Works like the Niinayamrta, Smrtikaustubha (pp. 9-10) 
approve of the division into five parts, and hold that ekabhakta 
means taking food at sometime between the 13th and 18th ghatl 
of the day (of 30 ghatls) *■ When ekabhakta is merely an 
alternative to strict upavssa on ekldasl, food must be taken on 
thetithi on which the fast would have been observed if the 
performer were able to undergo it. The same 359 rule applies to 
nakta as a substitute for upavasa. 

Ekabhakta is also a vrata independently performed (without 
reference to ekadasi) The AnusSsanaparva (chap. 106 verses 
17-30) declares the rewards secured by observing ekabhakta in 
each month from Margaslrsa to Kartika and Anusasanaparva 
(chap 107. 13-126) dilates upon the fruits of observing ekabhakta 
on each of the thirty days of a month The Extyakalpataru on 
vrata (pp 457-468) sets out practically the whole of Anusasana- 
parva chap 107 (which the editor appears not to have noticed) 
and Hemadri on vrata vol H. pp. 930-931 does the same The 
Krtyakalpataru (on vrata pp. 419-421), the ExtyaratnSkara 
(pp 406-7 and later on) and Hemadri on vrata (vol II pp 748-798) 
quote Anusasana 106. 17-30 about ekabhakta in different months 
at different places. 

Naktar— Two verses about nakta occurring in the Linga, 
Narada 560 and other puranas are: alms collected by begging are 
superior to fasting, food obtained without requesting anyone for 
it (i e ayacita) is superior to alms, nakta is superior to ayacita, 
therefore one should subsist by nakta method; eating havisya 
food, bath, truthfulness, small intake of food, offering oblations

the other is of the nature of a vrata, As regards the first all 
persons including householders having am have a dfete,ato 
observe it even m the daik half; but as regards the second 
(upavasa of the nature of vrata) householders that have progeny 
should not observe it on the eksdasls of the dark half, they 
should not make a sankalpa, they should simply give up cooked 
food but should observe the rayamas of celibacy and the like As 
to ekadaslsof the dark half between the SayanI and Bodhinl 
even householders with sons have the right to perform the vrata 
Similarly, those who desire to secure absorption into Visnu, 
long life and sons may perform a kSmyavrata on eksdasls of 
both paksas Vaisnava householders should always fast even on • 
eksdasls of the dark half The ekadaslvrata is obligatory on all 
inoludmg devotees of Siva, Visnu and the Sua Upavfisa in the 
nature of vrata is again of two kinds, ntlya and kami/a These 
aie biiefiy the rules laid down m the Nirnayasmdhu and 
Dharmasmdhu (p 16) The mam difference between mere upavasa 
and upavasavrata is that in the former there is no sankalpa that 
the person is undertaking an upavasavrata and he simply 
abstains from taking food because the sSstra says that on 
ekadasl one should not eat cooked food, while in the latter there 
is sankalpa and there are also several other matters to be 



It would now be proper to give a comparatively early but 
brief desonption of ekadaslviata TheNaradapurana(Purvardha 
chap 23 verses 12 ff) describes the procedure as fallows — on the 
10th Mitt the man who has to observe the vrata should after 
getting up brush his teeth, take a bath, bathe a Visnu image in 
pancamrta and offer worship (of several upaanas) to it On the 
11th, after bathing, he should bathe the image with pancamrta 
and worship Visnu with sandalwood paste, flowers and the like

food, should curb his senses, should lie down in front of the Visnu 
image, keep awake engaged in songs, music and dances relating 
to Visnu and listen to stories about Visnu contained in the 
Puranas On the 12th tithi, he should after a bath for himself,

he should perform his daily five sacrifices (brahmayajna,

restraint of speech when eating While engaged in the upavSsa-

It will be noticed that the main matters in the vrata are 
upavSsa, worship of Visnu image, jayara m at night with songs 
and music, parana on 12th and certain restrictions about looking 
at some persons or speaking to them and restraint of the senses 
The Brahma-vaivarta (IV 26 1-93) also contains the procedure of 
ekadasl-vrata It will be noticed n that m the procedure of ekadasl 
there is no homa, though in some other yiatas there is a noma 

Accretions gathered lound this simple procedure It was 
laid down early enough that one engaged m upavSsavrata should 
miss four meals in three days, i e he should eat only once on 
the 10th in the noon, fast 273 both times on 11th and on the 12th 
he should miss one meal The general rule is that the sankalpa 
for vratas is to be made in the morning, but as regards ekadasl- 
vrata exceptions hays been made m the digests. Far example, 
it is said that the sankalpa 271 about myamas is to be made on 
the night of the 10th tithi If ekadasl is mixed up with 10th, 
then sankalpa about fast is to be made at night, 275 if dasaml

Ttme for sankalpa 107 

Ktends beyond midnight and the eksdasl becomes mixed with 
it, sankalpa is to be made the next day after noon Hemldri 
(on vrata vol Lp 1006) and Kalanirnaya (p 268) provide that 
the image of Visnu should be worshipped in a mandapa decorated 
charmingly with flowers of various kinds It is provided in the 
Sfcanda 376 that when a person breaks his fast on the 12th he 
should partake of the naivedya mixed with TulasI (basil) leaves, 
since that destroys ( the sins of ) crores of murders 

Numerous medieval digests set out the procedure of ekidasT- 
vrata It is impossible for reasons of space to refer to them For 
the sake of comparison with the Naradapurina procedure, I shall 
set out the procedure of Ekidaslvrata from the Dharmasindhu 
(p. 19), almost the latest authoritative work on Dharmaslstra. 

Now (is set out) the procedure of (eksdasl) vrata On the 
day previous to the fast, the person, after performing all his 
daily duties in the morning, should make a sankalpa in the form 
'beginning from the 10th Itlfa.Ogod Eesava, lord of gods, I 
shall perform for three days your vrata; make it free from 
obstacles'. Then at midday (of 10th) he should eat by the 
ekabhakta method The restrictions to be observed about 
ekabbakta are : he should avoid taking food in a vessel of bell 
metal, avoid flesh, Tnaswapulse, sleeping by day, over-eating, 
drinking too much water, eating food again (after the midday 
meal), sexual intercourse, telling falsehood, honey, gram, 
Jcodiava, vegetables, the food belonging to others, gambling, oil, 
sesame cakes, tumbula (betel leaves and nut &c ), if he has to 
cleanse his teeth after ekabhakta he should do so with twigs 
At night be should sleep on a bed spread on the ground. In the 
morning of ekadasi he should cleanse his teeth with the leaves 
of a tree and not with twigs. After performing bath and other 
daily duties, he should put on his finger a p^vitra (loop) made of 
daibha grass, turn his face to the north, take a copper vessel fall 
of water and make a sankalpa as follows . ' after remaining with- 
out food on the ekadasi I shall, O lotus-eyed one, on the next day 
partake of cooked food, OAcyuta, be you my refuge'. Or he 
may offer a handful of flowers to Hari with this mantra. In the 
case of him who is unable to observe a total fast, necessary 
changes may be made in the sentence of sankalpa according to

his ability viz 'on ekadasl I shall subsist on water or milk or on 
fruits or I shall take food at thetimeof nakta'. Saivas should 
make the sanlcalpa with Eudra Gsyatrl; 277 Sun-worshippers 
should make the sankalpa with the usual Gayatrl (Rg. m 62 10 
'tatsavitur'&c) or by taking the name of the Sun. This 
sankalpa should he made by smartas on the night of the ekadasl 
tithi, if there is 10th tithi after sunrise (mixed up with ekadasl), 
if 10th tithi exists beyond midnight on dasaml day all (whether 
smartas or vai3navas) should make the sankalpa after midday 
He should drink the water used for Bankalpa On making the 
sankalpa ho should pronounce over it thrice the mantra of eight 
syllables (such as ' om namo NSrayansya') Then after erecting 
a manfapa decorated with flowers (garlands &o) he should offer 
worship to Hari (image) according to prescribed rules in that 
mandapi with flowers, fragrant substances, incense, best 
nmvedi/a, with various divine hymns of praise, charming songs 
and music, with straight prostrations on the ground like a 
staff, with best announcements with the word 'jaya' and at 
night he should keep awake. 

The cult of ekidasl went on growing apace, so muoh so that 
for the 24 ekidasls of the twelve months of the lunar year and for 
the two ekfidaste of the intercalary month separate names were 
invented It is not possible to say with certainty when these 
names were given, but some of them must be about two thousand 
years old 

The twenty-four names beginning with ceulra snkla ekadasl 
and ending with phalguna dark half ekadasl are given in the

fen want of space no notice is taken of it here. One cause of 
divergence appears to be that in some Puranas the month is 
pSrnimanta, while in others the month is amanta and what is 
Bhadrakrena in Purnimanta reckoning is SrSvana-krsna in 
Amanta reckoning. 

The ekadasi on Jyestha bright half is called turjala because 
the vrata consists in not using or drinking water except at the 
time of bathing or at acamana. It is described by Hemadri 
(on vrata vol Lop 1089-1091) who quotes the Mahabharata for 
it and by N S pp. 99-100. In the summer month of Jyestha it 
must have been a great trial to go without water for a day 
and therefore it was specially commended. Visnu was supposed 
to sleep for four months from Asadha bright ekadasi at night and 
to rise from his sleep on Kartika bright ekadasi by day and hence 
these two ekadasls are respectively called Sayanl (connected 
with the sayana ie sleeping of Visnu) andPrabhodhini 2 " or 
Prabodhani (connected with the pra'iodha i e. awakening of 
Visnu). What the legend of Visnu's sleeping from fisadha 
sufcla eleven for four months was really meant to illustrate or 
symbolize it is difficult to say As these four months were the 
months of the rainy season m many parts of India all move- 
ments from one place to another distant place came almost to a 
stand-EtdH in ancient times; so probably mythology became 
busy and suggested that Visnu himself gave up all activity It 
is possible that this legend of four months' sleep may have some 
connection with the state of things when the ancestors of the 
Vedic Aryans lived in northern latitudes, when for four months 
the sun was either not seen or emitted only faint light This 
legend from whatever cause it may have arisen is worked up in 
various ways. It was said that Visnu not only slept on his 
snake oouoh but he also turned in his sleep from one side to the 
other (as human beings do) on Bhsdrapada sukla eleven And 
therefore that ekadasi in Bhadrapada was called ParivartinI 
This matter was still further elaborated and it was asserted that

nil tho great gods and goddesses went to sleep like Visnu on 
different datos, n«j stated in the Rajamartanda quoted below "" 
Then, further differences arose, some works saying Visnu went 
to sleep on the 11th, somo that Vibnu slept on 12th, while a 
third sot said that Visnu slept on tho 15th of Asadha bright half 
The Vanaparva (203 12) declares that Visnu sleeps on the 
hoods of Sosa Kahd5sa m tho Meghadiita refers to both the 
sleeping of Visnu on his snake couch and his rising from it 
(sSpanto mo bhujagasayanad utthite sarngapanau) Most 
scholars hold that Kalidasa flourished betwoen 350-450 A D In 
tho Gangadhar Stone Inscription of Visvavarman in tha Krta 
year 480 there is a clear reference to tho rising from sleep of 
Visnu in Kartika (vide Gupta Inscriptions ed by Fleet No 17 
at pp 72,75,79) Krta is held to be the same as Vikrama year by 
most scholars So the legend about Visnu's satjana on a snake bed 
and getting up from it may ba about 2000 years old, if not more 

The question as to the tithi on which the gods (and parti- 
cularly Visnu ) went to sleep very much exercised the minds of 
the authors of PurSnas and of the digests For example, the 
VHmanapurana (16 6-16) contains verses 23 some of which may

Sayana-tilhis of gods 111 

be summarised here; 'a parson should arrange a couch in the 
form of the hoods of the snake Sasa for the lord of the world 
(Visnu) on the 11th tithi of Ssadha and offer worship; he should, 
being himself pure, seek on the 13th permission from brahmanas 
invited, and should bring to sleep the Lord that wears yellow 
clothes' Then the purana proceeds to narrate how Kama (God 
of Love) sleeps on 13th of JLsSdha on a bed of hadamla flowers, 
the Yaksas on 14th, Siva on the 15th (i e Purnima) on a bed of 
tiger-skin, then Brahma, "Visvakarma, ParvatI, Ganesa, Yama, 
Skanda, the Sun, Katyayanl, Laksml, Lord of snakes, Sadhyas 
respectively go to sleep on the tithis of the dark half from 1st to 
11th The K V (p 225) andHemtdri (onKala pp 888-889) 
quote certain verses according to which Kuhera, Laksml, 
BhavanT, Ganesa, Soma, Guha, Bhaskara, Durga, the Matrs, 
Vssuki, sages, Visnu, Kama, &va are the lords of tithis from 
1st to 14th for pavifcraTopana (i. e giving the sacred upavlta to 
the gods) and for sayana. 

One important rule has to be remembered, 282 viz whatever 
naftsafra or whatever lulu has a certain deity as its lord, the 
Bleeping, turning from one side to another and the rest (i e 
getting up &c) take place on that tithi or naksatra Some 
celebrate the sayana of a god relying on the tithi, others rely on 
the naksatra. But the trouble is that one tithi has several lords, 
according to various authorities For example, pratipad has 
throe lorai, Agni, Brahma and Kubera (Garuda I 116 3-8) For 
reasons of space it is not possible to refer to the texts on which 
different tithis are assigned for the sayana of Visnu. The 
Samayamayakha (p 79), K T.V p 172 and Vrataprakssa* 3 (part 
of Vlramitrodaya) espouse the view of JLsadha eleventh (of 
bright half) relying on the BrahmapurSna Many digests 
favour the 12th as the tithi of sayana and prabodha of 
Visnu relying on the several verses in the Varaha, Visnu- 
aharmottara and other Puranas Vide Kalaviveka p 175 (ff) 
V K K 286-288, K rtyatattva p 436, K R p. 209. In an

inscription referred to in I A vol 25 p 290 we have the words 
'punya utthanadvadasl' (the holy 12th tithi on which Vismi 
gets up from Mb couch), the inscription being dated in sake 1462 
(1540 A. D ) In some works JLsIdha Fall moon is advocated for 
the sayana of Visnu *» Vide K R p. 208, K V p 188, Ertya- 
tattva p 436 These works provide how sayana and prabodha 
are to be celebrated On the sayanl day, the devotee prepares a 
couch m the evening with a piece of cloth or with flowers, 
worships Visnu (image) at night, repeats the mantra 'om namo 
NarayanBya' and then puts Visnu to sleep and repeats two 
verses, one of which is quoted below 28S On the day of prabodha 
the image of Visnu is given an elaborate bath and a full worship 
is done and seveial mantras from Varaha-purana are recited and 
a Vedic verse (idam vismir, Sg I 22. 17) also is recited 

Peisons having adhiUira for ekadasi-vrata may be divided 
into two classes, viz Vaisnavas and Smfirtas The word vaisnava 
is defined in some of the Puianas 286 such as the Padma HI 
1. 21-32, IV 10 65-66, VI 252 74, VI 69, ViBnu III 7. 20-33, 
HI 8.9-19, the Bhagavata and in some of the digests A 
Vaisnava is really one who has received dlksa (initiation) 
according to the Vaisnava agamas of the Vaikhanasa, Paficaratra 
and other schools TheSkanda defines a Vaisnava- that man 
is a Vaisnava who does not forsake (fast on) ekadasl, whether he

be reduced to the direct misery or whether great bliss might have 
come to him, who has been given the dlkaa of a VaisDava, who 
behaves equally towards all living beings, who does not swerve 
from the duties of his olasa (varna), who is equal to his own 
Mends of his class (varna), who is equal to his own friends or 
his enemies, who, being high (in principles), does not deprive 
anyone (of his possessions) or does not injure anyone, and whose 
mind is pure. Vide Prof. S. K. De's ' Vaisnava faith and move- 
ment' pp 364-866 and p. 413 where the author gives an analysis 
of the characteristics of the Vaisnava devotee drawn from the 
Haribhaktrvilasa of Gopalabhatta (for followers of Caitanya). 

Though the Puranas give these definitions, some of which 

are very general and may apply even to persons not popularly 

called Vaisnavas, still in all parts of India and by all states it is 

admitted that those are Vaisnavas who are traditionally 387 

known by that appellation. The question on what tithi upavasa 

should be practised when ekadasl is mixed up with the tenth tithi 

and twelfth has to be often answered in different ways according 

as the person who is to observe the fast is a Vaisnava or a 

Smarta. The answer depends on the rules about vedha which 

are rather complicated. It is not possible within the space at 

my disposal to go into details. Those who want to make a deep 

study of this matter may consult Hemadri on Kala pp. 206-388, 

Kalanimaya pp. 233-356, Tithitattva pp 104-108, Samaya- 

prakasa pp. 66-74, Nirnayasindhu pp 37-44, Smrtimuktaphala 

(on Kala) pp. 839-844), Dhaxmasindhu (pp. 16-19). 

Ekadasl, like all other tithis, is of two kinds, viz sampurna 
and viddha or khands The general definition 283 of the sampurna 
tithi is that when a tithi has the extent of 60 ghatikas 
commencing from the time of sunrise it is called sampurna To 
this ekadasl was stated by the Skandapurana 289 to be an excep- 
tion In the case of Ekadasl the Garudapurana 290 and Bhavisya

114 Htstory of Lharmasastra [Sea I, Oh. V 

lay down that ekadasl is sampurna only when it exists also two 
muhuitas (i, e i ghatikas) before sunrise of the day on which it 
exists for the whole civil day. 

The Narada and other puranas condemn fast on ekadasl 
mixed with dasaml NaradapurSna (purvardha, chap 29. 39-40) 
says 'the sixth tifihi mixed with the 5th, the seventh mixed with 
the 9th and ekadasl mixed with dasaml — a fast should never ha 
observed on these; all should accept (for fast) ekadasl free from 
dasaml; dasaml joined to ekadasl destroys spiritual merit 
acquired m three past lives'. This aversion to dasaml was 
probably due to the fact that dasaml finds no place in the famous 
Vuqmaial-ya and the pair that is commended is that of ekadasl 
and dvadasl (and not of ekadasl and dasaml) One well-known 
verse is. Gandharl observed a fast on ekadasl mixed with 
dasaml; her one hundred sons (the Eauravas) perished (in the 
Bharata war); therefore one should give up that kind of ekadasl 
for a fast w The Nfiradapurana (purvardha, chap. 29 ) devotes 
15 verses to the discussion of Ekadasl and Dvadasl 

In the Brahmavaivartapurana quoted at great length by 
Hemadri on Ksla (pp 255-259) four kinds of vedhas of ekadasl 
by dasaml (viz. arunodaya-vedha, ativedha, mahavedha and 
Yoga ) are mentioned, but they are passed over here In the case 
of Vaisnavas, if dasaml extends on a civil day beyond 56 
qhatilcas from sunrise, then ekadasl follows and continues for the 
whole of the next cml day, there is then what is caBec! 
Arunodayavedha and Vaisnavas cannot observe afastonsnoh 
an ekadasl which is preceded by Arunodayavedha The same 
result follows if dasaml extends up to 3, 2 or one ghatika before 
sunrise or dasaml persists till the exact time when the sun rises 
and then ekadasl starts (when there is what is ^^ suryodaya- 
vedha ) A Vaisna va in deciding on what tithi to fast is affected 
by both arunodayavedha and suryodayavedha i e even : xl 
ekadasi exists for full 60 gbatte after sunrise on a civil day when 
dasaml precedes it by four ghatfe, oi by three, twooroneghatt 
OT^hen dasaml exists for one moment at sunr ise and Jfren

is on the day which is wholly covered by dvadasl and the parana 
is on the next day when dvadasl ends. In any cases other than 
those specified above ekadasl is the fast day and dvadasl is the 
parana day. Naradapurana (purvardha, chap 29 verse 45) pre- 
scribes that if there are two ekadasls, whether in the bright half 
or dark half, a householder should fast on the earlier of the two 
and ascetics (yatis) on the later. SannyasinB and widows are 
governed by the rules for Yaisnavas Smirtas (all those who are 
not Yaisnavas) are not affected by the doctrine of aruQodayavedha 
but only by suryodayavedlia i e. if there is dasaml before sunrise 
and an ekadasl follows from sunrise, smSrtas have to observe a 
fast on the ekadasL There are many texts that are apparently in 
conflict, but the Ealanirnaya (pp 251-256) and Nirnayasindhu 
(pp. 37-44) introduce order by showing that some texts refer to 
Yaisnavas alone, some to Smfirtas alone and same to both. 
The Ekadasltattva (p. 55 ) brings together many of the conclu- 
sions about the fast tithi and the paranatithi 

There are cases where the texts sometimes allow fast on 
ekadasl even though mixed with dasaml. This occurs when 
dvadasl does not exist even for a short time on the 13th tithi. 
But this is allowable only to Smaxtaa and not to Yaisnavas. 
Certain restrictions as to food and physical and mental activities 
had to be observed from the time sankalpa was made to the final 
ceremonies (pat ana) in ekadaslvrata. 292 It may be noted that 
even when a person is in mourning he has to observe ekadasl- 
vrata 293 Certain observances were laid down as common to all 
vratas (including ekadasl) viz. forbearance, truthfulness, 
compassion, charity, purity, restraint of senses, worship of god, 
homa, contentment and not misappropriating another's wealth. J9i 
There were separate rules to be observed on dasaml, ekadaai and 
dvadasl (10th tithi to 12th). They are somewhat overlapping. 
The observances prescribed for dasaml are: vegetables, flesh, 
masura pulse, eating again (after ekahhakta), sexual intercourse,

flesh, -wine, honey, oil, telling an untruth, physical exercise, 
journey, sleeping by day, earning (wealth), oil-cakes, masura 
pulse — one should omit these twelve (on daaaml) 

The restrictions on the day of fast are many, but a few are 
stated here Harlta lays w down : one should on a day of fasting 
avoid speaking with persons guilty of grave sins, heretical 
persons, atheists and the like and also falsehood, gambling and 
the like. The Kurmapurana provides' on the day of vrata one 
should not touoh nor speak nor look at persons that are avtyajas 
(untouchables) and have to live outside the village, a woman 
recently delivered, one guilty of grave sins and a woman in her 
monthly illness. Devak provides. 298 A fast perishes (i.e all 
rewards of observing it are lost) by sleep in the day, by play 
with dice and by sexual intercourse; but in case of great pain 
(or danger) a fast is not affected by drinking water (frequently). 
The Eajamartanda lays down- a man fasting on an EkSdasI 
should not be guilty of telling a lie, gambling, sleeping by day 
and sexual intercourse HemSdn (on vrata voL I p. 331) quoting

ornaments, (rich) clothes, fragrant substances, incense, sandal- 
wood paste, brushing the teeth and collyrium (in the eyes) would 
not vitiate a fast, he is referring to the fast observed by women 
whose husbands are alive. 

On the 12th. the person has to offer worship to Visnu and has 
to avoid sleeping by day, the food belonging to another person, 
eating again after the midday meal (on 12th), sexual intercourse, 
honey, bell-metal vessel, meat, oil 300 The passage in the note 
below is practically the same as the one cited from Brahmanda- 
purana by Hemadri (on Kala p 208) as containing the restric- 
tions about dvadasl. 

The result of the insistence by Vaiscavas on observing a 
fast on ekadasi mixed with dvadasl was often this that in order 
to be able to observe parana on dvadasl before it ended, they had 
to get up very early before dawn, take their bath and compress 
all their morning and midday duties into a short period before 
sunrise. In modern times many orthodox Vaisnavas do this 
and rely on the authority of the NSrada 301 and Skanda puranas 
quoted below. A smrti 302 text goes so far as to prescribe 'on 
seeing that dvadasl exists only for half a kala after nxsitha, a 
(Vaisnava) person should perform all acts proper to be performed 
up till midday following, because Sankara has so ordered*. 
Kala as a measure of time has been variously defined Matsya 
(142 4) and Yayu (100 217-218) say that 30 kalas are equal to a 
muhurta (i. e two ghatikas) ; on the other hand, the Amarakosa 
holds that 360 kalas constitute a muhurta and the K&lanirnaya

accepts this last. Ab the astronomers themselves were at 
variance as to the length of a tithi in question, a plain straight- 
forward rule was proposed that the fast in case of doubt should 
be observed on dvadusl and the p£ran3 should be observed on the 
13th. 903 The rank and file of Vaisnavas are very exclusive and 
bigoted and treat with some contempt everything connected 
with Siva and some of them eat sumptuous food on Sivaratri, 
instead of observing a fast Many of the smSrtas generally 
observe a fast both on the Bksdasl and the Sivaratri (particularly 
the MahaiivarStri i. e on Msgha dark 14th). There have been 
great wrangles and hatreds among Vaisnavas and Saivas 
The Brahmapurana expressly f* states that in the holy 
Furusottamaksetra a temple of Siva was erected an order to put 
a stop to the wranglmgs between Saivas and Bhsgavatas 
(devotees of Visnu) The higher Hindu thought including even 
the Purana excursions in philosophy always held that there 305 is 
only one God, that the one Brahma that is all Intelligence, that 
is incapable of being thoroughly comprehended, that is without 
parts and without body, is imagined to have different visible forms 
for securing the purposes of devotees and that deities deemed to 
have visible forms axe imagined as male or female or as portions 
(of the one brahma). The Mahsbharata and some of the PurSnas 
emphasize that God is one and that there is no difference 
between Siva and Vismi. 30 * Vide Vanaparva 39 76-^,

Eight ktnds of DvSdaiis 119 

BrahmapurSua 130 10-11, 193 51-53, VSmana 67. 27-28, 
Varsha 70. 27, Visnupurana V. 18. 50, Brahmanda HI. 43. 47-51, 
Naradlya I. 2. 32. Some puranas 307 put forward the notion that 
health is secured from (the worship of God as) the Sun, wealth 
from Agni, (true) knowledge from Sankara, and moJesa from 
Visnu. 

Some of the puranas (such as Brahmavaivarta) specially 
mention eight kinds of dvadasls viz. UnmflanI, VaSjulI, 
Trisprsa, PaksavardhinI, Jays, VijayS, JayantI and PapanSsinl. 
Vide Hemadri on Kala pp. 260-263, H. (on vrata) vol. I. p 1214, 
N. S. 43, Sm.K 250-254. Detailed descriptions of these are passed 
over here. Jaya, 308 Vijaya, JayantI and PapanSsinl are dvadasls 
respectively having Punarvasu, Sravana, EohinI, Pusya 
naksatras. Trisprsa is 3 " 9 dvadasl which spreads over three days 
i. e. it exists before sunrise on a certain day, then on the whole 
of the next day from sunrise and for some time (however short) 
after the latter. On these fast should be observed by those 
desirous of destruction of sins and attainment of moksa. 

It would not be out of place to bring together in one place 
the different items that constitute Ekadastvrata. 

On the 10th the performer has a meal at midday (eka- 
bhakta), then he oleans his teeth (not with a twig) but with 
leaves or by rinsing the mouth twelve times with water. Then 
on the night of 10th he gives up his evening meal and begins to 
observe the restrictions indicated above (pp. 115-116). Then on the 
11th after getting up he cleanses the body as well as the mind and 
makes asankalpa in the morning as described above (pp 105-106) 
The sankalpa has to be made at night or in the noon if eksdasl 
is viddb.5 Then he recites thrice the mantra of eight syllables 
(om namo NarSyariaya) on the water in the copper vessel in his 
hands and drinks water therefrom. On the 11th he prepares a

mandapa of flowers, worships the Visnu image therein and offers 
the several upacaras. He fasts that day. He reeites hymns 
of praise to Visnu and falls prostrate on the ground in saluta- 
tion. He then keeps awake at night On the 12th he takes a 
bath in the morning, offers worship to Hari and dedicates his 
fast to the God, recites the mantra (Aj&anatimirandbasya'&o 
cited above p. 105) and performs the parana. This is the 
general outline of kamya ekadaslvrata. In the case of the 
obligatory fast, the performer should abstain from food the whole 
day and also keep the several restrictions to be observed on 
ekadasl (as described above such as not drinking water more 
than once, not sleeping by day &o) The rules for the followers 
of Oditanya about ekadasl as summarised from the Hanbhakti- 
vilasa by Prof &K He in 'Vaisnava faith and Movement* on 
pp 371-875 do not differ much from those stated above. 

A vrata comes to an end by a rite called ndyspana (carrying 
out) or parana or parana The word parana or parana is derived by 
some from the root 'pSra' meaning 310 'to finish an action or rite'. 
The word occurs in the drama Sakuntala referred to above on 
p 46 and in BaghuvamSaH 70 •pratar-yathoktavrata-paranSnte'. 
Vide for parana also Baghuvamsa II 39 and 55 According to the 
Kurma-purSna, one should fast on the ekadasl and parana is to 
be on the 12th but parana should not be done on 13th tithi, sinoe 
that would destroy (the merit) of twelve dvSdaals «» En spite of 
this parana on the 13th 312 tithi had to be allowed under certain 
circumstances e g if ekadasl is mixed with dasaml on a prior 
day and with dvadasl on the next day, then the fast is to be on 
dvadasl but if no dvadasl at all exists on the day after fast, men 
parana may be on th e 13th fathi The Yisnudharmottara

The PSraiiS. 121 

prescribes ' a vrata ends with parana and at the end of a vrata, 
br&hmanas are to be fed; before one vrata is finished one should 
not oommence another '. The general rule is that in all vratas 31 * 
the pSrana is in the morning. One should perform the udyapana 
as laid down in the texts providing for the vrata concerned; a 
vrata becomes fruitless if the udyapana be not performed. If no 
form of udy£pana is prescribed by the texts, the performer should 
perform a lite in consonance with the 315 vrata He should make 
gifts in proportion to his wealth when no form of udyapana is 
mentioned in the texts on a vrata. For making the vrata 
complete he should donate cows and gold. If none of these can 
be given and nothing can be done as laid down in the texts, the 
words of a brahmana alone are sufficient to complete a vrata; 
but if a man receives the blessed words of brahmanas without 
giving a daksina (though able), he goes to hell > 

A difficulty may arise owing to the rules that no fresh vrata 
is to be undertaken till one (prior) vrata is finished and that 
vrata includes its parana. Suppose, a man has undertaken 
years ago to observe two vratas, then he may have to observe 
a fast on ekadasl and also on dvadasl owing to another vrata 
already undertaken Parana involves bhojcma (taking food). 
But this is impossible if one has to undergo two fasts succes- 
sively The remedy is that at the end of the first vrata the 
pari ormer (who has to undergo two fasts) should sip water. The 
Veda says that when a man partakes of water it is neither 
eating nor non-eating. 316

CHAPTER VI 

CATURMASYA 

On Asadha-sukla ekadaft or dvadasl or paurnims m or on the 
day when the Sun enters the Zodiacal sign Cancer, caturmSsya- 
vrata is to be observed. Whenever it may be begun it is to be 
finished on Kartika-sukla IS. The performer should observe a 
a fast that day, worship Visnu (image) and pray as follows: 
(Garudapurana I 191 2-3) 'OGod! I have undertaken this vrato 
in your presence; may it succeed without obstacles if you 
become favourable tome, after I undertake this vrataifldie 
when it is half-finished, may it become completely fulfilled 
through your favour *1 The vxata may be begun even when 
Jupiter or Venus has become invisible and the like The per- 
former has to give up some edible during the four months, viz 
vegetables in Sravana, curds in Bhadrapada, milk in Asvina and 
pulses in KSrtika According to some authorities, he has to 
give up some or all vegetables for all the four months. The 
performer is asked to give up many other things also such as 
sleeping on a cot, meat, honey &o When the vrata is finished, 
he invites brahmanas, announces to them what restrictions he 
had undertaken, feeds them, gives them daksina, and recites the 
prayer *0 Lord J this vrata was undertaken by mem order to 
please you, O Janardanal may it become complete through your 
favour, whatever defeot there may bel* This vrata is even 
now observed, particularly by women The Krtyatattva (p 435), 
Vratarka, Vrataprakasa (folio 105a) and other medieval digests 
quote long passages from the Matsya, Bhavisyottara (L6-9) 
and other puranas about the results of giving up certain things 
in the Gatunnasyavrata A few passages are set out for sample, 
•a man secures a sweet voice by giving up jaggery, has charm- 
ing limbs by giving up oil, by giving up ghee he secures beauty, 
by giving up fruits he becomes intelligent and has many sons, 
by giving up vegetables and leaves he secures wel l-cook*" 1

dishes, by giving up ouids and milk he goes to the world 
of cows*. 318 

In the Vedio period there were sacrifices called OaturmSsyas 
(seasonal sacrifices) that were performed on the Full Moon days 
of Fhalguna (or Oaitra), of Saadha and Kartika and were 
respectively called Vaisvadeva, Varunapraghasa and Sakamedha 
(the fourth called Sunasn-Iya need not detain us). Vide H. of 
Bo, vol IL pp. 1091-1106. It was expressly stated by Apastamba 
Srauta VHL 4. 13 that Vaisvadeva (parvan of CaturmSsya) was 
to be offered in vasanta and Varunapraghasa in the rainy 
Beason. It may be noted that the sacrificer in these seasonal 
sacrifices had to keep certain observances such as sleeping on 
the ground, 319 avoiding meat, honey, salt, sexual intercourse and 
bodily decorations, which closely resemble the restrictions laid 
on the person observing Ekadaslvrata. The Yajfiavalkyarsmrti 310 
d. 125) makes it obligatory on a person of means to offer a 
Soma sacrifice every year, a pasubandha in each ayana, the 
Sgrayanesti (performed when new crops are ready) and the 
oSturmasyas. The caturmasyas meant here are the Vedio ones 
mentioned above and not the Pauranika vratas of oaturmasya. 

The Yajnavalkya-emrti employs the word vrata in the sense 
of prayasoitta in IH. 251, 252, 254, 266, 269, 282, 298, 300, in the 
sense of 'brahmacarya' in 1JL 15, and in the sense of the food 
to be subsisted upon in HI 289, but hardly ever in the sense of 
a rite to be observed on a tithi or week day or naksatra as in the 
puranas This at least indicates that the vratas mentioned in 
the puranas had not attained prominence in the time of the 
Yajnavalkya-smrti, which, in spite of its containing over 1000 
verses, hardly ever refers to any vrata in the sense of the 
puranas.

Vratas called Nagapancaml, Manasapuja, 
Raksabandhana, Krsnajanmastarm 

In the month of Sravana there aie several important vratas, 
one of which is Nagapancaml on the 5th of the bright half of 
Sravana The Nagapancaml is observed in different ways in all 
parts of India Some hold that, instead of AksayyatrtJya, 
Nagapancaml is the one half auspicious day out of 3} most 
auspicious days in the year. The Bhavisyapuraua, Brahma- 
parva (chapter 32 verseB 1-39), expatiates on Nagapancaml 
Krtyakalpataru (on vrata) pp 87-90 and HemSdri (on vrata 
vol. I pp 557-560) quote several verses from the Bhavisya- 
purana Briefly, the Bhavisya 321 says when men on the 5th 
hafihe with milk the nagas called VSsuki, Taksaka, Kalrya,Mani- 
bhadra, Airavata, Dhrtarastra, Karkotaka and Dhanafijaya, these 
giVea&Acrya (freedom from danger) to then: families A legend 
is told (in Bhavisya I. 32) that KadrB, mother of nagas, laid a 
bet with her sister Vinata about the colour of the tail of Indra's 
horse called Ucoaih-sravas, Kadru asserting that the tail was 
black though the horse was white and Vinata saying that the 
body and tail were white and when the nagas refused to practise 
the deceit whereby they were to become the dark hair in the 
horse's tail, Kadru cursed them thafrfire would burn them (in the 
aarpasattra of Janamejaya) Persons should make golden, silver 
or clay images of nagas, should worship them with Karavlraana 
JatI flowers and incense etc , feed brahmanas with ghee pewasa 
etc. and should bathe nagas with milk The result would be that 
nagas would bestow on the worshippers safety (from snake-tote;

from snakes. Vide Hemadri on Kala p. 621, K Vp, 413, K B 
p. 234 In Saurastra Nagapaficaml is observed in Sravana dark 
half. 

It appears that in Bengal and south India (but not in 
Maharastra) there is worship of ManasadevI in one's own court- 
yard on a branch of the snuhl plant on the 5th of Sravana dark 
half. The Rajamartanda has four verses, one of which is quoted 
below. Samayapradlpa and Krtyaratnakara refer to the worship 
of ManasadevI. The Tithitattva 322 (p. 33) contains the dhyana 
of ManasadevI taken from Fadmapurana. First, there is a 
sankalpa 30 about the worship of ManasadevI in order to get rid

How and when serpent worship arose in India is a difficult 
problem TheRgveda contains no referenoeto snake worship 
On the contrary the Vedio god Indra is said to be the killer of 
ahi (a serpent) in $g. U. 30. 1, H 19. 3 and the slaughter of ah 
is frequently mentioned as in Bg. X 165. 6, III 47 4. That ahi 
meant a serpent with a hood is clear from 8g. VX 75 14 
(ahiriva hhogaih paryeti bahum). In Br. Up 17. 4. 7 and Frasha 
IV. 5 there are references to the cast-off slough of serpents 
(mentioned as 'pSdodara' whose feet are inside its body) 
and in $g IX. 86 44 (ahir najurnSmati sarpati tvaoam) 
also. But in many passages of the Rgveda (such as X 32 11) 
ahi appears to have a metaphorical sense and refers to a demon 
likeVrtra that prevented wat ers f rom flowing down. In the 
Tai. S IV. 2. 8. 3. and VSj 8. (J8JIX 6-8) there are three verses 
that contain salutations to serpents. In the Atharvaveda (Vffl. 
14. 13-15) there is a reference to serpents some of whioh like 
Taksaka and DhrtarSstra are named The Kathaka S V. 6 
enumerates the pitrs, sarpas, gandharvas, waters and herbs as 
paficajana, and the Ait Br. XHL 7 asserts that gods, men, 
gandharvas, apsaraseB, snakes and pitrs were paficajana. This 
cannot be the meaning of 'paficajanah.' in Bg.X53 4. The 
above passages show that sarpas had come to be a clan m«> 
gandharvas in late vedio times 

In the Asv. gr IX 1 1-15, the Pfiraskaragrhya IX 14 and 
other grhya sutras a rite called 'sarpabalT, (offering to serpents) 
was performed on the Bull Moon day of Srfivana Vide H. of

the country of the Nagas (probably a tribe that bad naga as 

their emblem) and took as bis wife Ulupl, a Naga princess who 

was smitten by love. Babhruvahana, son of OitrSngada, fought 

with Axjuna who had come to Manipura for protecting the 

Asvamedha horse, was killed by Babhruvahana and restored to 

life with the help of a Sanjlvana jewel (JLsvamedhikaparva 

chap. 79-^81). Serpents came to be associated with both Visnu 

and Siva. Visnu is said to sleep on the hoods of Sesa-naga 

(Vanaparva 203. 12 and 272. 38-39) and Siva wears serpents on 

his body like yajnopavlta (Anusasana 14. 55). 3JS In the 

Bhagavadglta X. 28-29 Lord Krsna identifies himself with 

Vfisuki among serpents and Ananta among nagas What 

difference is made between 'sarpa' and 'naga* is not clear. 

Probably 'sarpa* means all creeping things, while naga means 

'the cobra'. The Puranas are full of Btories about nagas 

Vide J. Ph. Vogel's painstaking work (Indian Serpent Lore, 1926) 

based on the MahShhSrata, the Puranas and the BajataranginL 

It appears that serpent worship arose gradually from the fear of 

serpents that must have taken a heavy toll of life, particularly at 

the beginning of the rainy season. Even in these days about 10000 

people die of snake-bite every year in India, while persons killed 

by aU wild animals are hardly 3000 Why the tithi was changed 

from Full Moon (for Sarpabali in the grhya sutras) to the 5th of 

the bright half is not clear. It may be due to the slight change 

in the time of the onset of rains owing to the precession of 

the equinoxes. Yide Fergusson's 'Tree and Serpent worship' 

pp. 1-75 and Plate XV which reproduces the sculptures on the 

eastern gateway of Sanobi, where occurs the figure of five-headed 

Naga. Stone images of serpents under sacred trees like pippala 

are common in the Dravida country and a few temples dedicated 

to nagas exist Buoh as the one at Battis Shiralen in Satara 

District and at Bhom-paranden in Hyderabad. 

On the Full Moon of Sravana there is in the afternoon a 
ceremony called Raksahandhana (tying the protective amulet). 
It 1b described by HemSdri on vrata, vol D. pp. 190-195, N. S. 
P 121, P.O. 284-285, Yratarka (folio 335a-336a) One should at

other human beings should get the amulet tied after honouring

that Indranf tied on the right hand of Indra a protective amulet 
whereby he was enabled to vanquish the amras This tying

This ceremony of tying an amulet on the right wrist is still 
in vogue and priests go about tying these amulets and receive 
some fee for doing so Mukerji (p 81) is unduly harsh on the 
poor brahmanas when he says that it is a day of blackmail by 
the priests Women in Gujarat and Borne other places tie silken 
amulets round the wrists of their brothers and give and receive 
presents 

On the Full Moon day of Sravana it is usual on the sea 
coast of western India (particularly in Konkan and Malabar) not 
only for Hindus, but also for Moslems and Parsis of the 
merchant class to go to the sea and offer flowers and a cocoanut 
to the sea. The sea becomes less rough and the violence of the 
monsoon winds abates after the lull Moon of SrSvana and the 
cocoanut is offered to the sea god (Varuna) in order that he may 
make sea voyage for vessels of merchandise safe

■ Antiquity of Krsga warship 129. 

- la some PurSna passages it is declared that JanmastamI 
is celebrated on the 8th of the dark half of Bhadrapada. The 
explanation is that in those passages the months are Purnimanta 
and the dark half is in these months the first paksa. 327 The 
Padma (HI 13)*Matsya 56, Agni 183 contain numerous verses 
on the greatness (mahatmya) of KrsnajanmSstaml. 

It would not be out of place to say a few words about Krsna 

and about the antiquity of Krsna warship. There is a reference 

in the Ohandogya-upanisad (HE. 17. 6) to Krsna Devaklputra 

receiving instruction from Ghora Angirasa. There was a Yedic 

poet named Krsna who calls upon the Asvinsto listen to his 

invocation in 3jtg. VHI. 85. 3 and the AnnkramanI assigns B>g. 

VIH. 86-87 to Krsna Angirasa. Jain tradition regards Krsna 

as contemporaneous with Femi, the 22nd Tlrthankara, and from 

the account of the 63 great men of Jain pre-histary about one 

third are shown as associated with Krsna. The life of Krsna 

as gathered from the Mahabharata is a composite one. In some 

passages he is depicted as a Yfidava prince, the staunches* friend 

of the Pandavas 328 (and particularly of Arjuna), as a great 

warrior, statesman and philosopher. In other passages he is 

identified with the Supreme Lord of the worlds and as Visnu 

Himself (Santi 47. 28, Drona 146. 67-68, Kama 87. 74, Vanaparva 

49. 20, BMsma 21. 13-15). There are most sublime praises of 

Krsna put in the mouths of Yudhisthira (Drona 149. 16-33), 

IteaupadI (Vanaparva 263. 8-16) and Bhlsma when about to die 

(Anusagana 167. 37-45). We have further information about 

him from the Harivamsa, the Visnupurana, Vayu (98. 100-102), 

the Bhagavata and Brahmavaivarta that deal with KrSna's 

romantic career among cowherds, which is wanting in the 

Mahabharata.

130 History gf Dharmasaslra \ Sec I, Oh. YD. 

It appears from Panini {17. 3 98 ) 329 that there were people 

in his day described asVasudevaka and Arjunaka that were 

devoted to Vasudeva and Arjuna Patafijali in his MahsbhSsya 

mentions several persons and incidents connected with Zrsna, 

On Vartika 6 to Pan. HI. 1. 26 the MahSbhasya gives two 

examples 'Kamsam ghatayati' (meaning "he tells the story of the 

slaughter of Eamsa*)and 'Balim bhandhayati' (meaning 1 he 

narrates the story of the imprisonment of Bali') InVartika2to 

Pan. HI, 1. 238 the word 'Govinda' is derived (from go + vinda). On 

Vartika 2 to Pan III 2 111 Patafijali gives the example 'Jaghsna 

Kamsam kfla Vasudevah* (Vasudeva, they say, killed Kamsa) and 

implies that the incident occurred long ago which the speaker 

could not have seen but was popularly known 330 This is a 

quarter of an UpendravajrS or Upajatl verse. Patafijali names 

SatyabhSmS with its shortened form Shams (Kielhorn, vol I 

p 111), the words 'Vasudevavargyah' and •Akruravargyah' occur 

(on Vartika 11 on Pan.1V. 2 104) On Pan. IV. 1 114 (rsyandbaka- 

vrsni-kurubhyas-ca) under vartika 7 Patafijali mentions 

TTgrasena as a scion of the Andhakas and Vasudeva and 

Baladeva of the Vrsnis Patafijali quotes half of an Anustubh 

verse 'Sankarsana-dvitryasya balam Krsnasya vardbatam 

(Kielhorn's ed. vol Lp 426). Patafijali is regarded by most 

modern scholars as having flourished in the 2nd century B 0. 

(about 150 B. O ) Therefore it follows that some poetic work or 

works that referred to incidents of Ersna's career (snoh as 

Kamsavadha) had been composed some centuries before Hie

Antiquity of Kreya worship 131 

and the source of the universe. The Ghosundi inscription of 
2nd or 1st century B C. mentions the hall of worship of Sankar* 
Sana and Vasudeva (E I 16 pp. 25-87, E. I 22 p. 198, 1 A. voL 
61 p. 203) addressed as ' Bhagavat ' and ' sarvesvara '. Hanaghat 
oave inscriptions of about 200 B. C mention both (A. S. W. I. 
vol V pp. 60-74). The Besnagar column ( Garuda-dhvaja ) 
Vaisnava inscription 332 where the Bhagavata Heliodorus, son 
of Diya, hailing from Taksasila and Yavana ambassador of 
king Antalikita (Antalkidas) to king BhSgabhadra mentions 
Vasudeva as ' devadeia'. The preceding items of evidence 
indicate that the worship of Vasudeva was prevalent in northern 
and central India from at least 500 B. 0.. if not earlier. Vide 
B G. Bhandatkar's 'Yaisnavism, Saivism &e.' pp. 1-45 for the 
Various phases of the Krsna cult and its antiquity. 

lb is rather surprising that the passages quoted in the 
medieval works on KrsnajanmastamI are mostly borrowed from 
the Shavisya, Bhavisyottara, Skanda, Yisnudharmotfeara, 
Naradlya and Brabmavaivarta puranas, but hardly ever from 
the Bhagavata-purana which is the Yeda of the Yaisnavas 
of later medieval and modern times. The description of Krsna's 
birth in the Bhagavata is vague and commonplace. All that 333 
is said there is that the time when Krsna was born was endowed 
with all good characteristics and was very charming, that the 
quarters looked very clear and the sky was lit up by bright stars, 
that the wind that blew was very pleasing to the skin and laden 
with fine fragrance and that when JanSrdana was born of 
DevakI it was midnight and darkness had enveloped everything. 

In the Bhavisyottara (44. 1-69) Krsna himself is represented 
as narrating to Yudhistbira the incidents of Janm&staml-vrata: 
'I was born of Vasudeva and DevakI on the 8th of BhSdrapada

Moon was in the sign of the Bull (Taurus) and there was Bahinl 
naksatra ' (verses 74-75), when on the 8th of the dark half of 
Sravana there is Rohinl-naksatra, the tithi is called JayantI, if 
a man observes a fast on that tithi, that destroys his sins 
committed in childhood, youth, old age and many previous 
lives' The result is that if there be no Bohinl naksatra on 
Sravana dark half 8th, it is simply JanmSstaml, but when 
Bohinl is joined to dark 8th of Sr&vana it is JayantI. The 
Bajamartanda has two verses on this. 331 

The important question is whether the Janmastaml-vrata 
and Jayantl-vrata are really only one vrata or whether they are 
two separate vratas The Kalanirnaya, 335 after a long discus- 
sion in whioh MimSmsa principles contained in Jai H % 83 and 
IV. 1. 22-84 are relied upon, arrives at the conclusion that the 
two are separate vratas on the grounds that the two names are 
different (viz Janmastaml-vrata and Jayantlvrata), then- occa- 
sions (mmtlta) are different (the first depends only on dark 
AstamI, white the latter exists only if there is Kohwl on 8th of 
dark half of Sravana) and their characteristics are different m 
that in JanmSstamlvrata sastra requires only a fast, while in 
Jayantlvrata the sastra requires a fast and also gifts and the 
like. Besides, JanmSstamlvrata is obligatory (n*aw), since the 
texts only speak of the incurring of sin if it be not performed, 
while Jayantlvrata is both -nOua and ffimya in that the sSstras 
connect it with special rewards in addition to the incurring of 
sin by its non-observance Further, the two are separately

mentioned in the same vmses. 336 Hemadri, Madanaratna, the 

Hirnayasindhu (p. 126) and several works hold the view that the 

two are different But the N. S notes 337 that in its day people 

observed only JanmSstaml-vrata and not Jayantl-vxata. On 

the other hand the Jayantinimaya (p. 25) states that people 

generally celebrate JayantI only (and not Janmastami). This 

variance is probably due to the fact that the two works (N. S. 

and J. N.) belong to the north and south of India. The Samaya- 

mayukha 338 and Purusarthaointtmani ( p. 117 ) very severely 

criticize the views ofMadhava set out above from the Kala- 

nirnaya, one of the principal arguments in these last being that 

the MJmamsa rules relied upon by M&dhava apply to rites, but 

Jayanti is the name of a tithi i. e the 8th of dark half when 

conjoined to Bohim. The Jayantlnirnaya of Harita Yenkata- 

natha holds that the two are different and that both are nitya as 

well as kamya (pp. 4-5 and p. 30). It farther points out (p 19) 

that in Janmastamtvrata tithi is the principal matter while in 

JayantI it is the naksatra (Rohinl) that is principal 

Two discordant notes are struck by the Yaraha-purana and 
by the Harivamsa The former says 339 that Krsna was born on 
12th of Asadha bright half. According to the Harivamsa q by 
Hemadri and Jimutavahana, the naksatra was Abhijit when

possible that these two represent some older traditions about the 
date of the birth of Krsna 

Another important point very much canvassed in the 
medieval digests is about the exact tithi and time when the 
JanmSstamlvrata is to be celebrated The K. Iff (pp 215-224), 
Krtyatattva pp 438-444, Tithitattva pp. 47-51, Samaya- 
mayukha p. 50-51, IT. S pp. 128-130 and several other digests 
state certain conclusions about this 

It is clear from almost all Furanas and other workB on 
JanmastamI that the principal time for the celebration of the 
birth of Krsna is the midnight 3fl of the 8th of Sravana dark 
half (Bhadrapada dark, if the month is Purnimanta). This 
tithi is of two kmdB viz (1) without Rohinl naksatra and 
(2) with Rohinl naksatra. In each of these two, the Kfilanirnaya 
of MSdhava (pp 218-224 ), the Hirnayasradhu (pp 128-130 ), the 
Dharmasmdhu (pp 64-«7) and other digests set out several 
possible alternative combinations The Nirnayamrta (pp 56- 
58 ) mentions as many as 18 kinds, eight of the suddka tithi, 8 of 
the vtddhS tithi and two more, one being the one where Rohinl- 
naksatra is there at midnight and the other being NavamI 
joined to Rohinl and having either Wednesday or Monday. A 
discussion of these would be somewhat complicated and hardly 
otherwise than of academical interest to modern readers. There- 
fore, all these alternatives are not set out here, ^a*'*™ 
brief conclusions put forth by the Tithitattva are given V 
way of sample. TheBe are: If JayantI (AstamI ^BdnnU

the two; if there is no JayantI, then ifce fast is to be observed

Items in Janmastamivrata 135 

If JayantI fast occurs on Wednesday or Monday there are 
far greater results and such a fast is superior to crores of other 
vratas and the man who ohserves a fast on JayantI conjoined 
to Wednesday or Monday would not he born again, 313 

The main items in JanmSstamlvrata are fast, worship of 
Ersna, jsgara (keeping awake at night, listening to and repeat- 
ing hymns of praise and stories about Krsna's exploits), pSrana. 

The medieval digests such as Tithitattva (pp. 42-47 ), the 
Samayamayukha (pp. 58-57), Kalatattvavivecana (pp. 53-56), 
VratarSja (pp 374-577), DharmaBindhu (pp 68-69) contain a 
lengthy procedure of Janmastamivrata based principally on 
Bhavisyottara chap. 55. A brief summary from the first two 
works (which agree in the main in most respects) is set out 
below. 

On the day of the fast in the morning the devotee should invoke 
the presence of the Sun, Moon, Yama, Time, the two twilights, 
the (five) elements, Day and Night, Wind, the lord of the quarters, 
the earth, the sky, the denizens of aerial regions and gods. 341 
He should hold iu his hand a copper vessel filled with water, 
some fruits, flowers and whole rice-grains, refer to the month &c. 
and make a sankalpa 'I shall perform the Krsnastaml-vrata, for 
securing a certain reward or for the removal of my sins'. He 
then repeats four mantras addressed to VSsudeva, one of whioh 
is quoted below. 315 After repeating the mantras he should dis- 
charge the water in the vessel He should construct a delivery 
hall for Devakl having auspicious jars full of water and mango 
leaves, garlands of flowers, fragrant with burnt aguru and

from Yasudeva for the protection of Yedas spiead over the earth. 
Let there be peace I Let there be bliss 1 He should then take out 
the image of Krsna, donate it to a brahmana and bring the vrata 
to a close after performing parana. 

The procedure in the Dharmasindhu (pp. 68-69) is more 
elaborate than the above, though no essential difference exists. 
It makes use of Vedio mantras (from Rg. X. 90. 1-16) along with 
Pauranika mantras, while in the Samaya-mayukha and Tithi- 
tattva no Yedio mantra is expressly mentioned As regards 
jagara the Dharmasindhu provides that the stories 30 about 
Krsna may be made striking by reciting poems composed in 
regional languages, that Yedic hymns may have at their end 
Pauranika stories recited, that visual representations (such as 
dances) may be resorted to, that this is a procedure meant for the 
three higher varnas, but in the case of sudras it is not proper to 
follow the same procedure; they should omit Yedio hymns but 
may engage in music and PaurSnika recitations. 

One question often raised in some of the medieval digests on 
DhaxmasSstea is : what is the principal matter in Janmastaml- 
vrata. Some held that both fast (upavasa) and worship (puja) 
are principal and they rely on a Bhavisyapurana 349 passage 
'when at midnight on the 8th of the dark half there is Bohinl, 
worship of Krsna destroys sins committed in three lives; a man 
observing a fast then and performing worship of Hari does not 
sink*. The Samayamayukha, after an elaborate discussion in 
which Mlmamsa doctrines such as those in Jai J. 4. 1-3 are 
employed, arrives at the conclusion that the fast is only an 
auxiliary (anga), while worship (puja) is the principal tiling. 
On the other hand the Tithitattva 350 relying on the verse of the 

'Srawft &^fo% I M<5R)'tj, pp. 70-71. The void 'spjfarara;' is used becanse 
In those days sadras were not entitled to study and recite Vedic Mantras

Bhavisya opening the description of the vrata 'On that day one 
should accept the restrictions of upavSsa' and also Mlmamsa 
doctrines holds that upavasa is the principal matter and pBjfi is 
an afiga (auxiliary matter). The JayantTnirnaya contained in 
the Dasanirnayl of HSrlta Yenkatanatha discusses at length the 
two (pp. 3 ff). This subject need not be pursued much further. 

It has already been stated above that every vrata requires a 
porana as the last item, that pSrana takes place the day after 
the day of the fast and that it is generally performed in the 
morning. There are certain special rules about the pSrana of 
JanmSstamI fast and JayantI fast. A few dicta of the purSnas 
may be first noted. The Brahmavaivarta 351 states 'one should 
never perform parana while astaml tithi is running or Echini 
naksatra is still there on the Astaml ; (if one does so) one destroys 
what he has done previously and the fruits acquired by the fast. 
A tithi destroys eight-fold, while a naksatra does so fourfold s 
therefore one should perform the pSrana (of JanmSstamI) at the 
end of the tithi and naksatra'. The Naradapurana 852 remarks 
' when a fast has to be observed on the conjunction of a tithi and 
naksatra, parana should not be done until at least one of the two 
has ended; when a vrata falls on a conjunction (of tithi and 
naksatra), parana should be done only when one of the two is 
separated (i e. ends)'. The Vahni-purSna provides 'parana » 
commended at the end of the naksatra orat the end of the tttta • 
Both the Tithitattva and the Krtyatattva 3SJ arrive on interpret- 
ing these and other verses at the following conclusions. PSian ?

the Wo ends before mahamsa and the other during mah&nisS 

'or after it, parana should he observed at the end of one of 

the two; "when both exist during the period of mahanisathen 

one should perform parana in the morning at the end of the 

festival'. At the end of the parana the performer repeats the 

'mantra ' salutations to Qovinda, who is Being, who is the ruler 

of (all) beings, who is iihe lord of (all) beings and who is the 

Bouroe of all beings'. 351 The above statement shows that in 

certain oases the parana of Janmastamlvrata may be at night, 355 

'particularly for vaisnavas who perform the vrata as a duty and 

'not for any reward. 

There is a difference of meaning between udygpana and 
Parana. Some vratas like EkadasI and Janmastaml are per- 
formed throughout a man's life; in such cases there is only 
Parana after the fast on every occasion that a fast is observed. 
If a man undertakes a vrata only once and finishes it, then the 
concluding rites of the vrata are called udyapana, 

' Besides the items mentioned above, it is the practice, parti- 
cularly of boys and common people in Maharastra, to hang up 
pots full of curds and buttermilk on the day after the birth of 
.Ersna is celebrated, to play underneath the pot, sing songs and 
then pierce the pot and get drenched by curds and buttermilk 
running out from the holes made.- This is probably due to the 
legends associated with Krsna's boyhood among cowherds. The 
Bhagavata 356 expressly says that the cowherds sprinkled each 
other on Krsna's birth with curds, milk, ghee, and smeared each 
other with these. This is called ' GopSlakalS in Maharastra. 
But thiB is not observed in other parts of India such as 
Saurastra. Surprisingly enough the KrsnajanmastamI festival 
'does not, like the BsmanavamI festival, figure intheKrtya- 
kalpataru on vrata. One cannot account for this omission.

But in the jffaiyataklla section 887 of the same work, a brief 
procedure of Kxenajanmastaml (which is word for word the 
same iu the Kxtyaratnakara) different from the one opacified 
above from the Titiutattva and other works, is set out It is as 
follows: On the 8th of the dark half of HhSdrapada was horn 
in Kaliyuga in the 28th (kalpa?), Krsna, eon of Devakl, for 
removing the burden (of the earth) and the reduction of ksatriyas. 
He (hiB image) should therefore he worshipped on that day, as 
also (of) Devakl and Yasoda with sandalwood paste, flowers, 
incense, various fruits and foods and dishes prepared from 
barley and wheat together with cow's milk At night the 
devotee should keep awake with, songs and dances Then on 
the 9th about the time of aiunodaya (4 ghatikas before 
sunrise) women dressed in red clothes and decked with garlands 
of flowers should carry the images of these (Krsna, DevakI and 
•Yasoda) to a holy river bank or to a charming and unfrequented 
lake, wherein (hey should themselves take then- bath and also 
bathe the images f then returning home they should eat a meal 
of barley together with jaggery, honey, ghee and black pepper. 

Before closing this account of JanmSstamI reference must 
he made to a paper read in 1867 before the Berlin Akademie dsr 
Wissensohaf ten by the renowned German scholar, Prof. A Weber. 
The Bubjeot of the paper was * An investigation into the origin 
of the festival of KTSnajanmSfltaml' and the paper ^J*™ 8 * 
into four parts; the first dealt with the sources (an Kaglisn 
translation of it by E. Behatsek was pnhbshea in Intoan

Weber's theory about Jatari&stami 141 

&n. An English translation of this part appeared in Indian 
Antiquary, vol DX pp. 21-25 and pp. 47-52, This paper, though 
it is a monument of learning and patient industry ( for that 
period when very few Sanskrit books had been printed ), gave 
rise to severe criticism owing to its fantastic and perverse 
conclusion about KrsnajanmastamI ritual being borrowed from 
Christian representations of Christ and his mother Mary. In 
t A. vol. HL p. 300 QrowBe attacked it very severely. In spite 
of all criticisms the tenacious German scholar stuck to his guns 
and launched an attack against his critics, particularly against 
Dr. Bajendralal Mitra, in L A, vol IX. pp. 226-229. As hardly 
any Sanskrit scholar in these days would espouse the theory 
put forward by Weber, I do not think that I should waste much 
time over a refutation thereof. Most European scholars, nurtured 
on the vaunted intellectual eminence of the anoient Greeks and 
on the intolerant attitude of Christianity towards other faiths, 
when they became acquainted with things Indian and studied 
Sanskrit, were obsessed ( though not very obviously expressed) 
by two notions, viz. much in India that resembled what prevailed 
'in the West must have been borrowed from the West and 
further, that Indians, who had allowed themselves to be invaded 
by outsiders and governed by foreigners for centuries, must not 
have been good at anything. These two notions gave rise to 
many untenable theories such as the following: the B&mayana 
was borrowed from Homer's Iliad, the art of writing was un- 
known to Panini, the Brahml script was based on Phoenician or 
Aramaic script, that the Gits was based on the Bible, that the 
very anoient Indian naksatra system was borrowed either from 
the Chinese, the Babylonians or Arabs. Most of such theories 
were the result of little knowledge and the non-recognition of 
certain oommon sense rules and have now been consigned to the 
limbo of deserved oblivion. The common sense rule is that when 
a thing or a state of things has existed for centuries in a certain 
country or among a certain people, the burden of proving that 
tt was borrowed by that country or people from outside is very 
heavy on those who assert such borrowing; mere similarities 
can never he held to amount to any evidence of borrowing at 
all; scholars should be very chary of confidently asserting 
borrowing and should put forward their conclusions very cauti- 
ously. It would not be irrelevant to point out the main circum- 
stances on which Weber, often a champion of lost causes, relied 
for his theory. 



14s History of Dharmaiuslra [See. I, Oh TO 

The firafc is that in the ritual of Krsnsstaml contained in 
some digests (that said that they borrowed the passage from 
Bhavisyottara ) the image of Krsna was to be shown *■ as suckl- 
ing at the breast of DevakI, that this is a unique direction, that 
in the Ramanavaml festival which is similar to JanmSstamI the 
image of Rama is not required to he suckling at the breast of 
Kausalya, that this detail was copied from the representation of 
the Madonna Lactans. Weber relied ( vide I A. vol HI p. 51 ) on 
one De Bossi who said that pictures of infant Christ at the breaBt 
existed in 2nd century A D. Weber brushed aside the testimony 
of other scholars that the Madonna with the child was a subject 
little known to the early christian centuries and the opinion of 
other scholars that the representations of the Madonna Lactans 
are extremely rare in Byzantine and Russian art (I A. vol HI 
p 48) and almost always of very late date. Weber makes a 
mountain of a molehill. The image of Rama is also described as 
lying on the lap of the mother Zausalya. 35 * Purther, all purSnaB 
do not provide that the image of Krsna was to be suckling at the 
breast HemSdri, in describing the Jayantlvrata from the 
PurSnas, shows that the image was to be on the lap of the mother 
DevakI. 360 Was the Hindu imagination so poor that when they 
could describe the image of Rama or Krsna as lying on the 
mother's lap they could not also imagine that it could be shown 
as suckling at the breast and had to run to the West to copy 
that detail from representations of the Madonna and the child 
thousands of miles away? 

The 2nd point made much of by Weber was that Narada is 
represented as having brought from Sveta-dvlpa ( whiteland) the 
doctrine of salvation by faith. Weber holds that SvotadvJpo 
was Alexandria, while Lassen holds that it was Parthia If we 
read the description of Svetadvlpa in the Ssntiparva ( chapters

336-339 ) and in such Puranas ** as Vamana (ohap. 25. 16 and 60. 
56) and Kurma (L 49) it would be clear that Svetadvlpa was an 
imaginary or mythical place where everything was white, where 
Vismiand the gods dwelt and that it had no earthly existence 
at least in the minds of the authors who wrote the above works. 

The third important point according to Weber was that 
certain incidents in Krsna's life suoh as Kaliya-mardana are 
similar to those in Christianity. Weber himself says that victory 
over Kaliya is a travesty of the christian tradition of the serpent. 
It appears to me that there is nothing common between the two 
except the word serpent.

offer warship to UmS by means of the 16 upacaras with 
appropriate mantraB such as avShana (invoking to be present), 
Ssana (seat), pSdya, arghya&o. After offering flowers the per- 
former should carry out worship of the lunbs of UmS from the 
feet in the form 'bow to UmS, I worship her feet' to the head. 
Then she should offer incense, lamp, naivedya, Scamaaiya, 
fragrant substances like camphor and sandalwood for rubbing on 
the hands, betelnut, tambala, daksiuS, ornaments, nirqjam

two (pp. 3 S) This subject noed not be pursued much further. 

It has already been stated above that every vrata requires a 
parana as the last item, that parana takes place the day after 
the day of the fast and that it is generally performed in the 
morning. There are certain special rules about the parana of 
JanmSstaml fast and JayantI fast. A few diota of the puranas 
may be first noted The Brahmavaivarta 381 states 'one should 
never perform p3rana while astaml tithi is running or RohinI 
naksatra is still there on the Astaml ; (if one does so) one destroys 
what he has done previously and the fruits aoquired by the fast. 
A tithi destroys eight-fold, while a naksatra does so fourfold; 
therefore one should perform the parana (of JanmastamI) at the 
end of the tithi and naksatra'. The Naradapurana 352 remarks 
' when a fast has to he observed on the conjunction of a tithi and. 
naksatra, parana should not be done until at least one of the two 
has ended; when a vrata falls on a conjunction (of tithi and 
naksatra), pSrana should be done only when one of the two nr 
separated (i e. ends)'. The Vahm-pur&aa provides 'P^fjf 
commended at the end of the naksatra or at the end of the taHn . 
Both the Tithitattva and the Krtyatattva* 3 arrive on interpret- 
ing these and other verses at the following conclusions Parana 
is to be observed on the day after the fast, but after the end ol 
the tithi (astaml) and the naksatra (Eohinl)j but when onew

the two ends before mahantsa and the other during mahanisa 
or after it, parana should be observed at the end of one of 
the two; when both exist during the period of mahanisa then 
one should perform parana in the morning at the end of the 
festival'. At the end of the parana the performer repeats the 
mantra ' salutations to Govinda, who is Being, who is the ruler 
of (all) beings, who is the lord of (all) beings and who is the 
source of all beings'. 351 The above statement shows that in 
certain cases the parana of Janmastamlvrata may be at night, 355 
particularly for vaisnavas who perform the vrata as a duty and 
not for any reward. 

There is a difference of meaning between udyapana and 
parana. Some vratas like EkadasI and JanmastamI are per- 
formed throughout a man's life; in such cases there is only 
Parana after the fast on every occasion that a fast is observed. 
H a man undertakes a vrata only once and finishes it, then the 
concluding rites of the vrata are called udyapana. 

Besides the items mentioned above, it is the practice, parti- 
cularly of boys and common people in Maharastra, to hang up 
pots fall of cards and buttermilk on the day after the birth of 
£xsna is celebrated, to play underneath the pot, sing songs and 
then pierce the pot and get drenched by curds and buttermilk 
running out from the holes made. This is probably due to the 
legends associated with Krsna's boyhood among cowherds The 
Bhsgavata 356 expressly says that the cowherds sprinkled each 
other on Kxsna's birth with curds, milk, ghee, and smeared each 
other with these. This is called 'Gopalakala in Maharastra. 
Bat this is not observed in other parts of India such as 
Saurastra. Surprisingly enough the Krsnajanmastaml festival 
does not, like the BamanavamI festival, figure in the Kctya* 
kalpataru on vrata. One cannot account for this omission.

140 History of Dharma&Sstra [Sec I, Gh. VH 

But in the Ifaiyatakala section 357 of the same work, a brief 
procedure of KrsnajanmastamI (which is word for word the 
same in the Krtyaratnakara) different from the one specified 
above from the Titbitattva and other works, is set out. It is as 
follows: On the 8th of the dark half of Bhadrapada was born 
inKaliyuga in the 28th (kalpa?), Krsna, son of DevakJ, for 
removing the burden (of the earth) and the reduction of ksatayas. 
He (his image) should therefore be worshipped on that day, as 
also (of) DevakI and Yasoda with sandalwood paste, flowers, 
inconse, various fruits and foods and dishes prepared from 
barley and wheat together with cow's milk. At night the 
devotee Bhould keep awake with songs and dances. Then on 
the 9th about the time of aiunodmja (& ghatikss before 
sunrise) women dressed in red clothes and decked with garlands 
of flowers should carry the images of these (Krsna, DevakI and 
•Yasoda) to a holy river bank or to a charming and unfreguented 
lake, wherein they should themselves take their bath and also 
bathe the images; then returning home they should eat a meal 
of barley together with jaggery, honey, ghee and black pepper. 

Before closing this aocount of Janmfistaml reference must 
be made to a paper read in 1867 before the Berlin Akademie dar 
WisaenBohaf ten by the renowned German scholar, Erof A Weber, 
tthesubjeotof the paper was 'An investigation into toe origin 
of the festival of Krsnajanmastamr and the paper was tente* 
into four parts, the first dealt with the sources (an EngMi 
translation of it by E. Behatsek was published in Mm

Weber's theory about Janmastami 141 

&c. An English translation of this part appeared in Indian 
Antiquary, vol DX pp 21-25 and pp. 47-52. This paper, though 
it is a monument of learning and patient industry ( for that 
period when very few Sanskrit books had been printed ), gave 
rise to severe criticism owing to its fantastic and perverse 
conclusion about Ersnajanmastaml ritual being borrowed from 
Christian representations of Christ and his mother Mary. In 
L A. vol. m p 300 Growse attacked it very severely. In spite 
of all criticisms the tenacious German scholar stuck to his guns 
and launched an attack against his critics, particularly against 
Br. Rajendralal Mitra, in 1 A. vol IX. pp 226-229. As hardly 
any Sanskrit scholar in these days would espouse the theory 
put forward by Weber, I do not think that I should waste much 
time over a refutation thereof Most European scholars, nurtured 
on the vaunted intellectual eminence of the ancient Greeks and 
on the intolerant attitude of Christianity towards other faiths, 
when they became acquainted with things Indian and studied 
Banskrit, were obsessed ( though not very obviously expressed) 
by two notions, viz. much in India that resembled what prevailed 
in the West must have been borrowed from the West and 
further, that Indians, who had allowed themselves to be invaded 
by outsiders and governed by foreigners for centuries, must not 
have been good at anything. These two notions gave rise to 
many untenable theories such as the following: the Ramayana 
was borrowed from Homer's Iliad, the art of writing was un- 
known to FSnini, the Brahml script was based on Phoenician or 
Aramaic script, that the GltS was based on the Bible, that the 
Very ancient Indian naksatra system was borrowed either from 
the Chinese, the Babylonians or Arabs Most of such theories 
were the result of little knowledge and the non-recognition of 
certain common sense rules and have now been consigned to the 
limbo of deserved oblivion. The common sense rule is that when 
a thing or a state of things has existed for centuries in a certain 
country or among a certain people, the burden of proving that 
it was borrowed by that country or people from outside is very 
heavy on those who assert such borrowing; mere similarities 
can never he held to amount to any evidence of borrowing at 
all; scholars should be very chary of confidently asserting 
borrowing and should put forward their conclusions very cauti- 
ously. It would not be irrelevant to point out the main circum- 
stances on which Weber, often a champion of lost causes, relied 
for his theory. 



14S History of Dharmaiaslra [Sea I, Oh. Til 

The first is that in the ritual of Krsnsstaml contained in 
some digests (that said that they borrowed the passage from 
Bhavisyottara) the image of JEftsna was to he shown *■ as suckl- 
ing at the breast of DevakI, that this is a unique direction, that 
in the fi5manavaml festival which is similar to Janmsstaml the 
image of Bama is not required 'to be suckling at the breast of 
Kausalya, that this detail was copied from the representation of 
the Madonna Lactans. Weber relied ( vide X A vol HI p. 51 ) on 
one De Bossi who said that pictures of infant Christ at the breast 
existed in 2nd century A. D. Weber brushed aside the testimony 
of other soholara that the Madonna with the child was a subject 
little known to the early christian centuries and the opinion of 
other scholars that the representations of the Madonna Lactans 
are extremely rare in Byzantine and Russian art (I A toL Ht 
p. 48) and almost always of very late date Weber makes a 
mountain of a molehill. The image of Bama is also described as 
lying on the lap of the mother Kausalya. 359 Further, allpuranas 
do not provide that the image of Krsna was to be suckling at the 
breast. HemSdri, in describing the Jayantlvrata from the 
Puranas, shows that the image was to be on the lap of the mother 
DevakI 3 " Was the Hindu imagination so poor that when they 
could describe the image of Bama or Krsna as lying on the 
mother's lap they could not also imagine that it could be shown 
as suckling at the breast and had to run to the West to copy 
that detail from representations of the Madonna and the child 
thousands of miles away? 

The 2nd point made muoh of by Weber was that ffarada is 
represented as having brought from Sreta-dvlpa (white land) the 
doctrine of salvation by faith Weber holds that Svetadylpa 
was Alexandria, while Lassen holds that it was Parthia Hwe 
read the description of Svetadvlpa in the Ssntiparva ( chapters

336-339 ) and in such FurSnas ** as Vsmana (chap. 25. 16 and 60. 
56) and Kurma (I. 49) it would be clear that Svetadvlpa was an 
imaginary or mythical place where everything was white, where 
Visnu. and the goda dwelt and that it had no earthly existence 
at least in the minds of the authors who wrote the above works. 

The third important point according to Weber was that 
certain incidents in Krsna's life such as Kaliya-mardana are 
similar to those in Christianity. Weber himself says that victory 
over Kaliya is a travesty of the christian tradition of the serpent. 
It appears to me that there is nothing common between the two 
except the word serpent

the Haritahkavrata for women alone. This vrata is not found 
in tha Krtyakalpataru on vxata or in Hemsdri It is described 
only m the later medieval digests like the Niraayasindhn 
fe 138), VratSrfca (folios U b-49 b), VratarSja (pp. 103-110) and 
AhalySkfimadhenu(folios282-S95). It may, however, he noted that 
the Eajamartanda of Bhoja (first half of 11th century A D.) devotes 
four verses to Hantalleaturtbl on Bhadrapada 4th of bright 
half and says it is dear to Pfirvatl (two of them are quoted below 
in note) ** It is very muoh in vogue among Maharastra women. 
The following is a brief description The woman should take 
an oil and myrobalan paste bath and wear fine silken clothes- 
After referring to the tithi &o the woman should make sankalpa 
as noted below. 30 She should bow to Urns and Sivaj she should 
offer worship to TJms by means of the 16 upao&ras with 
appropriate mantras such as avahana (invoking to be present), 
Ssana (seat), pSdya, arghya &o. After offering flowers the per- 
former should carry out worship of the limbs of UrnS from the 
feet in the form 'bowtoTJmS, I worship her feet' to the head 
Then she should offer incense, lamp, naivedya, acamaniya, 
fragrant substances like camphor and sandalwood for rubbing on 
the hands, betelnut, tambula, daksina, ornaments, ntrUjana 
(waving of a lamp). She should then offer worship to the several 
names of Urns (such asGaurl, Parvatl &o) and the several 
names of Siva (such as Hara, M&hsdeva, Sarnbhu &c) and present 
a handful of flowers, and go round (pradaksinB) the images of

oase an obeisance 361 and a prayer and donate presents plaoed 
in vessels of wickerwork together with auspicious substances. 

This vrata is not prevalent in Bengal nor in Gujarat. 

It is provided by Madhava that 365 if the third is mixed up 
with the 2nd tithi and the 4th tithi, the vrata is to be performed 
on the later day, provided the third tithi exists at least for a 
muhurta (two ghatikas) and then 4th tithi follows. 

In modern times women purchase coloured clay images of 
PfirvatI, of Sivalinga and a friend of Parvatt and worship them. 

It is difficult to say why the vrata is called Haritalika. The 
Vrataraja 366 (p. 108) says it is vrataraja (the prince among 
vratas) and was bo called because PSrvatl was taken away (from 
borne) by her friends. 

The Vrataraja contains a story said to have been narrated 
by Siva himself to PSrvatl about the vrata by performing which 
she secured him as her husband and also the position of being 
half of Siva's body. The Varahapurana (ohap. %%) contains a long 
narrative about the marriage of Gaurl with Siva 

On the 4th of the bright half of Bhadrapada is observed 
the festival of GanesacaturthI in many parts of India (though 
not in Bengal or Gujarat). According to the Samayamayukha, 367 
GanesacaturthI is also called Yaradacaturthl. The proper time 
for the performance is mid-day, as said by Brhaspati 368 quoted 
in the Kalanirnaya. When Gaturthl-tithi is mixed up with the

ever knows this story about the clearance of Krstia from a false 
charge would not be liable to have a false charge made against 
him by any one The Tithitattva 378 provides that if a man 
inadvertently sees the moon on the night of the 4th in Bhadra 
(sukla) he should repeat the verse of the nurse quoted above over 
some water, drink it and should listen to the story of the 
Syamantaka jewel 

When Ganesa is worshipped on BhSdra 4th of bright half, 
that tithi is called, according to Bhavisya, SSvfi, when Gfaneia is 
honoured on MSgha-sukla 4 it is oalled Ssnta, and when on the 
4th of the bright half file weekday is Tuesday that eaturfhlis 
called Sukha. The three 377 axe respectively described in Hemadri 
(vrata) vol I pp. 512-513, pp 513-514 and pp 515-519. 

In modern times the worship of Ganesa lasts for one day 
and a half, for two days, 5 days, 7 days or till AnantacaturdasI 
(14th of bright half of Bhadra), according to the usages of the 
people, their inclinations and their tastes The image is then 
. immersed in a well, tank or in the sea in a great procession, 2h 
certain parts of the Deccan and among common people it is 
customary to perform Gauripuja on 7th and 8th of Bhadrapada- 
sukla and immerse Gaurl (represented by a sheaf of plants) and 
Ganesa image on the same day and at the same time on 9th, 

Ganesa is the most popular god in these days and it is ti» 
practice to invoke him at the beginning of every important 
undertaking or rite He is the God of wisdom, the presiding 
deity of literature, thebestower of success and the destroyer of 
obstacles

Style of such ancient Upanisads as the Taittirlya, Brhada- 
lanyaka and Ohandogya, identifies Ganapati with the Highest 
Brahma. The Ahalyakamadhenu quotes passages from 
Bhavisyottara-purSna on Ganesaoaturthl In I. A. vol 35 p. 60 
an archaeological and mystic explanation is offered about the 
mouse being the conveyance of Ganesa and his elephant head, 
which is fantastic and hardly convincing. Several legends are 
told about Ganesa, his elephant head, his single tusk Vide 
Mukerji p 9 One of the most fantastic is the one in the Varaha- 
purana (chap 23) where it is said that from the laugh of Siva 
sprang a very handsome boy whom Parvatl looked at with 
admiring eyes when Siva's 3ealousy was roused and he cursed the 
boy to be elephant-headed and pot-bellied and then be relented 
and made him the chief of all Vinayakas. 

The Krtykalpataru (on vrata) pp. 84-87 quotes a passage 
from the tfarasimha-purana 379 (chap 26. 2-20) about Ganesa- 
oatnrthl-vrata, which also occurs among several vratas about 
Ganesa set out in Hemadri (on vrata voL I pp 510-512) It 
differs considerably from the celebration of Ganesaoaturthl 
described above. A few important points are stated here Ganesa 
is described as having one, two or four tusks and as having four 
arms. It is further stated that Ganesa causes obstacles (vighna) 
if not worshipped at the beginning of every undertaking. 
Ganesa assumed the form of an elephant for effecting the 
purposes of gods and thereby frightened all danaoas. 

On the 5th tithi of the bright half of Bhadrapada occurs the 
Rsipaficami-vrata. It was meant for men of all varnas but is 
now mostly practised by women. Hemadri (on vrata, voL I. 
pp 568-572) describes the vrata at length quoting from the 
Brahmanda-purana. One should, after bathing in a river or the 
like and after performing his daily duties, repair to his agmhotnt 
shed, should bathe with Faficamrta the images of the seven sages 
and, anointing them with sandalwood paste and camphor, worship 
them with flowers, fragrant substances, incense, lamp, white 
clothes and yajnopavttas and sumptuous naivedya and offer

(for Bharadvaja), Bg.X 167. 4 (for Visvamitra), Eg. I 78.1 
(for Gotama), $g. HL 63. 18 (for Jamadagni), Be "VH. 33. 11 (for 
Vasistha). The mantra for ArundhatI is quoted below 383 In 
this vrata the number seven is important. The vrata is to be 
performed for seven years, there are to be seven jars, seven 
br&hmanas were to be invited to whom finally the images (made 
of gold or silver) of the seven sages were to be donated If all 
the images were placed in one hdaSa, then the jar with the 
images was to be donated to one brabmana and the others were 
to be given kalasas with clothes and daksina. 

If pafioaml is mixed up with the 4th tithi and the 6th tithi, 
one must perform the BsipaSoaml vrata on the 5th mixed with 
the 4th (purvaviddha) and not on 5th mixed with 6th, in accord- 
ance with the Yugmavakya quoted above (n 191) Besides, Harlta 
expressly 38 * prohibits the acceptance of the 5th mixed with the 
6th in the words (5th tithi mixed with the 4th should be accepted 
and not the 5th joined to the 6th, both in the bright and dark 
halves and in rites for the gods and pitrs). But there is the most 
important rule laid down by Harlta himself that in all vxatas 
comprising worship the tithi to be selected is the one that covers 
mid-day. 385 Supposing that the 5th tithi does not cover mid-day 
when joined with 4th, but covers mid-day when joined with 6th, 
the latter (paraviddha) would have to be chosen. Hemadri would 
hold thiB latter view, while Madhava holds that everywhere 5th 
which is purvaviddha is to be accepted. Hence there is diver- 
gence of View among the great writers. 

It appears that originally the Rsipancaml-vrata was meant 
for the removal of sins for all, but later on it came to be specially 
provided for women; but it is not observed in Saurastra 

On the 14th of the bright half of Bhadrapada is celebrated 
the Anantaoaturdasl-vrata. It does not appear in the Krtya- 
kalpataru (on vrata). 

It consists chiefly in the worship of Hari as Ananta and in 
wealing on the the right hand in the oase of men and on the left

in the case of women a holy strap of thread dyed with saffron 
made of cotton or silk twisted into fourteen knots. It is an 
individual pfija and not a festival of a sooio-religious character. 
The Agnipur£na (ohap. 192, verses 7-10) gives a brief description 
as follows. On the 14th of the bright half one should worship 
the image of Ananta (Hari) which is made of darbba grass 
placed in a vessel for water (a jar) He should get ready flour of 
a praslha of paddy and make cakes from that, half of which 
should be donated to a brShmana and the remaining half he 
should use for himself One should perform this vrata on the 
bank of a river and listen to stories about Han and (pray to 
Hari) as follows • 38S O Vasudeva 1 save (people) sunk in the great 
and endless ocean of samsaia and make them apply themselves

mantra and having tied on one's arm or round one's neck a 
string of threads over which a mantra has been uttered, the 
person who performs the Anantavrata becomes happy If Han 
is Ananta, then fourteen knots may be deemed to symbolise the 
fourteen worlds created by Hari 

Hemadrf (on vrata voL H pp 26-36) has an elaborate 
description of Anantavrata together with thB story of KauDdinya 
and his wife Sua told by Krsna to Tudhisthira. Krsna states 
that Ananta is one of his formB and identifies himself with BOa 
(Time) that is called Ananta. Ananta should be worshipped

from the Bhavisyottara, and the Tithitattva also (p. 123) 
quotes portions from the Bhavisyottara The Kalanirnaya 
(p. 279) expressly states that the Anantavrata is described in the 
Bhavisyottara and discusses a few verses therefrom. The 
Vrataika (folio 277a-285a) describes this vrata at great length. 
Briefly it is this: first sankalpa, then making & sarvato-iliadra 
mamfafa and placing a jar thereon, on which is placed a riaga 
with seven hoods made of darbhas and in front of it a daraka 
with 14 knots, worshipping the daraka on the jar with 16 upa- 
oaras with the Purusasukta (Eg. X 90) and Fauranika mantras; 
14 devatSs of the knots from Visnn to Vasus are invoked, then 
there is worship of the limbs from the feet upwards in such 
mantras as ' AnantSya namah padau pujay&ni,' then a handful 
of flowers with the mantras of "Visnu, prayer to Ananta, tying 
thedoraka with a mantra, casting away the old daraka after 
offering it worship. Salt is forbidden in this vrata. It was 387 
believed that if this vrata was performed for fourteen years, 
one reached the world of Visnu. 

There is a variance in the views of eminent writers about 
the exact time and the tithiforthe vrata when 14th is mixed 
with other tithis(13th or Paurnima). Madhava 388 holds that 
mid-day is not the harmakala in this vrata, but that tithi which 
exists at sunrise for three muhurtas is the most suitable one for 
Ananta-vrata. The Nirnayasindhu holds 389 that Madhava was 
mistaken because he relied for his decision on a general rule that 
the principal tithi to be accepted is the one that covers mid-day, 
that the Anantavrata iB not mentioned in other puranas and also 
in other digests and that the passages of the Bhavisya and 
Sfcanda quoted by others are baseless and unauthoritative. 

There are even in these days many persons who engage in 
the Anantacatodasl-vrata, but their numbers are rapidly 
diminishing.

CHAPTER IX 
Navaratra or Durgotsava 

From the lstofAsvina bright half to the 9th is celebrated 
the DnrgSpuja festival, otherwise called Navaratra, observed all 
over India in some form or other. Some of the works 390 provide 
that Durgotsava must be celebrated in both Sarad (JLsvina-sukla) 
and Yasanta (m Caitra-sukla). But it is the Durgotsava 391 of 
Ssvina that is celebrated in a grand style, particularly in 
Bengal, Bihar and Kamarupa 

If a person is unable to celebrate the festival 393 for nine 
days, he should do so for three days beginning from the 7th tithi 
of Ssvina-sukla In fact, the Tithitattva 393 puts forward several 
alternative periods f or Durgapuja as follows: (1) from the 9th 
tithi of the preceding dark half of Purnhnanta livina to the 
9th tithi of AsvnuMlukla; (2) from the first tithiof Aivina 
sukla to 9th; (3) from the 6th to the 9th; (4) from the 7th to 
the 9th; (5) from the Mahastaml to the 9th, (6) only on the 
MahSstamI; (7) only on the Mahanavaml. Mori of theae 
alternatives find support in the Kalika and other Puranas

Dargolsavd 155 

' There is a voluminous literature on Durgotsava. Every 
digest on vratas, tithis and puja devotes considerable apace to 
this subject. Moreover, tbere are special treatises on Durgotsava 
or Navaratra, such as the Durgotsavaviveka of Sulapani, the 
Durgapuja-prayogatattva (published by the Sanskrit Sahity 
Parishad, 1924) of which the Durgaroanapaddhati of Baghu- 
nandana (published by Jivananda, voL II) is a part, Durgsbhakti- 
taranginl of Vidyapati,®* the Navaratra-pradlpa of Vinayaka 
alias Manda-pandita, the Durgotsavapaddhati by TTdayasimha 
(2nd half of 15th century A. D. J. 395 Besides these, the 
Markandeyapurana ( chapters 78-90 in Yenk. Press ed. and 
81-93 in Banerji's) contains what is called Devimahatmya ^ 
(or SaptasaH or Candl) in which are described the appearance 
of Devi from the accumulated togas of Visnu, Sankara, Agni 
and other gods, her getting different weapons from the several 
gods Buch as the trident from Siva, discus from Visnu, 
Vajra from India, her victory over and slaughter of the

with devotion to my greatness in the great annual puja per- 
formed in autumn, a man becomes free from all troubles and 
becomes endowed with wealth and agricultural produce by my 
favour*. The exaggerated importance of this Durga-puja will be 
clear from one verse of the Bhavisya ' rites like Agnihotra, 
solemn sacrifices described in the Vedas and completed with 
daksina are not equal even to one hundred-thousandth part of 
the worship of Candika.'* 01 

This Durgapuja is very cosmopolitan in character It could 

be performed not only by persons belonging to the four varnas, 

but even by those who were outside the pale of the caste system 

Durga-pujahas a congregational character and is not purely 

religious, but has also a social element in it (such as inviting 

friends and treating them &c ). The Bhavisyapurana 402 says 

'Devi should be worshipped (in her shrine) on Vindhya 

mountain, in all places, cities, houses, villages and forests by 

•brahmanas, ksatriyas, kings, vaisyas, sudras, who are full of 

devotion, who have taken a bath and who are cheerful and jolly, 

by mlecclias and other men (such as pratilomas) and by women*. 

In another place the Bhavisya states 403 ' Durga is worshipped by 

various groups of mlecohas, by all dasyus (thievish tribes or 

outoaste Hindus), by people from Anga, Vanga and Kalinga, by 

kinnaras, Barbaras (non-Aiyans) and Sakas*. Later medieval 

writers were careful to point out that mlecehas bad no adhtkSra 

to perform japa or homa or puja with mantras through a 

brShmana as sadras had, but they could only mentally resolve 

'to offer in honour of Devi animals as offerings and wine 401 also 

and do so.

158 History of Dharmaiastra [Seo.^ab.I& 

It is stated in the Skanda and Bhavisya 405 puranas that the 
worship of Candika in autumn (iLsvma) is of a threefold 
character; viz sStfrvikl, rajasl and tamasl, thesSttvikl worship 
is effected by japa, by- offering ncuvedyain which there is no 
meat; and japa consists in reciting the texts of the puranasin 
which the greatness of Devi is described; rajas! worship u 
effected by offering a bait and with naivedya which contains 
flesh; that is tamasl worship which is effected by the offerings 
of wine and meat and from which japa is absent and which is 
without mantras, this last is approved among KirStas (1 e. forest 
tribes and the like) Baghunandana adds** in his Prayasortta- 
tattva that the offering of wine in DurgapQja relates to ages 
other than the Kali age (i e other than the present age). 

It has been stated above (pp 110-111, n 280) that the principal 
gods are deemed to go to sleep for four months on different tithis 
from the prattpad (1st) of itsSdha-sukla to the 15th. Therein 
Durga is said to go to sleep on the 8th of the bright half of ieSdha. 
Therefore, in JLsvina she would be asleep. Hence the texts provide 
for the rousing {bodhana) of Devi from sleep As usual Qiere are 
'conflicting views The Tithitattva m notices the viewB of some 
that if the Devi is to be worshipped as having 18 arms she was 
to be roused on the 9th of the dack half preceding 5£vina bright 
half, but that if she was to be worshipped as possessing ten arms 
then the bodhana waste be on the 6th (of the bright half of 
Ssvina) Baghunandana does not accept this and holds &at the 
bodhana of Devi with ten arms was to he either on the 9th (of the 
preceding dark half) or on the 6th (of the bright half of ^™*

out, the neck narrow and the brim being broad and open), fill 
it with water, place twigs of mango and other sacred trees there- 
on and worship Durga with the 16 or 5 upacSras. Then he should 
offer materials suoh as sandal-wood paste, myrobalan for purify- 
ing the hair and also a comb. 411 On the 2nd tithi he should 
offer a silken ribbon for keeping the hair in position, on the 
third alaktaka (red lac) dye for reddening the feet, vermilion for 
putting it on the head, a mirror for observing the face; on the 
4th tithi he should offer madhuparla (to the goddess), a silver 
piece having the shape of a ttkika (for the forehead) and col- 
lyiium as decoration for the eyes; on the 5th tithi he Bhould 
offer sandalwood paste, unguents and ornaments according to

expired before evening, then in the evening without sasthl) and 
rouse Devi with the mantra 413 'for the destruction of Havana

you in the evening of the 6th titbi of Asvina.* After thus 
awakening Devi he should invite the bilva tree with the words 
*0 bilva tree! born on the top of Sirlsaila and the abode of

gold, Bilver, copper, whisk, mirror, lamp, prasashpatra ( a broad- 
plate ). Then he should repair to the pandal erected for Durga- 
pBja, perform acamana, should bind together with Aparajita 
creeper twigs or leaves of nine plants 415 so as to form one bundle 
or sheaf, viz. plantain, pomegranate, coriander, turmeric, Arum 
Indicum, Arum colocacia, bilva, asoka and jayantl. Each of 
these substances is accompanied by an appropriate separate 
mantra. 

He should offer worship to the bundle of nine plants and 
to the image (of Durga) and make the Devi abide in the bilva 
tree with sandalwood (and other substances mentioned above). 
The rousing (bodhana) of the Devi and the invitation to the 
bilva tree are separate and are done with separate mantras 
(Tithitattoa pp. 75-76 ). The two may be done at the same time 
if 6th tithi exists in the evening; but if it does not exist in the 
evening then bodhana may be done on the 6th and invitation 
on the 7th or bodhana may be done in the morning and invita- 
tion in the evening. The clay image of Durga together with 
the twig of bilva is to be entered in the house and worshipped, 
The details of the complicated discussion are not set out here. 

Then follow acts to be done on the 7th tithi On the 7th 
tithi conjoint with mula-naksatra or without it the performer 
after taking a bath approaches a bilva tree, worships it, folds 
his hands and says 'O blessed bilva tree I you are always dear 
to Sankara; after taking from you a branch I shall perform 
Durga worship; OLordl you should not feel pain due to the 
catting of a branch; O bilva I prince among trees, salutation 
to you ' ' After saying this he should cut off from the bilva 
tree a branch other than one in the south-west or north-west 
and endowed vrith a couple of fruits (or without fruit) with 
the mantra noted below. 416 Then he should take the branch, 
coma to the place of worship (the mandapa or the like ) and place 
it on a pltha (a seat). Then taking white mustard grains he

KSlI who is surrounded by goblins to accept that bait for proteo-

move, make others mem, enter my house quickly and go to the 
place of worship, svatiS'. Then he establishes the ghaia, worships 
the nine plants and five devatBs, establishes the image on a seat 
and the bundle of nine plants to its right to the accompaniment 
of songs and instrumental music and places the bilva branch in 
a copper vessel near the (image of) Devi and performs the prSna-

(fall) moon, her complexion is like molten gold, she is well 
formed and has charming eyes, she is endowed with blooming 
youth, decked with all kinds of ornaments, has charming teeth, 
looks keen and has full and upraised breasts, her posture is such 
that she is bent at three places, she has crushed the demon 
Mahisa, she has ten arms long and soft like lotus stalks, she 
holds a trident in the right hand and a sword and discus below 
that (trident) in order, a sharp arrow and sakti (missile) in the 
group of her arms, a shield, a fully bent bow, a noose, a goad 
(held in order) from above and a bell and axe should be held in 
the left hand from below; under her one should show a headless 
buffalo from which rises a demon with a sword in his hand, who 
is pierced in the region of the heart by the trident (of Devi), who 
(demon) possesses teeth set awry, whose body is dyed red with 
blood, whose eyes are bloodshot and distended, who is encircled 
by a noose of snakes, whose faoe is rendered fearful by his curved 
eyebrows, whose hair is seized by Durga with the left hand hold- 
ing a noose, whose mouth emits blood ; one should exhibit Devi's 
lion ; the right foot of Devi (should be shown) as resting evenly on 
the lion's back and her left foot toe (resting) a little higher on 
the demon. 

Then the performer should pat a flower on Mb head, take 
flowers and rice grains in his hand and make an invocation 
(avShana) with two mantras to Durgs, to be present in the bilva 
branch and establish her with the prayer to bestow long life, 
health and prosperity. He offers to the Devi the several 
upacaras of asana, padya, arghya &o. Then he should go near 
the sheaf of nine plants and repeat the mantra "O blessed Durgsl

Durga with padyaand other upacSras 420 and offer a kid or the

should be at least five years old. 421 

Much has been written about the sacrifice of animals in 
Durgapuja Only a few points can be dealt with here. The 
Kalika-puxaria enumerates the following annuals as fit for sacri- 
fice in honour of Durga and Bhairava 422 'buds, tortoises, croco- 
diles, fish, deer of nine kinds, buffalo, gavaya (Gayal), bull, goat, 
mongoose, boar, rhinoceros, black antelope, sarabha (a fabulous 
animal), lion, tiger, a human being and blood from one's own 
(i. e. the performer's) body; but the females of the species 
specified above were not to be offered as bait and the 
person whe did so would go to helL This was probably a con- 
cession to placate Devi who might have a soft corner for a ball

reasons of space I have not reproduced the whole , but have mentioned only

of her own sex. The bali should have no defect and should not 
be one whose tall or ears were cut off Though the above list of 
victims that may be offered is long, usually only goats and 
he-buffaloes were sacrificed It is said 4S ' the Devi that resides 
on Vindhya is not so well pleased with the offerings of flowers, 
incense, and unguents and of other animals as she is pleased 
with offerings of rams and he-buffaloes'. The "Varsa-kriya- 
kaumudi' 521 quotes "one should never offer to the great Devi a 
horse or elephant ; if a brahmana offers a lion, a tiger or a human 
being (as baZt) he would go to hell and even in this world he would 
have a short life and would be devoid of happiness and prosperity ; 
if (a brahmana) offers his own blood, he would be guilty of 
suicide. If a brahmana offered wine he would lose his status as 
a brahmana. When wine is laid down as a neoessary offering 
he Bhould offer cocoanut water in a vessel of bell-metal or honey 
in a copper vessel." But there were texts that contradict this For 
example, it is said in the Kalikapurana ' goat, he-buffalo, human 
being are declared to be bali,mahabali and atibali, respectively.' ** 
It has to be remembered that though an animal is killed still 
what is offered to the Devi is generally blood and the head of 
the victim. The Kalikapurana 436 says 'blood purified by the 
recitation of mantras over it and the head (of a victim) are said 
to be nectar; in the worship (of Devi) the adept worshipper

should offer flesh raroly (if otall) except blood ana the head, 
which (two) bocomo noctar" The Kahkapurana further states 
that Sivd i (Durga ) partakes of tho hoad as well as the flesh of the 
wctim, that one should offor in pfija tho blood and hoad of the 
victim, but tho wise (devotee) should emptor flesh in edibles and 
in homa. Tho Durgarcanapaddhati (pp (5G9-<i71) prescribes an 
elaborate ritual about killing the bah and offering its blood 
and head and tho rites and mantras slightly differ according as 
the bah is a goat, a buffalo or tho performer's own blood 
Tho*» bolt is made to faco tho oast, tho sidhaka (devotee) 
faces tho north and repeats certain mantras ono of which is Taj. 
S. 23. 17 'Agni was tho animal to be sacrificed. They sacrificed 
with him, ho conquered this world (tho earth) on which Agai 
exists; that will bo your world, you will conauer that worM, 
drink this wator. Vfiyu (wind God) was the animal &c ; the Sun 
was tho animal &o.' Anothor mantra is Mann V. 39 (=Visnu- 
dliarmasutra 51. 61s=Kalika 71.39) viz. 'animals were created by 
Brahma himself for serving tho purpose of sacrifice, for the 
well-being of sacrifice and of all; therefore killing (an animal) in 
a sacrifice is no killing ( does not cause the sin or blame of 
ordinary killing )'. He should place on the head of the bali 
a flower with a mantra ; then he sprinkles water with kusas over 
the bali and then worships tho sword with tho mantra 'you 
are the tongue of Gandika and you accomplish heaven (for the 
Worshipper );HrIm, Stfm, O sword) 1 . The performer contemplates 
on the sword as described in Tithitattva (p. 81) and DuigSicana- 
paddhati (p 670), honours it with sandalwood paste and the rest 
and repeats eight names of the sword, bows to it, takes it up 
with the words 'Am, Hrlm, Phat" and with one stroke cuts off 
the victim facing the east ( while the performer faces the north) 
or facing tho north (while tho performer faces the east) Then 
he collects blood in a vessel of clay or other material, places it 
before the Devi and offers it with the words 'this is the blood of 
the goat; Om, O Jayantll' and says 'Aim, Brim, Srlm, O 
Kauaikl 1 May she be pleased by the blood.' Then he offers the 
head of the bali (goat or the like) placing on the head a lamp 
with a flaming wick He then takes blood from the sword (with

which the animal's neck was out) and makes a tilaka mark with 
it on his forehead with two mantras. It was supposed that the 
tilaka of blood would make all persons amenable to the person 
who had that blood mark on the forehead as the mantra quoted 
below expresses. v When the bah is a buffalo, the mantras 
repeated over a goat are omitted and two others are substituted 
viz. ' as you hate a horse and as you carry Candika, so kill my 
enemies and bring happiness, O buffalo; you are the vehicle of 
Yama, you possess excellent form, you who are deathless ; bestow 
on me long life, wealth, fame, a bow to you who are a buffalo*. 
The fruit of offering buffalo's blood to Devi was deemed to be her 
gratification and favour for a hundred years. Then he performs 
japa of a mantra ( quoted in note J 428 and also certain verses of 
laudation and asks for certain benefits (DurgSroana. p. 672). 429 

The KalikSpurana in a long passage 430 provides gradually 
rising periods of times for which Durga becomes gratified by 
the offering of the blood of various animals, A few might be 
cited here: Durga secures satisfaction for one month by the 
(offering of the) blood of fishes and tortoises, and for two months 
by (the blood of) crocodiles; by the blood of the black antelope 
and of the boar Devi is pleased for twelve years and by the blood 
of buffalo and rhinoceros for a hundred years; by the blood of 
the lion, the sarabha and from the performer's body Devi is 
gratified for a thousand years and by a human being as a bait 
for a thousand years." There was a revulsion of feeling against 
blood sacrifices in some hearts and so even the Kalika provides 431 
that the offerings of kusmanda (pumpkin-gouid) and sugarcane 
stalks, intoxicants and asavas (spirits distilled from molasses, 
flowers or herbs) are like (animal) victims and gratification

(to the Devi) is the same as by the offering of a goat. Bni even 
in these days castes deemed higher, even including br&hmanas, 
oSex goats and rarely buffaloes to Durga, if that is the custom of 
the caste or family, I understand that many families of learned 
brSbmanaa such as the Bhatt&cSryas of Bhatpara in West 
Bengal sacrifice fruits and vegetables in lieu of animals The 
AhalyakSma-dhenu *" says that some Vaissavas regard the night 
whan victims are killed ob homble and do not eat food or even 
drink water on that night and that among hrahmana castes the 
offering (ball) should bo in the form of kusmanda and the like 
or flour images of animals or simple ghee should be offered As 
to other castes also it has been declared that Kosmanda, bilva 
fruit, sugarcane stalks may be out into pieces. 

The convenient belief from very ancient times has been ftat 
a victim offered in sacrifice to gods and pitrs went to heaven. 
£g 1 1C2 tV 03 ( = Vaj S 23. 16 ) and Manu V. 42 say sa 
HemSdri quotes verses Baying that all the animals such as the 
buffalo thotara employed for (gratifying) Devi go to heaven 
and those that kill them incur no sin.* 11 

The foregoing is somewhat of a digression, as the 6oft is 
generally to be sacrificed on the 9th and as the rites of even of 
the 8th have not yet been described On the MahsstamI con- 
joined to Pfirvasadha-naksatra or without it, the devotee after 
taking a bath and sipping water, should face the east or north,

described on p. 163 and note 418 above, places a flower on his 
head, mentally offers upacSras (to Devi), again contemplates on 
Devi's form and then offers the upacarasfrom asana (seat) to 
pranama {as indicated in note 420 ahove) with appropriate 
brief mantras. Then he offers worship to several goddesses to 
the right side, front side and left side of Devi with brief mantras 
and to the Mates 435 (64 are enumerated in Durgareanao. pp. 676- 
677, or 32, or 16 or 8) according to one's ability with five 
upaoSras or with sandalwood paste and flowers and to the eight 
mates Brahmsni &c Then there is aAgapBja (worship of Devi's 
limbs) from heart and head to the feet Then worship is offered 
to her weapons suchas trident, sword, discus, sharp arrow, shield, 
fully strung bow, the noose, goad, bell; and then her lion-seat is 
honoured and also armour, whisk, umbrella, flag and flag-staff, 
drum, conch Separate mantras areTeoitedin connection with 
the pfija of each of these, as laid down in DurgSrcanapaddhati 
pp. 678-681, in the Hirnayasindhu pp. 179-181 (which, quotes 
them from Visnudharmottara) and other works. They are all 
passed over here for saving space Then he goes near the sheaf 
of nine plants and worships it with five upacaras or with sandal- 
wood paste and flowers offered to each separately. Then he 
makes an offering of niasa pulse and boiled rice. 

On the day on which there is Mahastamlpuja the performer 
observes a fast But a householder 436 who has a son should not 
observe a fast on the Mahastaml He should follow one of the 
alternatives specified above in note 252 (naktam havisyannam 
&c). Whatever procedure about food he may follow, he, keeping 
himself pure and observing the rules of conduct for vrata, should 
worship Devi; he should offer worship on the MahSstaml and on

homa, gifts and japa as she is gratified (becomes favourable) by 
honouring maidens." And he haB to give them daksinS also. 
HemSdri (on vratavol I 903-906) quotes a long passage from 
the Skanda-purana on thiB subject Skanda provides that the 
performer should feed maidens from the first tithi of MavarStraon

and so on up to nine on the 9tb If he feeds nine virgins every 
day (of the Navaratra) he secures land; if he feeds double the 
number on each succeeding day he gets prosperity. He should not 
honour a maiden who is one year old (or less), for, suoh a girl haB 
not developed at that age liking for fruits, flowers andBandal; 
wood paste. , Therefore, he should honour maidens who are from 
two to ten years old, and not those that are beyond ten years The 
Bevlpurana provides that if no virgin is available, onemey 
honour even a married girl who has had no menstruation J&> 
Skanda provides that maidens from two years to tensbciuld ba

taken a ceremonial bath with oil is noted below. 440 In this way 
he is to honour virgins with bodice, clothes, sandalwood paste, 
flowers and aksatas, with different kinds of edibles and dishes 
and feed them with pdyasa (rice boiled in milk and sugar). One 
should not honour a maiden that has a limb more or less, that 
suffers from leprosy, or that has varioose veins or has a broken 
head or has limbs from which blood or pus oozes or has ulcers", 
that is blind from birth, is squint-eyed or blind of one eye ox is 
ugly or has little hair or much hair or is diseased or is born of a 
slave woman. A man should honour a brahmana maiden in all 
acts, a ksatriya maiden for victory, one belonging to untouch* 
able castes in acts of terrible nature. After the maidens are 
fed, brahmanas also should be fed (Durgarcana. pp. 681), 

The Tithitattva ( pp. 69-72), Nirnayasindhu and other works 
provide that in the Mavaratra the performer should hear the 
recitation of the Vedas (VedapSrayana) and that beginning 
with the first tithi up to the 9th he should himself mutter 
Caudlpatha (recitation of Devbnahatmya) or engage a person 
to do so, reciting it once on the first, twice on 2nd tithi 
and so on up to nine times on 9th tithi. The DevJpnrana 
provides for puis, japa and noma and the mantras therefore by 
saying that the worship of Devi is to be performed by casting 
into the fire sesame and with curds', milk and ghee. The' Devi- 
mantra is either what is called the Jayantunantra* 41 ( quoted' in 
note ) or the mantra of nine syllables ( quoted in the note ). 'The 
Dvaitanimaya-siddhsntasangraha states that the mantra is 
either one that a man's guru has taught him, or the Vedic verse 
1 J&tavedase sunavama' ( 9g. J. 99. 1 ) or one with nine letters or 
the one ' namo devyai mahsdevyai ' or the slokas in- the 
Saptaiatl.* 12 The Tithitattva quotes ( pp. 69-71 ) "a ,long passage

from the , VfirSbJ-tantea about the result of reciting Devlmahiitmya 
several times. A few verees are cited for sample. "When some 
great danger threatens, one should reoite (Devlmahatmya) seven 
times; if repeated twelve tunes one secures fulfilment of onefc 
desires and the destruction of enmity; if repeated 14 times, an 
enemy would be subdued and a woman -would be brought under 
onejs control; repeating a hundred times results in increase of 
one's kingdom , if repeated a thousand times Laksml comes to a 
man of her own accord As Asvamedha fs the prince among 
sacrifices, as Hari (is superior) among gods, so the laudoalad 
Saptaiatl is the highest among all lauds* 8 * The Tithitattva 
further provides that one should recite*** before the reading of 
the 'prathamaoarita' the rsi (sage), the metre &a of it and also 
when repeating the Madhyamacartia and the Uttaraconta Very 
great importance was attached in ancient and medieval times to 
the recitation of mantras and even modern men brought up in 
English schools, colleges and Universities often implicitly believe 
in their efficacy, even if one may not understand their meaning. 
The qualities of the sounds of mantras or of parts of mantras 
{such as 'brim') and their potentialities, the various devices 
employed when using them are deemed of far greater importance 
than the meaning. The Gita (X 85 ) itself puts Japa-yajfia as 
the highest among yajfias such as those of dravya (materials ox 
money ), tapoyajna ( GltS IV* 28 ). Mantras are supposed to have 
a tremendous effect on the sub-conscious mind and itmay perhaps 
be so if one concentrates one's mind thereon to the exclusion of all 
else. A person could himself recite the SaptasatI or engage a 
parson to read it to him who was called jfiUhaka or ificaka as in 
T. T. p. 72, Durgaroana p 661 Some very orthodox writers went 
so far as to lay down that a flfldra could only listen to the 
MahsbbSrata or Saptaiatl but could not read it himself. Bagbu' 
nandana**" like Kamalakara appears to have held this view. One

should stop reading at the end of a chapter and not in its 
middle; but if far some reason one had to stop in the middle 
of a chapter, 'when one again commenced reading or reciting 
SaptasatI, one should not proceed from where one left off in the 
middle of a chapter, but begin with the first verse of the chapter 
half read or recited. Provision was made that the reader engaged 
for reading SaptasatI should be handsomely requited for his labour 
by gifts of gold, silver, cows with bell-metal pails for milking. 
Mr Ghosh notes (p. 39) that besides the reader of Dev&nahatmya 
a separate priest is selected to repeat the mulamantra a hundred 
thousand times and is called Japaka. The Nirnayasindhu 
(pp 185-186} gives elaborate descriptions of Sataoandl-pstha 
and Sahasraoandl. In the first, ten well-conducted brabmanas 
including the acarya are chosen. They are to recite together 
SaptasatI once on the 1st day, twice on the 2nd, thrice on the 3rd 
and four times on the 4th; in this way SaptasatI would be repeated 
one hundred times. In Sahasracandi one hundred hrShmanas are 
to he chosen and they are to repeat SaptasatI for four days as in 
Sataoandl-patha A. thousand brshmanas are to be fed and one 
hundred cows are to be donated. The Nrrnayasindhu notes that 
these two are not included in the great digests but there is 
popular usage to this effect. 

After each puja prescribed for the day, the family members, 
their friends and guests sit together and partake of the prasada 
(which in the houses of the well-to-do comprises select delicacies). 
Formerly, the persons Bitting together would have sometimes 
numbered hundreds, but in the days of rationing and control, 
this would not happen. Mukerji { p. 124 ) notes that guests made 
offerings to the goddess (usually cash which belongs to the 
owner and not to the priest. ) 

After the puja, homa is performed as indicated above; 
offerings are to be made in fire called 'Balada'* 8 with the word 
'svShs' at the end to the accompaniment of a mantra preceded 
by ' om \ The Dnrgaroana-paddhati notes ( p. 681 ) that after the 
special rites on the Mahas^am! described above (viz. puja, 
honouring maidens, homa &o. ) are finished the rest of the tithi 
should be spent by the devotee in dance, songs" 8 and music

ofthe-imageof Devi* 55 The K&laviveka quotes Satya to the 
effect that leave is taken of Devi on the last pMa of Sravana- 
naksatra in the day and sabarotsava is celebrated on the # 10th, 
and explains that what is meant is that like men of the Sahara 
tribe, people wear leaves of trees, their bodies are besmeared 
with mire, they make incoherent pranoing movements and are 
engaged in dances, songs and music The KfilikSpurSna dwellB 
on this at great length. It says : " the msarjam ( sending away ) 
of Devi should be made with festivals in the manner of sabaras, 
viz. people may make merry to their heart's content by throwing 
dust and mud, with auspicious sports and revelry, with indulg- 
ence in words and songs referring to male and female organs 
and with words expressive of the sexual act. The Devi becomes 
angry with him who does not abuse another and whom others do 
not abuse and pronounces on him a terrible curse." This pro- 
vision that every one, how highsoever, was to join in the 
sabarotsava was probably made for emphasizing that before the 
Devi the highest and the lowest were of equal status and every 
one must join in the frolics on the 10th tithi to show that all' 
men were equal at least one day in the year. After the immer- 
sion friends visit friends and partake of sweets. It appears that 
this last practice is now not in vogue. 

A few words must be said with reference to certain relevant 
matters. How Devi was to be contemplated upon can be seen from 
p 163, note 418 above. That shows that only the image of Devi 
with the lion and the demon Mahisasura was to be constructed. 
In the Mark purana 456 it is Btated that Devi strode over the great 
demon's throat, struck him with her trident and with her heavy 
sword cut off his head and made him fall down on the ground. 
But in modern times the image of Devi is placed in a structure 
of wiokerwork and there are images of LaksmI and Ganesa on

Boghunandana does not make much of tbese additional deities, 
though he speaks of the prSnapratistha of Ganesa and others. 
On p. 146 of l Gave temples of India' by Fergusson and Burgess 
reference is made to a tableau at Mahavalli-puram of the strife 
between MahisSsura and Devi (with eight aims), which the 
learned authors assign to the period 650-700 A. D The image 
may be made of gold or silver, clay, metal, Btone or there may 
only be a picture of Devi. For DurgSpQjS it is not absolutely 
necessary that there should be an image Devi may bewor- 
shipped 438 in a hnga, on an altar or in a book, in her p&dukss 
(wooden or stone feet), in image, m a picture or a trident or 
sword or in water. Some of the puranas like Qaruda and 
Bbavisya 459 state that on the 7th or 8ft tithi nine wooden houses 
or only one with four comers may be constructed, that in the 
midst of it a platform or altaT of four cubits in length and 
breadth should be made on which a throne of silk, woollen oloth 
and deer-skin should be prepared, whereon Durgs { image) made 
of gold, silver, clay or wood was to be established having four or 
ten arms, possessing a complexion bke heated gold, three eyes 
and the moon as a head ornament. 

There is no unanimity about the arms of Devi The Vartha- 
tmrana(95.41) speaks of 20 arms of Devi and mentions the 
twenty weapons she carries ( 95. 4Z-43 ) In tbe Devlbhagavata 
V. 8. 44 she is said to have 18 arms HemSdri ( on vrata, vol. 
L to 923^924 ) quotes verses in whwh Devi is said to have elgM

both ten aims and eight arms. It appears that different numbers 
of arms were associated with different forms and names of Devi. 
Eta example, Vidyapati in describing the form of Kali or Camunds 
speaks of her as having four arms. In the Virataparva (chap. 6) 
where Yudhisthira praises Durgs, she is described ( in verse 8 ) 
as having four arms. 

There are varying views about the word * navaTatra'. Some 
hold that navaratra means 'nine days and nights' ; it signifies 
only the time for a vrata ( i. e. it is a gunavidhi ), not the name 
of a rite (karma), while others contend that navaratra is the 
name of a rite or vrata, which may last for eight days ( if there 
is UtUteaya) or ten days ( if there is vrddhi of a tithi from the 
first tithi to the 9th ). The first view is held by works like the 
Kslatattvavivecana (pp. 370-272 ), while the 2nd is held by the 
ttirnayasindhu 4 " ( p. 165 ), the PurusarthacintSmani (p. 61 ) and 
others. Aa the discussion is scholastic and hardly of any 
practical importance it is passed over here. 

The principal matters in Navaratra or Durg&puja, though 
it may be spread over three days ( from 7th tithi ) or nine days 
(from 1st to 9th), are four as laid down by the Lingapurana 
viz. snapana ia (bathing the image), puja, the offering of a 
victim (ball) and homa. For want of space snapana has not 
been dwelt upon in the above. The Durgaroanapaddhati (p. 674), 
the Vrataraja (p. 340) and other digests state at length how the 
image of Durga mar be bathed with scented water, with milk, 
curds, ghee, paftcagavya of a kaptla cow, sugarcane juice and 
What rewards are reaped by particular kinds of baths. One 
example ib given here for a sample. 463 The man who even f or

Then the question arises as to when p5j a in to be performed. 
Here there are varying views. The Samaya-mayukha** ( p M) 
quoting Devl-purana appears to hold that the piys should be in 
the morning, while the ffirnayasmdhu (p 165) holds that it 
should be at night It appears from the Devi-purSna and Kalika- 
liurana that pSj* in the morning, mid-day and at night ia 
intended** « When the sun fa in sign Virgo, the devotee should 
fofow the method of e<tfiata or naftte or take food only once or 
subsist only on water beginning from ttmncmdtka tithiof the 
bright half, should bathe in the morning, should riBe superior to 
the opposites (of heat and cola, happiness and pain &o) and 
Should worship (Siva and) Sivs three times a day.' The Kala- 
tafctvaviveeana* 6 resolves this conflict by saying that mormng 
and midday p&jas are brief, the principal and elaborate pfijs 
is at night only. There is some confusion oaused by the texts

having worshipped her on UttarfisadM should take leave of her 

on Sravana'. 467 Most digests refer only to the tithis. For 

example, we saw above ( p. 159 note 411) that on the 7th tithi the 

bilva branch is to be brought to the house, on the 8th fast, paja and 

jagara are to be observed, the bait is offered on 9th, and on the 

10th nirUjana and discharging the Devi take place. Some 

texts combine the tithi and naksatra for the several parts of 

Durgapuja. For example, the Bajamartanda verse (q inn. 426 

above) says ' one should, after propitiating with faith (Devi) by 

the head, flesh and blood of several kinds of animals, take leave 

of her on Sravana-oaksatra and 10th tithi'. The Devlpurana 

provides 468 'The bilva tree should be addressed with a mantra 

on 6th tithi joined to Jyestha, (the sheaf of) plants Bhould be 

brought into the house on the 7th joined to Mula, fast, puja and 

homo take place on the 8th joined to Purvasadha, on the 9th 

joined to TJttarassdha one should worship Durga with animal 

sacrifices and after prostrating oneself before her leave should 

betaken of her on 10th tithi joined to Sravana'. It often 

happened that the tithi and naksatra provided for an item did 

not tally and some rales were evolved. The first rule is: if both 

tithi and naksatra as provided tallied then that led to very good 

results, as said in the Lingapurana ' even if there be no Mula- 

naksatra, one should enter the bilva branch in the house on the 

seventh; the same rule applies to other tithis, but if the naksatras 

exist on the tithis specified there is increase of the results or

rewards," The second rule was that fctftf was superior 4 ® and 
therefore even if the nafcsatra did not exirt on the tithi specified, 
one should follow the tithi laid down for the several items in 
DurgSpujS. De vala and Lalla M0 laid this down. 

One question on which there is difference of view is about 

the tithi on which NavarStra is to be begun when pratipad is 

mixed with amaVSsya or dvitlyS. There are very lengthy 

discussions in the Nirnayasindhn, Kalatattvaviveoana, 

Purusartha-ointBmani and other works. Some quote passages 

from the Devi and other purSnas condemning the beginning of 

navaratra on pratipad mixed with amSvasyS. Devi is made 01 

to say 'in my worship pratipad which is joined to amavSay* 

should not be accepted; pratipad existing only foramuhQrta 

( two ghatfkss) at sunrise and then joined to the 2nd tithi should 

he accepted (for commencing NavarStra festival)*. On the 

other hand there*"* are texts like the following: if one ware to 

accept for the (beginning of the) worship of OandikS pratipad 

Joined to part of 2nd MM through ignorance or through another % 

advice, that leads to the death of that person's son. The Barna- 

yamaynkha says that both olaaBes of texts ate baseless or if tuey 

ate authoritative they leave the matter undecided as they m 

opposed to each other. The deoision has to be arrived at to a 

different manner. «H pratipad is mixed with amSvasya hut 

does not exist the next day, then it must be accepted for starting 

NavarStraas there is no other alternative. Therefore, even a 

pratipad mixed with amavasya has to be accepted in «*•*»

then the full pratipad has to be accepted for beginning nava- 
r&tra. li at first there is amavasya for one muhurta, then 
pratipad follows and then spreads over the next day up to less 
than three muhurtas, then thiB latter, that is, pratipad mixed 
with dvitlya has to be accepted as the beginning. For want of 
space all possible alternatives are not dealt with here. 

One important matter was not stressed above. On the first 
day of Navaratra one has to establish a kafaia or ghaia. A full 
kalasa has been a symbol of holiness and prosperity from early 
Vedic times (compare $g. HI. 32.15 ' Spurno asyakalasah'). 
This ib a rite which is performed in the Deccan, Gujarat and 
SaurSstra even though the elaborate Durgapuja of Bengal finds 
no place there. The procedure given in Durg&bhafctitaranginl 
p 3. Nirnayasindhu (p. 767), VratarSja (pp. 6S-fi6), FurusSrtha- 
ointamani (pp. 66-67) and other works is elaborate. Ghata-

to be performed by day and not at night. One Bhould make* 73

if these two exist the whole of the day, then the rite should be

these textB were baseless According to Ghosh (p. 76), in Bengal 
nine j'ars are established in a figure (sartatcbhadrd) filled with

devotee's own blood and flesh, and of he-buffaloes, goats and 
rams. It specifies the periods for which gratification is felt by 
the Devi by the offering of various bah& and avers that all 
dasyus and various mleccha tribes, the Angas, Yangas, Kalingas, 
Khmaras, Barbaras and Sakaa worship her. 

The Krtyakalpataru on Yrata does contain a vrata called 
Durgastamlvrata derived from the Devlpurana (pp. 225-233), 
but it has nothing to do with the exploits of Durga. 

Hemadri also (on vrata, vol. I. pp. 856-862) contains the 
same vrata with a few variations. That vrata is entirely 
different from the Durgotsava described in the Kalikapurana. 
In the first place there is no reference in it to the killing of 
Mahisasura. In the next place, that vrata is described as 
beginning from the 8th of Safravana-sukla and going on for one 
year in each succeeding month on the 8th of the bright half. 
Feeding virgins and brahmanas is mentioned in it also, but in 
each month the food offered to Devi and to the virgins is 
generally different. 

About the antiquity of the worship of Durga, vide H. of Dh. 
vol H pp. 738-739. A few matters that were not and that could 
not be mentioned there are noted here. Ambika is said to be 
the sister of Siva in Tai.* 77 B., but in the times of the Tai. At. X. 
18 Siva is said to be the husband of Ambika or TJma. In the 
Vanaparva chap. 6 (where there is a long laud of Durga 478 by 
Yudhisthiia), she is described as the daughter of Yaioda and 
Nanda and as the sister of Vasudeva, is addressed as Kali, 
Mahakall and Durga, in verses 10-11 the weapons carried by her 
in her hands are mentioned and in verse 15 she is Baid to have 
destroyed Mahisasura. When Arjuna (in Bhlsma 23} offers a 
Durg&stotra at the bidding of Krsna, he gives her several names, 
among which are Kumarl, Kali, Kapall, KapilS, Bhadrakall, 
Mahakall, Candl, Kfttyayanl, KausikI, Uma. But as the dates 
of these passages in the Mahabharata are far from certain no 
chronologi cal conclusion oan be stated. Literary works and

coins supply some firm data about the antiquity of theDorgft 
cult. In the Kaghuvamsa chap U a lion is said to have been 
appointed a guard to protect a deiaffirV, (pj D e) tree planted by 
Pfirvatt. PsrvatI is oalled Gaurf m Baghu. II 26 and in Kumfira- 
sambhava VJX 95 and Bhavanl in KumBrao (VIX 84), Oaiidl in 
Meghadfita (I 83). Similarly, in the KumSrasambhava the 
ArdhanSrlsvara form of Siva is mentioned* 9 The mitrs are 
referred to in the same work (VH 30, 38) and also Kali with 
skulls as ornaments (ibid V3X 39) In the Malatr-madhava 
(Act V) the offering of human victims to Osmunds in the city of 
PadmavatI is mentioned. In the Mroohakatika VI 27 the 
legend of the killing of Snmbha and Nisumbha hy DurgS occurs, 
IF wa hold that JCalidasa flourished between 350-450 A D„ the 
above evidence makes it Quite probable that the warship of 
BurgS may go back some centuries before 300 A. D The evid- 
ence of coins lends support to this conclusion. A simhavahni 
goddess is seen on the reverse of the coinB of Oandragnpta I of 
the Gupta 480 dynasty (about 305-325 A.D). On a coin of the late 
Kusana king Kaneshko the reverse shows the figure of a goddess 
with a lunar crescent seated 'full face on a lion crouohing left 
and the godddess appears to have a noosB and sceptre 481 The 
lion as vehicle and the noose indicate that the goddess should be 
Durga and not Laksml. This would take us to the first or %v& 
century A. D. 

Why two ffavarStras were recognized (in Oaitra and 
£svuta) is a matter of conjecture. It is possible that these 
two pujas arose from the faot that spring crops and autumn 
crops became ready at these two times The worship of Durga 
was very much influenced by Sakta doctrines and praofaoea. 
Ghosh m his work on 'Durgapnja * (p XVI ff ) tries to establish 
that the Vedic idea of Dawn (Usas) spreading over the sky was 
ohanged by thePuranas andTantras into the terrific goddess 
DurgS lam not prepared to aooept this explanation atau, 
as the links between the Vedio goddess Dawn and the terrible 
goddess of the BShka-purSna are altogether wantmg and as

tion between Durga ( Virgo ) riding a lion (Leo). But this also 
cannot be dearly made out. 

In the Indian Historical Quarterly voL 81 (pp 227-331) 
Mr. N. G. Banerjee refers to the Durgotsava-paddhati of Udaya- 
simha which begins with the MahanavamI and asankalpafor 
victory and ends with the description of horses marching on 
daiaml to victory and avers that this work indicates that 
Dnrgapuja was originally a military rite and was later on trans- 
formed into a religious festival He relies upon the description 
in the Eaghuvamsa (IV. 24-25 ) how the advent of Sarad 
(autumn) season impelled Raghu to march on an invasion and 
to perform the iantx rite for horses called Asvanirajana and also 
on the Brhatsamhita. chap. 44 (Kern's ed.) where occurs an 
elaborate description of the nlrajana of horses, elephants and 
fighters on the 8th, 12th, or 15th of the bright half of Ssvina or 
KSrtika. There are serious objections against accepting this 
theory. It is not unknown that unconnected celebrations may 
ba joined together on the same tithi or tithis. For example, in 
many parts of North India the Bamalila festival for ten days iB 
associated with Navaratra days. But NavarStra and RamaMs 
are independent of each other and in some parts even of North 
India, only one or the other is popular and celebrated and not 
both There is nothing improbable in there being two occasions 
for nlrajana, one in Durgotsava and another on the occasion of 
a king's march on an invasion Besides, a work of the 15th 
century can hardly be relied upon as evidence for explaining 
the origin of a festival that waB in vogue for about a thousand 
yeaiB at least before that work. Moreover, if it was the usage 
to celebrate the marching on an invasion in J&svina with 
nlrajana (lustration), that rite might have been borrowed from 
that in Durgotsava by analogy instead of the utsava having 
adopted the military usage. The Kalika-purana which describes 
at length Durgotsava also speaks of the nlrajana in JSsvina- 
sukla on the 8th and the worship of a noble handsome horse for 
seven days with sandalwood paste, flowers &o and requires the 
observation of the horse's movements for drawing prognostica- 
tions (chap 88. 15-75). There is nothing to show that the details 
of Durgotsava described in the Kalika and other puranas did not 
exist in the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries A. D. when Kalidssa and 
Varahamihira flourished and mentioned the lustration of horses. 
The theory of Mr N. G. Banerjee appears to be unwarranted 
by the evidence so far available and cannot be accepted. 



' CHAPTER X 

Vijayadasarm and Divali 

The 10th tithi of Asvina-sukla is called Vrjaya-dasaml 
It is elaborately described in Hemadri (on vrata, vol. 1 pp. 
970-973), Nirnayasindhu (pp 69-70), FurusSxtha-ointainani (pp. 
145-148 ), Vrataraja (pp 359-361 ) and Kalatattva-viveeana (pp. 
309-312), Dharmasindhu (p 96) As DasamI (10th tithi) is not 
mentioned in the YugmavUkya the Kalanirnaya relies on a verse 
that in the bright half that tithi which exists at sunrise 
should be accepted for performance of rites and in the dark half 
the one that exists at sunset WI Hemadri proposed (on vratavoL I 
p 973) two simple rules (when 10th is mddhn) that that tithi on 
Which Sravana-naksatra exists should be accepted and in all 
other oases 10th mixed with 9th be aooepted. But the other 
digests introduce many other considerations and complicated 
rules follow. A few of them are given below H the lOflt 
tithi is mixed up with 9th and 11th, the day on which it ib 
mixed with 9th should be accepted provided there is no Sravana- 
naksatra on the next. The Skanda Bays: Apar«jita-devl should 
be worshipped by men on the 10th towards the north-east and 
in the afternoon, when the 10th is mixed with 9th. Aparajita 
should be worshipped on that day for welfare and viotory. 
Another verse «** is 'A person should offer worship on the 10th 
tithi in Asvina bright half and should not perform the worship 
of Aparajita on Ekadasl* It must be remembered that tfte 
proper time for Vijayfi-dasamI rites is aparShna (afternoon) ana 
vradosa«» is gaunaksla (secondary time). If 10th extends over 
aparahna on two days, the first (i. e 10th mixed with 9th) shouM 
he accepted. K the 10th exists at pradosa time (but art > « 
aparahna) on two days, then the later (viz. 10th mixed with UW 
should be accepted; Sravana is not decisive just as Eonini n

Janmastaml is not. If on both days the tenth tithi does not exist 
at the time of aparahna then the first (10thmixedwith9th)istobe 
accepted ; but in this case if on the 2nd day Sravana-naksatra 
exists at the time of aparahna then the latter (10th mixed with 
11th) is to be accepted. These are the conclusions of ST. S. The 
P. 0. (p. 148) disputes the last proposition. Hemadri and follow- 
ing him Kirnayasindhu (p. 189) quote Kasyapa 483 to the follow- 
ing effect: 'if dasaml exists for some time at sunrise and if 
there is then ekadasi for the rest of that day and there is 
Sravana-naksatra at aparahna on that day, that tithi is called 
Yijaya; since Bama started on his invasion (against Havana) on 
Sravana-naksatra, men should celebrate the crossing of the 
limits of their village on that day and naksatra*. The Nirnaya- 
sindhu and other works quote a verae 481 ' That time (on 10th tithi

the stars have just begun to appear is to be known as Vijaya 
and tends to the success of all undertakings.' Bhrgu says 'the 485 
11th muhGrta (on a day of 15 muhurtas) is called Yijaya; all 
desirous of victory should march out at that time.' These verses 
explain why this tithi is called Yijaya-dasamL These two verses 
show that the time called Yijaya is of two kinds. 

The YijayadasamI is one of the three most auspicious days 
In the year (the other two being Caitra-sukla fast tithi and 
KSrtika-sukla 1st). Therefore in India children begin to 
learn the alphabet on this day (i e. perform SarasvatlpQjana), 
people start new undertakings on this day, even when the moon

king marches against his foes on this tithi when there is 
Sravana-naksatra it is very auspicious and brings to him 
victory and peace. 

On this day the principal acts are the worship of AparSjitS, 
the worship of Saml, Slmollanghana ( crossing the boundary of 
one's village ), returning home and having a lamp waved before 
oneself by the women in the house, wearing new clothes and 
ornaments and in the case of a king, nlrajana of the horses, 
elephants, soldiers and marching out. 

Dasara or Vijayadasaml is a great day for people of all 
castes, but it is specially a day for the ksatriyas, the nobles and 
kings. 

The procedure of the worship of AparaptS (invincible) Devi 
is briefly as follows (from Dbarmasindhu p 96) Lithe after- 
noon one should go to the north-east of one's village, smear the 
earth (with cowdung) on a pure spot, should draw with sandal- 
wood paste or the like a figure with eight segments, should make 
a santozlpa as in the note and should invoke Apar&jits m the 
midst of that figure with the words 'salutations to Apar&jife 
and also invoke Jays and Vijaya to the right and left of 
Aparsjita respectively with the words 'salutation to Kriyaflakti 
and 'salutation to Urna* respectively. He should then offer 
worship with sixteen upaoSras to Aparajita, Jays and Vijaya 
with the mantras * Aparajitsyai namah, Jayayai namah, 
Vijayayai namah' and offer the prayer 'O Devil «°f*»?^ 
puis which I have offered to you according to my ability, tor 
my protection may you go to your own place \ Li the ,*** 
Se ktag he should pray for victory in the words 'May Apatite 
wearing a striking necklace and resplendent ■*____*_"{

Vijayadaiaml 191 

In the oase of the king the procedure described by Hemadri 
(on vrata vol J. pp. 970-71 ) is as follows : the king coming out 
of his palace should be preceded by his purohtta and after per- 
forming the rites on starting for a journey should march towards 
the east; after reaching the end of the capital he should perform 
Vastupuja (worship of a site) and worship the guardians of the 
quarters and the devatas (in temples) he may meet on the 
road He should then offer worship to SamI tree with Pauranika 
mantra 488 '! take refuge with the blessed and auspicious SamI 
tree, that removes all inauspicious things and evil acts and the 
effects of bad dreams'; then he (the king) should take first 
towards the east and towards other directions the Visnu steps. 
After making an effigy of his enemy or merely bringing him 
before his mind he (the king) should pierce him in the heart 
with an arrow 489 with a golden shaft The purohita recites 
verses about the victory of the king in the quarters; the king 
should honour worthy brahmanas, the astrologer and purohita 
and should arrange sports of elephants, horses and foot-soldiers. 
He should then enter his palace to the accompaniment of 
auspicious shouts like ' Jaya' and lights should be waved before 
him by courtezans. The king who performs every year this 
auspicious ceremony secures long life, health, prosperity and 
victory; he suffers from no ailments physical or mental nor 
defeat and obtains unblemished wealth and viotory in the world. 
Xf a king 49D starts on an invasion without celebrating Vijaya- 
dasaml he would secure no victory for a year in his kingdom. 
The Tithi-tattva quotes Rajamartanda 4M to the effect that if for 
any reason the king cannot march out in person on Vijaya- 
dasaml he should send out his umbrella or favourite weapon for a 
victorious march. The ETirnayasindhu, Dharmasindhu and other

late medieval works add some verses about Saml and other 
details* 82 'Saml destroys sin, Saml has reddish thorns, it held 
(concealed) the arrows of Aijuna and it appealed lovingly to 
Bama, O Saml worshipped by Bfimal May you remove obstacles 
on the march that I am to undertake according to my convenience 
and ease'. If a Saml tree is not available, then the ft6m»ntpirft 
tree « should be worshipped with a mantra (given in note below). 
Taking up a little wet clay from the root of the Saml tree 
together with akaatas one should bring it to one's house to the 
accompaniment of songs and loud instrumental music; then the 
perBon should wear new apparel and ornaments along with his 
relatives and lights should be waved before him as an auspicious 
rite by chaste young women. 494 

In modern times on Vrfayadasaml there is samlpiya in 
many parts of India, But saml is a rare tree In MabsrSstra 
and Konkana, twigs of a tree called iLpta are brought from the 
forest and arranged in the form of a bush near a temple and in 
the afternoon'the people of a town or village engage u a sort of 
mook scramble for taking away twigs of -Spta" and distribute the 
leaves among their neighbours, friends and relatives saying 'take 
this gold'. In Saurastra and in several other places there is no 
such distribution of leaves. The Eharmasindhu notes that oommon 
people (in Maharastra) out off twigs of &ml and take them to 
their houses but that this has no sastra basis ** In some places 
a he-bunalo or a goat was formerly sacrificed on thiB day In 
the former princely States of India suoh as Baroda and Mysore

durbars were held on Vijayadasaml (or Dasara, as it is called) and 
grand processions with, richly caparisoned elephants and pranc- 
ing horaes were taken out on the streets of the capital The 
kings in ancient and medieval times performed the ffirajana 
ceremony of horses and elephants, soldiers and the king himself. 
Kalidasa mentions that when sarad came Baghu performed the 
fenti rite called vajinirajana (Raghuvamsa IV. 24-25). In his 
Brhatsamhita (chap. 44. ed by Kern) Yaraha describes at length 
lustration rites for horses, elephants and men The Nirnaya- 
sindhu sets oat the mantras at the time of nlrajana of the army 
1 goddess, ruling over gods I may my army divided into four 
sections (elephants, chariots, horsemen and foot-soldiers) attain 
to the position of having no enemy left in this world and may 
viotory come to me everywhere through your favour.' The Tithi- 
tattva provides that the king after performing nlrajana for vigour 
to his army should see the fine khafljana bird in the vicinity of 
water or cowpens and address it with the mantra 491 ' O khafija- 
rltabirdl you have come to the earth, you have a blue and auspi- 
cious neck and you bestow all desires ; salutation to you P The 
Tithitattvathen (p. 103) desoants upon the conclusions about the 
future to be drawn from the several places where the khafijarlta 
(wagtail) is seen and from the directions in which it is seen. 
The Brhatsamhita has a chapter (45) on the auguries to be drawn 
from the sight of the khanjana bird, almost the whole of which 
is quoted by the Krtyaratnakara (pp 366-873) and a few verses 
of whioh are quoted by Yarsakriyakaumudl pp 450-51. In 
Manu V. 14 and Y5] X 174 among the birds whose flesh is for- 
bidden for eating is khafijarlta (probably because it was such a 
valuable bird for prognostications). 

In some parts of Northern India Ramallla celebrations go 
on for ten days and culminate on the 10th of Ssvina in the 
burning of a tall hollow paper and wickerwork structure conceal- 
ing crackers representing Havana and his hosts. 

There are several other local customs and usages such as 
Worship of weapons of war and implements of one's trade or 
avocation associated with Dasara or Vijayadasaml which are 
Passed over here for reasons of space.

There are many conjectures about the origin of the 
.DasarS, festival Some, relying on the usages of some parte of 
India to offer to gods ears of new corn, of banging on the 
doors of the bouse the ears of green or unripe paddy and of 
putting in the turban young sprouts of wheat and the like, hold 
that it is more or less an agricultural festival Others hold 
that as, about Dasara monsoon rains stop, swollen rivers abate 
and crops are near being garnered, it is the most suitable 
time for marching on an expedition and that therefore the 
origin is due to military exigencies. I incline to the latter 
view In ancient countries other than India, there was a fixed 
season when kings went to battle For example, we read in 
II Samuel ohap. 11 1 ' And it came to pass, after the year was 
expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that, David 
sentJoab' The cult of Saml is very ancient. Two logs of wood 
(areas*) from an Asvattba tree growing inside a SamI were 
employed in producing fire by attrition for Vedic sacrifice* 
ffire symbolizes vigour and valour and logs of SamI aw helpful 
in producing fire and saml wood is Very hard. In ttw Atharva- 
veda (VILU 1) we have the words 'the Asvattha tree rides 
SamI*. TbeTai. Br 12.1 16 refers to Agni being produced 
from Asvattha that is 'Samlgarbba' and Tai. Br. 12 1.7 con- 
nects SamI with santi (the removal of adverse Bigna). In the 
Tai. A\ ( VI 9. %.) we read 'O SamI I remove from us (destroy) 
sins and enmities ' (saml eamayasmad-aghs dvessmsi ). It had 
some affinity with MavarStra also, as the latter celehratesthe 
military exploit of Devi against MahisSsura, and was&erefore 
oelebrated immediately after Mavarfitaa. The word Dasara, is 
derived from 'dasa' meaning 10 and «ahan' (a day)

contributed to the Journal of the Ganganath Jhalnstitute (voLIH.

The Bhavisyottara contains a charming verse with a double

like Bamayana in which the thunder of clouds is stopped (or in 
which Meghanada i. e. Indrajit, son of Kavana, is described as 
killed), in which the tips of wicks are burning (or in which 
Havana became infuriated) and in which young women find 
delight (or with which Rama iB pleased). Some works like the 
N. S. andKalatattvavivecana(p. 315) hold. that the three days 
viz. 14th, amavasya and Eartika first, constitute the Kaumudl 
festival. 4 " 

Taken all in all Dlpavall spreads over about five days. The 
whole festival comprises five principal items spread over five 
days, viz. worship of wealth, the celebration of Visnu's victory 
over NarakSsura, worship of LaksmI, victory of Yisnu over Bali 
and dice-play and the exchange of brotherly and sisterly 
affection. There are illuminations and the discharge of crackers 
on almost all the five days from the 13th of the dark half of 
Sivina This last is called in Gujarat and Saurastra 'Dhanteras*. 
Before and on this day houses are painted and decorated, the 
courtyards of houses are cleaned, and metal vessels are polished 
and illuminations begin. The FadmapurSna "VX 124. 4 refers 
to illuminations on the 13th of the dark half of Ksrtika (by the

13th outside the house in honour of Yama in order to avoid 
accidental death 500 

The Bhavisyottara contains a lengthy description of the 
four days of theDivall festival from the 14th, I shall take 
that chapter as basis and add, where necessary, other passages 
from other texts 

On the 14th of the dark half of jSsvina 501 ( or of Kartika in 
the pQrnimfinta reckoning) persons afraid of Hell should take an 
oil bath at the time of daybreak, should whirl over their heads 
the twigs of ApSmarga tree together with clods of ploughed land 
and the thorns (of the twigs) The mantra to be repeated is noted 
below 503 Then the purana provides for tarpana( satiation with 
afijalis of water &o mixed with sesame) to Yama and mentions 
seven names of Yama 503 Then the pnrSna provides that a lamp 
should be lit for Naraka (i. e. for the avoidance of Maraka) and 
that in the evening illumination with charming lamps should be 
provided in the temples ofBrahmS, Visnu, &vaand others, in 
mathas (monasteries), in rooms for implements, on caityas 
(mounds on which sacred trees grow), in assembly halls, on 
rivers, and ramparts, in parks, wells, principal roads and in the 
women's apartments, in shrines of siddhas, Arhats (Jaina saints), 
Buddha, C&rnunda, Bhairava, in isolated stables for horses and 
elephants (verses 15-17) Other texts provide that on this day

in the midst of the bath one should whirl over one's hody twigs 
and leaves of apSmarga or of gourd or of prapunnata (called 
T&kla in Marathi) for the removal of hell and that one should 
light a lamp with four wicks in memory of Narakasura. It was 
believed 501 that LaksmI came to dwell in oil and the Ganges 
came to all waters on the 14th in Dlpavall and he who would 
take an oil hath on this morning would not see the world of 
Tama. In modern times, people in the Deccan after their hath 
on 14th crush under their foot a hitter fruit called Kartt, which 
probably represents Harakasura. The oil hath was to be taken 
about the time of arunodaya, but if for Borne reason it could not 
'be done then it may be taken even after sunrise. 505 The 
Dharmasindhu says that even yatis (ascetics) should undergo the 
oil bath on this day. It appears probable that originally the 
14th was called Narakaoaturdasl because Yama was to be 
propitiated for fear of HelL Later on the legend about the 
killing by Krsna of Narakasura, king of Pragjyotisa city 
(Kamarupa), said to have been born of the Earth when it came in 
contact with the Varaha incarnation of Visnu, was pressed into 
service. People now-adays remember only Narakasura on this 
day and hardly any one performs Yamatarpana. SB The depreda- 
tions of Narakasura are narrated in the Visnupurana V. 29 and 
in the Bhagavata X (uttarardha) chap. 59. He deprived Aditi, 
the mother of gods, of her ear ornaments, Varuna of his umbrella, 
Mandara of a peak called Maniparvata and kidnapped 16100 
girls of gods, siddhas and kings and imprisoned them in his 
palace s" Krsna killed him and if Parana descriptions are to be 
treated as historical Krsna's actions were prompted by great pity

The Ttthitattva notes that there is a usage of eating 

with the Uth tithi, enumerates them from Mmayamrte and 
rooommonds that this should he followed. 508 

Several works such as the Varsakriyfi-kaumudl and the 
Dharmasmdhu prescribe that™ on tho evenings of the l4thof 
the dark half and amSvasya of Asvina men with firebrands in 
their hands should show the way to their pita (deceased 
ancestors) with the mantra 'May those men in my family who 
were oremated and those who had no cremation performed for 
them and thoso that were burnt only by resplendent fire (without 
religious rites?), reach the highest state (or goal); may those 
(pita) who, leaving the world of Yama, came for the Mahmaya 
srMdhaB (in the dark half of Bhadrapada or JLsvina aco to 
pBrnimanta reckoning) find their way by the brilliant light (of 
the firebrands) and reach (their own worlds) 

The medieval texts prescribe on 14th of Asvina 5U> dark 
half the performance of the following acts, viz oil bath, taxpana 
of Yama, lighting lamp for Naraka, illuminations at night, 
holding firebrands, worship of Siva, worship of MahSratri, taking 
food at night only Out of these only three (viz oil bath, 
lighting a lamp for Naraka and night illumination) are 
now-adays generally performed and the rest are omitted. After 
the bath people put on new clothes and ornaments and take a 
repast of sweets and the like and in the noon there is a 
sumptous feast There is a good deal of discussion in the 
Nirnayasindhu (p. 197), P.C (p. 241), Dharmasindhu (p 104) 
about the time when oil bath is to be taken, if the 14th is mixed

NarakaeaturdasI is also called BhutaoaturdasI in Ertyatattva 
(p. 450). 

On all the three days, viz. 14th of dark half of £svina,atna- 
vtsya, and the first of Kartika-Sukla an oil bath in the morning is 
prescribed for him who desires wealth and prosperity. 

Sivina amavasya is a very important day. One should 
take an oil hath in the morning 511 and perform the worship of 
LaksmI for the removal of alaksml (had luck, penury) Some 
texts add that the harks of five trees 512 should be boiled in 
water for the bath and the person should have lights waved 
before him by women. The Bhavisyottara (in chap 140, verses 
14-29 ) describes the celebrations on am&vasya at some length. 
Briefly it comes to this. In the morning one should take ( an 
oil) bath, worship gods and pitrs and perform the parvana 
sraddha with curds, milk, ghee and feed brahmanas with various 
edibles. Then in the afternoon the king should proclaim in his 
capital 'today is the sovereignty of Bali; O people] enjoy 
yourselves '. People also in their houses should make merry with 
dance and music, should offer tambula to each other and anoint 
their bodies with saffron powder, dress themselves in silken 
robes and wear gold and jewels, young women move about in 
groups wearing brilliant clothes, the houses should be full of 
rows of lamps, handsome maidens should oast rice grains about 
and the waving of lamps ( nfrajana ) should be resorted to whioh 
confers victory. Towards midnight the king should move about 
m the capital on foot to see the fun and charm of the festival 
and than return to his palace. When midnight is past and 
people's eyes are heavy with approaching sleep, the women in 
the city should create great noise by beating winnowing baskets 
and drums and Bhould drive out oiakgmi (ill luck) from the court- 
yards of their houses. Hemadri ( on vrata vol IL pp. 348-349 ) 
quotes from Bhavisya certain additional items: 'no one except 
children or ailing persons should take a meal by day, one should 
worship LaksmI in the evening and should illuminate with 
treelike rows of lights shrineB of gods, squares where four roads 
meet, cemeteries, rivers, mountains, houses, bottoms of trees, 
cowpens, oaves. They should decorate shops where merchandise

brShmanas and hungry persons in places surrounded by lamps and 
take dinner dressed in white garments and decked with ornaments* 
The JTlIamata-purana calls this amavasya night 'Sukh-suptiks' 
and describes it (verses 505-510) in the same way as Hemadn's 
quotation does 513 In Bengal Kali is worshipped on this day, 
who it is said is both LaksmI and Sarasvatl In modern times 
this is a day specially for merchants and traders. On this day 
they worship their books of account, invite friends, customers 
and other traders and give them tSmbulri and some sweets. Old 
accounts are closed and new ones opened. There is a popular 
legend that Brahma gave to brahmanas raksabandhana (Sravana 
Full Moon day) as their festival, Dasara to ksatriyas, DrvSlI to 
traders and Holika to SQdras The night of the worship of 
LaksmI 514 is called Sukharatri, since LaksmI gives up her slepp 
on the amavasya when the sun is in Libra (or Balance) audit 1b 
provided in some works that at the dawn of Sukharatri when the 
house is illuminated by lamps one should honour one's relatives 
with words of complimentary queries and worship LaksmI, that 
removes the taint of ill luck, with auspicious flowers, sandal- 
wood paste, curds, yellow pigment and fruits The Krtyatattva 
quotes a verse " when there is 14th tithi in a portion of the day 
and there is amavssyS on the night of that day LaksmI 
should be worshipped and (that night) should be known as 
Sukharatnka" and then gives an elaborate procedure of tho 
worship of LaksmI. Some works such as the Varsaknya- 
kaumudl, Krtyatattva (p 453) and Dharmasindhu (p 107)

provides that on this Sukharatri not only LaksmI "but also 
Kuhera 515 is to be worshipped. 

The first of Ksrtika-Snkla is regarded as one of the three 
most auspicious days of the year. The Dhaxmasindhu ** 
remarks that though the three days from the 14th tithi are 
designated DlpSvali yet that day which has Svati-naksatra is 
most commended. It may he stated that Balipratipads is often 
conjoined to Svati-naksatra. On this day also an oil bath is 
obligatory. The most important item on this tithi is the 
worship of Bali The Bhavisyottara (140. 47-73) describes this 
worship of Bali as follows : The king should at night draw the 
figure of Bali having two arms on a circle made on the ground 
with five coloured powders; the image should have all ornaments 
and should have Yindhyavali (Bali's queen) near him, should 
be surrounded by asuras like Kusmanda, Bana, Mura and others, 
should wear a crown and ear ornaments; the king should himself 
offer worship in the midst of his palace together with his brothers 
and ministers with several kinds of lotuses and offer sandalwood 
paste, incense and nawedya of food including wine and meat 
and employ the following mantra 517 'salutation to you, O king 
Bali, son of Yirocana, enemy of gods and the future Indra, 
accept this worship.' Having thus worshipped he should keep 
awake at night by arranging for dramatic speotaoles presented 
by actors based on stories about ksatriyas. Ordinary people 
also should establish inside their houses on a couch the image of 
king Bali made with white rice grains and worship it with 
flowers and fruits. Whatever gifts, 518 large or small, are made

The Krtyatattva (p 453) provides that three aajahs of flowers 
should be offered to Bali The Bhavisyottara adds 'this tifiu 
increases the dominion of Bali; baths and gifts made on this 
tithi in Ksrtika yield a hundredfold reward ' 

If the pratipad is mixed with amavasyS ordvitfya, the 
worship of Bali, the proper time of which is night, should be 
performed on pratipad mixed with amSvSsyS, since HemSdri 
quotes from Padma 'Sivaratri and Bali's day should be observed 
on the day when the tithi is mixed with the preceding tithi' and 
on account of the yugma-takba Madhava also is of the same OT 
opinion 

Bali was the son of Virooana and grandson of Prablsda, a 
great devotee of Visnu. In the Vanaparva (28 2) Bali asks his 
grandfather Prahlada the question 'which is better, hsamS. (for- 
bearance) or tejas' (-rigorous action) In the Ssntiparva 225 18 
it is said that Bah felt jealous of brShmanas The story of Bali 
who had become rety powerful and made gods lose their tejas is 
narrated in BrahmapurSna 73, Kurma I 17, V&nana ohap _77 
and 92, Matsya chap 345-246 and Bhavisyottara 140 Ball 
began an Asvamedha Visnu assumed the form of a Swarf 
brahmana student and begged for land that would be measured 
by his-three steps Though warned by Sukra that toe dwarf was 
really Visnu, Bali promised to give land equal to three steps 
Then the dwarf grew larger and larger and covered heaven ano 
earth in two steps When Vsmana asked Bali where to ptot 
the third step Bali told him to plant it on his back, and Urns Bab 
was thrust into the net her regions. Visnu being ^pleased with

Bali's adherence to his plighted word conferred on Bali the 
overlordship of putala and the position of the future Indra. This 
story is an ancient one. The Mahabhasya M1 on Panini HI I. 
■ 26 states that when a person reoites the story of Bali's imprison- 
ment (in #B£5fahyVisnu) or represents it on the stage people 
use such phraseology as 'Balim bandhayati' (he imprisons Bali), 
though Bali was imprisoned a long time ago. This makes it 
certain that the story was embodied in dramas and poems more 
than two thousand years ago. 

The Balipratipada appears to be called Ylrapratipada 532 
in the Vamana-purana. It is also called Dyutapratipad 
fKrtyatattva p. 452) The puranas 523 say that on that day 
Siva was defeated in dice-play by Parvati, that Sankara became 
sad, while Gaurl remained happy. Therefore, on this day in the 
morning men should resort to gambling. Whoever suoceeded 
on this day in gambling would find that the whole year there- 
after was beneficial to him but if he Buffered defeat in gambling 
that day he would lose his wealth that year. In Ellora care No. 
21 Sankara and Parvati are shown as playing with dies; vide 
plate SS in 'Ellora' by Balasaheb Pant-Pratinidhi of Aundh. In 
many parts of India people engage on this day in gambling and 
fortunes are often lost or made on this day. Even in a com- 
paratively small country like Nepal gambling stakes soared up 
to three million rupees in 1955 on the Balipratipad day.

On this day also there should he illuminations. It is said 
'by lighting 521 lamps during (the day of) Bali's domination 
LakemI becomes stable j this is called Dlpavali because there is 
waving of lights in this festival Having reached (the day of) 
Bali's domination how will lamps be burning in the houses of 
those who do not observe the festival of the rows of lamps? ' 

The Dharmasindhu furnishes 525 a long list of the observances 
on this pratipad day according to the several purSnas and 
digests, viz. worship of Bali, illuminations, holiday for and 
worship of cows and bulls, worship of Govardhana, the tying of 
MargapSlI (lit protectress of the road), wearing new clothes, 
dice-play, waving of lights before men by women (whose 
husbands are alive), and tying up an auspicious garland. In 
modern times only three out of these, viz worship of Bali, illu- 
minations and gambling are observed and the rest are 
hardly observed anywhere Therefore only brief references will 
be made to the rest Cows, calves and bulls are to be worshipped 
with two mantras (quoted in note) and decorated and cows 
are not to he milked and bulls are not to be made to carry burdens 
this day. This is to be done in the morning of Kartika pratipad, 
If it be mixed up with 526 the 2nd it should not be done on that 
day as that would lead to the death of one's sons, wife and loss of 
wealth, but this should be observed when pratipad is mixed with 
amavasya. Devala prescribes this and remarks that by the wor- 
ship of cows -three prosper, viz people, cows and the king Ab

with cowdung or with heaps of cooked food or draw it in a 
picture and woiBhip it along with GopSla (Krsna) and offer all 
the 16 upaoaras to Govardhana and GopSla (Ersna) with 
mantras which pointedly refer to Krsna's giving protection to 
the settlement of cowherds (Gokula) against the heavy down- 
pour of rain to the discomfiture of Indra. The sankalpa is 
given in the note. 527 The naivedya is to he on a grand scale. 
Therefore, the Smrtikaustuhha (p. 174) states that Govardhana* 
pfija 528 is called Annakuta (heap or hill of food) in Padma- 
purana. Vide Var. 164 for Govardhana and Annakutaparikrama 
The Dharmasindhu provides that a homa should be performed 
with the two verses ' a gavo agman ' ( Rg. VI. 28. 1 ) and ' praite 
vadantu* (Bg.X. 94. 1). Mukerji(pp 150-152) describes how 
Govardhana-puja is carried on in some out-oHihe way rural 
tracts in United Provinces, though it has become altogether 
defunct elsewhere. Vide 1 A. vol 60 pp. 187-190 and vol. 61

observed in Bihar, Orissa and some other parts on Kartika first 
of bright half in the afternoon in which cows gaily stamped 
with circular stains of red and blue on their skin and horns 
glistening with oil and red ochre chased a puny pig with their 
pointed horns and killed it. 

In the afternoon of the pratipad(Kartika-sukla) the tying 
of Matgapsll takes place. 529 A rope of kusas or k&sas (Saocha- 
rom spontaneum) should be made according to the usage of 
one's family and tied to a tall pole and a tree in the east; one 
should bow to it and offer a prayer to it with the mantra ( quoted

way underneath the rope. In the same way a strong rope of 
kssas or the like should be made and a tug of war should ensue, 
the rope being frequently pulled on one side by the prineeB and 
on the other by persons of lower oastse The pulling of the 
rope should be done in front of a temple or the palace or where 
four roads meet and an equal number of stiong men should be 
selected for each side. A line should be drawn behind each side. 
If the persons of lower castes succeed in drawing the other side 
towards them then it should he held that the king will he 
victorious thereafter for one year 530 The H&Sjana ceremony by 
women should be performed in the morning (if the pratipad is 
mixed with dvitlya) and the MangalamalikS (a series of ausp- 
icious rites or auspicious garlands) should be performed in the 
evening on the 2nd tithi ( if pratipad exists only for a short time 
and is followed by dvitlya ). sa 

As shown above, the three days from Asvina-krsDa 14th are 
spoken of as days of Kanmudlmahotaam^ 1 The Bhavisyottaia 
and Padma derive the word Kaumudl from *ku" (earth) and the 
root 'mud' to bo delighted, the meaning being 'in which people 
find delight on the earth among themselves* and then another 
etymology is suggested, vm kumudas (white water lilies) are 
offered to Bali in this festival 

In the Vedio period and for soma centuries thereafter 
certain rites were performed in the month of Asvina or in 
Saradsuch as the Asvayujfand Agrayana or Navasasyesti. 
The first is one of the seven pakayajnas mentioned by Gaatama- 
xhvrmuiBlua. (VH119) The first was performed on the *uU 
JETS? of Asvina Vide H of Dh vol It p 827 for a 
SSption of AsvayujI and pp 827-*9 for Agrayana But it is 
S2S to trace the DivaD festival to these rites. How the 
ISS rites first arose cannot be stated with any approachto

plausibility. In the Anusasana parva it is said that the donor of 
lamps shines in the heavens like a row of lights (dlpapradah 
svarga-loke dipamaleva rajate, 98 51). Some writers regard 
these as a reference to the Divali. But it is not so clear as to 
place the matter beyond doubt In L A. voL 32 pp. 237-239 Mr. 
B A Gupte contributed a paper on 'Divali folklore'. He refers 
to the several legends and characteristics connected with the 
DivSlJ, viz, the killing of Narakasura, depriving Bali of his 
empire, the crowning of Rama and Vikrama in these days of 
Divali and illuminations and says that the origin must be 
sought in the movement of the earth round the sun, the change 
of season, the end of the rice crop and the manuring of soil for 
the second crop. The connection he traces is rather remote and 
somewhat fantastic and I am afraid that his theory of origins 
will appeal to very few in these days. 

On the 2nd of the bright half of K&rtika occurs a very 
fine festival called Bhratrdvitiya or Yamadvitlya, The Bhavisya 
states : 533 ■ on fjha 2nd tithi of Kartika bright half Yama was 
treated by Yamuna to a dinner in her house ; therefore this tithi be- 
came declared in the world as Yamadvitlya; wise men should not 
take mid-day meal in their own houses but they should take 
food from the hands of the sister through affection, as doing so 
increases one'B welfare or prosperity. Gifts should be made to 
sisters; all sisters should be honoured with golden ornaments, 
clothes, reception and meals ; but if there be no sister, one should 
nonourawomanwhomhe regards as sister (uncle's or aunt's 
daughter or a friend's sister).* The digests add further details.

and Yamuna with arghya and offer haridfals of flowers. The 
arghya mantra is» 'Qome, come, O Yama, son of the Sun; you 
tbat carry fn your hand a noose; accept this worship offered on 
ifliratrdvitlyS and also arghya; salutation to you I' Then two 
more mantras may be addressed.** 'OEharmarSja, salutation

me along with your servants.; salutation to you. Salutation to 
you, O Yamuna, sister of Yama and honoured by people, always 
- confer on me favours, O daughter of the Sun, salutation to yon I' 
After this she serves food to her brother with the verse « Brother I 
I was born after you; partake of this pure food for' pleasing 
Yama, particularly Yamuna*. If the sister be older than the 
brother she should say *I was born before you'. Then after the 
brother finishes his meal she should deck him with sandalwood 
paste and then herself partake of the food. Some works like the 
VratarSja (pp. 78-fll) present a far more elaborate procedure, 
which is passed over here but two matters provided for by it 
may be mentioned The first is that a person before going to 
his sister's house should mutter ten names of Yama (quoted in 
note 537 ). The second is that the sister is to worship images of 
Yama and of eight mythological personages (Markandeya, 
Bali and others ) supposed to be immortal for the increase of her 
brother's life 53s In modern times hardly any religious cere- 
mony is performed except that residents of places near or on the 
banks of the Yamuna river (Jumna) bathe in the Jumna and 
there ib a mela on the river on this day. The only thing 
generally done is the brother's visiting his sister, dining at her 
house, light being waved before him and his making some 
presents to the sister.

DivaU-BhratfdvitiyS 209 

ThiB festival of Bhr&trdvitlya is really an independent one, 

but it was probably tacked on to the three festive days of Divall 

in order to lengthen out the dayB of fun and joy. Sisters, when 

after their marriage they leave their brother's home, may not 

meet for years and further the sister may have become rich and 

the brother a poor man or vice versa. Our ancient writers evinced 

a keen appreciation of the bonds of disinterested affection 

between brothers and sisters and set apart a day in the year for 

their meeting to enable them to go over their sweet memories 

of childhood and to re-live for a day at least their early life 

which had gone forever. A religions tinge was added to the 

festival by recalling the two mythical personalities of Yama and 

Yarn!, that figure in the famous Yama-Yami hymn ( Eg. X. 10 ). 

I should like to digress a little and Btrongly protest against the 

conclusion drawn by certain Western Sanskrit scholars that the 

hymn is an indication of the prevalence of the usage of the 

marriage of a brother and a sister among anoient Aryans. The 

hymn is a purely imaginative effort 'which bodies forth the 

formB of things unknown', as in the case of Eg. X 119 where 

the poet imagines what India must have felt when treated to 

huge portions of Soma beverage. In Eg. X 10.10 s39 the sage 

makes it clear that in future ages something like what was 

delineated in his fantasy might occur ( namely, sisters might do 

unsisterly acts ). Macdonell in his * Vedie Mythology * (pp. 178- 

' 173) indulges in some facile assumptions. Yama may bean 

Indo-Iranian divinity, but Yarn! does not occur in the Avesta 

at aU, as he himself admits, but only in later Parsi writings. 

Therefore, what is stated in these later writings should not be 

foisted upon the sages of the Egroda. He supposes that the 

sage in Rg. X 10 indulges in propaganda for exonerating Yama 

from incest. Propaganda is well-known to Western countries 

in the 19th and 20th centuries A D The Egveda nowhere 

states that the human race was produced from Yama and Yaml. 

There is no warrant for saying that Yaml is Indo-Iranian and 

consequently the myth of the human raoe being horn from a 

brother and sister is not IndoJranian Pargiter in AIHT 

(p. 70 ) follows the ball set rolling by Macdonell and others and 

boldly asserts that, when the Vayu ( in 93. 12 ) says that Nahusa

and that union between brother and sister was not unknown as 
Bgveda X 10 abont Yama and YamI shows. One suspects the 
motives of a writer like Fargiter who held . high judicial offioe 
in India, when he does not explain why 'pitrkanya' was used and 
not ' svasr ', when he pays no heed to the fact that in many places 
in Vayu ( 73. 5, 73. 1-3, 26, 36, 40, 45, 77 74 ) Mens, AcohodS, 
Plvarl, Qauh, YaiodS, Viraja herself, Narmadfi and GandhakslI 
are spoken of as 'pitrnam manasl kanya', that Vayu (72), 
Matsya ( 13. 0-9 ) and other Poranas speak of seven groupsof 
pftrs and set out how from the mmd-bom daughters ofpitrs 
several Boions were born Viraj5 (described as pitrkanys m 
Vayu 93 12 which Pargiter naively renders as father's daughter 
i e. sister ) is spoken of in the same PurSna ( Vayu 73. 45 ) as 
the 'mind-born daughter % of these ( i. e of Pitrs ) in the plural 
and not as 'iof the father*. Writers like Pargiter sometimes 
create more riddles by their so-called research than they can be 
said to have solved. < >

In Vedio times and in early smrtis like those of Manu 
(EL 11 ) and Y&j. (I 53 ) it was difficult for a brotherless maiden 
to get married (vide H of Dh vol Up 435) But from this it 
is a far cry to say that the BhrStrdvitlya owes its origin to fin* 
idea or practice. 



; CHAPTER XI 

Makarasankranti and Mahasivaratri 

Mdkarar-SaAkranti. This is a very important religious 
observance and festival About 70 years ago ( in the author's 
boyhood) it occurred on the l&th or 13th January according to 
the Beveral Indian almanacs then current, but now it falls, 
owing to the precession of the equinoxes, on the 13th or the 14th 
of January in the month of Pausa. Sankranti means 'the 
(apparent) passage of the sun from one rasi (sign of the Zodiac) 
to the next following' and hence the rasi in which the Sun 
enters is designated as the Sankranti of that name 5n When 
the Sun leaves the rasi called Dhanus and enters the Makara- 
rasi that is called Makarasankranti The rasis are twelve and 
the Sankranti names with their western equivalents are given 
in the note. sa There are only twelve sankrantis even if there 
be an intercalary month in some year. Everyone of the twelve 
sankrantis was regarded as a holy day. The Matsya-puiana 
(ohap 98) deals with the completion of Sankranti-vrata. 
Briefly, it provides that on the day previous a person, whether, 
male or female, should take food only once in the noon and on 
the Sankranti day should brush his teeth and then take a bath 
with water mixed with sesame. 542 The person should offer to a 
self-restrained brahman a householder three vessels containing 
edibles together with a cow intending them to be for Yamaj 
Hudra and Dharma and repeat four verses one of which is as 
follows: "Ajs I do not make any difference between Siva,

the Universe be always a bestower of welfare on me I'. sa The 
person should make, if able, further gifts of ornaments, a bed- 
stead and golden jars ( two ) to the brShmana; but, if poor, 
should offer only fruits to the brahmana. Then he should take 
his meal but without oil and should feed others according to his 
ability. Women also should perform this vrata. Great merit 
was attached to a bath in the Ganges on a sankranti, on an 
eclipse and on New and Full moon, as such a man reached the 
world of Brahma 5 * 4 A bath with ordinary water (not heated) 
was obligatory (mtya) on every sankranti, since the Devi- 
purSna declared ^ " the man who would not take a bath on 
the holy day of Sankranti would be for seven lives diseased 
and poor; whatever offerings are made to gods and pitrs by 
men on sankranti are returned to them by the Sun again in 
several future Hvbb ". 

It may be stated that in ancient texts the entrance of the 
Sun alone in a rfisi is not regarded aB holy time, but the 
entrance of all planets in a naksatra or rasi was deemed to be a 
holy time. MS Hemadri ( on E&la p. 437 ) and the Kfilanirnaya 
(p. 345 ) qpote three verses M7 specifying the holy times [punya- 
kSla ) of the passage of the Sun and planets as follows: in the 
oaseoftheSunthepunya-kalais 16 ghatikas before and after 
the moment of the Sankranti; for the moon it is one ghatt 
and thirteen polos on both sides, for Mars four ghatikas and one 
pala, for Mercury three ghatikas and 14 palas, for Jupiter" 8 four

ghatikas and 37 palas, for Venus four ghatikas and one pala, 
for Saturn 82 ghatikas and 7 palas. 

Though the planets also have sankrantis, later writers hold 
that the word saAIa antt by itself means only Eavi-sankranti, as 
itated by the Smrti-kaustabha p. 531. SB 

The twelve Sankrantis in the year are grouped into four 
classes, viz. there are two ayana sankrantis ( that is Makara— 
sankranti from which udagayana starts and Kaikata-sankranti 
from which Daksinayana starts ), two Visuva sankrantis ( that 
is, Mesa and Tula sankrantis when the day and night are equal 
in length), the four sankrantis called Sadaslti or Sadasltihmukha 
( i. e. Mithuna, Kanya, Dhanus and Mlna ) and Visnupadi or 
Visnupada ( that is, Vrsabha, Simha, Vrscika and Kumbha ) ^ 

Sankranti gradually came to be deified and the Devlpurana 
identified it with Durga herself. The Devlpurana Bays ' Devi is 

( Continued from last page ) 
made on the Snn's sankrantis. For example, vide E. I vol. VII. p. 85

all-pervading on account of the division into very snail and 
large parts in the form of year, ayana, season, month, fortnight, 
day and the like Devi bestows rewards in accordance with the 
divisions into meritorious and sinful ( actions ) ^ Even one act 
done at that time ( of Sankranti } yields results multiplied crore3 
of times. From dharma { righteous acts ) increase life, kingdom, 
progeny, happiness and the like, from adharma (unrighteous 
conduct} spring diseases, sorrows and the like; whatever is 
donated and whatever japa is performed near (ia at the fame 
of) Yisuva (Mesa and Tola) sankr5ntis and at the ayana 
I Makara and Xarkata sarkrSntis) becomes inexhaustible; the 
fame holds good about Tisnupada and Sadaslti-inukha '. 

The exact moment of time when the sun leaves one rasi 
and enters the next following iSsi is impossible of being marked 
by the eyes of flesh (ordinary human eyes). Therefore thirty 
ghatikas before and after the moment of Sankranti are said to 
be the time. sn 

In order to convey how infinitesfmally small is the time of 
the Sun's entrance into a rSsi after leaving another the Derf- 
pursnahas* 3 the following: " thirtieth part of the time taken 
by the throb of the eye of a man sitting happily at ease is called

passage ( from one rasi into another ). As it is not possible to 
perform on such an infinitesimally small point of time the rites 
prescribed for performance on sankranti, one has to accept 
periods of time near this moment as the proper time. The first 
rale is that the nearer 551 the ghatikas are to the time of actual 
entrance the holier they are. Therefore it iB laid down that in 
Bankr&ntisthe punyatama-kala ( holiest time ) is sevenfold 555 
tie. three, four, five, seven, eight, nine or twelve ghatikas; 
during those periods real merit is accumulated. If one cannot 
perform the prescribed rites within these limits thirty ghatikas 
are permitted as the highest limit in the texts for the panyakala 
(holy time) for all sankrantis exoept Sadaslti (in which the 
maximum punyakala is 60 ghatikas ) and VisnupadI ( where it 
is 16 ghatikas before and after ). s* 

Each of these twelve sankrantis in the year is seven-fold 
(1 e. has seven different names) according as it occurs on a 
particular week day or in conjunction with certain classes 
of aaksatras. The seven names 557 are : Manda, MandakinI, 
DhvSnksI, Ghora, Mahodarl, JJSksasI, and Misrita. A sankranti 
( such as Mesa or Earka or Makara ) is called GhorS if it occurs 
on Sunday, Dhvanksl on Monday, Mahodarl on Tuesday, Manda- 
kinI on Wednesday, Manda on Thursday, Misrita on Eriday and 
Bsksasl on Saturday. Again, a sankranti , ( like Mesa or Karka 
and so on) is called respectively Manda, MandakinI, Dhvanksl 
Ghora, Mahodarl, RaksasI, Misrita according as it commences 
respectively on naksatras called dhruva, mrdu, ksipra, ugra,

their observance. Another explanation was to hold that the 
limit of 16 ghatikas applied to sankrantis called Visnupadl. 

A sankranti may take place by day or at night. If 
Sankranti occurs by day that whole day is pnnyakala. If 
Sankranti occurs by night, lengthy and complicated discussions 
occur in Hemadri, Madhava and others. One rule evolved is that 
in ten sankrantis excluding Makara and Karkata sankrantis the 
pnnyakala is by day when those sankrantis occur by night. 

Several exceptions are engrafted on tbe general rule about 
IS or 16 ghatikas before and after a sankranti being the 
pnnyakala. Therefore, several works like the Tithitatfcva (pp. 
144-145) and Dharmasindhn(pp 2-3) give brief final conclu- 
sions on this topic. I summarize 560 " the conclusions of the latter 
work. On the Sun's passage in Mesa and Tula the pnnyakala is 
fifteen ghatikas before and after S ( some say ten ghatikas ); in 
Vrsabha, Simha, Vrsoika, Kumbha S, P is sixteen gh. before S ; 
inMithuna S, Kanyg, Dhanus and Mina S, P is 16 gh. after S; 
in Karkata S, Pis thirty gh. after S; in Makara S,P is forty 
gh. after S. H Sankranti occurs by day when a period of two 
ghatikas or less only remains before the close of the day then in 
the case of Mithuna, Kanya, Dhanus, Mina and also Makara 
Bankrantis P is before S for the gh. specified above against 
each; if S occurs in the morning at a period of twogh. or less 
from sunrise then in Vrsabha, Simha, Vrscika, Kumbha and 
also Karkata S, P is after S for the period specified above. If S 
occurs at night but before midnight, P iB latter half of the day- 
time before the S ; if S occurs at midnight or later than midnight 
but in the night, P iB on two days viz the latter half of the 
daytime before S and the first half of the day after S; this 
applies to all S except Makara and Karkata. When Uttarayana 
begins in Makara in the night F is the day after S and if S 
begins in Karkata at night P is the day prior; if Makara S 
occurs at evening twilight ( i. e. during three ghatikas after 
sunset) then P is on the previous day; if Karka S occurs in 
morning twilight ( i. e. during three gh. before sunrise ) then P 
is on the day following the S. 

This discussion about the punyakala is necessary because a 
bath is to be taken and gifts are to he made during that time in 
order to secure the full merit thereof The general rule is that a

bath is not to be taken and a gift is not to be made at sight 

ParSsara® 1 says ' a bath by day purified by the rays of the Son 

is commended; bathing at night is not commended except on 

seeing an eclipse'. The Visnudharmasutra says the same. Bat 

several exceptions were recognized The Bha-nsyapurana* 2 

provides ' one should not take a bath at night and particularly 

Bhould not make a gift at night, but a bath and a gift may be 

made at night on proper occasions A gift at night is commended 

in an eclipse, marriage, sankranti, pilgrimage, on death, on the 

birth of a child and at (before sitting down for) hearing ihkasa 

(MahabhSrata) ' Gobhila 563 provides ' people may bathe and make 

gifts at night in eclipses, sankrantis, marriage, in distress (or 

death) and on the birth of a child and in vratas undertaken 

for a desired object' A bath is therefore obligatory on every 

sankranti and particularly in Makara-sankrSnti There are 

special recommendations about gifts in Hemadn on Ksla 

(pp. 414-419) which are taken by him from VisvSmitra ana 

which are borrowed by ITirnayasindhu (pp. 4-5), Samaya-

Recommended gifts on sankrantis 219 

of wood and fire, on Kumbha of cows, water and grass, on Mina 
of fresh flowers Special gifts are required to be made on 
Makarasankranti. The Skanda 565 says 'He who donates tila- 
dhenu on Uttarayana (i. e. Makarasankranti) secnres all objects 
and obtains the highest happiness.' The Yisnudharmottara 
provides 'the gift of garments on Uttarayana yields great 
reward (merit ). A man becomes free from diseases by donating 
sesame and a draught bull'. The Sivarahasya declares that Siva 
after he performed the Gosava sacrifice created sesame on 
Makara-sahkranti for the gratification of all men and provides 
'men should bathe in water in which sesame are mixed and one 
should rub one's body with sesame; tarpana of gods andpitrs 
should be made with, water in. which sesame have been put; 
sesame should be given to brahmanas on Uttarayana sankrSnti ; 
one should eat sesame and perform homa with them; those who 
perform homa with sesame and honour brahmanas shine in the 
heaven (as stars) like those who donate a thousand cows; 
auspicious lamps fed with oil of sesame should be lighted in 
Siva temples and a brahmana should worship God ( Siva ) with 
grains of rice and sesame '. The Kalika-purana ( q. by Hemadri 
on Kala p. 413 and Extyakalpao, Waiyata, pp^ 366-67) provides : 
'one should place on the top of (the linga emblem of) God (Siva) the 
five jewels viz gold, diamond, sapphire, ruby and pearl; but if a 
man has none of these he may place in Uttarayana on the top of 
tiw linga gold one 566 kanp or half karsa in weight; he should 
worship with plenty of ghee prepared from cow's milk and should 
donate ghee and a blanket after washing and pressing it; he 
should give condiments and a dinner to brahmanas and ascetics 
and honour them with daksinS'.

eats sesame. 

Gifts are made in these days on Makarasankranta, bnt 
mostly by women. They honour priests by donating vessels 
(of clay, copper or brass) containing several things such as 
betelnuts and coins and also invite their women friends and 
distribute among them earthen vessels containing red powder, 
pieoes of turmeric, betelnut and also separately several other 
things such as sugarcane stalks In south India there is a 
festival called Pongal 57 * which corresponds with theMakara- 
sankranti observed in Northern and Western India, Pongal 
being the first day of the Tamil year. This South Indian 
festival lasts for three days. 

According to the modern astronomical calculations, the 
winter solstice occurs on 21st December and on that day com- 
mences the Sun's apparent march towards the north. But in 
India people who follow the almanacs based on the ancient 
methods and data think that the Sun's march towards foe north 
takes place on the 14th of January, They are thus about twenty 
three days behind the correct MakarasankrSnti owing to the 
preoesion of the equinoxes. This fact was recognized even in 
the medieval DharmasSstra works Tor example, He madri sH

real punyakala occurs and therefore gifts and the like prescribed 
on the occasion of sankranti should also be performed on the 
day twelve days prior to the popular sankranti day. 

The origin of the observances of Makarasankranti cannot 
be very ancient. The Sun's apparent northward march for six 
months has been mentioned in Brahmana and Upanisad texts at 
least a thousand years before Christ For example, the Sata- 
patha 875 Br. states 'That half moon which increases represents 
the gods and that which decreases represents the fathers. The 
day represents the gods and the night represents the fathers. 
And further, the forenoon represents the gods and the afternoon 
the fathers ...Now when he (the sun) moves northwards then 
he is among the gods, then he guards the gods; and when he 
moves southwards then he is among the fathers, then he guards 
the fathers.' The Ghandogya-tTpanisad 576 contains a reference 
to the Sun's passage to the north during six months in the words 
'from light to day, from day to the bright half of the month, 
from the bright half of the month to the six months during which 
the sun goeB towards the north, from the months to the year, from 
the year to the Sun &c.' But here the word v dag-ay ana is not 
expressly employed The word 'ayana' occurs in the Rgveda HI 
33. 7 (ayannapo ayanam-icchamanah) 'the waters Booking a pass- 
age went rushing.' Here ' ayana' has the etymological sense of 
passage' or 'place * But in the grhyasutras the word 'udaga- 
yana' in the sense of the sun's northward passage occurs. The

Vi. 8. 33 it is provided that rites for gods are to be performed in 
toe northward passage of the Sun, some day in the bright half 
of the month and on an auspicious day. As a matter of fact, 
none of the ancient Srauta, Grhya or Dharmasutras mentions any 
raste or prescribes any auspicious or inauspioious times concerned 
with rssis but only times in relation to naksatras Some people 
try to interpret the words 'sustke rndau ' (when the moon is well 
placed i. e auspicious) in Taj. I 80 as referring to rssis, but 
they forget or ignore the fact that the earliest extant com- 
mentator of Yajfiavalkya, Visvarupa, explains those words as 
referring to naksatras and not to rasis. The subject about the 
introduction of rasis will be briefly discussed in the next section 
on Kala and Muhurta. As udagayana had already been 
regarded for many centuries as an auspicious period, naturally 
MakarasankrSnti from which the northward passage of the Sun 
starts became a very sacred day, when the rssi system was 
introduced. Why so much importance was attached to sesame 
on this MakarasankrSnti day it is difficult to Bay Probably in 
view of the cold prevailing at the time of the beginning of 
uttaxSyana an oily substance like sesame easily available and of 
great food value was selected. In any oaBe the observances and 
festival of Hakarasankr&nti do not appear to be muoh older than 
the beginning of the Christian era 

In modern pafioangas, MakarasankrSnti, being deemed to be 
a deity, Bsveral curious matters are added, viz. sankrsnti ndes 
on some vahana (principal vehicle or draught animal such as an 
elephant ) and an upavahana ( as ancillary vehicle ), she wears a 
garment either dark, white or red or of some other colour, she 
is supposed to carry a weapon (such as a bow or javelin ),

she applies a tilalta of some substance (like lac, gorooana), 
she is either young, middle-aged or old, her posture ( sitting, 
standing &o. ) is mentioned, the Sower she holds, the food she 
eats, the ornament she wears-4hese are mentioned, her two 
names ( out of the seven mentioned above on p. 215 note 557 
based on the week day and the naksatra on which sankrSnti 
takes place ) are apeoified, she is supposed to come from one 
direotion ( east or the like ), to proceed to another ( such as the 
west &c ) and to oast a glance at a third direction; then her 
bodily form is described such as drooping lips, long nose, with 
nine arms (or the like). And the prognostications are as 
follows: whatever things Sankranti accepts, their prices rise or 
they axe destroyed and whatever she glances at is ruined; happy 
are the people in the direction from which she comes and un- 
happy are those in the direotion she goes. 

Maha&ivarmri : The 14th tithi of the dark half of a month 
is called Sivaratri, but the 14th of the dark half in Msgha (or in 
Fhalgnna according to the purnimanta reckoning) is the Siva- 
ratri par excellence and is often designated Mahssivaratri. 

The Garudapurana 1. 124, Skanda 1 1. 33, Padma "VX 240,' 
Agni 193 contain the Mshstmya of the Sivaratri on the 14th of 
the dark half of Magha. Though some details differ, in all these 
the main outlines are the same. 

All these praise Sivaratri-vrata highly. When after *■ 
observing a fast on that day, Siva is worshipped with btlva 
leaves and jSgara for the whole night is observed, Siva saves the 
man from hell and bestows enjoyment of happiness and moksa 
and the man becomes like Siva himself. Gifts, sacrifices, 
austerities, pilgrimages and observances of vratas are not equal 
to even one ten-millionth part of ShrarStri. 

# The story that illustrates this extremely exaggerated praise 
of Sivaratri in the Garudapur&na seems to be the older of the 
three and therefore it is briefly set out here. There was a king 
ofTO'sn aos named Sundarasenaka on Mount Abu, who went out

to a forest for hunting with his dog. He bagged no animal and 
being oppressed by hunger and thirst he remained awake the 
whole night on the bank of a tank in a thicket of trees. Under- 
neath a bilva tree there was a Sivalinga and in an effort to keep 
his body at ease he threw down leaves of the bilva tree which 
fell on the top of the linga without his knowing it In order to 
put down dust he ( took water from the tank and ) splashed it so 
that it fell on the linga and one of his arrows fell Sown from his 
hands on the linga through inadvertence which he took from the 
linga by falling on his knees before the linga In this way he 
unconsciously bathed the linga, touched it, worshipped it (with 
bilva leaves) and kept awake the whole night In the morning 
he came back to his house and partook of food given by his 
wife. When he died in course, of time he was seised by the 
myrmidons of Yama, when Siva's attendants fought with 
them and liberated him and he became a sinless attendant of 
6iva together with his dog In this way he collected merit 
without knowing it; if a person does with 579 full knowledge 
(what the nisada did without knowing ) the merit is inexhaus- 
tible. The AgnipurSna expressly mentions the hunter Sundara- 
senaka 580 . The whole chapter of Garuda is quoted in the 
Varsakriya-kaumudl pp. 512^518. The story in the Skanda is 
more elaborate. There it is a wicked KxrUta named Omda who 
killed fish by catching them in his nets and killed also many 
animals and birds. He had a wife who matched him in Mb 
cruelty. Thus passed many years One day he ascended a 
bilva tree taking water in a quiver desirous of killing a wild bow 
and passed the whole night without sleep keeping a watch ana 
cast down many bilva leaves which fell on a linga at foebottom 
of the bilva tree. He also rinsed his mouth with water from Hie 
quiver, that f ell on the linga. In this way he worshipped Siva 
mail ways, viz he bathed (snapana) the linga withwater^he 
worshipped linga with numberless bilva leaves , and .* kept 
awake toe whole night and was without food that day, He 
aSedfrom the tree and began, after reaching the .tank £ 
catch fish. Because he did not return home that «*£*■*»

otobb the river. They both bathed in the river, but before the 
kir&ta could reach the food a dog came there and ate all the 
food. When the wife wanted to kill the dog the kirata whose 
^heart was softened persuaded his wife to desist from killing the 
dog. By that time it was noon (on amav&Bya) and Siva's 
attendants came there to take both the husband and wife as he 
had worshipped (though unknowingly) the linga and as both 
had fasted on 14th. The kirata and his wife reached Sivaloka. 
The Padmapurana ( VI 240. 32 ff ) weaves, as the Skanda does, 
its story round a nisada. 

There is a conflict of views about what the chief thing is in 
SSvaratri is. The Tithitattva holds that a fast is the principal 
thing in &ivaratri and relies on the words of Sankara. ' On that 
tithi ( Sivaratri ) I am not so pleased with bath (of the linga) nor 
with clothes (offered to the linga) nor with incense nor by 
worship nor with the offering of flowers as I am pleased by a 
fast' si On the other hand, Hemadri and Madhava hold that 
Sivaratri means fast, worship and jagarana 58 * and all the three 
are apprehended as principal and quote passages from the 
SkandapurSna and Nagarakhanda in support. 593 'That man 
who observes a fast on Sivaratri for twelve years and who keeps 
awake ( in dance and music ) before me the whole night would 
reach heaven. That man, who worships &iva and performs 
lagara on the 14th, would not thereafter taste milk at mother's 
breast (i. e. would not be born again) ; the nisada, unknowingly 
worshipping a self-existent linga, observing a fast and jagara, 
became free from sin and attained the position of the attendant 
of Siva'.

&28 History of Dliarmaiastra [Sec. I, Ch. XI 

In the K&laniraaya 584 there is a lengthy discussion on the 
question whether the word' Sivaratri' is used in a oonTentional 
sense ( viz. a particular tithi ) or in an etymological sense ( every 
night on which some observance relating to Siva is performed), 
or a metaphorical sense ( viz a vrata, though the word expresses 
a tithi} or a yoga) uqVia sense i. e. etymologioal mm conventional 
like the word panlcaja ( a lotus ) The conclusion established is 
that the word Sivaratri is yogarudha like the word pankaja 
(lotus), which doss spring from mud (so far the sense is 
etymological ) hut which is confined to only one thing viz lotus 
(so far there is rudhi or convention) and does not apply to a frog. 

SivarStrivrata is both mil/a (obligatory) and Wntga 
(optional). It is nitya because there are passages which lay 
down that sin follows if a man does not perform it 585 ; 'the being 
that does not worship with devotion Budra who is the lord of 
three worlds wanders through thousands of future lives ' Besides, 
there are verses which lay down that the vrata should be per- 
formed every 5 " year: 'O great goddess! a man and a chaste 
woman should every year worship Mahadeva with devotion on 
SivarStri*, This vrata is optional because the textB provide the 
rewards of performing this vrata For example, vide p 85 above 
and p. 86 above for the maxim of sawuoga-prthaktva. 

This vrata according to the IsSnasamhitssw can be per- 
formed by all human beings 'The SivarStrivrata destroys all

sins and confers enjoyment of happiness and moksa (final 
liberation ) on all human beings including oSndalas'. 

The Isanasamhita provides: a devotee ofVisnu or Siva or 
of another god, if he gives up Sivaratri, destroys all the fruits 
of his warship ( of the deity to whom he is devoted). Everyone 588 
who performs this vrata has to observe certain restrictions, viz. 
non-injury, truthfulness, freedom from anger, celibacy, compas- 
sion, forbearance and he has to ba calm in mind, devoid of fits 
of paBsion and has to perform austerities and he should be free 
from malice ; knowledge of this vrata should be imparted to such 
a one provided he follows his preceptor; if one imparts it other- 
wise, one goes to hell 

The proper time for this vrata is night, since, as stated in 
the Skanda 889 ' goblins, the Saktis and &iva ( who wields the 
trident) move about at night and therefore these are to he 
worshipped at that time on caturdasl.' The Skanda *" provides 
'A fast Bhould he observed on that caturdasl of the dark half 
that is joined to nisltha (i. e. that exists at that time); that 
tithi is the heat and leads to companionship with Siva'. 
Hemadri quotes Nagarakhanda 591 as follows : on the Uth of the 
dark half of Magha I shall go in the Ealiyuga on the surface of 
the earth at night and not by day. I shall undoubtedly transfer 
myself to all lingas, whether movable or permanently fixed, for 
the removal of the sins committed in the (preceding) year; 
therefore the man who offers worship to me at night with these 
mantras will be free from Bin'. In the Isanasamhita it is said 
'The first God (Siva) appeared in the form of Sivalinga, whose 
refulgence was equal to that of a orore of suns, on the 14th of 
Msgha dark half. The tithi to be accepted for the SivarStri

vrata should be one that covers that time. A man should 
perform this -wata on that tithi when the 14th covers the time 
before and after midnight.' sai Hemsdn also quotes a verse like 
this 'The 14th tithi called &ivaratri that covers pradosa should 
he accepted (for vrata); one should observe a last on that tithi 
since there has to be a jagara (in that vrata) at night.' " 

Owing to the above somewhat conflicting dicta there is a 
great deal of discussion on the proper day and time for the vrata 
in Hemadri on Kala (pp. 298-308), Kalanirnaya (Rp.297ff), 
Tithitattva (pp 125-126), Nirnayasindhu (pp. 222-824), 
PorosStthacint&mani (pp 248-253) and other works Some 
works like the NirnaySmrta 57 * put emphasis on the word pradosa 
(in note 593) above, while others emphasize the word mfitha 
and ardharatra. The conclusions drawn by MSdhava (the 
prince of nirnayakaras) are stated here H caturdasl covers 
both pradosa and nisltha, then the vrata should be observed on 
that day. If caturdasl spreads over two days (io, it is mixed 
with 13th and also with amSvSsyS) and 14th exists at the time 
of nisltha on both days, or if it does not so exist on any of 8» 
-two days, then covering pradosa is the determining factor! 
where 14th covers pradosa on two days or does not cover praaosft 
on any of the two days, then existing at nisltha is the determifl- 
{ng factor; if caturdasl having extended over two days covets 
t»ly one oat of the two (pradosa and nisltha ) on each day then 
conjunction with Jaya ( i. e. 13th tithi) is the decisive factor*

austerities and homa. O Sambhu! on 14th I shall take no food 
and shall take food on the nest day. Oh Lord! he thou my 
refuge for securing enjoyment of happiness and moksa ' The 
person observing the vrata should approach a teacher and should 
bathe (the linga) with pancagaeya and with pancsmrta. He 
should repeat the mantra 'Om namah SivSya' He should 
worship Sfrra with the upacaras beginning with sandalwood 
paste and he should offer into fire sesame, grains of rice and 
boiled rice mixed with ghee. After this homa he should offer 
purnfflmh (an offering made with a full ladle) and listen to 
music and good stories (about Siva). He should again offer 
offerings at midnight, in the 3rd quarter of the night and in the 
4th quarter. Having inaudibly repeated the nralamantrafom 
namah Sivaya) he should pray to Siva about daybreak to forgive 
bis Bins with the words '0 Godl I have worshipped in this vrata 
without obstacles through your favour; O Lord of the worlds 1 
O Siva I pardon me. Whatever merit I have won this day and 
'whatever has been offered by me to Siva I have finished thiB 
vrata to-day through your favour; O bountiful one I ba pleased 
with me, and go to your abode; there is no doubt that I have 
become pure by merely seeing you.' He should feed persons who 
are devoted to contemplating (on Siva) and should give to them 
garments, umbrellas and the like; 'O Lord of Gods', lord of all 
things} that bestoweth favour on people; may my lord be 
gratifiedby what I have given with faith.* Having thus prayed 
for forgiveness, the person undertaking this vrata may carry it 
on for twelve yeara. After obtaining fame, wealth, sons and 
kingdom he may repair to the city of Siva; he should perform 
fcgara (on 14th) in all the 12 months of the year; the man 
undertaking the vrata after feeding twelve brabmanas and 
donating lamps may secure heaven. 

The Tithitattva (p. 127) adds some details which are 
interesting The linga is to be bathed with milk in the 
first _ watch of the night, with curds in the 2nd, with ghee in 
tne 3rd and with honey in the 4th. The mantras in the four 
watches are respectively 'hrim, Isangya namah,' 'hflm Agho- 
rsya namah,' «hrlm VsmadevSya namah* and «hrlm Sadyojataya 
aamah.' The mantra at the time of offering arghya is also

one meal in the noon, on the 14th after finfrbirg his usual 
morning duties and rites, he should make a sankalpa in the 
morning with a mantra 'I Bhall perform this Sivaratrivrata that 
yields great rewards; O Lord of the world! may it be wiHiout 
obstacles through your favour. On the 14th I shall be without 
food and shall take my meal on the nest day for enjoyment of

he should take a bath with black sesame, should apply the

rosary of rudraksa ( berry of Elaeooarpus Ganitrns ), should go 
to a temple of Siva at the beginning of night, should wash his 
feet, should take acamana ( should sip water ) and should make 
a sankalpa 'I shall perform the pfija of the first watoh on 
Sivaratri ' ; if he intends to perform separate pujas on all the four 
watches or if he wants to perform a pujs only once he should say 
'I shall perform the worship of Siva on Sivaratri for securing 
the favour of Siva ' Then he should repeat the sage (Vamadeva)

of the Siva mantra of five letters ( &vaya namah ), the metre 
( Anustup ), the Devats ( Sadasiva ) and it is to be employed for 
nyasa, puja and japa. Then he should bow to the sage, metre

body from the heart with appropriate mystic letters and mantras 
( such as ' om namas-tafr-purusaya namah hrdaye ' to the last ' am

contemplate on Siva as portrayed* 00 in the verse quoted below. 
He should then establish a linga by performing the praga~

mantras and pray Siva to be present in the linga till the end of 
the puja. Then he should offer an afljalt of flowers. If the 
linga is already permanently fixed or if the linga, though not 
fixed, has already been established with the necessary samaksras,

CHAPTER XII 
Holika and Grahana (eclipse) 

ffoZtfta. Holi or Holika is a festival of unmixed gaiety 
tad frolics throughout India, though all parts do not observe it 
in the same way. One element, viz bonfire, is present almost 
everywhere except in Bengal Swinging of Krsna image on 
Phalguna Full Moon is done in Bengal, but it is not observed 
in several other parts of India The number of days during 
which this festival is observed also varies from province to 
province. Another item which is common to many parts of 
India is the sprinkling of friends with coloured water from 
bamboo or metal Byringes or with red powder and this merriment 
is indulged in even now by persons c in high plaoes. In the 
Konkan men dressed as women accompanied by several persons 
go about with songs ( often obscene ) and music and dance. The 
only religious element is the worship of Krsna in Bengal and 
in some provinces where bonfires are made a priest is engaged 
to perform rraja before the bonfire, people go round the fire 
throwing cocoanuts in the burning wood and grass, taking 
them out half-burnt and distributing the singed kernel among 
the people present as prasada. In some parts people produce 
sounds by beating their mouths with the backs of their hands. 
It is not possible nor necessary to set out in this notice all the 
varying details of this festival throughout the whole of India. 

This festival is very ancient. Originally the form of the 
word was HolakS and from references in the bhasya of Sahara 
on the Frnvamlmamsa-autra (1. 3. 15-23 )°° it appears that it 
was in ancient times a usage very prevalent in the eastern 
parts of Bharata. But Jaimini and Sahara appear to hold that

called DhondhS troubled boys by day and night. The king 
consulted his pwohita who told him that she was a raksasl, 
daughter of Malin, who got from Siva a boon that she would not 
be liable to be killed by gods or men nor suffer from arms nor 
from cold, heat or rain. The priest farther told the king that 
Siva said that she would be in danger from boys going about 
oraaily The priest added that on Phalguna 15th season of 
cold vanishes and summer starts, that people may laugh and 
enjoy themselves, that boys with bits of wood in their hands may 
go out of houses in great glee, collect a heap of wood and grass, 
set it on fire with Baksoghna mantras, clap their hands, go 
round the fire thrice, laugh, sing and utter obscene words in 
the popular language and by that noise and loud peals of 
laughter on the part of boys and by the homa 615 the ogress would 
die. When the king got all this done, the raksasl expired and 
the day came to be called 'Adada' and Holika. Then it is 
further stated that on the next day which is the first tithi of 
the month of Caitra (on the purnimanta reckoning) people 
should salute the ashes of the bonfire with the mantra quoted 
. below,* 1 * then worship of Kama should be made on a square in 
the house yard in the midst of which square a seat should be 
.arranged and in front a jar covered with leaves containing 
aksatas and 'smeared with white sandalwood paste should be 
placed The image of Kama should have sandalwood paste 
applied to it by a beautiful woman and thereafter the priest 
should make the performer partake of mango blossoms mixed 
with sandalwood paste. Then donations should be made to 
learned brahmanas, bards &o according to one's ability with the 
words ' May the God of Love be pleased with me ' The purana 
' winds up with the verse ' When the season of frost ends on the 
' lath of the bright half and the time of spring approaches in the 
morning, that man who partakes of mango blossoms with sandal- 
Wood paste lives in happiness.' 

Instead of the gay and saturnalia-like practices prevalent 
in many parts of India about Holika, Bengal celebrates it by 
the Dolayatra. SttlapSni composed thereon a short work called

IfclayStrS-viveka™ The festival should be carried on for five 
or three days. Before the Full moon of Fhalguna, on the 14th 
at the beginning of night an utsava in honour of Agni is to be 
celebrated to the east of the mandapa Then an image of 
Govinda is to be made, it is established in a structure with 16 
pillars on a vedtffi (raised platform) and it is to be bathed with 
pancgmrta and various items of worship are to be offered and 
seven times the swing on which the image is placed has to be 
rooked to and fro. Fire kindled on the first day is to be preserved 
till the days of the festival end. At the end the swing is to be 
rooked 81 times It is narrated that king Indradyumna started 
this swing festival in Vrndavana. By means of this utsava a 
man becomes free from all sins Then SfilapSni discusses at 
some length the exact tithi, prahxara and naksatra on which the 
DolayStrS is to be performed. Briefly, the conclusion is that 
DolayatrS must be performed when the Full Moon tithi is runn- 
ing, whether there is TJttara-phalgunl-naksatra or not 618 

. The Kalatattvaviveoana very suooinotly puts down the 
characteristics of Holikotsava aa set forth in the Bhaviqyottara 41 ' 
The Hirnayasindhu (227), Smrti-kaustubha (516-519), Funis. 
artha-ointSmani (808-319) and other late medieval works dis- 
. course on this festival, but for reasons of space their discussions 
are not set out here. 

As HoUka is mentioned by Jaimini and the Ea&akagrhya, 
it follows that it prevailed at least some centuries before Christ. 
The Kamasutra and Bhavisyottara connect it with spring and it 
was performed at the end of the year (on piirnimSnta reckoning). 
Therefore, the bonfire represents the expiry of the season of 
froBt and cold and heralds the warmth and love-making of spring. 
The ribald songs, dance and music are further accretions due to 
the joy felt on the advent of spring. The sprinkling of coloured

water and powder is an additional item in the celebration of the 
delights of spring. In some provinces this sprinkling is done 
on the very day of the Holika, while in the Deccan it is indulged 
in on the 5th day (popularly called Kanga-paficaml) after Holika 
bonfire. Though the Holika festival is composite in several 
parts of India and is celebrated on more days than one, in origin 
it is no more than a spring festival. In some parts mud is tao 
thrown by people at each other on the day after bonfire. That is 
probably an extension of the idea of applying ashes of the bon- 
fire to one's forehead and the body on the day after it. The 
usage in some parts of oreating noise by striking the back of 
one's hand against one's mouth accompanied by an obscene 
reference to sex is a further perversion due to welcoming the 
advent of spring which is traditionally the season of love-mak- 
ing. Mr. Gupte in 'Hindu holidays and ceremonies' tries hard 
to show that the Hohka festival was ' imported from Egypt or 
Greece' (p. 92). This theory is very fantastic and does not 
deserve to be taken seriously. He had not read, it appears, 
the ancient works mentioned above and is not himself sure 
whether the origin is to be found in Egypt or in Greece. 

Grahana (eclipse, solar and lunar). Great importance was 
attached from very ancient times to eclipses. An extensive 
literature has accumulated on this subject. "Vide among others

Bgveda V 40.5,6,8 'OSnnl when Svarbhanu, the son of an 
asura, struck you with darkness. O Indral when you struck 
down the wiles of Svarbhanu that existed below the heaven,

(24 3) that the Atria performed the Saptadasa-stoma three days 
before Visuvat and thereby smote the demon Svarbhaim that 
had pierced the son with darkness i e the solar eclipse (in Rg. 
V. 40 5 f£) took place three days before the autumnal Visuvat 
(equinox) 

It appears from the Brhat-samhita that the real cause of 
eclipses was known to Indian astronomers several centuries 
before Varahamihira (1st half of 6th century A. D.) who 
remarks 6 ' 2 'In a lunar eclipse the moon enters into the shadow 
of the earth and in a solar eclipse the moon enters the Sun (i a 
comes between the sun and the earth), that this cause of eclipses 
was found by (former) SoSryas who had a divine insight, that 
Rahu is not the cause (of eclipses), this is the true state that the 
sastra (of astronomy) declares (or this is the real intent of 
sSstra)'. In spite of this correct theory of eclipses, common 
people and even learned men (not astronomers) then believed 
and do believe up to the present day that Bami is the cause of 
eclipses and regard an eclipse as a special occasion for bath, 
gifts, japa, sraddha and the like Varahamihira makes an effartf 83 
to square Sruti, Smrti, popular belief and real astronomical 
doctrine by the remark that there was an Asura on whom a 
boon was conferred by Brahma 'You will be gratified by a por- 
tion of the gifts and offerings made on an eclipse', thatAsura 
remains present to receive his portion and that therefore it » 
metaphorically (poetioally) said that he is Rahu Batanaj"* 
and popular traditions and superstition cannot go together. 
Some difference was made between an eclipse of the Sun and

that of the moon. Vyaea says : at ' an eclipse of the moon is one 
hundred thousand times (mote meritorious than an ordinary 
day) and an eclipse of the Sun ten times more so than the 
preceding and if the waters of the Ganges are near (for a hath) 
then a moon eclipse is one crore of times (more meritorious ) and 
a sun's eclipse is ten times more so than the preceding \ 

The first duty of a person on seeing an eclipse is to hathe. 
It is said 'on 6 * 5 seeing Rahu (i e. eclipse) men of sJlvarvas 
become impure They should first bathe and then do their usual 
dufcieB and Bhould give up food already cooked (before the 
eclipse)'. Peculiar sanctity was deemed to attach to the time 
of grahana. If a man 626 does not take a bath at the time of 
eclipse, at the passage (of the sun) from one ? ait to another, 
there is no doubt that he would suffer from leproBy for seven 
future lives and sorrow would be his lot ' He should take a bath 
in cold water and in as holy a place as possible. The holiest 
bath is the one in the Granges or God&vafl or at Prayaga, then 
in any one 627 of the big rivers such as the six rivers connected 
with Himavat mountain and the she south of the Yindhya 
mentioned in the Brahmapurana, then in any other water, since 
at the time of eclipse all water becomes holy like Ganges water.

eclipse began, to perform homa, worship of gods and srSddha 
while the eclipse was in progress, to make gifts when the eclipse 
was about to end, and to take a bath again when the son or 
moon became free from eclipse. Even a person who is impure 
owing to a birth or death has to take a hath on an eclipse but 
he is not tomake a gift or to perform srSddha (according to Gauda 
writers), but fheMadanaratna and theWirnayasindhnremtettis 
view and hold that in an eclipse even one who is in Ssauca can 
take a bath, perform srSddha and pwascarana m In the pniSnas 
and medieval digests some distinction as regards merit or holiness 
was made between eclipses in certain months and baths in certain 
rivers or holy places The Kalaniraaya (p 350) especially 
commends the Godavarl for a bath in a lunar eclipse and one in 
the Karmada for a solar eclipse. The Srtyakalpatarn (Naiyata- 
kala),HemadrionKala and the ESlaviveka quote ra a long 
passage from the Devfpurana, some verses of which may be 
rendered here' 'an eclipse in Kariika is the highest (in merit) 
at the confluence of the Gangs and Yamuna, in Margaslrea on 
Devika, in Pausa 2f armada is holy, in Magha Sanruhita is hoV 
Sas. On the occasion of the partial eclipse of the sun on 80ft 
June 1955 about four hundred thousand people took a hath at 
Ehruksetra and Sauyahet (SannfhitS of ancient times) 

The general rule is that one should not take a bath, make a 
gift or perform a srSddha at night Apastamba 631 says 'let him 
avoid a bath at night'. Manu says 'one should not perform a 
srSddha at night, she (night) is declared to be a raksasi 
( a demon } and also at both twilights and when the sun has just 
risen*. But eclipses were an exception as regards bath, gift and 
srSddha. Ysjnavalkya enumerates 632 eclipses among the proper 
times for srSddha

Great value of gifts &c in eclipse 245 

It is stated by Satatapa 633 that gifts, baths, tapas and 
sraddha at the time of eclipses yield inexhaustible ( rewards or 
merit); the night is a raksasl elsewhere (at times other than 
those of eclipses); therefore one should avoid it (in other 
matters ). A passage is quoted from the Mahabharata °* ' on 
ayana and Visuva days and on the occasion of the eclipses of 
the sun and the moon, one should make a gift of land together 
with daksina to a deserving brahmana'. YajSavalkya succin- 
ctly observes ' not by learning alone nor by tapas alone ( does 
one become a deserving person); that is declared a deserving 
person (palra) in whom these two (vidya and tapas) and 
aotions ( appropriate to these ) are found ' Numerous inscrip- 
tions published so far bear witness to the fact that over the 
whole of India ancient and medieval kings and well-to-do people 
carried out to the letter this recommendation of making gifts of 
land on eclipses. Some inscriptions are mentioned here by way of

As regards sraddha, it is often difficult to perform it at the 
time of an eolipse for two reasons Most eclipses are partial 
and the time is short Besides, there is a prohibition to eat food 
during an eclipse A prSjapatya expiation is prescribed for 
pai taking of food during an eolipse ^ It is therefore provia'ea 
in some smrtis and digests that the sraddha performed should 
be the amasraddha or hemasraddha 636 Though the person 
performing sraddha in an eolipse is deemed to reap great 
merit, the person partaking of sraddha dinner is liable 
to undergo an expiation and is generally looked down upon. 
The Mitaksara on Taj I 217-218 guotes the first quarter ofa 
verse 'one should not eat during a solar or lunar eclipse' 
Therefore a good brahmana cannot be easily secured and the 
performance of sraddha with details is well-nigh impossible, 
even though Satatapa and others state that it is °Wigatay- 
« on seeing Kahu (L e an eolipse) one should perform a sraddna 
even at the cost of all his wealth; one who does not perform 
sraddha then sinks like a cow in mud • The order of the several

Order of acts on an eclipse 247 

y&ma, tarpana, japa of Gayatrl, homa in fire with sesame 
■with the vyabrtis and the mantxas for the planets as in Ysj. 
L 300-301, then amasraddha, gifts of gold, food, cows and land. 

In these days moat people except very sophisticated ones 
still take a hath on eolipses and make some gifts also, but do 
not proceed further in the matter of eolipses. An eclipse is the 
best time for japa and for diksa (initiation) and perfection in the 
mantras peculiar to various deities : ' one 638 should engage in japa 
and the like while an eclipse of the sun or moon is in progress ; 
one should not bathe nor eat food during that time, but when 
die sun and the moon are free from eclipse one should bathe and 
partake of food one may engage in the japa of the Gayatrl 
mantra (Rg. HI. 62 10) and it is laid down that if one does not 
engage in japa on an eclipse one becomes sinful For diksa as 
to mantras seven days from eclipse are allowed Solar eclipse 
is the best time for dlksa. 

The Puuyakala (the holy period) in the case of eolipses 
lasts only as long as the eclipse is visible to the eye. J&bali 
says 69 'In the case of Bankrantithe punyaksla is 16 kalSs on 
both sides thereof, but in the case of a lunar or solar eclipse it 
lasts only so long as the eclipse is visible'. This leads on to a 
question that is very much discussed in the several medieval 
works and on which there is great divergence of views. Much 
emphasis is laid on the words 'yavad-darsana-go-oarah' and 
'rahudarsane' occurring in several verses (quoted in the notes, 
633, 639 &a ) The Ertyakalpataru ( Naiyatakala ) argues 
that in those passages 'darsana' (being visible) is declared 
to be ttie cause or occasion of the several acts (snana, dana 
&o.) to be performed in an eclipse, that an eclipse is an 
occasion only when it is known that it has occurred, and 
that knowledge must be derived from the eye and that

Bhould perform religious acta on snoh an eolipBe, but not on 
mere calculation.' 

If a solar eclipse occurs on a Sunday and a lunar one on 
Monday, such a conjunction was called Cudamani and it was 
laid down that a Cudamani eclipse yields one orore of times as 
much merit as an eclipse on other week day? 614 

Some held that on the day previous to an eclipse one should 
observe a fast; but Hemadri provided that a fast was to be 
observed on the day of the eclipse MS A householder however 
who had a son living was not to observe a fast as laid down in 
atext." 6 

About partaking of food before, during and after an eclipse 
elaborate rules were laid down from comparatively early times. 
The Visnudharmasutra 6 * 7 provides- 'one must not eat during 
aneolipse of the moon or sun; he should eat, after having 
previously taken a bath, when the eolipse is at an end; if the 
sun or moon have set before the eolipse was over he must bathe 
and on the next day he may eat again after having seen the 
sun rise'. This is elaborated in two verses quoted in several 
works: 'One should not take food before a solar eclipse and 
also in the evening of the day of a lunar eclipse ; and one should 
not eat when the eolipse is in progress; but when the sun or 
moon is free from eclipse one may, after a bath, partake of food ; 
when the moon is free from eolipse one may take food (even at 
night thereafter ) provided it is not mdHaraia, when the sun or 
moon sets before being free from eclipse, one should see them 
rising the next day, bathe and then partake of food'.

It was farther prescribed that not only was one not to eat 
during an eclipse, but in the ease of a lunar eclipse one was not 
to eat for three ptdharaa ( 9 hours or 221 ghatikSs ) before the 
eclipse started and for four prahaiaa before a solar eclipse starts, 
but this does not apply to children, old men and women 6B This 
period of three or four praharas before an eclipse was called and 
even now is called 'vedha'. The Xrtyatattva (p. 434) collects 
together in one place all the above propositions about taking 
food Although these rules are not generally observed in these 
days by people in cities and by educated people, in the author's 
boyhood they were strictly observed by almost all adults 
eduoated or illiterate. 

Certain astrological results were deemed to follow from 
eclipses One or two are oited here for illustration. 
The Visnudharmottara" 9 states that if in one and the same 
month there is first an eclipse of the moon and then of the sun, 
that occurrence would tend to oreate disputes between biahmanaj 
and ksatriyas, but if the opposite was the case, then there would 
be prosperity. The same purana says that parsons born on the 
naksatra on whioh there is an eclipse of the sun or moon suffer 
troubles unless they perform santi rites (to avert the evil resulte). 
Hemfidri (on Ksla pp 392-93) quotes several verses from Garga 
about the prognostications derived from eclipses of the sun and 
moon when they are in oertain naksatras. Atri provides. 
•When the moon and the sun are eclipsed in the naksatra of a 
man's birth, that forebodes disease, long journeys, death ana 
great danger from the king (of the country)'.

List o£ vratas and utsaVAs 

The following list of vratas and utsavas does not claim to 
be thoroughly exhaustive But it is far more exhaustive and 
informative than any similar list so f ar prepared in English by 
any one or contained in any work in English. The line of 
demarcation between vratas and utsavas is very thin. Many 
vratas contain an element of festivities and many utsavas have 
more or less a religious element also and were religious in the 
beginning though later on they became secular, like the Olympic 
games of Greece. It may be pointed out that in the Asiatic 
Researches, vol m, Sir William Jones published a list of Hindu 
festival days based on the Tithitattva (pp 257-293) and Prof. 
Kielhorn also inserted a list of festival days based mainly on 
the Dharmasindhu in L A vol 26 pp 177-187. Both these are 
meagre The Indian Ephemeris ( vol I part 1 pp. 55-69 ) has a 
long descriptive list and a brief but accurate account of Indian 
festivals in relation to tithis and vice versa. Yet it is not as 
exhaustive as this list will be and it refers hardly to any autho- 
ritative texts. Very recently in the Beport (1953) of the Calendar 
Reform Committee presided over by the late Bt M. N Saha there 
is a list of lunar festivals ( from Caitra onward ) and solar festi- 
vals and of some important tithis (pp 101—108) and an 
alphabeticed list of festivals ( pp 111-115 ), which is exhaustive 
but its great defect iB that no texts are cited or referred to and 
hardly any details are given except month, paksa and tithi 
There are a few works on vratas written in Bengali and other 
regional languages of India, but I could not include most of 
them in this volume as I do not know most of those languages, 
though I have referred to some of them. Apart from vratas 
and utsavas certain matters and technical terms that occur 
frequently in works on vratas have been included. The list is 
arranged in the Sanskrit alphabetical order, though everything 
is transliterated into the English alphabet for the convenience of 
printing Eor saving space abbreviations have been very 
largely employed and a list of the most important abbreviations 
is given in the preceding pages. As regards each vrata the time 
when it begins, whether it is a tithivrata or varavrata, 
samvatsara-vrata or a naksatravrata or a praklrnaka vrata is 
generally indicated ( except where from its very title or descrip- 
tion its nature is clear ), the deity to be worshipped is pointed

most of them are included in the rewards mentioned on p 55V 
above, and as they are often too numerous to specify and alio 
for reasons of space. Similarly, tithis that are Tugadi/or 
YugantyaorManvSdior EalpSdi have not all been noted/as 
they are too many but they are enumerated in one place under 
the words Yugadi&o I have made great efforts to trace tie 
Pauramc quotations to their sources, but I regret that I have 
not been quite successful owing to several causes such as the 
vast extent of Puranas, owing to several recensions of the same 
purfina and owing to my inadvertence or sheer weariness One 
feels that tracing a verse to its origin is often as difficult as 
finding a pin in a haystaok. The author or authors of Poranas 
often wrote like modern advertisers of medicines, toilet articles 
&o Most of the vratas are said to have been declared by divi* 
nities like Siva to ParvatI, by Krsna to Tudhisthira, by great 
sages like MSrkandeya, Marada, Dhaumya, Ygjfiavalkya, 
Vasistha and it is often added that the Virata is a great secret 
not narrated or known even to gods and goddesses e g. Siva* 
rstrivrata ( in HV U 88). 

It may not be out of place to point out here what should be 
done about the numerous vratas and utsavas, described so fat 
and to be mentioned in the long list that follom Many of the 
vratas and utsavas once observed have already gone out of vogue 
owing to various causes. But it would not do to recommend 
the abolition of all vratas and utsavas even in the latter half of 
the 20th century. Some seasonal vratas and festivals should be 
kept up as in the case of DivSH and HolikS, but they should be 
Bhorn of extravagances like gambling on Balipratipads or the 
obscenities and dirt-throwing indulged in by some people in 
HolikS, Other vratas and utsavas like the BSmanavamI, VnayS- 
dasaml, Ersna-janmaBtamI should also be celebrated m order to 
remind the present generation of the great heroes and auUSras 
of the past and the supreme values they exemplified in then: 
lives and a few new ones such as the Jayantls of Shivaji, Guru- 
Govindsingh, Tagore, Tilak and Gandhi may be added Besides, 
such vratas as Vata-sSvitri and Haritalika may still be empha- 
sized for observance by women and lastly such nice observances 
redolent of disinterested regard and affection as Eafcssbandhana 
and BhratrdvitlyS deserve to be preserved. 



List of vratas 255 

It should be remembered that several vratas depend con- 
jointly upon month, tithi and naksatra together It is difficult 
to classify such vratas and my classification may in some cases 
appear to be arbitrary. For saving space the details mentioned 
above will not generally be conveyed in regular sentences, but 
in catch-words only The figures after the abbreviated name of 
a work represent pages and Roman figures refer to volumes or 
parts; and double Arabic figures with a dot between represent 
chapter and verses respectively. As most vratas are tithivratas, 
the word tithi is not mentioned where the vrata has reference to 
a tithi alone and to no other particular (such as month or 
week-day &c. ). The word vrata has been generally omitted after 
the names, except where I felt that doubt or confusion is likely 
to be caused The word* purana' is not added to the names of 
puranas such as Agni, Vamana &c Except in the case of puranas 
references to medieval digests and commentaries are generally 
arranged in chronological order The following abbreviations 
are used for months and half months: Oai. = Gaitra, Vai. 
= Vaisskha, Jy. = Jyestha, As. = Asadha, Sr. = Sravana, Bh.

that if ono out of the several requirements (Pausa at MSgha 
Amavasya, VyatipSta, Sravana-naksatra, Sunday) is absent, 
it becomes Mahodaya-parva In Ardhodaya a bath at 
Pray3ga in the morning is most meritorious, but it is pro- 
vided that all rivers become like the Ganges at Ardhodaya. 
The devatas of tho vrata are three viz Brahma, Visnu and 
Mahosvara and thoy are worshipped in the same order; 
offerings (of ghoo) are made in fire with Fauranika mantras, 
and also with three Vedic mantras viz 'Frajapate'(Bg. 
X. 121. 10) for Brahmffi, •IdamVisnur" (Bg. 1 22. 17) for 
Visnu, •Tryambafcam yajanahe' (Bg VIC 59. IS) for

wealth by Emperor Harsavardbana at Prayaga once in five 
years made by the Chinese traveller Yuan Gbwang (vide 7 
I A. 196 atp 198) is not to Ardhodaya at all, as some

jLhan— a day. There are several views about the divisions of 
the day, viz. into two, three, four, five, eight, or fifteen parts. 
The two are pfirvahna and aparahna ( as in Manu HI 278 ) ; 
for three vide notes 257-258 above Four parts described by 
Gobhila ( q by KBT p. 110 ) are purvahna ( for 1$ prahara ), 
madhyahna for one prahara, aparahna up to the end of the 
3rd prahara and thereafter sayShna till end of day. For 
names of five divisions vide H of Efh. vol IV p 376 In 
l$g V. 76. 3 (utSyatam sangave pratarahno) three of the five 
parts of a day viz pratah, sangava and nuzdhyandtna are 
expressly mentioned. Eight divisions of the day are men* 
tioned by Kautilya ( L 19), Daksa ( chap 2 ) and Katyayana. 
Kalidasa in Vikramorvasiya II 1 (sasthe bhage) appears to 
know this. There are fifteen muhurtas of the day and fifteen 
of the night Vide Brhadyogayatra VI 2-4 for 15 muhurtas. 
As the day and night beoome long or short at different 
places ( exaept on the equator ) eaoh of the muhurtas will 
vary in length to some extent even in the same place in 
different seasons of the year. Similarly, purvahna or 
pratahkala will be of 7$ muhurtas if day is divided only in 
two parts, if into five parts purvahna or prStah will comprise 
only three muhurtas. The KIT (p. 112) remarks that the 
division into five parts being observed in many Vedio and 
Smrti texts as the principal division, that division, is the one 
resorted to in the sastric passages about positive and 
negative injunctions. Vide HK 325-829, VKK 18-19, KTV 
6, 367.

Udasevtka— same as Bhutamatr-^otsava. This utsava followed 
immediately after the Indradhvaja was taken down ( i. e, it 
took place on Bh. su. 13 ). It somewhat resembled the wild 



£76 Jtistary of Dharma&astm TSso I, Gh. ytfr 

and mystic Roman Bacchanalia In HV 31359-865, KKS 
413-431 and KR 387-395 this festival is described at length 
from the Skanda The origin is traced to Bhairava and a 
girl called UdasevikS ( whose body was smeared with mud ) 
sprung from the mind of Siva and ParvatI respectively. 
They became husband and wife All people become on this 
day vociferous about sexual matters Men and women go 
out like crazy persons, ride asses, bulls and dogs, smear 
themselves with ashes and mud, even men 100 years old act 
like boys, become void of shame, utter obscene songs, dress 
liko cowherds, dombas, barbers and also went about naked. 
It iB remarkable that Skanda averred that god3 and pdrs did 
not accept the offerings of a man who did not take part 
in this festival and remained aloof. There was difference 
of views about the time when the utsava was to be celebrated. 
Vide HV II p. 368, and VP ( folios 91-33 ), which place it in 
Jy. fcr. 1 to 15 (by pflrnimanta reckoning)

subsisting on Smiksa and boiled milk for two months each, 
eight days on curds, three days on ghee and total fast for

vity, while Santika rites are homa and the like performed 
for averting threatened evil influence of planets and danger

sexual intercourse by day attack prana while those that have 
it by night are observing brahmacarya, that those who 
observe the Prajapati-vrata produce children (a son and a

MSghlsnana ) and it adds that in Magha waters exclaim 
when the Sun is just risen ' what great sinner, whether a 
drinker of sura or murderer of a brahmana, shall we purify '. 
This verse is q by VKK 490 from Bhav and by SmK 439

Mesa ( Bam ), the Moon and Jupiter in Simha ( Lion ) and 
the Sun is in Sravana-naksatra then it is Mahamaghl. 
Yide NS %%1 for other views. This verse emphasizes the 
importance of Maghasnana at Prayaga and other holy rivers 
and in holy tanks in early morning for the removal of sins. 
Vide H. of Dh vol IV p 617 for Maghasnana In Tamil 
country ' Makha ' is an annual temple festival and Maha- 
makha occurs once in twelve years, when a great mela is 
held at Kumbhakonam for a bath in a tank there called maha- 
magha tank, the mela being comparable to the Kumbhamela 
at PiaySga. This festival is popularly known as 
* Mamangam * and takes place when the Pull Moon is in 
Maghanaksatra and Jupiter is in Magha or in the sign of 
Lion. It fell on 23th February in 1955 according to south 
Indian Almanacs It is reported that about a million people 
took a bath this year in eight to ten hours from Z A. M. 
in the Mahimafcham tank at Kumbhakonam from which 
muddy water was pumped out and in which fresh water 
from the Kaverl river was made to flow. 

It is surprising that hardly any medieval digest refers 
either to the Mahamakham festival or the Kumbha- 
mete The great emperor Harsa used to hold once 
every five years a great mela at Prayaga on the great sandy 
Plain to the west of the sangam on the site where the 
Aumaaamela is held in modern tunes and distributed the 
accumulations in his treasury.

Veiyavratct— HV H. pp. 541-548 ( quoting Bhav. XT. ) deals with 
this vrata and contains the startling story narrated by 
Krsna to Tudhisthira that the former cursed his 16000 
wives, when he noticed their erotic emotion roused by the 
charms of his son Samba, that after his death dasyus would 
kidnap them and the story of a prior curse pronounced by 
sage Narada on Apsarases who proudly did not bow to him 
that they would have Narayana as their husband but that 
ultimately they would be kidnapped by robbers and become 
Vesyas { prostitutes ). The long and short of this story is 
that they were advised to follow the profession in palaces 
and temples, that they should not love any male who has 
no wealth, hut that they should have as their sole object 
wealth, whether the man who approached them was hand- 
some or ugly. It is further stated that they should make 
gifts of cows, fields, gold to brahmanas, should bathe with 
saimttsadhi water when on a Sunday there is Hasta, Pusya 
or Punarvasu naksatra and offer worship to Eamadeva 
from the feet to the head, that they should worship Cupid 
as Visnu, honour a hrshmana learned in the Veda with gift 
of a prastha of husked rice grains and render their person 
to him on Sunday as above for a year and in the 13th 
month make a gift of bedstead, gold chain and an image of 
Kamadeva, this is the vrata for all Vesyas , thiB is varavrata ;

Hara Prasad Shastri in oat. of mss in the Asiatic Society's 
Library, Calcutta, vol.V. preface p. LXV says that the 
worship of Satyan&rayaria (ma No. 3370) has aMaho- 
medan origin. It was originally ( and even now in many 
places) called 'Satyaplrer puja'. It occurs) in the Rev5- 
khanda of the Skandapurana ( VangavSsi ed ) but does 
not occur in the Venk. Press edition. Vide also JBORS 
vol XVI. at p. 328 where the same scholar says that the 
Mahomedan custom of offering 'Sirni' to Satyaplr was 
adopted by Bengal Hindus as worship of Satyansr&yana. 
This is a vrata very popular among lower middle-class 
people and women. Vide L A. vol 3 pp. 83-85 for 
stories current in Bengal about this vrata. It is said 
that Harada was told about this vrata by Visnu himself. 
On any day a man worships Satyanar&yana and offers 
naivedya of 1} quantity ( such as 1J ier or mound ) of 
plantains, ghee, milk and wheat flour (or rice flour), 
jaggery or sngar; all these to be mixed up for naivedya; 
performer should listen to the stories and partake of the 
prasada; jagara with songB, music, dance; then people go 
to their houses; this yields all desired objects; stories about 
a brahmana who performed this vrata every month, of a 
Vendor of wood, of a trader named Sadhu with a ship full 
of merchandise and costly things and his daughter XalavatI, 
In these stories Satyanarayana is represented as very 
Jealous and vindictive. The stories are said to have been 
taken from Skandapurana, Reva-khanda.

When the sixth is mixed up with 5th or 7th the general

the 7th is to be chosen except in the case of SkandasasthI

One or two special matters may he noted. Skanda is the 
lord of 6th tithi and is to he worshipped on every 6th tithi

SatwnZr<&anavrat a— very popular in Bengal and Mahfeastra : 
desoribed in Bhavisya (Pratisargaparva) chap. 24-29 ; M. M 
Hara Prasad Shastri in oat of mss in the Asiatic Society's 
Library, Calcutta, vol V. preface p. LXV says that the 
worship of Satyanarayana (ms. ffo. 3370) has aMaho- 
medan origin. It was originally ( and even now in many 
places) called 'Satyaplrer puj&*. It occurs in the Reva- 
fchanda of the Skandapur&na ( VangavasI ed ) but does 
not occur in the Venk. Press edition. Vide also JBOES 
vol XVI at p. 328 where the same scholar says that the 
Mahomedan custom of offering 'Sirni* to Satyaplr was 
adopted by Bengal Hindus as worship of Satyanarayana. 
This is a vrata very popular among lower middle-olass 
people and women Vide I. A. vol 3 pp. 83-85 for 
stories current in Bengal about this vrata. It is said 
that Narada was told about this vrata by Visnu himself. 
On any day a man worships Satyanarayana and offers 
naivedya of 1£ quantity (such as 1J ter or mound) of 
plantains, ghee, milk and wheat flour (or rice flour), 
jaggery or sugar; all these to be mixed up for naivedya; 
performer should listen to the stories and partake of the 
prasada; jSgara with songs, music, dance; then people go 
to their houses; this yields all desired objects; stories about 
a brahmana who performed this vrata every month, of a 
vendor of wood, of a trader named Sadhu with a ship full 
of merchandise and costly things and his daughter Ealavatl. 
In these stories SatyanSrayana is represented as very 
jealous and vindictive The storieB are said to have been 
taken from Skandapurana, Beva-khanda.

exile in a forest because of not feeding brahmanas, that king 
Sveta suffered pangs of hunger even when in heaven and 
was told by Brahma that his plight was due to his not 
havingfed hungry persons. The word literally means 'vrata 
(ie. giving food) always*. In modern times it is often 
pronounced and written as ' Sadavarta ' or ' Sadsbarta' or

happiness, long life and saubhaffua. The printed HV labels

DHARMA&STRA and CALENDAR 

CHAPTER XIV 

Conception of Kala 

Among the first of the great problems of philosophy is that 
of the nature of Space ( dik ) and Time ( ma). 

The questions that arise are : Are Space and Time ultimately 
real ? Is the world we apprehend spaceless and timeless or has 
the universe a beginning in time; are Space and Time them- 
selves things or real, attributes or relations of things. Great 
divergence of views has prevailed on these problems from 
ancient times to this day. It is therefore advisable to indicate 
briefly the speculations on Time contained principally in 
Sanskrit works. 

The word K&la occurs only once in the $gveaa tsl 'as a 
gambler collects the fcrfa( highest stake) at the (proper) time' 
(Rg. X 42. 9, 'Krtam yac svaghnl vicinoti kale"). The 
Atharvaveda contains two hymns (23X53 1-10 and XIX. 54. 
1-5 ) embodying a most sublime conception of Kala, A few 
striking verses * a are translated here . ' Kala ( Time ) carries ( as ) 
a horse with seven reins, thousand-eyed, ageless, endowed with

Horn these passages it appears that the word Kate was 
used even in very early Vedic times in two senses, viz time in 
general (as in modern Sanskrit and modern Indian languages) 
and Time as identical with the Supreme Being or the source of 
creation. This latter sense, it will be Bhown a little later on, is 
also emphasized in many Sanskrit works (inolnding the 
Puranas ). 

In the Satapatha-brahmana the word Kala is often used in 
the sense of' time' or 'proper time' 653 e g. 'he (Eudra angry 
because he was excluded from a share in offerings) flew up 
towards the north at the time when smstakrl offering was to be 
made ' ( 1 7. 3. 3 ) ; Prajapati ( when cattle approached him ) said 
' whenever you may get anything at the (proper) time or at an 
improper time you may eat it' ( II 4 % 4 ) 

A few passages from some of the TTpanisads regarded as 
anoient by most scholars may be cited here; the Chan. Up. n,«* 
31. 1 ( while speaking of "Vamadevya Seman and its parts ) uses 
fee word Kala as equal to ' end* or 'finish' The Br » Up 1 8.4

Bays " He desired ' would that a second self of me were produced ' 
,.. He bore him for a time as long as a year; after that long time 
he brought him forth". In the dialogue between GSrgya and 
king Aj&tasatra in the same Upanisad GSrgya put forward several 
objects which he reverenced (upasana) as braJima when the king 
replied as to those oases in these words ' Prdma ( breath ) does not 
leave him before the time' arid 'death does not come to him 
before time*. Here the word 'Kala' is used in the Benseof 
' proper or appointed time '. In the passage of the Eausltaki Br. 
that corresponds to Br Up H. 1 10 and 18 the words are 'neither 
he himself nor his progeny pass into unconsciousness before the 
time' and ' neither he nor his progeny dies before the time*. In 
some passages of the Svefc&svatara Up. some thinkers are stated 
to have put forward Kala as the cause or source of creation e g. 
'what is the cause ?** Is it Brahma? Whence are we born? 
Whereby do we live? On what are we established (or where 
are we going?) .. Time or inherent nature or necessity or 
chance or elements or yoni (prakrti) or the person, it is to be 
considered ( whether one of these is cause)'; 'Some sages dis- 
course upon inherent nature { as the cause ) while other deluded 
persons speak of Time ( as the cause ).' Here Kala is represented 
as the cause of creation, which is the 2nd meaning of the word 
Kala set out from the Atharvaveda. In another passage 657 of 
the same Up. Kala is said to have been generated by Him who is 
intelligent and omniscient The first meaning of Kala ( time in 
general) is also found in Svetasvatara Up. 'He (God) is the 
beginning, the efficient cause of (all) combinations, He is 
beyond the three times and is also without parts'. The Mandu- 
kyopanisad avers that Omkara is beyond the threefold time viz. 
past, present and future. 

The Maitrl Upanisad 48 has a long but somewhat rambling 
disquisition on time ( VI 14-16 ). It first says " Thenit has been

said elsewhere 'Food is indeed the source of this whole world, 
and timo of food ; the Sun is the source of time ' Then a little 
later on it proceeds "Thus one has said ' JBrom Time flow beings, 
from Time thoy roach growth, and in Time they come to dis- 
appear,- Time is a form. ( i. o has definite shape or limits ) and 
is (also) formless 1 ' Then it propounds 'There are indeed two 
forms of Irahma, Time and Timeless. That which is prior to 
the Sun is Timeless (form of Brahma) and it is without parts. 
But that which begins with the Sun is Time that has parts, year 
is the form of the Time that has parts AH these beings are 
produced from the year, through the year these beings when 
born grow, and they disappear in the year Therefore the year 
is Prajapati, is time, is food, is Brahma nest ( or abode ) and is 
Atman And it has been said 'Time cooks (ripens or digests) 
all beings in the Great Self, that man knows the ( real import 
of) Veda who knows that in which Time is cooked". Here the 
Maitel Up speaks of Time in its two senses, contains the germ 
of the later conception of the experience of Time as due to the 
actions or movements of the Sun, and refers to Time in the same 
terms in which the Tai. Up (EI 1) speaks oforaAnm It is 
unnecessary to set out passages from other Upanisads such as 
the MahanSrayana (XI U aham-eva kalo naham kSlasya) 
where Kala is identified with God (Naiayana)«» 

The MababhSrata recurs to the theme of Kala time and 
again In the Hdiparva it is said 'Kala creates bemgs and 
KSla destroys people, M extinguishes Kfila that is engaged . m 
destroying people; Kala brines about good or evil **-J«

liberated ). for Kala Is invincible'. The Strlparva has the 
following ' Kala cooks all beings and Kala destroys 'people; Kala 
is invincible'. The Ssntiparva 660 in chapters %Zi and 227 
contains a long disquisition on the formidable influence of Esla 
on all including gods like Indra In the Ssntiparva it is 
asserted 'beyond the mind is the Great Intelligence and beyond 
the latter, is the Great Time; beyond Time is the adorable 
Visnu to whom belongs the whole world'. In another place the 
Ssntiparva, after detailing nineteen gums the last being doandm- 
yoga (pairs of opposites such as pleasure and pain ), remarks that 
the 20th gwna beyond the nineteenth is Kala and that one 
should know these twenty to be the source and end of all beings. 
The .Ssvamedhika-parva describes (chap. 45 ) the wheel of Time 
in an elaborate metaphorical way (verses 1-9) and remarks that 
the man who well knows the action of Kala and its sublafcion 
is never deluded and reaohes the highest goal InVanaparva 
Krsna is identified with Brahma, Budra, the Sun, the Moon, 
Dharma, Tama, Kala &c. Vide for further references Santinarva 
25. 5 ff, 224-225. 

^ In the BhagavadgltS the word kala is used in the sense of 
•time in general or proper time" in several passages (such as 
IV. 2, VIE 7 and 27, VHX 23, XVtt 20 ) and Kala is identified 
with Krsna as Supreme Lord in one of his super-eminent 
manifestations in X 30 and 33 (I am Kala among those that 
seize and I am Kala that is imperishable) and XL 32 (lam 
Kala, that has increased (in strength) and that brings about 
the destruction of the worlds) 

Panini employs the word kala in his sufeas many times, 
Wit in the sense of time in general or the divisions of time or 
proper time Patafijali on Binini HL 3. 167 ( Ealasamayavelasu 
tanran) quotes a half verse about Kala, which is the same as 
the one quoted above from the MahabhSrata (in note 659) and 
which appears to have been cited by Patanjali as a well-known

the Sun When that (motion of the Sun ) is repeated again and 
again there is a month and a year' This means that Ksla 
does not exist except as a convenient name or word for the 
manner of measuring change or becoming in what we observe 
by oomparing one series of changes with another 

In the Manusmrti the Supreme 6 " Lord is said to have 
created time and its divisions (J 24 Kslam kalavibhafctlsea) 
and to have, after He produced the universe, disappeared in 
himself again and again, squeezing one period of time by means 
of another period (I 51 ). 

Coming to the philosophical systems, it may be noted that 
the Sankbya system does not include Ksla as a separate taltm 
in its twenty-five tattvas But Ola was not altogether 
forgotten in that system. The S&nkhyak&rika *" states that the 
haranus are thirteen, three being abhyantara (internal i. e. 
inside the body) and ten bemglfihya, the latter are concerned 
with the present, while the former are concerned with the three 
times (past, present and future) 

The Vaisesika-sStra treats "* Ksla as included in the nine 
dravyas (substanoes, L 5) and states that the indications of the

existence of Kala are the apprehensions of a thing as posterior 
or prior, the apprehension of simultaneity of certain things, the 
apprehension of a thing aB lasting long or as being momentary, 
that it is mtya, one and the (efficient) cause of all things that 
are created. Prasastapada gives the instance of an old man 
and a young man being seen by a person in one place and 
direction or in different directions, who apprehends after looking 
at a young man that another man called old differs from a 
young man as regards a grown-up moustache or beard, wrinkles on 
the body and baldness and so apprehends that the old man is 
remote from the young man and therefore apprehends him as 
beyond (pa; a) while he thinks of the young man as near, 
posterior and so apara. 

There were certain philosophers who held that Time is 
either past or future and denied that there is present time 
(vartamSna). The NySyasutra refutes this view and holds that 
time is either past, present or future (IX 1.39-43) Sxom 
Patafijali's 6SS Mahabhasya it appears that even in his day 
there were philosophers that held that there was no time called 
present and that those people quoted certain verses in support. 

The Nyfiyamanjarl « of Jayantabhatta ( K. S. S. 1936 ) has 
a long discussion on Kala It first sets out the views of those 
who deny the very existence of Kala as a separate entity. These 
latter say that Kala is not perceptible like a jar &c and that

the ideas of quickness or slowness depend merely on the observed 
effects. The same theorists raise the further objection that if 
Kola is a dtaoya (substance) that is all-pervading and per- 
manent, as the Vaisasikas assert, then how is it that Kala is 
spoken of as past, present and future. To these objections some 
reply: Kala is direotly perceived, since it appears to the mind 
as distinguishing the various perceptions of effects, that the 
several experiences such as 'these matters happened simultan- 
eously, this happened after long, this happened quickly' cannot 
be perfectly explained if one denies the existence of Kala and 
holds that these experiences depend solely on the perceived 
objects or actions Others hold that KSla is really inferred and 
not directly perceived They argue merely because KSla is not 
directly perceived it does not follow that it does not exist; to 
infer that KSla exists is proper as it is proper to infer that the 
other side of the moon exists though we see only that face of 
the moon that is below the earth; therefore KSla exists as a 
separate entity to which is due the common experience of simul- 
taneity, quickness or slowness &c. The differing observations 
about persons being young or old cannot be well explained with- 
out admitting the existence of Kala, which like akaia is one, 
all-pervading and permanent To the objeotion how, if Kate is 
one, all pervading and mlya, it is spoken of as having three 
divisions, the reply is: m reahty there are no ^hm m Kate, 
but divisions are imagined m KSla on account of the agrifo

Ktila in Yogasiltiabhasya ill 

In the Yogasutoabhasya on ID. 51 there is a brief but very 
interesting and abstruse disquisition on Kala The satra runs 667 * 
' by constraint (samyama) upon moments (ksana) and their 
sequence ( or succession ) ( arises ) knowledge due to discrimina- 
tion*. The bhasya explains . just as an atom is substance or 
matter (diauya) reaching the limit of minuteness, so a ksana 
(moment) is time that reaches the highest limit of minuteness, or 
a ksana (moment) is time taken by an atom in leaving the posi- 
tion in space it occupies or the time taken in reaching the next 
point in space; h ama( sequence) is the non-cessation of the 
flow of moments; moments and their succession do not form a 
oolleotion ( or combination ) of actual ( or perceptible ) things. 
Muhurta(30th part of day and night), day and night and 
others are combinations made by the mind ( or by mental con- 
ceptions). This time, though devoid of being a real thing 
by itself, is indeed only a creation of mental conceptions and 
results from knowledge derived from words ( alone ) and appears 
as if it were an actual object to ordinary people whose doct- 
rines are divergent ( or confused ) But ksana (moment) falling 
among (i e. being mixed up with) real perceptible things 
appears ( to the human mind ) as dependent on or constituting 
sequence ( or succession ). Kiama{ sequence) is of the nature 
of uninterrupted succession. This sequence is called Kala by

I have confined myself to Sanskrit works and particularly 
to works of the Vedic school type ta Buddhist and Jaina 
thinkers had to say a good deal on KSla Far example, the 
PramanaWWsrtika-bhSsya or TSrlakslankSra of Prajfiskara- 
gupta (about 700 A D.) combats the view of the Vaisesikasutra 
and PrasastapSda ( quoted above} and holds that there is no 
separate entity like Kala, that it is not possible to have the ideas 
of distant time and near time if Ka1a he without beginning and 
be endless, that the ideas of being distant or near or quick are not 
distinct from the activities about which they are predicated 
This Buddhist view practically amounts to saying that time is 
not a thing, but only an idea, only a subjective condition of 
human sensorial experiences and intuitions and is non-existent 
in itself, apart from the subject On the other hand Jaina* 70 
writers hold that there are six padaithas viz jlva, dharma, 
adharma, akssa, pudga'a and kala i. e Time has separate 
existence

Kala in the Put anas 473 

Some of the Furanas contain disquisitions on Kala. The 
nature of Time is described in the Kurmapurana as follows : 
This adorable 671 Ksla is without beginning and without end, it 
is ageless and immortal, it is a great Lord because it is all-em- 
bracing, it is independent and is the self of all, there may be 
many Brahmfis, Rudras and ISTarSyanas and other gods. It is 
declared that the divine Lord is one and is omniscient and is 
Ksla; they ( the gods ) are created by Kala, which again swa- 
llows (or makes them disappear), the gods Brahma, Nar&yana 
and Ida ( Siva ) are said to undergo prakrta disappearance by 
the power of Kala and also spring again therefrom as highest 
Brahma, the elements, Vasndeva and Sankara Therefore the 
whole world has its soul in Kala He alone is the highest Lord ' 
The Visnudharmottara 672 has a similar long disquisition on 
Ksla the gist of a few verses of which may be set out here ' Kala 
is without beginning and without end, it is Budra that seizes 
all ( or it is Sankarsana ); it is called Kala because it oarries off 
or drives all beings. Ksla is great and the highest Lord, because 
it is beginningless and endless; it is more subtile than the wink- 
ing of one's eye, very much more subtile than the subtilest. 
Its'subttfenesa cannot be understood even by Yogins When 
a thousand lotus leaves are pierced by a needle ignorant people 
think that the piercing of all leaves is at the same time, but 
really the leaves are pierced at separate units of time. This is 
the subfcileness of Kala. But though Kala is very very subtile, 
it is also great and measurement of it can be computed beoause 
of the motions of planets' The Vayu and Kurma both say 
'Time creates beings and again destroys them; all are under 
the rule of Time, while Time is not under the dominance of

any one ' The Visnupurana 673 holds that Brahma which is one, 
unborn, permanent, ageless appears in the form of Kala, which 
is without beginning or end The BhSgavatapurana 474 also regards 
Kala as inferred in regard to its minuteness and its grossness is 
all-pervading, and holds that it is supposed to have units from 
the subtlest ( atom ) to the highest 

Among astronomical works the Suryasiddhanta states' 35 
'Ksla is the destroyer of worlds ; another ( kind of time ) is of the 
natureof calculation; Kala is of two kinds, gross and subtile, 
which are also called murta (physically apprehensible ) and 
amurtal not so apprehended); (the divisions of) time calkd 
prana ( respiration ) and the like are murta, while truti and the 
like are amvrta ' The Caraka-^amhita 878 inoludes Kala among 
nine dravyas and holds that it is acetana (non-sentient) Thus 
it agrees with the Yaisesika view. In the Susrntasamhita it is 
declared * Kala is indeed self-existent, without beginning, middle 
or end; the poverty or richness of substanoes that have ( one or 
more of the six ) flavours (rasas ) and the life and death of human 
beings are dependent on Kala It is called Kala because it doeB 
not remain Bticking to even the smallest division or because it 
heaps together (beings by leading beings to death) or drives 
them together. Of that adorable Kala whidh assumes the 
character of year, the divine Sun produces by his special move- 
ments the divisions called twinkling of the eye, kaslha&o.

JTSfa m grammatical works 475 

Similarly, philosophical grammarians like Bhartrhari 677 ( author 
of theVskyapadtya) holds that Kala iB a substance (dravya), 
all-pervading and permanent apart from activities, that it is the 
efficient cause of all created things, that it is divided into years, 
seasons Sea. on account of the different activities, just aa the 
same man may be called a carpenter or a blacksmith &c. {on 
account of his different activities), Por reasons of space it is 
not advisable to pursue the subject of the nature of time from 
other Sanskrit works of medieval and modem times. For those 
who desire to make a further study of this subject I would 
recommend the ' Kalasiddhanta-darsinT composed and published 
by Shri H&ranchandra BhattgcSrya of Calcutta in 1941, which, 
exhaustively deals with the philosophical conceptions about 
Kala held by different sects, schools and Sanskrit writers. 

There is a great temptation to compare Indian ancient and 
medieval conceptions about Time arrived at more than a thousand 
years ago with similar or corresponding conceptions on the same 
subject in modern Western philosophical works such as Kant's 
* Critique of pure reason*, Prof S. Alexander's ' Space, Time and 
Deity ' {1927, London, two volumes ), ' Time and Western Man ' 
byWyndham Lewis {London, 1927), Pierre Burgelin's 'L' 
Homme etLe Temps' {1945), Bergson's 'Time and PreewilT, 
S. G. F. Brandon's 'Time and Mankind' (1953). But as this 
volume has already grown to large proportions, comparisons 
with Western philosophical views have to be given up. 

Exam, very ancient times minute divisions of time have 
been mentioned. The Taj. S, states 678 ' that all winkings of the 
eye (and similar units of time) were produced from the (supreme). 
Person that is brilliant (like lightning)'. This half verse occurs 
in the MahanSrayana Upanisad also. It is stated in the Br. Up.* 79 
that under the dominion of this imperishable brahma the Sun 
and the Moon are held apart, as ateo mmesas, muhurtas, days, 
and nights, half months, months, seasons, and years stand apart

The Mahanarayaua Upanisad' (1 8-9) mentions as unite of 
timo'lTimesas, KalS, muhurta, kasths, ahorStra, half months, 
months, rtus, year' Manu I 64 provides that IS nimesas ate 
equal to fcasthS, 30 kasthBs to fcals, 30 kalSs to muhQrta, 
30 muburfcas are equal to one day and night Early and very 
exhaustive enumeration of the several units of time from subtlest 
to file highest are contained in Brhat-samhita of YarSha and 
in the bhasya of Prasasfcapada on Vaisesikasatra^vfe 'Ksla 
is the cause of the popular usage about the units being 
Isant, lava, mmesas, lastha, kalB, muhurta, ySma(prahara or 
j}th of e. day), ahorStra (day and night), ardhamisa (half month), 
masa{ month ),rtu( season), ayana, samvatsara (year), yuga, 
manvantara, kalpa, pralaya and mahapralaya. The PurSnas also 
dilate upon the units of time from nimesa to pralaya or kalpa. 
Vide Brahma 331. 6-12, Kurma L 5 6-14, Padma V 3. 4-20, Yayu 
57 6-35. If imesa (lit winking of the eye) is defined by the Vaya 



letter and the latter adds that a smaller unit than it cannot be 
( physically ) apprehended. There is great divergence of -nm 
about the number and names of the minute units of time and 
their mutual relations. A few examples alone can be cited.

2 nadikas = muhurta, 30 muhurtas = day and night together 
It should be noticed that here the relation of nimesas to kastha 
is different from that in Manu and Kautilya The Arthasastra aB 
of 3£autilya does not stand alone in speaking of h uta ( ? i ) as the 
smallest unit of time. The SQryasinddhanta (quoted above) 
provides that truti is the smallest unit of time, that it is amurta 
(not apprehended physically), that the prana is the first nffirta 
( physically apprehended ) unit of time, that 6 pr&nas are equal 
to a vinadl, that 60 vinadls are equal to a nadika, 60 nadis axe 
equal to an ahoratra Utpala 68 ' on Br. S. quotes verses from 
Paulisa-siddhanta and Brahmasphuta-siddhanta to the effect that 
six pranas axe equal to a vinadika, 60 vinadikas are equal to a 
n&dika or ghatika and 60 ghatikas are equal to a day ( i e. 
ahoratra) A smrti quoted in the Tithitattva states that two 
trutis make a lava, 2 lavas make a nimesa, so that truti is equal 
to |th of nimesa. Hemadri on Kala (p. 7 ) quotes a verse that 
truti is equal to two nimesas and 10 trutis are equal to prana. 
The Amarakosa follows Manu as to eighteen nimesas being 
equal to kastha, but it introduces a unit called ksana between 
kala and muhurta, go that its scheme is : 18 nimesas = kastha 
30 kasrth&s = kala, 30 kalas = ksana, 12 ksanas = muhurta, 
30 muhurtas = ahoratra The Bhagavata-purSna ( m. 11. 3-10 ) 
puts forward a far more elaborate scheme: two atoms (of 
Time ) = ami, 3 anus = trasarenu, 3 trasarenus = truti, 100 
trutis = vedha, 3 vedhas = lava, 3 lavas = nimesa, 3 nimesas = 
ksana, 5 ksanas = kastha, 15 kastbfis = laghu, 15 laghus = 
nadika, 2 nsdikas = muhurta, 30 muhurtas = ahoratra. In the 
Alfcarvana-gyotisa the table is. 12 nimesas=lava, 301avas=kala. 
30 kalas = truti, 30 trutis • muhurta. This agrees with none! 
Itattm wuh of time from ahoratra to pralaoa will be dwelt upon 
a little later.

Branches of Jyotxqa 479 

in Br. 8. chap. H. A work embodying complete presentation 
of the three branohes was called samhita G8S and he who well 
knew the three branches, viz Ganita, Hoia and Sakha was 
called, as Garga Bays, * Samhit&paraga ' (master of samMta). 
VarSharaihira 68 ' himself tells us in the Brhaj-jstaka, that, for 
the benefit of astrologers, he compiled a comprehensive work on 
Jyotisa in its three branches The word Samhita appears to 
have been nsed in two senses, the firstf 98 (a wider sense) referring 
to a complete presentation of Ganita, Hoia. and Sakha, while the 
second ( a narrower sense ) refers only to the Sakha part Why 
the third branch was called Sakha is not satisfactorily explain- 
ed anywhere. It was so called probably because it had to deal 
with numerous circumstances, such as the fruits of the simple 
and retrograde movements of planets; the movements of 
Agastya(Canopus) andscyrfarsis ( Ursa Major ), the conjunc- 
tions and oppositions of planets, haloes, meteors, earthquakes, 
lore about the movements and cries of birds, nirvana, removal 
of the evil effects of utpStas. In this sense samhita was what is 
called natural astrology. Hora again had three sub-sections, viz. 
jataka or janma{ judicial astrology, predictions from the situa- 
tions of the sodiaoal signs and planets at a person's birHi), 
TatrS or "Satrika ( Brharjataka 28.4-5 ) that dealt with progno-

Western Scholars on Indian Astronomy 481 

period 02 of that tithi Vide Krtyaratnskara p. 299 and Smrti- 
kaustubha ( on tithi p. 12 ) f or other examples. 

About Astronomy and Astrology as developed in India 
Western scholars such as Weber, Whitney, Thibaut have pro- 
pounded many sweeping and unwarranted theories based on 
flimsy data. ' Here and there I may have to refer to them. But 
I must say in one place how and why their conclusions are 
often unacceptable In the first place, they do ~not attach 
due importance to the fact that a vast literature in Sanskrit 
has perished beyond recovery (as it is admitted was the 
casein Greece after Ptolemy composed his Almagest) 693 and 
what we now have is a mere fraction of what once existed. 
In the second place, they forget or ignore that much of the 
literature that survives is religious and not intended to be a 
historical and full treatment of any topic I. e. most of the 
references to astronomical matters found in the Yedas and 
Br3hmanas are not made of set purpose but are incidental or 
casual They hardly seem to be aware of the rule of oaution 
and common sense that in ancient literature what is expressly 
stated may be used for drawing inferences, but the non-mention 
of certain matters cannot necessarily be a valid reason for arriv- 
ing at the conclusion of non-existence, unless the subject matter 
was such that if something connected with it existed it should 
ordinarily have been mentioned. Further, and most important 
of all, mere similarities in institutions, usages and other matters 
should not be regarded as evidence of borrowing by one people 
from another people. Human mind is the same everywhere, its 
environment and the needs of human beings are often the same 
and no people, ancient or modern, can be regarded as having 
had the monopoly of great intellectual powers. Most of those 
who wrote on Indian literature and subjects in the 19th century 
were nurtured on the literature of the Greeks and Eomans and 
on the vaunted superiority of the ancient Greeks in Philosophy 
Mathematics, arts and other matters and of Egypt But as 
ancient cuneiform tablets in Babylonia and the Middle East 
countries came to be deciphered, things began to be seen in

a dozen are necessary as a preparation for modern mathematics

could not easily employ ordinary arithmetical methods owing to 
their dependence on the abacus. 685 It was further found that the 
sexagesimal system of degrees, minutes and seconds used by

of the greatest intellects in mechanics and astronomy, to per* 
petual imprisonment at the age of 70 for no greater offence than 
holding fast to the Copernican theory. Hardly any parallel to 
suoh an attempt to suppress honest difference of opinion as 
regards heavenly bodies can be found in any non-European 
country claiming to have a civilization 

There are controversies about the relation of astronomy and 
astrology. The marvellous spectacle of the sky at night con- 
taining thousands of stars of different brightness all apparently 
in motion'round the earth, the Sun's annual northward and south- 
ward passage in the sky, Full Moon and its disappearance for 
one day and its phases, eclipses of the Sun and the Moon, 
comets and falling stars— all these must have struck even the 
most primitive men with wonder and also with fear and fore- 
bodings. In course of time arose astronomy and astrology. In 
ancient times both words had the same meaning. The Cambridge 
Anoient History (1925, vol Ht pp. 238-239) holds that the 
whole science of astronomy is due to astrology. On the other 
hand Prof. Neugebauer and Mr Peter Doig see no evidence for 
this theory. 69 * In my humble opinion if we restrict ourselves 
to existing literatures of different peoples and eschew mere con- 
jectures and speculation, both astronomy and astrology are 
equally ancient and must have acted and reacted on one another 
in very ancient times In the f ollowing pages some evidence 
will be given from Vedic literature of the simultaneous cultiva- 
tion in India of both astronomy and astrology (particularly 
natural ). To a modern scientist, the lucubrations of astrologers 
in their available works appear to be sheer nonsense. But the 
rondamental principle assumed by astrology that heavenly bodies

exert predictable influence on terrestrial things and persons is 
not different from the principles of astronomy or meteorology 
whereby one can predict tides, eclipses, storms, torrential rains, 
and the like which affect the world and human beings. 

Whether the stars and planets exert some influence on 
earthly things is not the real question Probably they do, but 
the really important question is whether astrological works and 
astrologers have discovered correct methods and reached correct 
knowledge about the influence of planets on the human mind 
and on the day-today activities of human beings 

The astronomical and astrological literature m Sanskrit 
falls into three slightly overlapping periods. The first period h 
that of the Vedic Samhitas and the BrShmanas from the mists 
of antiquity to about 800 B. C. The second is represented by 
the VedSngajyotisa, the Srauta, Grhya and Dharmasatras, Manu 
and Yfijfiavalkya, Oarga and Jain works like the Suryaprajfiapti 
and ended about the 3rd century A. D The third period begins 
at the commencement of the Christian era and is represented by 
the works called SiddhSnta and gave rise to the works of Arya- 
bhata ( born 476 A. D. ), of VarShamihira (about 475 to 550 
A.D.), Brahmagupta (born in 598 A. D.) and soon Those 
who want to make a deep study of the History of Hindu Astro- 
nomy should carefully read the work in Marathi written by 
Shankar Balkrishna Dixit m 1896 (2nd edition w 1931 by 
his son). Even Thlbautwho is generally chary of praising 
any Indian achievement in astronomy was constrained to 
observe that Dikshit's work is the richest source of Indian astro- 
nomical material and that his treatment from Brahmagupta 
onwards is particularly detailed ( Grundriss, p. 3 ) Dikshit held 
that the scientific system of Indian astronomy is essentiajy 
independent and rests on Indian observations. In my humble 
opinion this view is far sounder than the view that the scienti- 
fic astronomy of India was derived from or was greatty influen- 
ced by Greek astronomy. I have decided (asstated above p. £0} 
not to enter into detailed discussions about astronomical matters.

Units of KaJa 

We shall sow turn to tho units of time from yuga back- 
wards to muhurta, leaving aside Manianlara, Kalpa and Pralaya 
for tho moment 

The word 'yuga ' occurs at least 33 times in the Bgveda and 
appears to have heon used in several senses Vide H of Eh vol, 
III p 886-890. Two senses stand out as prominent, ra a short 
period or a very long period For the first sense we may cite 
Bg. X 158. 6 ( 'Dlrgbatamas, the son of Mamata, became old in 
the 10th Yuga, he becamo br&hmS high priest and leader of the 
waters flowing to their goal' m Here yuga cannot mean a period 
of more than ten years and probably means a period of five 
years; in Bg HL 36.3 we read 'likeaneighinghorseby its mother, 
VaisvSnara ( Agm ) is kindled by the Kusikas in each yuga', vide 
Bg III 55.18 m In the Yed5ngajyotisa H1 ( verses 1 and 5 ) ynga 
issaidto comprise five years There is nothing to prevent us from 
taking this sense in the two passages cited from the Rgveda,

Rgveda meaning of yuga 487 

the word panualsara ' those ancestors that shattered Vala by 
righteousness and forced out the wealth consisting of cows' and 
in Bg. VII. 103. 8 the word 'parivatsarlna'. Samvatsara and 
Parivatsara are two of the five names bestowed on the five years 
of a yuga in the other samhitas. Just as the word yuga was 
used in several senses even in the Rgveda it is quite possible 
that the words 'samvatsara' and •parivatsara* meant simply year 
and also successive years of a cycle of five years. In the Tai. S. 
(V 5 7. l-3)namaskuia (salutation) is offered toRudrawith 
Samvatsara, to his bow towards the right with Parivatsara, to 
his bow behind with Idavatsara, to the bow towards the north 
with Iduvatsara and to the bow above with Vatsara. The Vaj. 
S. ( VI. 45 } names these five separately with Idavatsara in place 
of Iduvatsara; similarly, in Atharva VI 55.3 salutation is offered 
to Idavatsara, Parivatsara and Samvatsara. In Tai. Br. (14. 
10. l m ) Agni, Sditya, Oandramas and Vayu are identified with 
Samvatsara, Parivatsara, IdSvatsara and Anuvatsara and it 
should be noticed that the four names of years are brought in 
close relation to the four caturmasyas, via Vaisvadeva, Varuna- 
praghasa, S&kamedha and S\inasMya. Thus even in the Samhi- 
tas names (generally five) are mentioned in a certain fixed 
order. There is no reason why this should be so unless they 
formed a fixed series In a cycle. Thibaut in his Grundriss ( p. 9 ) 
hammers on the fact that sometimes only two or three or four 
out of the five are mentioned and argues ( rather obstinately ) 
that knowledge of the five year yuga cannot be assumed for the 
Vedio times. It should be noted that Kautilya speaks of the 
yuga of five samvatsaras and of the insertion of two intercalary 
months, one at the end of 2J years and the other at the end of 
five years. 701

488 History of Dlutrmaiasira [ Sea. D, Go, XV 

Tho MahSbh&rata knows of the ynga of five years 705 (in 
Sabhaparva IX 38 ). The PitamahasiddhSnta, m which is not 
extant now, stated, according to the PaficasiddhsntikS of 
VarShamihira, that yuga means five years of the Sun and 
the Moon and that an intercalary month was added after thirty 
months. 

Tho next question is : what was the extent of the year in the 
Vedic age. Some 5k. verses may be cited in this connection. 
'The wheel 707 of r/a has twelve spokes, it revolves round the 
heavens; it does never wear out. O Agm I m this ( wheel ) seven 
hundred and twenty sons in pairs abide Some say that the 
father ( Sun ) who sends down water has five feet and twelve 
forms and remains endowed with fulness in the distant half (part) 
of heavenB while others say that he ( the Sun ), the all-seeing, is 
placed in a lower (place) that has seven wheels and six spokes, 
all the worlds abide in the revolving wheel with five spokes , one 
wheel and twelve rims (of the wheel) and three naves-who is 
there that knew these (thoroughly); in that ( wheel i e.yeax) 
are placed together three hundred and sixty very unstable nails' 
( Bg I 164. 13-13 and 48 ). In these passages the sage poses a 
riddle or puzzle in very metaphorical and mystic language about 
a year divided into three, five or six seasons, twelve months, 
360 days and 730 days and nights (when calculated separately ).

divided into twelve parte ( dvadasSra ). But it is a very difficult 
matter to keep in view the twelve divisions correctly. In $g. 
L 164 15 it is said ' They say that the 7th of those that are born 
together is bom of one; there are only sis twin sages bom of the 
gods'. Here there iB a reference to seasons, six of wh.iob.have 
two months eaoh, the 7th has only one ( viz. 13th or interoalary 
month) and that the 13th month is not fit for religions rites. 
The Atharvaveda V. 35. 4 ms also states that Bamvatsara has 
twelve spokes and the months have 30 spokes This explains 
Bg. 1 164. 11-13 and 48. In the BrSamanas also the year is said 
to have 360 days and 720 dayB and nights together ; datapath* 
IX 1. 1. 43, Ait. Br. VH, 7 also say the TO same. We have also 
to recognise that the Vedio samhitas and Brabmanas speak of a 
13th month that was intercalated. About Varuna the Bgveda 
says 710 ' He knows the twelve months with their progeny (the 
days ) and also the month that is added. ' The Tai S. ( IV. 6. 7. 
1-2 ) refers to a year of twelve months and also of 13 months. 
The KausXtaki Br 19. 2 speaks of the 13th month. The Tai S. 
( 1 14. 4, vX 5. 3 4 ) expressly mentions the 13th month called 
' Samsarpa or Amhaspatya '. It is called Amhasaspati in Vaj. S. 
(VJI.30andXX3X31) and Samsarpa in MaitrSyanI 8. HE. 12. 
13. The Kausltaki Brabmana connects the 13th month with the 
Sunaslrlya sacrifice. 711 The MaitrSyanI Samhlta (L 10.8) 
draws a distinction between a rtuySjI and eaturmasya-yajr, the 
former being one who offers sacrifice thinking 'now Tasanta 
has started, rainy season has started, iarad has started while the

490 History of Dharmaitistra fSeaU.Gb.XV 

CSturmSsya-ySjI is one who offers sacrifice in -new of the 13a 
month'. nia How and when tfaB month was inserted in the 
Sgveda times or the times of the Tai S is not clear What is 
clear is that one whole month was added Therefore, Thibaut 
overstates the case when he asserts emphatically ( Grundriss p 7 ) 
that all Vedio texts agree that the year was exclusively of 860 
days. A year in which one month was added ( i e of 390 days ) 
was also well-known to the Bgvedic Indians. Therefore, in order 
to explain the facts we have here probably to postulate two 
calendars, one a purely sacrificial (or religious) of 360 days 
( 12 months of 30 days ) probably inherited by the Vedio Indians 
from their ancestors about whom we know next to nothing, and 
another calendar where a month was added in order to bring the 
year in line with visible astronomical data. It is known that the 
ancient Egyptians" 2 had an offioial calendar of 360 days ( 12 
months of 30 days each) plus five days added at end Le of 
365 days only and no intercalary day was inserted an a year. 
The result was that the opening day of this calendar wouia shift 
back through the solar year until a whole cycle of that year had 
been completed in 1456 or 1506 years ThiB calendar oafled 
sliding calendar was in use for about 3000 years in Egypt from 
proto-dynastio period until the Boman period. There was also 
another calendar against which this sliding calendar moved. A. 
yearof 360 days ( divided into 13 months of 30 days mA) was 
notpeculiar to ancient Vedic India nor to ^ ancient %>***

lengths for later times is vouchsafed by the Arfchasastra p 108 
( Sham Shastii's ed of 1919 }. A year of 360 days was Id later 
times in India called a S3t,ana one (from *savana* meaning 
extracting of soma juice in a sacrifice ) and a month was added 
after about 30 months to bring the lunar year ( of 354 days ) in 
line with, the solar year. 

In the Satapatha Brahmana (1L 1. 3. 2 )«* the Sun's 

apparent passage for six months in the north and for six months 

in the south is referred to, though the word ay ana is not employed 

in this passage. The word 'ayana' occurs in the sense of 

'motion or path' mtheBgveda (Syan-n-Spo ayanam-iochamanah, 

Bg. IU. 33. 7 ) UUarwjana &n&-Bak$tWyana in later literature 

mean no more than the san's ( apparent ) motion or path in the 

northern celestial sphere and in the southern sphere respectively. 

The Sun's movement in the north for six months and in the south 

for six months is mentioned in Br. Up VL %. 15-16 also. Thibaut 

(Qrundrissp 10 para 6 ) cites KausXtaki Br. 19. 3 as stating 

that &e Sun stands still after it has gone for six months towards 

the south in order to turn again to the north and then observes 

that no one has a right to assume, from this statement in the 

Kausltaki 71 * Br. that for six months the Sun goes north or south, 

that the halves of the year axe to be understood "What Thibaut 

is driving at is not clear to me We have in this passage six 

months passages of the Sun in the north and also in the south. 

A year has ordinarily only twelve months Therefore it must be 

assumed that halves of a year are meant. Thibaut does not 

explain what part of the year these six months in the north and 

south correspond to. Thibaut is probably swayed by the fact 

that in the Satapatha and elsewhere Vasanta, Grlsma and Varsa 

are lamped together as the seasons (rtus) for the gods hut 

tfttarayana does not exactly correspond with these three rtus. 

That may be so, but the rule or maxim is that names are given 

on the basis of what is principal or eminent (prEdMngena 

vyapadesa bhaianti ). Vasanta and Grlsma are important parts

The Atharvaveda Wo < VI 55.8 } mentions all the sis, but not in 
the usual order. The Ait Br. says that the year has five itm™

having six rtus and the Sat Br. (31 1.3.16) saya that sam- 
vatsara comprises six rtus. In Satapaiha XH a».33 the rtaB

seven rtus in Atharvaveda VL 613 But one should not he

and Yarsa ate fee seasons of gods, Sarad, Hemanta and Sisira 
axe seasons of the pitre; similarly the bright half of a month, 
the day and the forenoon of a day axe the times for gods and 
the dark half of a month, the night, the afternoon of a day are 
the times for pitrs and it winds up with the prescription that a 
brShmana should consecrate the sacred^ fixes in Vasanta, a 
ksatriya in Gxlsma and a vaisya in Sarad ns At least as 
early as the edicts of Asoka the words 'varsa' (which etymo- 
logically means ' rains * ) and ' samvatsara' are both used in the 
same sense viz. a year in the Brahmagiri inscription ( vide C. 
ILL p. 175). 

There are Western scholars that deny the knowledge of 
the planets to the Vedic Indians. But Thibant ( Grundriss p. 6 ) 
and Kaye (p. 33 ) both concede that it is inconceivable that the 
Yedic Indians did not observe and distinguish at least the 
larger planets in early times, but they contend that the Yedic 
passages cited as proving knowledge of the planets on the part 
of Yedic Indians cannot be accepted as evidence of the record 
of observations about planets and that the mere mention of the 
number seven or five ( about Adityas in &g. 2. 72. 8-9 or oxen ) 
cannot be relied upon. Both Thibant and Kaye approach these 
problems with a peculiar mentality. Their criticism is mainly 
destructive and has a flavour of special pleading against things 
and ideas Indian. They hardly ever propose their own explana- 
tions of the disputed passages and when they rarely do they do 
not show how their explanations are more satisfactory than the 
ones they criticize One typical case may be cited here. Almost all 
scholars agree that KrttikSs are the same as Pleiades ; but Kaye 
( Archaeological survey memoir No 18 p. 24 and I. A. vol 50, 
p. 45 ) appears to doubt this, yet he has not the goodness to say 
positively what other duster KrttikSs stand for and why. The

123. 1 and 5 the latter of whioh may be translated as follows: 
'The young lady ( Usas or lightning ), approaching with a smile 
her lover, hears in the highest heaven Vena, the dear one, and 
she mores about, in the places of the dear (Vena) and sits 
down with him on a golden wing (a oloud)'. This would be 
a fine description of Venus rising in the east at dawn. 

About months a good deal would have to be said later on. 
The word is either 'mas' or 'masa'. We have "mas' inQg. I 
25. 8, IV 18. 4, X 53. 3 ' He ( Agni ) appears every day and every 
month' and we have 'masa' in Bg. HI. 31. 9, V. 78. 9 (may the boy 
lying in the womb of his mother for ten months come out alive 
&o. ), X. 184. 3. 'M&s' ( the measurer ) also means the Moon, 
as in Bg. VUL 94. 2, X 12.7 ( *surye jyotir-adadhur-masyaktun, * 
the gods placed light in the Sun and darkness in the 
Moon ), X. 64. 3, X 68. 10, X 92. 12, X 93. 5. The words * mas ' 
( moon ) and * masa' ( month ) are Indo-European, as variants of 
the same occur in many languages of the so-called Aryan family 
of languages. 

Naksatras have been a matter of serious discussions in 
numerous works. The word « Naksatra ' has in all three senses 
( 1 ) Btar in general; ( 2 ) 27 equal parts of the zodiac; ( 3 ) 
asterism in the zodiacal belt ( which may each consist of one or 
more stars ). In my opinion the first and the 3rd are the most 
frequent meanings of the word in the Vedic samhitSs. It may be 
that the zodiacal belt was divided into 27 equal parts called 
naksatras, but the easier, more natural and probably the earlier 
way was to mark some conspicuous star groups like Krttikas, 
Mrgasiras and to refer to them as naksatras. The word 'naksatra' 
occurs frequently in the Bgveda and the other Samhitas and 
Srsamanas; the naksatras like thieves g o away along with

I. SO. 2 ), ' May the earth, the heaven, the waters, the Sun along 
with the naksatras and the wide sky listen to ub ' (Bg. JH. 54. 19); 
c he (Varuna) urges on in two ways the Dig and high heaven 
( the Sun J and naksatras and also spreads the earth ' ( Bg. VII. 
86. 1) ; ' when he ( the Sun ) comes up, naksatras are not'seen in 
the heavens, no one knows truly (how this happens }' Bg. X 
121.7,' The JLdityas are strong through Soma, the earth is great 
through Soma and then Soma is placed in the Jap of these 
naksatras ' ( Bg. X 85 8) In some passages like Bg. VH. 8L 2 
and X. 88. 13, it is difficult to say what ' naksatram ' stands for. 
Naksatra in most of the above passages means a star in general 
But in Bg. X. 85 2 and in X 68 U { the pitas adorned the heavens 
with naksatras ) 7a * naksatra appears to mean the 27 well-known 
asterfsms. So also when the Satapatha contrasts the Krttikaa 
(that do not swerve from the east) with other naksatras (that 
do swerve), naksatra should be taken to mean asterisms in the 
Zodiacal belt, the 27 ( or 28 ) constellations in the Zodiacal brit 
in which the moon appears to move. Another word is' ste" 
( that ie an Indo-European word ), which always occurs in the 
Instrumental plural in the Bgveda ( as in I 68. 5, 1 87. 1, 1 166. 

II, U. % 5, If. 34 2, IV. 7. 3, VI 49. 3 and 18 ) ana is often con- 
nected with decking the sky. The word « rksa ' in the Bense of 
' star ' occurs in Bg *** I 24. 1° ' these rksas that are established 
high up ( in the sky ) are seen at night, hut where did they go 
by day*. This refers to the constellation of the seven saps 
( Ursa Major ). In the Atharvaveda VI 40 1, the constellation 
of the seven sages is expressly mentioned : « May Heaven and 
Earth confer onus freedom from danger here, may the Sm iana 
the Moon do the same for us; may the wide mid regions confer 
on us freedom from danger and may there be *J*» «"»«

naksatras. 725 Apart from that the Bgveda mentions the naksatras 
Tisya ( as above ) and Agha and Arjuni™ ( in Rg. X 85. IS ) 
which two latter correspond to Magna and PhalgUDis according 
to the Aihaxvaveda. It is possible to hold either that Agha and 
Maghs were names for the same naksatra in Rgvedic times or 
that Agha was changed to Magna by 1he time of the Tai S. and 
the Atharvaveda hymns. If the latter alternative be accepted 
the change in the names of the two naksatras ( Agha and Arjani } 
could not have taken place in a short time, but would require at 
Ieastahuudred years between the time of Rg.X.85 on the one hand 
and Tai. S. and Atharva 19. 7 on the other. This would strongly 
militate against Mas Mullet's assignment of two hundred years 
to the Samhitas which are purely hypolhetioal and the minimum 
dates ( vide Intro p XV to the 4th volume of his 4 volume ed of 
the Rgveda) Apart from Agha and ArjunJ which it is agreed 
are two of the 27 naksatras, it is probable that the Rgveda refers 
to Mrgaiiras, Funarvasu, Satabhisak and one or two more by 
name. The Naksatras are 27 or 28 { adding Abhijit after UttarS-

in works from the 3rd or 4th century A. O. and in modern time3 
they are enumerated from Alvinl to BevatX. 

It is time now «j set out in a list the names of naksatras, 
deities governing them, their gender and the number of stars 
in each. There is some divergence of views as regards the 
names and the deities, which will also he pointed out in the

Br. 1 5 and 331. 1, Atharvaveda SX 7. 3-5, KSfhaka SamhitS

Naksatra* tn Bgveda 499 

rSjan bbisajah sahasram ' it is possible to see a reference to the 
Satabhisak naksatra of which Varnna is said be the devata 
in the Tai. Br. DX 1, especially as in the following Terse { ami 
yarksariihitasaucoa) there is a special reference to the Great 
Bear or to naksatras in general. 

Some remarks on the naksatras in general and on individual 
naksatras would not be ont of place, tn the Atharvana Naksatrakalpa ( the 
first of the Atharvaparisistas edited by Boiling and Negelejn ) m chapter 4 
verses 1-8 the devatas (deities) of the naksatras are given and chap, 2 
states the number of stars in each naksatra In some Fnranas also snch as 
the Visnudharmottara (I 83.13-21) the presiding deities of naksatras are 
set ont. In the Brhat-aamhtlS Varahamihua (chap. 97. 4-5) specifies 
the deities of the naksatras from Asvinl to Revati (incloding Abhijit)as 
noted below. The Brbat-samhita (96 1-3 ), the Atharvana-naksatra-kalpa 
(I. 2) and the Visnndbarmottara (1.88 4-7) specify the number of single 
stars in each naksatra (which are from one to six), those having six stars 
being Krttika, As)esa and Magna Vide JASB. vol 62 part 1 p. 14 where 
Hoernle gives a table, from a ms, of Pnskarasari's work, of naksatras, the 
stars in each, the muhttrtas, the gotra, devata of each. According to 
Hoernle the work is very old. Some notes are added on individual naksatras 
( mentioned in the Vedic works ). Krttika — The Tat. Br, III. 1.4.1 specifies 
the names of seven Krttikas as Amba, Data &c Panini refers to Krttika as 
Bahula(inIV. 3.34). J C. Hicley »n 'Introducing the universe' (pp 119- 
120) says that persons of unusually keen 731 vision under favourable atmos- 
pheric conditions can see even eleven. MrgaSrsa— Taj Br. III. 1, 4. 3 
mentions both names viz. Mrgasina and InvakS. Funarvasu — In the Kathaka 
and Mai S. this is masculine singular ; Panini states ( I. 2. 61 ) that in the 
Veda the word 'Fnnarvasn' is employed optionally in the singular (i.e.

cealed by any one ) 1 who is here that awakened us ? The goat ( the Sun ) 
replied that the dog was tbe awakeser at the end of year and that this 
was announced that day.' Tilak in ' Orion ' ( pp. 168 ff ) explains at great 
length the meaning of these verses Though one may not agree with every- 
thing that he says, his main contentions seem to be probable.

Tisya— Paoim uses the word Tisya in I 2 63 and 3. 34 and the words 
Pasya and Sidbya in the sense of 'on which undertakings prosper or 
succeed.' 

PhaJgunt— PSmni provides that the words FhalgunT and Prosthapada as 
nsksatras are optionally used in the dual or plnral. 

Nistya— Mai. S shows that this is neater singular. Nisfya in Rg, VI, 
75. IS, VIII 1. 13, X 133 5 appears to mean ' outsider or outcasts ', 

Visakhar- PSnim (I 2 62) provides that in the Veda 'VisakhS' is 
sometimes need in the singular, sometimes in the dual, while in his day it 
was used in the dual 

Annradhi— The mantra in Tai. Br HI 12 1 appears to use it as 
masculine plnral 

Koblni— Jyestlia is called Rohuu in Tai S andTai, Br (13) Jyestha 
is styled Jyesthaghnl in Atharva VI 110 2 Vide note 753 below. 

Mula— In Tai S, Vicrtau is used for Mula The Atharvaveda brings 
together Vicrtau and Jyesthaghnl in VI 110 2-3 and has -Vicrtau nima 
tSrake* in II 8. 1 and VI 121 3 In Rg X. 87 10 ( tndha nflta yStudhi-

and Kathaka S , Pitarah as deity far Mula in Tai S. but Nirrti 
in almost all other texts; Iztdra as deity of SatabMsak in Tai. S. 
and Mai. S but Varuna in Tai Br (ULl.) and Kathaka, 
Farther, it was also specified whether a naksatra had only one 
star or had a cluster of two or three or more. Besides, the 
important point for consideration is; why does the Tai S. differ 
from the Tai Br and Tai Br. I 5 from Tai Br. DX 1 in the 
number of naksatras, in the names and the deities also of some 
of them STo satisfactory explanation can be given except this 
that the Tai. S passage is earlier by some centuries than the 
Tai Br. section (III 1 ) or the Tai S was composed in a country 
far away from the place where the Tai Br. was composed. This 
latter does not appear to be probable since one part of Tai. Br. 
(IS) differs from another part (BX 1 ). The latter section 
speaks of a naksatra-isti in which oblations are offered to 88 
naksatras ( including Abhijit ) and their deities ( one naksatra 
being dealt with on each day from KrttikSs ) together with 
puronuvakyas ( invitatory verses ) and yajyas ( oblation verses ) 
which are different for each naksatra The first fourteen naksa- 
tras from Krttika (up to and including VisakhS) are called 
Devanaksatras and the fourteen naksatras from AnurSdhs to 
Apabharanl or BharanI are called Tamanaksatras. After 
Visakha, the Tai Br. ( Naksatresti ) inserts PaurnamSsI with 
appropriate pnronuvakya and yajya verses and after apabharanl 
an offering to Amavasya with a puronuvSkyg (which is the 
verse 'Nivesaul sangamanl vasunam' Tai S BX 5 1.1) and a yajya 
( which is the verse * yat te deva adadhur ', Tai B. BX 4 L 1 Jl 
Besides, it was laid down that the sacrificer had to invoke gods 
in the sacrifice by a name ( to be kept secret ) derived from the 
presiding deity of the naksatra on which he was 731 born ( i. e. if

If the naksatras ( 27 or 28 ) had been borrowed at one time 
en bloc from, a foreign source the divergences in the names of the 
naksatras, in the presiding deities, and in the gender and numbe r 
should ordinarily not have arisen to the extent they do But, if 
they were an indigenous growth then differences of opinion 
would naturally have been evolved in the passage of centuries 
-The only asterisms first specialised and named m Greece and 
Syria were the Pleiades in Job 38. 31, Homer and Hesiod; 
Orion in Job 39 31, Homer and Hesiod ; Aioturus in Job 9.9 and 
in 39.32, Homer and Hesiod , the great Bear in Homer and Hesiod, 
Aldebaran in Homer and Hesiod and three more including Sirius 
(vide 'Dawn of Astronomy' by Norman Lookyer, 1884 p. 33) 
ThiB is several centuries later ( if not thousands) than the early 
Vedio texts wherein the whole scheme of naksatras appears.

brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya saorificer respectively. The 
Satapatha appears to condemn setting up of sacred fires in relation 
to naksatra alone and reoommends that Agnyadheya should he 
performed on the New Moon of Vaisakha on which there is 
Bohint naksatra; 732 " hut these rules did not apply when a person 
had resolved upon performing Soma sacrifice and he should not 
in that case stop to consider the season or naksatra. 

Very interesting information and legends are given in the 
Vedio texts about some of the naksatras. About the Krttikas the 
Satapatha Brahmana' 33 states ' other naksatras contain one star, 
or two or three or four stars, but these Krttikas are many, the 
saorifioer reaches plenty; therefore one should set up sacred 
fires on the Krttikas. These ( Krttikas ) indeed do not swerve 
from the east, while all other naksatras do swerve from the 
eastern direction. * The recondite allusion in Rg. L 164. S3 
( atra pita duhitur-garhham-Sdhat ) and X 61. 7 ( pita yat svam 
duhitaramadhiskan ) are developed into a myth, a lengthy 
account of which is given in the Ait. Br XTTT. 10 and Satapatha 
1. 6. 2. 1-4 ( Frajapati approached his daughter, some say the 
heaven and others say it was Usas &o.) and about Eohinl, 
Mrga, the Mrgavyadha ( Sirius ) and the three stars in the belt 
of Orion. Prajapati 73 * is said to have had 33 daughters which 
he gave in marriage to king Soma, who was fond of BohinI 
and on account of that suffered from Bajayaksman ( Tai. S. H. 
3. 5 1) 

Why the naksatra lists begin with the Krttikas in the Vedio 
Literature and why with AsvinI in classical Sanskrit literature 
oan be explained only on astronomical considerations. The ver-

nal equinox was in Krttika about 2300 B. G Instead of admit- 
ting this as a probable date for tbe Vedio works, fleet boldly 
asserts that tbe list of naksatras beginning with Krttikas has 
no basis in f aot, but belongs entirely to ritual and astrology 
(JEAS for 1916 p 570). No detailed arguments are deemed 
necessary Fleet does not Bpecify cogent evidence, nor does he 
assign reasons why priests later on changed the beginning of 
the list from Krttika to AsvinI, nor does he vouchsafe how the 
list of naksatras in the Vedic age began in fact for ordinary 
folk if the Krttika list was a pure priestly invention Even 
Thibaut ( in I A. voL 24 at p. 100 } had to admit that the begin- 
ning of the naksatra series with Krttika instead of with AsvinI 
seriously affeots Max Mutter's assignment of 1500 B. a to 800 
B 0. to the Vedio period In the Tai. S VII 4 8 there is a 
discussion about the time for undergoing the dlksa in a Ssmvat- 
sara-satra*. m It is proposed there that the dlksa may be performed 
on the Full Moon in PhalgunI because that is the beginning of 
the year; then an objection is raised against this and it is pro- 
posed that the dlksa may be taken on Full Moon in Citra, because 
that waB the beginning of the year. K the year began with 
the winter BolBtice in those days this reference would have to be 
placed at 4000 or 6000 B. O. This passage probably embodies 
traditions that the year began in different months in different 

periods of antiquity. 

Great controversies have raged over the question whether 
the Indian naksatras are indigenous or ^!»™"j"™ 
other people. The great French astronomer Biot held thattodians 
borrowed the naksatra system from the Chinese and TOutney

NakqOlras indigenous or borrowed 509 

of ( it is said ) 28 at about 1100 B 0. ( as said by Thibaut in 
Grandriss p. 13. ) There are no clear traoeB in the Vedio texts 
that naksatras were held to be 34 during the times of those texts. 
We should not accept at their face value the assumptions of the 
antiquity of astronomy in China that are sometimes advanced 
( vide ' East and West ', Borne, vol. VI. p. 288. ) Besides, neither 
in Babylonia nor in China were the asterisms thoroughly 
integrated with the religious system. In Yedio times one was 
not entitled to perform solemn sacrifices unless he had already 
set up sacred fires on certain naksatras Further, the months 
( Magna, Fhalguna, Oaitra &o ) were named after certain 
naksatras and exist only in Sanskrit, not in Greek, Latin or 
Chinese. The deitieB that were deemed to preside over the 
naksatras from such ancient dayB as those of the Tai S. and Tai. 
Br. are almost all of them exclusively Vedic and have no counter- 
parts in Babylonia or China. Besides, though thousands of 
cuneiform tablets have been found in Babylonia no one has, so 
far as I know, pointed to a single tablet where all the naksatras 
appear in an orderly series of 27 or 28, as we find in Vedio 
SamhitSs. It is at least clear that long before the Taittirlya 
Samhita the Vedic people had fixed the number of the naksatras 
( at 27 or 28 }, their names and order and their presiding deities 
and had made the naksatras a most integral part of their sacri- 
ficial system. Bnrthermore, almost all of the Indian names of 
naksatras aie significant or have ancient legends connected with 
them. For example, Ardra means * wet' and the naksatra was call- 
ed Sxdra because when the sun was in it rains set in. Punarvasu 
was probably so called because the grains of paddy or barley 
sown in the ground sprout up as new wealth after being buried ; 
Pusya, was so oalled because the young sprouts grow and beoome 
nourished ; A.sresa or Silesa,beoause the grown-up plants of paddy 
or bailey grow high enough to embrace each other ; Magna, be- 
cause the paddy or other plants are putting forth the standing 
crop which is wealth in itself; Krttika, because they ( being six 
or seven }, look like the skin of the spotted deer on which a 
religious student was to sit for Vedic study. In these circum- 
stances the burden to prove borrowing of the naksatra Bystem 
by Indians was very heavy on those who affirmed it. What is 
the evidence ? There is very little evidence except prejudice and 
speculation The main tangible evidence they can and do rely on 
fa that the Chinese or Babylonians had also 28 naksatras as the 
Indians had. But these scholars, though very learned and far- 
seeing in their own way, never stopped to consider how from

source. Ano&er reason for akaounting the theories of Tot 
Weber and WMtnay may also be advanced v« JtanlSS 
of Tjjakmta 'Orwn' (particularly pp. 61-45) and of Prof! 
Jaoobi have at least made this clear that the KrttikS series Is 
not lie oldest arrangement of the naksatras known to Indians, 
out that the Indiana had once an older arrangement, which plac- 
ed MrgasTrsa at the vernal equinox. Those who are interested m 
these somewhat novel and rather barren controversies raised by 
Bwt, Weber and others may read Weber's 'der vedisohen Nachn- 
ohten von den Naksatras', two volumea, I A vol 23 pp. 154-159 
(Jacobionthe 'date of the fcgveda'), pp. 238-349 (Burner's 
note on Jaoobi's theory and Tilak's Orion, I A. pp. 83-100 
( Thibaut on 'antiquity of Vedic civilization' ) and pp 361-869 
(Whitney), I A 48 pp. 95-97. The word 'naksatra' is derived 
by Y&ska 736 from the root 'naks' meaning 'togo', while the 
Satapatha Br. (H 1. 2. 17-18) and Tai Br, H 7 18 derive it as 
from na plus Ksatia and Pfinini (VI 3 75) accepts this derivation. 
The word ' naksatra* (m) is applied even to the Sun in Bg. VI. 
67. 6. Tai. Br teaches how one is to mark the naksatra 
on whioh one has to perform a religious act, viz. he should mark 
about dawn and before the first rays light the sky the part of 
the sky where the naksatra appears and when the sun appears 
the naksatra would be to the west of the sun, at which time he 
should perform what he has to do. It is stated that sage Matsya 
established into eminence Yajfiesu and Satadyumna by this 
method ( Tai. Br. I 5. 2 1.) 

Even so early as the Ait Br. 757 Vedic Indians had arrived at 
the conclusion that the Sun was one and never sets. ' This Sun

indeed never seta nor rises. When people think that he ( the 
Sun) sets what happens is he reaches the end of the day, 
reverses himself, creates night below and day above When 
people think that he rises in the morning, that meana that 
having reached the end of the night he reverses himself, makes 
day below and night above. He indeed never sets '. This is in 
very interesting contrast to the Jaina view in SuryaprajSapti 
of two suns and two moons or the view of Heraolitus in Greece 
( 6th century BO.) that a new sun was born and died every day 
{Eislerp.43.) 

In the Brahmana period Indians had 737 " found out the day 
called Visuvat or Visuva ( which is said to be in the middle of 
the sacrificial year ) when the day and night were of equal 
length : ' As a person fastens the two wings or sloping sides of 
a hall ( or shed ) to the bamboo ridge or beam that is in the 
middle ( of the shed ), so people use the Divaklrfcya day for stret- 
ching across the two sides { half years ) '. 

I have purposely devoted some space to the subject of the 
astronomical knowledge of people in the Vedic age. Several 
European scholars that have written on the astronomical 
achievements of anoient and medieval India, have indulged in 
very disparaging and contemptuous statements about Indians

not only fn astronomy, but generally. To take only one or two 
instances Thibaut ( Grundriss p. 3 J is pleased to observe that 
what Indians knew before Greek influence is not much and is 
of a primitive character. This is how Whitney, a learned 
American scholar of Sanskrit, unburdens himself ; 'there can be 
no question that, from what we know in other respects of the 
character and tendencies of the Hindu mind, we should not at 
nil look to find the Hindus in possession of an astronomical 
science possessing so much of truth They have been from the 
beginning 1 distinguished by a remarkable inaptitude and disin- 
clination to observe, to collect facts, to record, to make inductive 
investigations' (J A.O S vol. VI p. 471) His coadjutor, 
Mr. Burgess, differed from him even in regard to astronomy 
(tbifi. pp. 477-480). 

One is tempted to return Whitney's compliments to Indians 
in the same coin by saying that for 1400 years from Ptolemy, 
the ancestors of Whitney and other highbrows hardly ever made 
any discovery of astronomical importance, stuck unthinkingly 
and slavishly to the Almagest and were literally in the dark 
about the true astronomical position during what are often 
called the Dark Ages of Europe Even Luther who rebelled 
against the authority of the Pope denounced Copernicus as a 
fool, charged the latter with turning upside down the science of 
astronomy and relied upon the Bible, which, he said, declared 
that Joshua commanded the Sun to stand still and not the 
Earth ( Joshua 10. 12 ). This betrays the old mentality that if 
there is a contradiction between the words of the Bible and 
Nature, the believers in Scripture must correct > &"*" f 
Nature in accordance with the Bible and not the Bible in 
accordance with what is found to be Nature This also reminds 
onTof the mLim of the Purvamlmamsa that there is nothing too 
heavy for a saored text.

of the Vedio priests ' ( p. 8 }. If the Greeks forged ahead in one 
or two branches, there were Beveral other peoples in the world 
that far surpassed them in other equally important matters. I 
would also recommend to them to read carefully what Barton 
says in his Preface (p. IX) to 'A history of Science' where he 
charges Western writers with unpardonable omissions viz. 
ignoring the scientific efforts of Egypt, Mesopotamia and other 
countries and assuming childishly that science began in Greece 
and secondly hiding the superstitions which surrounded eminent 
Greeks. Writers at least in the 19th and 20th centuries should 
have no reason to run down one people and praise to the skies 
another people, but their endeavour should be to arrive at well- 
documented, well-balanced, impartial and cautious judgments 
upon the achievements of ancient peoples of the world 

The chronology of the Tedic age is far from certain. Jacobi, 
Dikshit, Tilak and some others would put the Vedio age back 
to 4000 B. O. or even earlier Winternitss puts it as far back 
as 2500 B. O , while Max Muller and following him many 
Western scholars would thrust all Vedio Literature between 1500 
to 800 B. a Even taking these latter timings the Vedio Litera- 
tnre slwnre a good deal of progress in astronomical matters 
which Indians could not have owed to Greece. There is no 
extant literature in Greece that can be placed earlier than about 
S00or800B.O with certainty. The Homeric poems and the 
works of Hesiod are the oldest surviving literary writings in 
Greek, Homer mentions the Sun, the Moon, the morning and 
evening star, the Pleiades, Hyades, Orion, Great Bear, Sirius 
(Orion's Dog), Bootes (Arctums) and Hesiod mentions practi- 
cal the Bame stars as Homer; Hesiod says that spring began

Greek influence and Siddhantas 515 

first place no Indian work of She Siddhanta class admits that any 
Yavana knowledge was at the basis of the Indian astronomy nor 
do these ancient Sanskrit works on astronomy set out any large 
number of purely astronomical terms of Greek origin as VarSha 
does in astrology. The subjects to be dealt with in the Panoasid- 
dh&ntika are set out in chap. X verses 5-7 and there is hardly 
any word therein that can be said to be originally Greek, 
Reliance is placed by Weber and others on the fact that two 
of the five Siddhantas the characteristics of which are sum- 
marised by VarShamihira in his Karavd? 40 called Pafica- 
siddhSntiks are designated Eomaka and Paulisa and it is 
argued that this clearly suggests Greek influence. One should 
like to know the number of purely Greek astronomical words 
employed in the Siddhantas (older than VarSha) and different 
from fee 36 or 37 Greek words said to have been employed in 
Sanskrit astrology by VarSha and others Conceding for 
argument that Eomaka stands for the Alexandrian school that 
does not prove Greek influence on the Siddhantas. There is 
hardly any evidence to show that any medieval work or calendar 
in India followed or was based mainly upon the data of the 
Eomaka' 4 * The length of its year is 365 days, 5 hours, 55 
minutes and 12 seconds which exactly agrees with the deter* 
mination of the extent of the year given by Hipparchus and 
accepted by Ptolemy (Thibaut in Grnndriss p. 4Z) The 
rules set np by VarSha for ahargana according to Eomaka giv» 
results for the meridian of Tavauapura (and not for that of 
tJjjayinl). It did not occur to any Western scholar so far that 
the Bomaka-siddhSnta being in Sanskrit was most probably 
composed by some Greek"' settled ia I ndia familiar with

natal theories at length (as the siddhantas do) and famishes a set of

of 'hora-saBtra'. But VarSha nowhere pays a similar compliment 
to Yavanas about their proficiency in Astronomy and Mathe- 
matics This would suggest that in astronomy he did not 
rate them high or did not think they had anything special to 
impart to Indians or at least he did not base his astronomical 
theories on the works of Greek astronomers. He hardly ever 
employs any Greek words that are not already employed in his 
work on astrology. 

Thibaut ( Grundriss, p 42) holds that the name Fulisa has 
deoidedlya non-Indian appearance. One fails to understand 
why these learned writers are so positive about a certain name 
being non-Indian. We have in Sanskrit such ancient names 
asFulastya.'^Pulaha, Paulastya (forKubera) which contain 
most of the elements of the word Fulisa and are very similar to 
it. Even in these days Hindus! bear such names as Sabobsingh. 
The siddhantas are called PaitSmaha and Paulisa because 
they were deemed to have been composed by Pitamaha and 
Pulisa. Alberuni, Thibaut says, traces the name Pulisa to a 
Greek author PauhiB; but Alberuni who was familiar with both 
Indian and Greek authors might have committed a mistake, as 
even such a scholar as Weber, whose vast reading and pheno- 
menal industry are a marvel, was misled by mere similarity in 
name and one recalls what was said in the drama 6akuntala by 
the attendant of Sakuntala's little Bon that the child was misled 
by the similarity of nameB. Thibaut himself admits that it 
cannot be proved that the Paulisa siddhanta is related to the 
work of the Greek astrologer Paulus. Paulisa-siddbanta appears 
to have restricted itself mostly to astronomical matters. We 
have seen (p 488) that the Paitamaha-siddhSnta was composed 
about 80 A D. Therefore, that Siddhanta could not have borrowed 
anything from Ptolemy { 150 A. D. ). Prof. Neugebauer again

thafc thanseof the eecenfric-epioyclie model alone is sufficient

lies between Hipparohus and Ptolemy and hopes that a

information about pre-Ftolemafo Greek astronomy no longer

that hope will ever be fulfilled If ancient Indians were capable 
of analysing the elements of the Sanskrit language and raising 
Buoh a system as Paninfs, if they could plumb the depths of the 
human mind and create a mental discipline like the Yoga, if 
they carefully noted oenturieB before Christ the parts of the

it and the sign for a zero to Europe through the Arabs in the 12th

the development of Hellenistic astronomy before Ptolemy. In his review of 
the work on Indian studios by Professors Renou and Filhozat Prof. 
Neugebauer seems to bold that the discussion of Greek influence on Hindu 
astronomy and mathematics is of very littlB interest, since most of the Greek 
material was well known in Mesopotamia in the middle of the 2nd millennia 
B.C. and might have spread from Mesopotamia towards the east (vide

supposed motions of the Sub, the Moon and the planets round 
the earth. 

One more observation must he made here. The Vedanga- 
Jyotisa 745 says 'The sun and the moon start towards the 
north in the month of Magha at the beginning of Sravistha ( i e. 
Dhanisths) and the Sun starts towards the south in the middle 
of islesa in the month of Sravana' i e. winter solstice was in 
the beginning of Dhanisths in the Brhatsamhita Varahamihira 
tells us that in his day the two ayanas of the Sun took place at 
the beginning of Karkataka and of Makara respectively, that 
indeed at some time in the past Uttarayana began at the 
beginning of Dhanistha and daksmayana commenced in the 
middle of Asless and that therefore it was so declared in 
former sSstras. This shows that, between about 505 A D. when 
Varaha planned and probably wrote his Panca-siddhSntikS and 
the observation contained in the Vedanga-Jyotisa, the commen- 
cement of Daksinayana had shifted from the middle of Aslesa 
to the last quarter of Punarvasu i e in all about %i degrees and 
20 minutes. Varahamihira makes no effort to explain this. It is 
therefore quite reasonable to argue that he was probably not 
aware of the theory of the precession of the equinoxes. Autho- 
rities are not in complete agreement as to the yearly extent of 
precession. Taking itat50 2 seconds per year, the total number of 
years between Varaha and the date of the observation in Vedanga 
Jyotisa would be about 1673 and deducting 505 years (the time 
ofVaraha'Bepochforasiddhanta calculation) the observation 
would refer itself to about 1168 B. 0. If Varaha and his prede- 
oessors had borrowed scientific astronomy directly from the 
Greeks, they should have been quite aware of the precession of

Hipparohus, and was adopted by Ptolemy. 715 ' 

This consideration has speoial force in view of the faot that 
Var&ha believed that the constellation of the Saptarsis (Ursa 
Major) was in the MaghSs at the time when Yudhisthira ruled, 
that that star group remains for one hundred years in each of 
the 27 naksotras and that therefore to complete one cycle 
through all naksatras the star group of Saptarsis required 
3700 years. 7 " 

There are other serious difficulties also in holding that the 
Sanskrit scientific astronomical treatises were acquainted with or 
borrowed from Ptolemy's work. Numerous discrepancies in essen- 
tial matters exist between Ptolemy's work and Hindu astronomical 
works such as the assignment of different dimensions to Hie 
epicycles of the planets by Ptolemy and by Hindu writere. There- 
fore, it is altogether improbable that the Hindu works were 
directly based onPtolemy's work. Nor is there any direct evidence 
to show that Hindu works were based on Hipparohns or the works

No proof of Greek Influence 521 

of other Greek writers. No each Greek works are now available 
nor are even Greek elementary manuals of astronomers available 
which, can be said to agree with Hindu scientific works That 
an extensive Sanskrit literature on astronomy has perished is 
clear from Varaha-mihira's works and Utpala's quotations in 
his commentaries on the Br. S. and Brhaj-jataka, Modern 
Western writers would do well to ohserve at least for the present 
a non-committal attitude instead of repeating ad nauseum that 
Hindu scientific astronomy was derived from Greeks on slender 
similarities between the two systems and on obscure and ill- 
understood passages and extracts in old astronomical works 
(vide E. Burgess in J. A. O S. vol. VI at p 480 ). 

After having briefly indicated the astronomical knowledge 
to be gathered from Vedic works, it is now necessary to show 
that astrological knowledge is also found in the Yedic texts from 
the oldest times. The human mind is very curious to know the 
future and is very prone to regard certain days, times and 
appearances as auspicious or favourable and others as inauspici- 
ous Various means were adopted by ancient peoples to pry into 
the future The word astrology is now generally understood 747 to 
mean the predictions about what would befall an individual 
based on the configurations of the Sun, the moon and the planets 
at the time of his birth. But this was not the sense or at least 
the only sense in which the word was used in very ancient times. 
Astrology known to us from the ancient Assyrians was concerned 
almost wholly with the interpretation of celestial phenomena 
and planetary configurations and the predictions about the 
immediate future in relation to the country, its people, its 
government or king, in such matters as the crops, floods, storms, 
Invasions or other calamities. The events in the heavens, in the 
sky and even on the earth were supposed to intimate the 
thoughts of the gods, and to convey indications about impending 
happenings. This may be called natural astrology. Horoscopio 
astrology is a later development Predictions were also derived by 
skilled diviners from various other happenings such as dreams, 
the flight and cries of birds, and the interpretation of the 
mysterious signs on the livers™ of the sheep killed in sacrifices 
to god3 in Bab ylon and Rome

(the setting up of the sacred fires) was to be performed on 
one of seven naksatras or in spring, summer and autumn 
according to the tarna (class) of the performer (vide Ksthaka 
S. 8.1, Sat Br. EL 1.2, Tai Br. 1 1 2 6-7 ). But an exception was 
recognized in the case of one performing a Soma sacrifice. It 
was provided that whenever a man had a desire to perform a 
Soma sacrifice he might establish the sacred fires in any season 
and that would bring prosperity to him. 18 *.

individual astrology. Sbr example, in the Tai. Br 751 it is 
provided that people plough their fields on AnuradM 
naksatra, of which Mifcra 1b the presiding deify. The 
PSraksoragrhya prescribes in the same strain that a man 
should put the ploughshare (in his field) on an auspicious day 
or on Jyestha naksatra of which Indra is the presiding deity 
(and rains are in the handB of Indra) On the other hand, the 
same Br5hmana ,M (Taittirlya) provides that if a man desires 
that his daughter should he dear to her husband he should 
get her married when the moon is in Nistya(Svatl) naksatra 
and that if ha does so his daughter becomes dear to her husband 
and never comes hack to her father's house. The naksatras 
from Krttika to Visakba have been declared to beDevanaksatras 
and whatever rites are performed on them are declared to have 
been performed on a holy day (ptinusha) Even as early as the 
Atbarvaveda' 53 it appears to have been believed that a boy 
born on Jyestha or on Viral (i e Mala naksatra) or on a day 
called tiger-like (on an evil or terrible nakBatra) might himself 
die or bring about the death of his father or mother. The two 
verses may be translated as follows- '(the hoy) is born on 
Jyesihaghnl (i. e Jyestha ) or on Vicrt which belongs to Yama; 
goaid him against being uprooted, may (Agni) take him 
beyond all evil results in order that he may reach the long life 
of a hundred autumns This valiant eon was horn on a tiger-like 
day and naksatra; may he not, while he grows, kill his fattier 
or his mother that gave him birth.' 

Thus it appears that some naksatras were called puma 
(auspicious or holy) as in Tai. Br. 1 5. 3. 1 or DX 1,2.8, while

some others (like Jyestha, Mula) were held to be pSpa (evil) 
naksatras. 

From a passage in the m Br. Up. it appears that certain 
naksatras were called male "if a man desireB 'May I reaoh 
greatness' he should observe milk diet for twelve days beginning 
in the northward passage of the Sun, in the bright half of a 
month and on a favourable day he offers into the fire on a male 
naksatra&o." 

From the above examples it will be apparent that prognos- 
tications were based in very early Vedio times on the naksatras 
either of birth or on naksatras deemed auspicious or inauspicious. 
Pusya appears to have been regarded as a very auspicious 
naksatra long before PSnini, who mentions another name of it 
as'Sidhya'. But in these early times it does not appear that 
any rules had been arrived at about the influence of planets 
(except perhaps of Jupiter in Pusya) in certain naksatras or 
about horoscopes with planets in naksatras or ra&s (signs of 
the zodiac) or in certain 'houses'. In those days prognostica- 
tions were confined mainly to naksatras, days and natural 
phenomena and bodily marks. For example, Psninl L 4. 39 
( ' W&Fi$«l ftsw ' ) provides a rule for a diviner considering the 
good or bad luok of a person. The %ffim explains 'ftft?: sbk

to indicate coming events, auspicious or otherwise; "» '(the 
bird) erring again and again and voicing (indicating) coming 
event sends forth his speech as an oarsman propels a boat; 
bird I may you bo auspicious to us and may no unfavourable 
sign reach you from any quarter ; O bird! may you that are 
auspicious and whoso cry forebodes good cry to the south of 
(our) bouses; may no thief master us nor may any one declare 
that wo may meet danger.' Br S, 98. 14 provides that birds 
indicate to a person going on a journey the evil results of actions, 
good or oviL done by him in former lives. The Yoga-yStrs of 
Varahamihira (chap. 14) and Adbhutasagara pp. 569-582 deal 
at iongth with sakuna (prognostications from the sight, flight 
or cries of birds and other animals). TogayfitrS ( 14. % and 26 ) 
provides that certain birds and animals when they are to the 
right or southern side of a man starting on a Journey indicate 
auspicious results and that when a cSsa bird with something in 
its mouth flies to the right side of a man that is an indication 
of welfare. 

Tho result of the dependence on ideas of rooky and unlucky 
days and naksatras was that some people began to make 
observations and deduce conclusions and a lore called 'naksataa- 
-vidya' arose When Nfirada approached the great teacher 
Sanatkumara for knowledge, the latter questioned him as to 
what he already knew and then tfarada enumerated, a long lias 
of lores (including'* the four Vedas, Itihfisa-pnrSna), one of 
which is 'nakeatravidya' («the science of naksataas t% 
artronomy and astrology). It can be easily imagined how

like. One of the earliest references to this prejudice against star- 
gazers in Sanskrit literature is found in the Tai Br. EL 4 4 and 
VSj. S. 30. 10 and 20, where the 757 * naksatradarsa* (star-gazer) is 
made over as a viotim to piajilana and tha 'ganaka' (calculator 
of the movements of stars and planets) is consigned to aquatic 
animals along with the headman of the village Among the long 
list of hrshmanas that should not be invited for religious rites in 
honour of gods or in sraddhas, Manu ( HI 162 ) includes one who 
maintains himself by the practice of astrology (naksatrair- 
yasoajlvati) and in (VI 50) Manu prohibits ascetics from 
desiring to secure alms by foretelling the results of portents 
(like earth-quakes) or of bodily 7SS movements (such as the 
throbbing of the eye or arm ) or by naksatravidya ( astrology ) 
or angamdya ( palmistry ) or by casuistry or by telling what the 
sfistra ordains on a (disputed) point. The ancient sutras of 
Harlta and of Sankhalikhita declare that a naksatrajivm ( one 
who lives by practising astrology) and a ' naksatr&desavrtti ' 
(who makes his livelihood by conveying the message of naksa- 
tras ) respectively are unfit to sit in a row with other brahmanas 
( q by Krtyakalpataru on sraddha p. 88 ) Similarly, Sumantu 
( in a prose passage q on sraddha by Krtyakalpataru p. 91 ) 
states the same about a * mulyasamvatsarika ' (who practises 
astrology for money) The Visnudhaima-sutra (chap. 82.7) 
includes those who maintain themselves by astrology (naksatra- 
jlvinah ) among those who are not to be invited for sraddha 
rites. Similarly, the Tevijjasutta ( S. B. B vol 33 pp 196-197 ) 
and Mahasfla in Dlghanikaya ( I. p. 68 ) condemn for Buddhist 
monks maintenance by such low arts as guessing at the length 
of a man's life or by foretelling future events ( such as eclipses, 
falling meteors, victory and defeat &c. ) But the mere study 
of constellations is allowed by Buddha ( m S. B B vol XX 
pp. 292-394). Among obstacles to gain 759 Kautflya enumerates

many such matters as passion of love, anger, timidity and desire 
to find out an auspicious tithi and naksatra* and winds up with 
two fine verses characteristic of the great genius that placed 
Gandragupta Maurya on the throne of Magadha . ' The desired 
object ( or wealth ) eludes that childish man that is excessively 
in search of what the stars portend: for the desired object is 
(itself) the star that governs (success) in securing it; what 
will stars do ? Men striving ( to attain their ends ) will secure 
their objects after hundreds of efforts; wealth is caught by 
wealth just as elephants are bound by other elephants (opposed 
to them } ' Prom the above it is quite clear that several centuries 
before Christ an astrologer ( who maintained himself on money 
acquired by the practice of astrology) was very much condemned. 
What Kautilya regards as reprehensible is extreme reliance 
on and pursuit of naksatra astrology, but it is not to be 
supposed that he ignored prognostications altogether. About 
the king's purolnta (priest) he lays down the following 
« the king should appoint as priest a person whose family ana 
character are highly spoken of, who has well studied the Veda 
together with the six angas, the divine and other portents and 
the science of the government of people and who can prevent 
divine and human calamities by means contained m the 
Atbarvaveda. the king should follow him as a Jwndg-Uf 
teacher or a son his father or a servant his master *J fcTOW. 
who is later than Kautilya by some centuries, also lays down in

called mSnasa (pertaining to the mind ), in this way all persons 
are concerned with six naksatras (1st, 10th, 16th, 18th, 23rd and 
25th), they say that the king is concerned with nine naksatras, 
the three additional ones being those connected with his jati 
(caste), his country and with the naksatra on the day of his 
coronation The Yogayatrs and Yisnudharmottara (I. 78. 
14-16) farther provide 'when the naksatra of one's birth 
is affected by evil (star or aspect) the results are the 
appearance of disease, loss of money, and- disputes;

which a king was crowned is affeoted by evil planets or aspeots, 
one should predict loss of the kingdom, if the naksatra of the

and if the naksatra of the king's caste is affeoted then one

caste of the king are as follows* 5 , the three PBrvas (PhalgnnI, 
PurvfisfidbS and Purvabhadrapada) and KrttikS are naksatras 
of the king of the brShmana class; the three TJttaras (Utters 
Phalguni, TTttarSsadha and UttarabbSdrapads) and Fusyaare 
naksatras for a king of the ksatnya caste; Eevatl, AnurSdhS, 
Maghs and Eohin!, of agricultural class; Pnnarvasu, Haste,

about the nomenclature also According to Parasara and the 
Visnudharmottaia ( 1. 87 7 ) the 4th naksatra from the naksatra 
of hirth is called Manasa A naksatra 766 is said to be affected 
( updhata ) when the Sun or Saturn occupies it or when Mars is 
retrograde in it or occults it or an eclipse ( of the Sun or Moon ) 
occurs in it or a meteor strikes it or when the moon continuously 
affects it ( by occulting or occupying its middle or goes to the 
southern part of it) The Yisnudharmottara (1 89. 1-13), 
Yogay atra IX. 13-18, and Parasara (quoted by the Adbbuta- 
sagarapp 271-274 ) prescribe certain sSnti rites for averting the 
evil effeots of the above noted nine naksatras being affected. 767 

It should be noted that in the astrology depending on 
twelve rasis and twelve bhaixts ( places or houses ) karma is the 
name given to the 10th house from the first ( just as in the case 
of naksatra astrology ) and mrtyu ( i e vinasa ) is the name of 
the 8th bkaia, 

The Mahabharata and the Ramayana contain numerous 
passages where the planets in relation to certain naksatras are 
stated to indicate misfortunes to people in general, to warring 
armies and to individuals A few examples may be cited by 
way of illustration. When in the sanguinary battle between 
Havana and Rama, the former seemed to be getting the better 
of Kama, the Ramayana states 768 'Mercury stood covering the 
Rohinl naksatra which is presided over by Frajapati and which 
is the favourite of the moon and thereby indicated evil fortune 
to people'. Similarly, it is said 'Mats stood covering the 
naksatra Visakha in the sky, which is presided overbylndra 
and Agni and which is the naksatra of the Eosalas'. In the 
MahabhSrata numerous statements are made about the position 
of the planets, the naksatr as and tithis, which it is almost

impossible to reconcile. Vide H of Dh. vol HE. pp 903-923 for 
consideration of the astronomical data in the Mahabharata. 
Here we are concerned only with the beliefs about certain omens 
and portents. Jn the Bhlsma-parva we read 70 ' a white celestial 
body standB traversing CitrS naksatra, one sees therein specially 
the destruction of the Kurus; a vary frightful comet stands 
covering Pusya-naksatra; this great gidha will bring about 
terrible evil to both armies A white blazing giaha resembling 
fire emitting smoke stands covering the bright Jyesths-naksatra 
whose presiding deity is Ihdra; a cruel comet standing between 
OitrS and SvatI afflicts Bohinl and the Sun and the Moon' 

There are several statements about Mars that are more or less 
irreconcilable 57 " For example, the Udyogaparva says "Mars 
having been retrograde in Jyestha seeks (toxeach or afflict?) 
Anurfidha presided overbyMitra, as if bringing death*; while 
Bhlsma-parva remarks 'Mars is retrogade in Magna and Jupiter 
is in Srarana and Saturn afflicts the naksatra presided over by 
Bhaga (1 e PurvaPhalgunl). About Saturn several" 1 statements 
axe made ' a refulgent and malignant planet, Saturn, affliots the 
naksatra (ruled over by PrajSpati i.e. Bohinl) and will afflict 
people more'; 'Saturn stands afflicting Bohinl'; 'Jupiter and 
Saturn are near Visakhs'. .... 

One very remarkable feature of the Mahabharata passages 
is that while they put forward .dozens of times the positions of 
the Sun, the Moon and planets in reference to naksatras, not a 
single passage gives the position of the planets in relation to 
rSsxs, the signs of the Zodiac, or week-days (such as Tuesday, 
Sunday &a.\. ' ' 

The Stbarvana Jyotisa furnishes a somewhat different 
s cheme of naksatra astrology. It says. 7 " the 10th naksatoaftom

sampatkara( bringing about prosperity), the 3rd, 12th and 2lst 
(from ' janmanaksatra) constitute the group of wpaikara

are maitra (friendly), the 9th, 18th and 27th constitute a highly 
friendly group These are nine groups ( each made up of three 
naksatras from among 27 naksatras and each one in each group 
being separated by the number 9 from the next in the same 
group). These names make a further approach to the scheme of 
twelve bhttvas ni viz. janma (which corresponds in name and 
import to tanu or lagrva ), sampal ( corresponds to the 2nd bhSva 
called dhana), karma (is same as 10th bhava), naidhana (corresponds 
to 8th bhava called vinasa or mrtyu), maitra ( corresponds to the 
4th bhava called suhrt ), lesemya ( corresponds to the name of 
the 11th bhava called aya orlsbha). The JSLtharvana-Jyotisa 
then provides at some length what should be done or not done on 
these nine groups and their constituents. The above mentioned 
words (vipatkaia, ksemya&c.) occur also in Brnad-yogaySfcrS

iLtharvana Jyotisa cannot be placed earlier than the 2nd or 1st 
century B.0 and may he a little later still But it appears that the 
present J&harvana Jyotisa only collects together the ideas then 
current and therefore the five names ( janma, sampat, naidhana, 
mitra and karma) could very well have been ourrent centuries 
before the present JS&harvana Jyotisa text. Similarly, it is 
difficult to assign an exact date .to the Visnu-dharmottara- 
purana. It is in the nature of an encyclopaedia of the then 
knowledge of several lores and its present text may be assigned 
to some period between the 4th and sixth century A. D 

From the passage of the Brhadsranyka TTpamsad (in note 
754) it would be seen how auspicious times were prescribed for 
rites to be performed by an individual The Brahmanas and 
Kalpasutras prescribed the auspicious naksatras and seasons for 
solemn Yedic sacrifices. The grhya and dhatma Biitras pre- 
scribed for domestic rites auspicious times, which were either 
the same or similar to those prescribed in the Brahmanas, Br 
Up. and the Kalpasutras. A few examples may be cited here 
The SsvalSyana (1 13 1), Apastamba(VI 14.9), Baudhayana 
(L10. 1) andParaskara(I 14) and other grhyasutoras provide 
that the rite of Pumstmma (that would produce male issue) was 
to be performed in the third month after conception on Tieya 
(Fusya) naksatra or on a day on which the moon would be m

Tisya, Hasta, Anuradha, tFttara Bhadrapada as the proper 
naksateas for pumsavana As regards caula ( tonsure ) 
£pastamba-grhya(V7 16.3} prescribes that it should be per-

The name of the naksatea may be noted, which literally 
means 'fresh wealth or new growth.* The Kausika-sufaa 
mentions 'papanaksatra' (in 46 25) and pumnaksatea (lucky 
naksatea) in 35. 2. There are varying provisions about 
marriage. The Sp. gr says that all seasons are proper for 
marriage, excepting the two months of Sisira (viz. Msgha and 
Phalguna) and excepting the last month (AsSdha) of summer, 
and all naksateas declared tobs auspicious TO The sfltra also quotes 
an ancient gatha stating that persons for choosing a girl should 
be sent out on Invakas (i e Mrgaslrsa) and then they are greeted 
with success As regards marriage the Gobhila-grhya provides 
a simple rule that it should be performed on an auspicious

one should take a maiden's hand in marriage in the northward 
passage of the sun, in the fortnight of the increasing moon,

BrEbmanas and sutras (several centuries before the Christian

CHAPTER XVI 

Muhurta 

The word ' muhurta ' occurs twice in the Bg. In the dialogue 
between the rivers and sage Visvamitra that had come to the 
confluence of the Sutudrl (modern Sutlaj) and the VipSs 
(modern Beas) occurs the following 780 'for the sake of my words 
( of your praise ) that will be followed by the offering of soma may 
you, that follow the established order (of nature), stop from 781 
flowing for a short while'. In another place the BgvedasayB 
'the opulent Indra, employing many tricks, often assumes 
different forms from off his own body, since he, being invoked by 
mantras addressed to him and upholder of the cosmic order and 
drinking soma at (usual and even ) unusual times, comes thrice 
from heaven for a short time.' In both these passages 
' muhurta * means ' a short time, a few moments '. This meaning 
of muhurta is found in the Sat Br. 18 3.17 (tan muhurtam 
dharayitva) and II. 3. %. 5 (atha pratah anasitva muhurtam 
sabhsyam-asitvapi) and in classical Sanskrit works like the 
Baghuvamsa ( Y. 58). 

There is another meaning of the word « muhurta' in Sat. Br. 
X 4. 8 18 and XII 3. a. 5 where it is said that there are fifteen 
muhurtas of the day and fifteen of the night ( L e 30 in ahoratra) 
and that in a year there are 10800 muhurtas ( 30 X 360 7SI ).

Here the word muhurta means 15th part of the day ( i e in a 
general way about two uSdikSs or ghatikas) Bg. X 189.3 
appear* ^ to contain a somewhat recondite allusion to thirty 
parts of the day and night 'by the rays of the sun thirty loca- 
tions of the day ( and night ) shine forth; a laud is offered to 
the bird ( the sun ).' The fifteen names { viz citra, ketu &c ) of 
the muhurtas of the day and 15 muhurtas of the sight ooour in 
Tai Br. HI. 584 10 1. 1-5. The Vedtaga-Jyotisa states that two 
nSdikas are equal to a muhurta (Terse 7 of VedSnga-Jyotisa of 
Eg. ) and that there is a difference of six muhurtas ( i. e 18 
ghatthas) between the longest and shortest day w Mann I 64, 
Kautilya( quoted in note 681) and several puranas( quoted in 
note 683 ) state that day and night are together equal to thirty 
muhurtas Therefore, the second meaning of muhurta from 
early Brahmana times at least was ' a period of two ghatikSs'. 
The Kausltaki-upamsad speaks of muhurtas called Yestihas * 

It appears that some centuries before the Christian era the 
15 muhuitas of the day had received names different from those 
in the Tai Br. The Baudhayana-dharma-sutra {II. 10. 26), 
ManuIV. 92 and Yaj. I 115 prescribe' 8 ' that a householder 
should get up from his bed in the Brshma-muhSrta { the last 
half watch of the night). The Br &hmamuhurta is mentioned m

Dronaparva (80.23). In the P^ghuvamsa ( V. 36 ) KjiteBa 
^stLt Aja was born on the Brahma mutarta (i eAbhijit 
S^Brahnttfe the presiding deity) and n theKumara- 
sambhava (VII. 6) he aaya that the female relatives of 
ParvatI decked her in readiness for her marriage on Maitra 
muhurta and when the Moon was in mtarS-Phalgnnl-naksatra. 
tithi (5th). Besides, in several places auspioious tithte, 
nakaatraB and muhflrtaa are mentioned in general ( e. g. Sahha 
a. 15 and %h. 4, Vana 253. 28). The Stharvana Jyotwa 
(1.6-11) names the 15 muhurtas of the day as noted below.™ 
The Muhiirtadarsana (or Vidya-madhavlya) gives almost the 
same 15 names ( except Gandharva for Visvavasu), inserts Sakra 
before Varuna and omits Sanmya and states that seven of these 
are auspicious viz. 789 Abhijit, Vairaja, Sveta, Savitra, Maitra, 
Bala and Vijaya. The 3.diparva ( 133. 6 ) states that Yudhisthira 
was born when the moon was in the naksatra presided over by 
Indra(i. e Jyestha), on the 8th muhurta called Abhijit, when 
the sun was on the meridian by day and on a tithi called 
puma( here the 5th) In the Uoyogaparva it is stated that 
apxtrohita was sent as a data of the Pandavas on Pusya- 
yoga" and Jaya muhurta (here Jaya is probably the 
same as Vijaya ). The Manusmrti says that naming the child 
should be done on the 10th or 12th day ( from birth ) on an 
auspioious tttht, muhurta and wafcso/ra. 7 * 1 It would be proper 
to assume that the auspicious muhurtas intended by Manu are 
the same as the seven mentioned in the Vidyam&dhavlya. The

840 History of Dharmaiaatra f Seo.U,Ch.XVl 

V&yupurSna enumerates the names of the 15 muhurtas in the 
day somewhat differently and also of the night m The Matsya- 
pnrSna (in chap 23 51) refeTs to two muhurtas, Abhijit and 
Baubina and mentions eight muhurtas as auspicious on which 
to begin the construction of a new house m It also speaks of 
Kutapa as the 8th muhurta (22 84 ) and states that Kutapa and 
the following four muhurtas are the home of svaiihU (i. e. 
eraddha must be begun on kutapa and completed before the 12th 
muhurta ends). It would be seen from the above that the names 
of muhurtas were given at least twice, first in the Tai. Br and 
then in the itharvana Jyotisa and the Puranas A further 
stage was probably reached when their names receded into the 
background and practically disappeared from such works as 
those of Varahamihlra and only the names of the deities presid- 
ing over the 30 muhurtas of day and night remained and the 
muhurtas came to be known by the names of the deities. 
Though Varabamihira refers to the muhurtas of day and night 
in Brhat-samhitS 42. 12 and 98 3, he does not set out their 
names in that work, but m his Brhad-Yogayatra he sets out the 
30 names of the deities presiding over the muhurtas of day and 
night as quoted in the note below. 791 Varaha remarks: what-

What should be done on muMrias of dag 841 

ever has been stated as proper for being done on certain naksa- 
traa, may be done on tithis presided over by the deitieB of those 
naksatraa and also on karanas and on muhurtas; that leads to 
success as the deity is the same. 1 * For example, if a certain 
thing is recommended for being done on Ardra naksatra, then 
it may be done also on the muhurta of Siva ( i. e. the first 
muhurta of the day) as the <feio(ff of both ( the naksatra Ardra 
and the first muhurta) is the same (viz Budra). The Atharvana 
Jyotisa ( 2. 1-11 ) and ( 3 1-6 ) dilates upon what should be done 
on the 15 muhurtas of the day. Some examples may be cited 
here : on Baudra may be done whatever is of a terrific nature; 
on Maitra should be done whatever is affeotionate or friendly; on 
SSrabhata black magic may be resorted to against enemies; 
Abhijit is proper for all desired objects and gives success in all 
undertakings; Vijaya leads to victory if one marohes on it, one 
may perform auspicious aots on it and sunh rites, onBbaga- 
muhurta one should choose abrShmana maiden for marriage and 
such a one married on Bhaga does not turn out unchaste It 
may he noticed that Patanjali ( on Vartika one on Panini V. 1. 
80 ) refers to the fact of a person being engaged for a month to 
teach one muhurta every day. 7 * 

After the vernal equinox, days become gradually longer than 
th8 night and after the autumnal equinox nights are gradually 
longer and longer than the day. As there are only thirty 
muhurtas from one sunrise to the next sunrise it is proper to say 
that a muhurta is equal to two ghatikas ( i. e 48 minutes ). But 
it is also said that there are 15 muhurtas of the day. The longest 
day in India of the Ved&nga-jyotisa locality was of 36 ghatikas 
and therefore if one insisted on the number 15 each muhurta on 
that day would be 2& ghatikas, while as the shortest day was 
24 ghatikas in length each muhurta of that day would be only 
If ghatikas. This difference in length in the case of muhurtas 
is noted by the Visnudharmottara (I 73 6-8) and by the 
Brahmandapurana ( L 2. 21. 122-123 ). The Visnudharmottara 
(i. 83 b7-73) setB out the names of the deities of the 30 muhurtas 
It appears that in ancient times it was understood that the long- 
est day gained and w as of 18 muhurtas, while the short night of 



5*2 £ttatory of MomaiSstra tSeo. JI, Cb, XVI 

that day bad only 12 mulnlrtas i e. 6 muhurtas got attached 
to the day sometimes and 6 mnhurtas got attached to the 
night sometimes when it was longest. Patafijah 7 * 7 in his 
bhasya on Vfirtika 2 at PSnini H 1. 99 mentions this This 
would be a matter of personal observation which need not 
extend beyond a few years Bat even here Prof. Neugebauer 
smells Mesopotamian influence ('Exact sciences in Antiquity' 
p 178 ). This is a characteristic example of the jaundiced eyes 
with which most Western writers look at things Indian. If the 
writer of the VedSnga Jyotisa was a native of the extreme north- 
west of India or had stayed there for some years he would hare 
easily noticed the difference between the longest day and the short- 
est day as about twelve ghatikfis, particularly' as that very verse 
of the Vedanga-jyotisa shows that water clocks were then used* 
Even illiterate people in the villages of Bombay State know 
.that the difference between the longest and shortest day in their 
villages is about six ghatikSs ( as Bombay is a little over 18 
degrees, H" Laft ). There is nothing to show that the writer of the 
Vedanga-Jyotisa was not a person who was either born in the 
extreme north-west of India or stayed there The Horth-weat 
of India was a centre of Sanskrit culture at least bIx centuries 
preceding the Christian era and Taksasils (Taxila) was a great 
University where princes came to learn ( vide Rhys Davids n 
'"Buddhist India' p 8 ). P&nini hailed from that part, it appears, 
and teaches the formation of words like Saindhava, Taksasila and 
ggteturiya as meaning a person whose ancestors lived in or who 
himself Lyed in Sindhu or in Tateasila or ****££* 
IV 8. 89-90 and 93-S4). Later writers call Panini «■%** 
7^«BhamahaVI 62-63). To suppose that a learned Indian

North Lat ; one who is to tbe north of Gsndharamay quite naturally 
Bay that the ratio is about 3 to 2. Vide G. R. 0. Report p. 225. 
Further in Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vol 8 (pp. 6-26), Prof, 
Waerden points out { at p. 18 ) that even in Babylonia the great 
omen series started from tbe primitive ratio 2 : 1 and that it was 
only later that the more accurate value 3 :2 became known. 

It has been shown so far that the word 'muhurta'hadtwo 
meanings in the ancient Vedic times, viz 'for a short time' and 
'a part equal to two ghatikSs ' As some muhflrtas of the day (of the 
duration of two ghatikSs) were declared to be auspicious, gradually 
a third meaning came to be attached to this word viz. ' time 
that is fit for the performance of an auspicious act' 738 . It would 
be Bhown later on how the medieval DharmasSstra works are 
full of muhurtas in this sense. 

In order to thoroughly understand the requirements about 
muhurta in this third sense some knowledge of the planets, 
the twelve bhaias (houses or places in a horoscope) and 
the rafts would be necessary. Before entering on a discus- 
sion of these latter matters reference must be made to tbe 
ohange that came over even the beat minds of India from 
about the 4th century B,0. It has been seen above (p. 527) how the 
star-gazer and the ganaka had come to be condemned and how 
one who was a professional astrologer (for money) had been 
looked down upon as an unworthy brahmana. All the same 
there was even about 500 or 600 B. O. a small section of people 
who looked upon the astrologer as all important, particularly to 
the king. The Gautamadharmasfitra ra provides 'the king 
should choose as his purohtla (palace priest) a brahmana endowed 
with learning, good family, eloquence, handsomeness, ( middle ) 
age (neither too young nor too old), character, and who is 
righteous in conduct and austere , the king should perform all 
(religious) acts as directed by the priest; he should respect 
(te. follow and not discard) what those who have devoted

Daiva(Fate) and PurasakSra 545 

tendencies viz. {firstly ) daiva is all powerful, ( Secondly ) Iranian 
effort is superior, (thirdly) a golden mean between the two. 
Vide H. of Dh vol 1IL pp 168-169 for discussion and for 
passages supporting all the three views. The first chapter of Brhad- 
yogayatra (BO verses) and also of the YogayatrS (22 verses) 
deal with daiva (Luck, Fate) and put usakUi a. In spite of this, from 
the king to the lowliest man, almost everyone was firmly in the 
grip of astrology and even now astrology has great influence over 
some highly educated Indians. Astrology based on horoscopes 
and dealing with individuals was called hot asSstra oijataka. By 
the time of Varahamihira even learned men had forgotten the 
origin of the word hara. The BrhaBataka says 802 'according to 
some the word hora is obtained fiom ahot atra by dropping the 
first and last syllables, that horasastra well manifests what the 
fruition of acts, good or bad, done in previous lives is going to 
be'. ItBhouldbe noticed that the Brhajjataka insists on two 
matters, viz (1) it links np the horoscopic astrology to the 
doctrines of karma and punarjanma ( re-incarnation to wipe out 
karma) and (3) the sastra holds that the horoscope to be only 
a map or plan, which indicates future trends in a man's life 
arising from what he had done in a previous life or in previous 
lives. It does not here say that the planets in a man's horoscope 
will compel him to do this or that, but it says that the horoscope 
will only intimate in what directions a man's future might he 
evolved. These principles were repeated even by late medieval 
writers. For example, Baghunandana 803 in his TTdvahatattva 
( p 125 ) agrees with the DSpika that the planets only convey 
that sins were committed in former lives, but they do not them- 
selves produce evil results and quotes the Matsyapurana in 
support that ' evil actions done in former liveB bear fruit in the 
present life in the form of diseases, distress and the death of 
those dear to one'. There was probably a third underlying 
principle viz. the stars are the temples in which the gods reside,

Importance of astrologers 547 

who have become forest hermite), who aie free from worldly 
attachments and are without property, ask questions of one who 
knows the movements of heavenly luminaries. As the night 
without a lamp or the sky without the sun, so a king without 
an astrologer (with him) wanders about (or wavers) as a 
blind man on a road. If there be no astronomer and astrologer, 
auspicious times, Mhis, naksatra3, seasons and the asanas 
( northward and southward passages of the sun ) -these would all 
become confused What a single astrologer knowing the oountry 
and time can effect, that even a thousand elephants or four 
thousand horsemen cannot accomplish.' 

The Bajamartanda provides *" 'the purohita (family or 
palace priest ), an astronomer, a councillor and an astrologer as 
the fourth - these must always be supported by the king even 
with great trouble, as in the case of women ' 

It has, however to be noted that Varahamfhira himself 
frequently gives up the principle that the horoscope is only a 
map showing tendencies and talks the language of certainty and 
of the planets causing this or that state of things. To mention 
one or two examples In Brhaj-jataka 810 he says 'the sages 
declare that a person is born from a paramour for certain { and 
not from his reputed father ) if in his horoscope Jupiter has no 
drsh ( aspect ) either on the lagna or on the moon or on the sun 
and moon that are in conjunction ( in his horoscope ) or when 
the moon is in conjunction with the sun and with a malefic planet 
(Mara or Saturn)'. In Yt 11 Br J. says ai 'the moon in conjun-

ction with a malefic planet in the 1st, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th or 12th 
house ( in a horoscope ) causes death ( of the new-born child ) if 
it is not also in conjunction with powerful Yenus, or Mercury or 
Jupiter or if it is not in aspscfc with one of those powerful three.' 
Again in Brhaj-jataka XIV 1 it is said . If the sun is in con- 
junction with another planet, he produces the following results, 
viz with the moon a man who makes (lethal ) machines or works 
in stones; with MaTs a man addicted to evil ways; with Mercury 
a man who is skilful, intelligent, famous and happy, with 
Jupiter, a cruel man or one intent on carrying out the objects of 
others; with Venus a man who makes money by going on the 
Btoge ( or in a ring for boxing &a ) or by the use of arms , with 
Saturn a roan clever in metals or different kinds of ( marohan« 
dise or ) vessels The SSrsvall very frequently says that such and 
such a position produces (janayal^ utpudayah ) as causes ( karoti 
or kvayVt &c ) certain results. Vide chap. 33 48-61. 

Before proceeding further I must point out that India was 
not singular in its firm belief in Astrology The case was the same 
throughout Europe and among the Greeks after Alexander the 
Great. It hasbeenalreadyseenfo. 521) how Babylonian astrologers 
made reports to the king about the position of the Sun, the Moon 
and the planets and what they portended for the country, the 
king and the people Vide for example, Nos 9, 15, 16, 21, SB, 33, 
52, 53, 63, 66, 67, 72, 74, 76, 86, 151, 164 from * The Beports of 
the Magicians and Astrologers of Nineveh and Babylon by B 
Campbell Thompson ( vol I and n, Luzae and Co. London, 1900). 
But horoscopic astrology was developed by them later a the

Chaldeans and Greek Science 549 

when the heavens were deemed to be nothing but a cover of the 
earth, when all the stars were ranged at small distances on the 
vault and the planets were supposed to move in the midst of stara 
like shepherds inspecting their flocks. Greek science having ext- 
ended the world, the influence of stars moved back at enormous 
distances was not a postulate of common sense' (vide note 748 
above }. Herodotus 813 (H. 82) refers to a peculiar practice of the 
Egyptians to regard each month and day as sacred to some deity, 
and says how from the day of a man's birth they determined his 
fortune, character and the manner of his death. But this has no 
reference to horoscopio Astrology. The Egyptians knew nothing 
about the Zodiac before tiie Alexandrian age There is no trace of 
astrology in early Greek astronomical writere and it appears 
that the Greeks got it from Babylon 813 after Alexan der conquered 
Babylon, when teachers of astrology began to arrive in Greece. 
The Hellenistic mind was soon completely captivated by astro- 
logy. Before the advent of astrology the Greeks tried to peep 
into the future by oracles, interpretation of dreams and inspec- 
tion of the entrails and livers of sacrificed animals, from the 
flight and cries of birds and from prodigies and unusual 
occurrences such as eclipses, comets and meteors BerossUB a4 ,

Antioehus ISoter (280-261 B C.) an elaborate work on Baby- 
lonian and Chaldean history and it was he who was instrumental 
in spreading Babylonian astrology in Greece by first introducing 
it in his school at Cos, an island not far from the south-western 
corner of Asia Minor. From Greece astrology spread to Borne 
about the 2nd century B.O The signs of the Zodiac became 
house-hold words in Greece and Rome. Stoics like Po3idonins

Diodonis 816 Sioulus (a contemporary of Augustus of Borne)

Capricornus and of the protective power of Jove and about bale- 
ful Saturn in his horoscope. Strabo, 818 who died in 24 A D«

nomy and the casting of horoscopes. Petronius (1st century

vidua! and Babylonian astrology was a priestly business while 

in Greece the astrologers were laymen. Astrology became a 

study of international importance in Europe and was cultivated 

in the Universities as a subject of real value throughout Europe 

by the side of astronomy. Its great vogue among even well 

educated people was due to its apparent soientifio structure 

with its houses, planets, twelve signs and so forth Allen 

(in 'Star-crossed Renaissance' Preface p. VHI) says that 

everybody in the Renaissance period in the West believed to, 

some extent in astrology. In ' Stara above us ' by Prof. E. Zinner, 

Tyeho Brahe is quoted as saying that he prepared every 

year an astrological foreoast for his king (p. 76). Even 

Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler practised astrology 

themselves or countenanced its practioe. Bacon was 

prepared to say that there was no fatal necessity in the stars, 

but they rather incline than compel Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos 

reigned supreme for about 1400 years and is even now a work 

of great authority for those who believe in astrology. It may 

interest the reader to know that the great German poet, 

dramatist and philosopher, Goethe 8 » (1749-1832), begins his 

Memoirs by mentioning the aspeots of planets at his birth. 

Two circumstances tended to weaken the influence of astro- 
logy in Europe, viz. the giving up of the geocentric theory in 
favour of the heliooenteio theory and the vast additions to 
astronomical knowledge made during the last two centuries. 
But it should not be supposed that astrology has become defunct 
in the West or T7. S. A. The immense strain and distress caused 
by the two world wars provided a powerful fillip for the Bpread 
and influence of astrology. Even in papers the circulation 
of which runs into millions there is a regular astrological feature 
every day or every week, which tells people what the stars 
portend for twelve groups of the world's population in the week

itBelf is due to astrological beliefs and words like ' aspect \ 
'conjunction', 'ascendant', 'retrograde* are all due to the 
language of astrology. 

In support of Astrology Ptolemy (in Tetrabiblos, 1.2) puts 
forward certain arguments. The Sun not only affects every- 
thing on the earth by the change of season, but by its daily 
revolutions furnishes heat, moisture, dryness and cold in regular 
order. The Moon, the nearest heavenly body to the earth, 
causes the seas to change their tides with its own rising and 
Betting times, and plants and animals wholly or partly wax and 
wane with the moon. The planets often signify hot, windy and 
snowy conditions of the air and affect mundane things. The 
changes of seasons and winds are understood even by very 
ignorant men and by some dumb animals. Sailors know the 
special signs of storms and winds that arise periodically by 
reason of the aspects of the sun, moon and planets. But because 
sometimes sailors err, no one says that there is no science of 
navigation. Therefore, a sufficiently observant man wise 
enough to know accurately the movements of the sun, moon and 
planets can predict whether the weather will be warmer or BS 
wetter. Why can he not, with respect to an individual, perceive 
the general quality of his temperament from the surroundings at 
the time of his birth, as for example that he would be Buoh and 
such in body and mind? Ptolemy then condemns impostors 
who do not study the science but deceive common and 
trusting people and fill their pookstB. He further points 
out that the nativity alone is not the sole basis of 
judging a person's future, that the country of birth, the

race to which lie belongs, the customs of the people among 
whom he Is born, the way in which he is reared, the age in 
which he lives have also to be considered, all which will contri- 
bute materially to the proper prediction, other things being 
equal. In 17.10 he points out that if one looks only at the 
horoscope without paying attention to nationality, manners and 
customs and the like he may call an Ethiopian fair' 2 *' of 
complexion and having straight hair and a German a dark- 
skinned person and endowed with woolly hair or not knowing the 
peculiar customs say that an Italian whose horoscope is being 
examined may marry his sister fas ancient Egyptians did) or that 
the man may marry his mother ( as only Persians did ) Vide 
Tetaabiblos IV". 10 p. 439 (Loeb. ol library). In I. 3 Ptolemy 
argues that astrology is not only possible but is beneficial, 
because fore-warned is fore-armed. It is a very far cry to argue 
from the undoubted influence of the Sun and the Moon on 
mundane matters, such as heat and cold, rains, storms and 
droughts that the particular positions and aspects of the Sun, 
Moon and planets at the time of birth or conception (as some 
bold ) are throughout an individual's life ( it may be for a day or 
8 hundred years ) the dominating factor ( if not the sole factor 
as many astrologers say) governing his conduct, character, 
family affairs and destiny. The reasoning of Ptolemy, though

Astrologers to consider country, caste, family 555 

Indian works also require the astrologer to consider the 
easterns of thB country and of the people. The EajamSrtanda 82 * 
says ' First the usages of people most he considered; whatever is 
firmly established in the several countries, that alone mast he 
followed; the learned give up what is hateful to the people; 
therefore an astrologer should proceed along the people's way. 
A learned man Bhould never go against the inclinations of the 
family ( to which the person belongs ) and of the country' ; and 
then he gives examples of the astrological requirements as regards 
planets in the case of marriages in several countries. The general 
astrology about calamities or occurrences that affect all people 
spoken of by Ptolemy would fall under £akha or Samlitta in the 
narrower BenBe ( vide notes 688 and 690 ) Some important and 
interesting conclusions of Ptolemy may be noted here. 

Ptolemy speaks of beneficent and malefic planets (16), of 
masculine and feminine planets ( 1.6 }, of diurnal and noctu- 
rnal (in Sanskrit dvnabah and miabali) planets (I. 7), 
(1. 1% ) masculine and feminine rasis ( BignB ), the aspects of the 
signs ( X 13 ) viz. opposition ( 180 degrees ), trine (120°), quartile 
( 90" ) and sextile ( 60" ), of the houses ( svagrhaa in Sanskrit ) of 
the planets. In Book It he divides the inhabited world into 
quarters equal in number to the triangular formations of the 
signs of the zodiac and after a disquisition which would be 
regarded by modern men as casuistical and practically unintel- 
ligible, Ptolemy sets forth a list of over seventy countries ( then 
known ), assigning to each sign some countries. For example, 
to Aries he assigns Britain, Gaul, Germania, Bastarnia, Syria, 
Palestine, Judaea and one more; to Capricorn he assigns India, 
Ariana, Gedrosia, Thrace, Macedonia, IDyria. The whole of 
America, almost the whole of Africa ( except the northern part ), 
Indonesia and Australia and the other neighbouring lands are 
not considered by Ptolemy at all, because these were unknown 
then. He remarks at the end of 3X 3 that as to metropolitan 
cities they should be treated like individuals and their nativity 
is to be cast by taking the time of the foundation 826 of the city

dation is not known then the nativity of the founder or of the 
king is to be taken. 

A few important points of agreement and disagreement 
between Sanskrit astrological works and Ptolemy will be set out 
later on. 

The literature on muhurta (auspicious time for undertaking 
anything) is extensive. Almost all works on Ksla mentioned 
above such as BemSdri on XSla, the Kala-mSdhava, Kfilatattva- 
vfvecana, Mraayasindhu are in a way works on muhBrta, since 
they discuss the proper times for performing the samskSras and 
religions rites. Among the works the names of which begin 
with the word muhurta are : Muhartakalpadruma (published by 
2?im Press, Bombay) composed by Vitthala Dlksita in 16Z8 A.D. ;

are mss. ( in Bombay Asiatic Society's Library ). In this section 
on muhurtas reliance has been placed mainly on the three 
printed works along with the Jyotisaratnamala of Srlpati (about 
1039 A.D.), the KajamSrtanda of Bhoja (ms in B. O. R.I., 
Poona) and the other works on ESla. Among the woxta 
described as especially dealing with muhnrtas, the most elabo- 
rate are the Muhnrta-ointamani ( containing about 480 verses 
with a very exhaustive commentary) and the Muhfiitadarsana 
(with about 600 veraes) and also a very elaborate commentary. 
Itwouia not be possible to deal with all matters contained 
in these works. The MuhurtamSrtanda ( containing 161 verses ) 
follows a middle course. 'According to it the subjects dealt 
with in it are briefly as follows :—what positions and aspects 
of the planets, what yogas, what tithis, naksatras, months and 
conditions of the family and of the mind should be avoided in 
the case of iitbha (auspicious) actions; the proper times for 
somskSras, such as garbhadhana, pumsaoana,3atdkarma, pieroing 
the infant's ear, caula, upanatjana, the end of the period of 
Vedio study; topics connected with marriage (this takes up 55 
veraes i. e. a little over one-third of the entire work ) ; times tat 
kindling sacred domestic fire (grhyagni); times for construction 
of a house and for first entrance into it; the proper times for 
starting on a journey or marching against an enemy king; 
auspicious and inauspicious sakunas (omens or prognostications), 
times for king's coronation, for wearing of rich clothes and 
ornaments and for agricultural operations, for sale and purchase 
of animals ( such as cattle, horses ), for bath with sesame and 
myrobalan, for finding lost articles, for constructing wells and 
tanke . times when Vedic study should be stopped ( anadhySya ) 
for long or temporarily; the results of a lizard or chameleon 
-falling on one's body; what planet is inauspicious or auspicious 
in which sign from the sign of one'B birth; the punyakala of

SankrSntis. It may be mentioned that many of the provisions 
about auspicious aspects of planets, about upanayana and 
marriage, construction of and first entrance into a bouse, sakunas 
about the fall of lizards and chameleons were observed in the 
author's boyhood and are still observed by many, though there 
ia gradually an increasing looseness of observance in these 
matters. 

It should be noted that even as to satomoa VarSha-mihira 
puts forward the principle that it is the fruition of actions, good 
or evil, done in previous lives by men, that is manifested by 
sakunas for those who start on a journey or invasion. •» 

How people had become almost crazy with the idea of find- 
ing out a muhvata for everything from shaving, wearing a new 
garment to such solemn matters as marriage is well illustrated 
by the provision of a muhurta for a theft in the Muhfirta- 
muktavali, viz the act of thieving succeeds when done on the 
naksatrasisless, Mrgasiras, Bharanl. Svati, Dhanisths, Oitaa

Classification qf naksaira* 559 

BrhadSranyaka Upanisad quoted above ( in note 754 ), it is clear 
that the naksatras had vary early ( i. e. about 1000 B. 0. at least ) 
been classified as punya ( auspioious ) and pUpa ( inauspicious } 
asd into male and female. The YedSngajyotisa ( Yajusa ) gives 
a classification of naksatras into ugra and fe-Sra. 829 The 
naksatras are farther classified in the Brhat-samhita ( chap. 97. 
6-11 ) into dhruva ( or sthira = fixed ), tlksna ( or daruna ), ugra 
( or krura ), ksipra ( or laghu ), mrdu ( or maitra ), mrdutlfcsna 
( or ssdhsrana or misra ), cara ( or cala ). aa 

The Br. S. ( 97. 6-11 ) states that on Dhruva naksatras the 
coronation of a king, santi (propitiatory rite for averting impen- 
ding evil or calamity ), planting of trees, foundation of a city, 
charitable acts, sowing seeds, and other permanent acts should 
be done; on tlksna naksatras succeed attempts to harm, the 
acquisition of mantra ( mystic verse or formula ), raising ghosts, 
arrest (of a person), beating, separating (two friends or) relation- 
snips ; ugra naksatras are to be used for success in extermination, 
destruction of another's property, cheating, arrest, poisoning, 
incendiarism, striking with a weapon, killing; ksipra (or laghu) 
naksatras are declared as leading to success in sales, in making 
love, in the acquisition of knowledge, decoration, arts, crafts 
(such as carpentry), medicines, journeys; the mrdu naksatras 
are beneficial in securing friends, sexual affairs, clothes, orna- 
ments, auspioious ceremonies (marriage, upanayana &a ) and 
Binging; the mrdu-tlksna (or aSdhSrana) naksatras produce 
mixed results ( on which mild or fierce acts may be done); the 
cara naksatras are beneficial in doing fleeting actions The 
MuhQrta-martanda provides that wise men engage in actions 
similar to the names of the groups of naksatras for attaining 
success. It should he noticed that some works like the Jyotisa- 
ratnamate < HI. 9 ) and the Muhurta-cintSmani ( H. 2-8 ) hold 
that Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Siiday, 
Saturday are respectively dhruva, cara, ugra, misra, laghu,

verses are translated for sample: 83 * a person born on ibvinla 
is fond of ornaments, is handsome, has a prepossessing appear' 
anoe, & clever ( in all things ) and intelligent; one bom on 
Bharanfs is of firm resolve, truthful, free from disease, olever 
and free from worry; one horn on Krttikfig is a heavy eater, 
fond of other's wives, impatient, famous; one born on Bdhinl 
is truthful, pure, of agreeable speech, of resolute intellect and 
is handsome. The BSjamSrtanda in verses 16-40 sets out 
the synonyms of 27 naksatras which include the names of the 
lords of the naksatras and synonyms of the lords of naksatras. 
The JyotisaratnamalS, Bhujabala and M Q 2. 28-S3 divide 88 
naksatras (including Abhfrit) into four groups 835 of seven 
each, called 'andhaksa* ( blind X 'mandaksa' (of dim sight), 
"madhyShsa* ( of medium sight ) and 'svaksa' (of good Bight) and 
state that property stolen ou 'andhaksa' naksatras maybe recove- 
red quickly, stolen on 'mandaksa* naksatras after effort, stolen on 
'madhyaksa' (there is no recovery but) the owner may hear that 
it has been taken to a distant plaoe by the thief; stolen on 'svaksa' 
or 'sulocana* the owner would not recover it nor even hear about 
its whereabouts. The Brhat*amhifc3 (chap. 14) has already 
been referred to (on p. 530) in connection with the provinces of 
India governed by nine groups of naksatras (three naksatras in 
each group) and chapter 15 of the same (1-27) sets out what 
substances are governed by the 27 naksatras from Krttikft 
toBharanl 83 * One verse is translated as a specimen: under 
Zrttikas are white flowers, those who have consecrated the Vedio 
fires, those who know Vedio mantras, sntras and bbasyas 
(commentaries), officers over mines (or stores), barbere, 
brShmanas, purohtfo, astrologers, potters.

of 27) form partof Timelooked upon as a jWKaa (Person). This is

Naksatras as ttntbs of Prcpapati §61 

an extension of a very old conception. The Tai Br. says; 
'Prajapati has Hasta-naksatra as his hand, Cifcra as his head, 
Nistya (i e SvatI) as his heart, the two stars of Visakha as the 
thighs, Anuradhas as his stability (or support) This is indeed 
Prajapati in the form of groups of naksatras* •*. 

From the above it would be noticed that a naksatra astro- 
logy apart from therasi astrology bad bean thoroughly developed 
in India while Ptolemy is hardly concerned with the naksatras, 
but concentrates only on rasis. 

The twelve rCisu, are to be found in the Zodiacal belt ( or 
circle), each extends over 2 J naksatras i e Mesa extends over 
AsvinI, Bharani and J of Krttika, Vrsabha extends over J of 
Krttika, whole of Bohinl and half of Mrgaslrsa and so on. These 
twelve rasis from Mesa are identified respectively with the 
following Iimb3 of the Kalapurusa f3Sa viz. the head (Mesa), 
mouth (Vrsabha), chest, heart, stomach, waist, the abdomen 
(between the navel and the private parts), the private parts, the 
pair of thighs, the pair of knees, the two shanks, the two feet. 
Varaha adds that the words rasi, ksetra, grna, rksa, bha and 
bhaiana are used as synonyms in Jataka The purpose of the 
identification of rasis with the limbs of Kala put forward by 
astrological works is that if a malefic planet occupies in a 
person's horoscope a certain rasi, he is adversely affected in that 
limb of his body to which the rasi corresponds among the limbs 
of Kala, but if a beneficent planet occupies at birth a rasi, then 
the person prospers as to the corresponding limb This is 
succintly put by the SSravall (10. 5-6 ) The twelve rasis with

Names of fasts and their synonyms 563 

It should be noted that the list of synonyms is not exhaustive ; 
other words with the same meaning are often employed. For 
example, for Simha, Mrgaraja may be used or for Mlna the word 
prthuroman may be need. The words in italics are deemed by 
Weber and many others as borrowings from or Sanskrit adapta- 
tions of Greek words It may be admitted that most of them 
bear a striking resemblance to Greek names of rasis Pathona 
should be Pathena to correspond with the Greek word. There is 
no reason why kullra should be regarded as a Greek word Kern 
( preface to Br S. p. 29 ) thinks that it is a pure Sanskrit word 
There is no Greek woTd corresponding to Kullra in Ptolemy. 
The word Karka or Karkin appears to mean ' white ' and occurs 
as early as in Atharvaveda IV 38. 6-7 All that the Brhawataka 
(IS) means is that there are other words like knya used for the 
twelve rasis in otheT works VaTahamihira frequently refers 
to the views of the Yavanas and sometimes differs from them. 
It has been shown by me in my paper on 'Yavanesvara and 
Utpala * ( in J of Bombay Asiatic Society, vol 30, pp. 1-8 ) that 
there is a Sanskrit work on astrology called Yavana-jStaka of 
about 4000 verses composed by a king of the Yavanas called 
Sphujidhvaja and another Vrddhayavanajataka also in several 
thousand verses by Mlnaraja who styles himself the overlord of 
Yavanas I cannot agree with Prof Sen-Gupta ( 'Ancient Indian 
Chronology ' p 99 } that words like Mesa and Vrsabha in verses 
like Rg L 51. 1 (abhi tyam mesam) refer to rasis, when he himself 
had to concede that he could not find the other ten in the Rg

The appearance of the i&sis is briefly described by the 
Brhajjataka 837 1. 5 and explained by TTfcpala as follows: (Tie 
sign Mlna i e Pisces ) appears as two fishes ( each facing the 
tail of the other ), Kumbha appears as a man carrying an empty 
jar placed on his shoulder, the sign of Gemini is represented as 
a man carrying a mace and a woman holding a late, the sign of 
Sagittarius is a man with a bow whose legs are like those of a 
horse, the sign Capricorn is a crocodile with the face of a deer, 
sign of Libra is a person holding scales, the sign Virgo is 
represented by a maiden in a boat with an ear of corn in one 
hand and fire in the other; the remaining signs are similar ( in 
form J to the objects indicated by their names and all signs reside 
in places appropriate to their names For more detailed descrip- 
tions, vide the twelve verses quoted from Yavanesvaraby Utgsala 
which I have o^ioted and translated in my paper in the Journal 
of the Bombay Asiatic Society voL 30 parts 1 ana 2 pp 1-7 and

insects ) and the remaining five resemble human beings with 
special characteristics in each case These rSsi names have 
more or less the same meanings in Babylonia, 839 in Europe inclu- 
ding Greece and in India But it should not be supposed that 
everywhere the several groups of stars were imagined to be 
identical with the figures of the same animals or of human beings. 
In China for instance, the twelve xasis are rat, ox, tiger, hare, 
dragon, serpent, horse, sheep, monkey, hen, dog and pig{ Encyclo- 
paedia Americana, voL 89 under the word ' zodiac' and $Tew Funk 
and Wagnall's Encyclopaedia vol 36 under 'Zodiac') 8390 . It is 
further stated that these are still found in some parts of Asia, 
in Japan and also among the remains of the Aztec race in 
America There are many who deny that except for a few signs 
(like the Scorpion) there is hardly any very striking similarity 
between the twelve groups of constellations called Aries &c. and 
the natural appearance of the objects denoted by the twelve 
names 8 *° The origin of the names assigned to Zodiacal signs is 
unknown The zodiacal signs named Mesa, Yrsabha &. are 
purely imaginary, are mere subjective configurations of stars 
which appear to be in one plane and which appear to certain 
persons to possess somehow the outline of a scorpion or a 
lion which are, as modern astronomy tells us, situated at 
enormous distances (light years as they are called) from each 
other. The same constellation is often given different names; 
e g. the constellation called Great Bear was called by Thales 
'the wain' (waggon drawn by horses) The twelve Zodiacal 
signs are clearly absent from the sacred astronomy of Egypt 841 
and the Egyptians knew nothing of the Zodiac before the

566 History of Dharnuziastra [Sec H, Gh. XVI 

Alezandrian age and very few Zodiacs are older than the Boman 
times Since Assyxiologists began to reveal the astronomical 
knowledge in the valley of the Euphrates, the Babvlonian 
origin of the Zodiac has beBn taken for granted by "almost 
ali^ scholars sa The dissenting voice is that of E J. Webb 
in 'Names of stars * SB who very strenuously argues against the 
Babylonian origin of the Zodiacal signs and holds that the Zodiac 
as we know it is a Greek invention and that deostratus who 
according to Pliny was concerned in forming it lived about 530 
B. G. In spite of the vehemence of Webb's arguments, in my 
humble opinion, he is far from convincing and for the present at 
least the Babylonian origin of the Zodiacal signs has to be 
accepted Thepassage of Pliny on which "Webb relies is differently 
understood by Prof. J K. Forheringham. SM The latest work of 
Barton on ' History of Science ' (1953) holds that the Zodiac had 
been distinguished by Babylonian astronomers a thousand years 
before deostratus and all that deostratus probably did was to 
divide those constellations into twelve equal lengths of the 
ecliptic i e. the twelve signs of the Zodiac A somewhat amusing 
argument has been advanced by Hickey ■ H that the fact that there 
are in the sky no animals (figures) suggestive of Egypt or India 
such as the hippopotamus and the elephant seems to rule out 
those countries as sources Is there any logical necessity that 
certain animals must be introduced in a system of Zodiacal signs 
if that system originated in a certain country that may be the 
home of dozens of wild and tame animals ? Are all the principal 
animals of Mesopotamia or of Greece included in theseven animals 
that figure as signs, if one of the above two was the origin

of the praaont Zodiacal signs? All the seven animals in the 
Zodiac are found in abundance in India even now, while some 
of them may not be found in the present day Greece or Baby- 
lonia. At present I am only concerned to say that out of the 
three ancient lands, viz Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece, 
Mesopotamia has the greatest claims to be regarded as the 
source of the Zodiacal signs. The oase of India will be dealt 
with a little later on

lords of the four main direotions ( east &o. ) The above

The Brhajj&taka compresses these dotails in J. 10-11 and 
Utpola explains the purpose of some of these technical terms. 
YfitrS ( invasion ) undertaken on slrsodaya rSsis yields the 
desired result but if undertaken on prsthodaya ritsis there is 
failure and one's army is routed. Those bom on krura Bigns

nature and those born on dvisvabhava Bigus are of mixed chara- 
cter. The knowledge of the signs as lords of quarters is useful 
in finding out the direction where a person who Btolo something 
on a particular sign could be found or the stolen article could

and 391 for slightly varying enumeration 

Br J. ( chap 17. 1-12 ) sets out the characteristics of persons 
born when the Moon wbb in Mesa and the following rSsis and 
remarks at the end ( in verse 13 ) that the results described will 
come out fully if the moon, the rasi it occupies and the lord of 
that rSsi are powerful. In Br. J. I 19 it is said that two-footed 
rasis ( mithuna, kanya, tula, kumbha and forepart of dhanus ) are 
powerful by day if they be in kendia; four-footed rSsis ( mesa, 
vrsa, simha, makara forepart and dhanus latter part ) are power- 
ful at night in kendra position and the rest i. e. watery Bigns 
and insect signs (kultra, vrsoika, mlna and latter part of 
makara ) are powerful at twilight, when in kendra position. Br. 
J 18. 20 provides that similar results (as in chap 17) follow if 
a person is born when the lagna at his birth is mesa or any one 
of the other rasis. 

Planets, their relations to the rasis and their conjoint influ- 
ence will now be briefly indicated. We saw above (pp. 493-495 ) 
that in tiie Yedic SamhitSs and Brahmanas express references to 
planets other than Jupiter are almost absent, that in some Vedio 
verses five planets and Venus ( as Vena ) appear to be referred to. 
SvarbhSnu, the son of an asura, is said to have struck the sun 
with darkness ( i e. caused an eclipse ) m Rg V. 40. 5, 6, 8, 9. 
In the Ghandogya Upanisad the soul that has acgaired' true' 
knowledge is said to shake off the body after oasting off all evil 
like a horse (that casts off dust by) shaking his hair (mane 
and tail ) or like the moon becoming free from the mouth of 
Bfibu.8» The Maitr&yanl Upanisad mentions Sani, Rahu 
( ascending node ) and Ketu ( descending node ) M » But hardly 
anything is said about the astrological significance of planets 
in the ancient Vedic Literature In the Mahabharata there are 
plenty of references to the evil influence of planets, but that is 
restricted to naksatras. Both Rahu and Ketu are said in 
Karnaparva to rise in the sky for ( i. e. portending ) the destruc- 
tion of the world *» Kautilya offers the curious information 
that a foreknowledge of rainfall can be had from the position, 
the motion and the garbhMhTma of Jupiter, from the rising 
setting and motion of Venus and from the natural and unnatural

Observations of planets by the Babylonians go back to 
2nd millennium B 0. Venus was the first to be studied Tables 
about Venus based on observations are found from 1921-190l*» 
B G, , Jupiter and Mars were also observed. Jupiter was held to 
be normally favourable when he shone brightly or followed the 
moon, while Mars was the planet of ill-luok, but, if Mars shone 
weakly or disappeared, its evil influence disappeared. Saturn as 
its name indicates ('firm standing one*) was regarded mostly a 
planet of good luck Various favourable prognostications were 
made about a child, according as the planets like the Moon, Venus 
or Jupiter were rising or unfavourable prognostications were 
made if Mars was rising or if Jupiter or Venus were setting K! 
Each planet received a variety of names in the astronomical 
texts of Babylonia The .teaching that every planet has 
its exaltation i. e the strongest pitch of its might and influence 
when in a particular Bign goes back to ancient Babylonia. M 
The arrangements of the order of planets differed at different 
times. Planet comes from a Greek word meaning ' a wanderer ' 
and the word was applied to the planets because as compared 
with the stars they appeared to wander in different ways and at

different times e% In modern times there are three more planets, 
viz. Uranus, Neptune and Pluto discovered respectively in 1781, 
1846 and 1930 A. D 855 Bouche Leoleroq mentions that modern 
astrologers asserted that Chaldeans saw Uranus and Neptune 
and three other planets (Juno, Vulcan and Fluto), when they had 
good eyes (p S73 note 2 of L" Astrologie Grecque). 

The Br. J. (II 2-3), SarSvall (IV. 10-11) and RajamSrtanda 
(verses 8-15) set out the various names for the sun, the moon 
and the other seven planets They are specified in the note 835 

8S4. C. V Mad can on 'Babylonian Astrology and its relation to the Old 
Testament' (United Church Publishing House, Toronto) p 27, Prof 
Neugebauer in E. S A p 162 ( for arrangements of planets in cuneiform 
texts in Selencid period and in Greek horoscopes ). In the Selencid period the 
standard arrangement was Jnpiter — Venus — Mercury — Saturn — Mars. Ordinary 
arrangement m Creek horoscopes is Snn, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Vends, 
Mercury. For the planetary -week the arrangement in Greece is said to he 
Saturn-Inpiter-Mars-San-Venns-Mercury-Moon On p 163 Prof Neugebauer 
thinks that Hindu arrangement of planets is obviously Greek in origin for 
two reasons, as it is based on the arrangement according to distance from the 
earth and also on a division of days into 24 hoars, which is not Babylonian 
but Hellenistic and ultimately of Egyptian origin In this latter he can be said 
to be wrong, as a similar arrangement of week dajs can be arrived at by 
relying on the 60 ghatika system of India. We saw above that hot a in 
Indian astrology has three meanings, viz JStaka, lagna and half a sign, but 
the very early Sanskrit astrological terts at least do not appear to employ the 
■word hora in the sense of 'honr' or &th part of the -whole day or £jth part 
of the day Any, one who asserts that the arrangement of week daj s is copied 
from the Greeks must prove two things, (l) the definite time when the Greeks 
hit upon the particular arrangement of planets for purposes of week-days and 
(2) the borrowing people had definitely not arrived at the same arrangement 
before the Greeks Prof Nengebaner, so far as I can see, offers hardly any ei i- 
dence on any of these two matters beyond mere assertions and conjectures. It 
has further to be remembered that Albernni (Saohau, \ol. L. p. 343) states that 
nobody in India uses the hours except the astrologers, for they speak of the 
dominants oE the hours The 30muhurtas of ahatatra are much older than 
the Satapatha Br. and it was easy to divide a muhurta into two nadis or 
ghatikas as the ArthaSstra does (I 19 p, 37 ' Nalikabhiraharastadha ratrim ca 
vibhajeOandPuranashkcVisnuVI. 3. 6-4 do. There is hardly anything in 
the last Sanskrit Literature (of ancient or medieval times) to show that 
common people or writers ( not being astronomers or astrologers ) employed 
the method of 24 hours of the day.

Greek name for toe moon occurs in these or other works and 
I am not convinced that JIva is a Greek word or adaptation 
of a Greek word The word Jlva occurs in the Bgveda itself in 
many places (as in Bg. I 16430.X 1837) and means 'living 
being, an individual' and m Obfindogya Upanisad VI 3 2 it 
means ' individnal soul '. When Brhaspati came to be regarded 
as the most prominent of planets and was said to preside over 
knowledge and happiness (as m Br. J. II 1 «Jivo jasna-sukham') 
he oame to be regaxded>as the very life of beings and was called 
Jlva The Sfiravall (X 116) says that Brhaspati is the life of men 
(Brhaspatir-nrnam jlvah ). In Bhujabala it is said 'what will all 
the planets do to him in whose horoscope Jupiter is intend* a

The Br. J. and SSravall provide that further synonyms may he 
derived from popular usage. 

In the following some characteristics of the planets (based 
on Br. J IL5-7) are brought together, viz. the colour ruled by 
each, the lords of each, the direction, element, Veda and class 
(brShmana, ksatriya &o ) dominated by each and whether they 
are beneficent ox malefic.

SW History of Dhormaiaska [ Sea H, Oh, XVI 

gods that rule the eight directions and the planets that rule 
thorn. Indra, Agm, Yama, ffirrti, Varana, Vfiyu, Tafcsa 
(Kuberaj and Siva are the lords of the eight directions from 
East to North-East, while the same directions are governed by 
planets as in the above table. 

The purpose for these classifications is explained as follows • 
As regards colours ruled by planets, they are useful in indicat- 
ing the colour of the thing lost by or stolen from a man and the 
colour of the flowers with which the planets are to be worshipped , 
the lords of the planets are to he worshipped along with the 
planets m qiaJiapujB; the direction in which a king should 
march on an invasion is indicated by planets that rule the 
directions; according as beneficent or malefic planets are power- 
ful in the horoscope, the character of the person concerned is 
indicated as good or bad The Br J. IX. 7 further provides 
that the Moon, the Sun and Jupiter are lords of saltoa-guna, 
Mercury and Venus of wjo-qumt, Mars and saturn of tamoguva. 
TTtpala points out that Varaha differs from Yavanesvara, who 
regards the Sun, Mars and Jupiter as Sattvika, the Moon and 
Yenus as full of rajoguna, Saturn as having tamoguna and 
Mercury taking on the character of the planet with which it is 
in conjunction.' 5 * 1 Bahu is the ascending node or the point where 
the orbit of the moon intersects the ecliptic in passing northwards, 
Br. J. (II 8-11) and Laghujataka II 13-19 describe the form and 
appearance of the planets from the Sun to Saturn, giving full 
rein to association of ideas, imagination and to personification 
of them. For illustration, I translate one verse ( 10 ) 'Jupiter 859 
has a large body, his hair and eyes are brownish in colour, 
he has eminent intellect and has a phlegmatic constitution; 
Yenus is given to pleasures, has handsome body and pretty eyes, 
has wind and phlegm in his constitution and black hut curling 
hair on his head ' Another table based on Br. J II. "11, 12, 14

It was said that if Jupiter was in his own house ( i. e. 
DhanusorMlna), then Jupiter also ruled over gold. 861 The 
object of assigning these was practical, viz the astrologer could 
judge of the place of birth if the planet was powerful or of the 
place of the thief or, if a question were put about the food which 
one invited to a dinner may be served with, the powerful 
planet would suggest the kind of food. 

The Br. J. ( H, 5 ) states that the Sun, Mars and Jupiter are 
masculine, the Moon and Venus feminine, while Mercury and 
Saturn are neuter or common {nxpuihsalta ). Here Tetrabiblos 
differs ( I 6 ), as it regards Saturn as masculine. Ace. to Br. J. 
n 21 the Moon, Mars and Saturn are nocturnal (powerful at 
night), the Sun, Jupiter and Venus are diurnal (powerful by 
day) and Mercury is common (both diurnal and nocturnal) 
The Tetrabiblos differs ( L 7 ) by making Venus nocturnal and 
Saturn diurnal

The figures under signs of exaltation and depression are the 
avisos (degrees) respectively of paiamocen and paromontca. 
The explanation offered by Yavanajstaka of Spnuiidhvaja and 
the Vrddhayavana-jataka of Mlnaraja is that the sign of Leo 
was assigned to the Sun as his honse because it is the most 
powerful sign and Cancer ( a watery sign } was assigned to the 
Moon, and the Sun and the Moon each gave one sign out of the 
remaining to the other five planets vre KanyS, Tult, Vrscika, 
Dhanus and Makara were given by the Sun to Mercury, Venus, 
Mars, Jupiter and Saturn ( arranged according to distance ) and 
the Moon gave to flie same five planets one each of the rSs» of 
Mithuna, Vrsabha, Mesa, M5na and Kumbha <**5««ff

Ptolemy ort svagrhas 577 

for the verses of MSnaraja and p 7 for translation) Tetrabiblos 
L 17 practically gives a similar explanation about houses 
( svagrhas) and I 19 agrees with Br. J I IS about the exaltation 
and depression signs. Ptolemy does not give the degrees (of 
paramocca and paramanlca 861 ). 

That rasi that is occupied by its own lord or has an aspect 
( drsti ) of Its lord or is occupied by Mercury or Jupiter or has 
an aspect with them is powerful 861 if it be not occupied by any 
one or more of the remaining planets or has no aspect with any 
one of the rest There is a further provision that Scorpion if it 
is in the 7th house is powerful, the human signs ( Mitbuna, 
Kanya, Tula, the forepart of Dhanus and Kumbha } are powerful 
in the lagna, the watery signs (Kaikata, Mlna, latter half 
of Makara) are powerful if they occupy the 4th house and 
the quadrupeds (Mesa, Vrsa, Simha, latter half of Dhanus, 
and the forepart of Makara ) are powerful in the 10th house 
(Br J. 1 17.) 

The natural powerfulness of planets is in the following 
order: Saturn, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, the 
Sun, each succeeding one is more powerful than each preceding 
one; if the power of any two or more is equal in other respects, 
then one has to take into consideration this natural powerfulness 
for determining which is more powerful *** 

The astrological houses in a horoscope are twelve and each 
is expressed by various synonyms, many of which indicate 
what particular matters are to be judged from the state of that 
house. They are enumerated in Br. J. I. 15-19, I>aghuj3taka

designations, without indicating the special function of the 
house, such as horS, dusoikya, mesurana, nhpha, raturasra, tae 
second class of these appellations conveys the special functions 
of the houses, such as tarn (body), sva (wealth) or kutumba 
( family ), sahaja ( brothers ) 

There are certain appellations that apply to a number rf 
houses The 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses are all called kantaka,

Thibaut ( in Grundriss p 68 J following Jacobi boldly asserts 
that the doctrine of the twelve astrological houses which is a 
chief point in the Indian system found developed in Varaha- 
mihira does not occur among Western authorities earlier than 
Firmious Maternus (middle of 4th century AD) and that 
Greek astrology entered into India only between Firmicus and 
Varahamihira One is regretfully constrained to say that this 
is a case of one blind man following another In the first place 
the conception of houses ( bhavas ) is not totally absent even in 
Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos, as can be seen in IT 8 p 191, m. 10 
pp 378-275 (Loeb Classical Library), where houses I, VO, IX, X 
and XI are referred to, though Ptolemy does not pay much 
attention to the system of Wwtos Probably this escaped the 
attention of both Jacobi and Thibaut In the second place, the 
system of bbSvas does not occur for the first time in Varaha 
Varaha refers to a host of Indian writers before him as will be 
shown below in whose works the system appears in a fully 
developed form It is not possible to believe that all this vast 
literature was developed m a hundred years or so after Firmicus. 
Besides, authors like Garga, Parasara, who are placed between 
the Vedangajyotisa and the siddhantas ( about 800 B O to 350 
A D ) knew this system and Garga is assigned to 50 B. G. by Kern 
(PrefacetoBrS p 50) Thibaut, a great scholar, proposing to write 
an encyclopaedic work on Jyotisa is content to rely on Jacobi and 
does not appear to have cared to see for himself even Ptolemy and 
examine works like the Atharvana Jyotisa, the Vaikhanasasutra, 
Vismidliarmottara which teach astrology based on naksatras. 
This, to say the least, is most surprising Prof Zinner ( in ' Stars 
above us ' ) p 67 says that the twelve houses denote life, business, 
toothers, father, sons, health, wife, death, religion, gain, good 
deeds, gaoL In the 3rd place Thibaut takes no account of Sanskrit 
works written by Yavanas settled in India, to whom Varaha 
frequently refers, from whom he sometimes differs on vital 
pomtsof doctrine andfromwhomTJtpalaquoteshundreds of verses,

from the several bhtvas as stated in Br. J do not all agree with 
whatJ'irmioiie says. VarSha designates the 2nd bhSva as 
kutumba and sva (family, wealth) whfle Mrmieus calls it 
'lucrum' (haw one shall earn one's living), the 11th 
bh&va is called aya (income) and bh&va by Varafca while 
Ffcmicus calls it the house of good deeds; in Mnnious the 
4th bhfiva is that of father or parents, while Vataha calls it 
*bandhu.'( relatives) and grha in Br J. and 'subrt'j friends) 
in LaghujStaka and some later Indian writers Bay that 4th and 
10th bhSvas are respectively of the mother and father, In 
Firmious the din and ISth hhsvas are respectively wealth and 
jail, while VarSha holds them to he * enmity ' and ' expenditure'. 
Certain technical words have yet to be explained. One 
meaning of horU is half a? 36. 2n the case of the rSsis of odd 
numbers ( vis. 1, 8, 5, ?, 8, 11 ) the lord of the first half is the 
sun and that of the 2nd half is the moon, while in the case of 
E&sis of even numbers ( 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 ) the lord of the 1st half 
is the moon and of the 2nd half the sun (Br J.X.11) The 
purpose of this is that those born on sun's hora are energetia 
( assertive ) by nature and those born on moon's hora are mild 
by nature, Br. J. (112) mentions the view of some 80 {of

Lords of haras 581 

Yavanesvara, according to TTtpala ) that the lord of the first hora 
1b the same as the lord of the rasi and the lord of the second hora 
is the lord of the 11th house in the horoscope The result of this 
view would be that all planets can be lords of horas and not the 
sun and the moon alone as Var&ha, Satya and others say Each 
rasi ( of 30 degress) is divided into three parts, each of 10 degrees, 
called dreskana or drekkana or drkana or drgana ( in Br. J. Ill 
5, probably for the sake of the metre ) The lords of the three 
parts of each rasi are respectively the lord of the rasi itself ( of 
the first part }, the lord of the Sth rasi ( of the 2nd part ) and the 
lord of the 9th rasi ( of the 3rd part ). For example, in the case 
of Vrsabha ( of which the lord is Venus ), the lords of the 1st, 
2nd and 3rd parts are respectively Venus, Mercury (lord of 5th 
from Vrsabha ) and Saturn ( lord of 9th from Vrsabha ). And so 
on for the other rgsis 

A few words must be said about dreskana Weber and 
others think that it represents the Greek word'deoanoi' The 
' dekans' were a legacy from ancient Egypt, which 816 had origi- 
nally no zodiaoal signs. Bouche-Leolercq has discussed 887 the 
question of deoans at great length in his ' L ' Astrologie Qreoque ' 
pp 215-240 The decanal system can be traced as far back as 
the third dynasty of Egypt ( about 2800 B. O. ) and may be older 
still. Originally, the deoans were conspicuous stars ox groups 
of stars rising at particular hours of the night during 36 
successive periods of ten days each that constituted the year in 
Egypt The series began with Sirius and they were distributed 
in a wide equatorial belt The ancient Egyptians had a fixed 
idea that each division of time, large or small, must have its 
protective tutelary deity. Therefore, the decans were originally 
the divinities ( or genu ) that presided over the 36 decades of the 
Egyptian year. Each period of ten days was marked by the 
rising of the next decan on the eastern horizon at sunset. 
Bouche Leolercq points out that in the Egyptian language a 
specific name (like the Greek word' deoanos') is not met with 
and that the deoans are designated by a number of synonyms. 
When the Zodiacal signs were introduced in Egypt by the 

866 'Legacy of Egypt' ed by S. R K. Glanvillc (Oxford. 1942, 
P. 163).

Greeks, the tutelary spirits slipped into or got intertwined with 
the signs of the Zodiac (each sign of 30 degrees being divided 
into decans of 10 degrees) and played an important part in 
astrology The original division referred to the equator, while 
the later distribution of 36 decans among the twelve signs refers 
to the* 68 ecliptic Bouche Leclercq avers (p 53) that it has 
been proved beyond doubt that the Egyptian Zodiacs (they had 
four, viz 2 at Denderah, one at Esneh and one at A khnvm ) are 
all of the Boman epoch and are imitations of the Greek Zodiac 

The Brhajjataka has a special chapter 27 (in 36 verses) 
called dreskSnadhyaya in which the 36 presiding deities of 
dreskanas are described This chapter appears to conserve the 
ancient Egyptian conception of the decans as guardian 889 divi- 
nities The language must be regarded as rather metaphorical 
or symbolic It is parts of the Zodiac that are being described. 
Nearly two-thirds of 36 are male and the rest are female Some 
composite figures of males and females and quadrupeds or birds 
or serpents occur. In verses 2, 19 and 31 ( of chap 27 ) Vara* 
expressly says that he only sets out what the Tavanas have said.

description of dreslcanas 583 

Here I translate two verses (2 and 21) 'the Yavanas have 
deolaied the form of the middle dxesk&na of Mesa sign ( Aries J 
viz. she is a female clad in ted garments, intent on ornaments 
and food, has the mouth of a horse and has a jar-like ( i e. 
rotund } form, she is oppressed by thirst and is standing on one 
leg'; 'theYavanas have declared the appearance of the last 
dreskana of Tula (Scales) as a male having the form of a monkey, 
deoked with ornaments, frightening deer in a forest, wearing 
golden armour and quiver, and holding fruits and flesh (in his 
hands )'. There is nothing in the Tetrabiblos of Ptolemy corres- 
ponding to this and Varaha probably refers to a Sanskrit work 
by a Yavana writer muoh earlier than even Ptolemy and Mani- 
lms. Manilius, author of 'Astronomica', a didaotic poem on 
astrology, referred to tiie deoans but he wrote about 9 A. D. and 
it appears that deoans had gone out of vogue in Greece by the 
time of Ptolemy. Souohe-Lecleicq notes (p. 319 ) that the system 
of deoans is a characteristic of Manilius and that after him one 
doeB not hear it spoken of any longer. On p 219 of his work 
Bouche-Leolercg. furnishes a figure of the Decans of Manilius, 
which is entirely different from the descriptions of deoans given 
by Br J. Manilius divides each sign into three parts, each of which 
represents no deity but the signs themselves. For example, Aries 
is divided into three parts and those three are the same as Aries, 
Taurus and Gemini The Saravall 8 **' in chap. 49 devotes 
thirty-six verses to the description of 36 dreskanas, but the des- 
cription differs from that of the Br J. as the note below will 
show. TheSSrSvall had probably before it a Sanskrit yatana 
work different from the one relied upon by Br. J 

Some other technical words may be mentioned and denned 
here. The six items, viz the rSsi of a planet, the hora, dreskana, 
navamsa.dvadasamsaandtrisamsa of the iasi axe each called 
the iorgo or Sad-varga of that planet ( Br. J. L 9 ) The first

The vatBottamaraa.vS.m6as of all r&srts bear the same names as the

planet other than the sun occupies the 2nd louse from that 
occupied by the Moon; the Toga Anapha occurs when some 
planet other than the sun occupies the 12th bouse from that 
occupied by the Moon and Darudhars occurs when planets occupy 
the 2nd and 12th houses from that occupied by the Moon. The 
Yoga called Kema-druma occurs when the above three don't 
occur and the Moon is not in kendra position or if kendra is 
not occupied by any of the planets ( except the Sun ) Br J IS. 

4 notices that varieties of AnaphS and Sunapba are 31 each and 
the varieties of DurudharSareWO. The Br J. does not devote more 
than 6 verses to all these four yogas but the Yrddha-Tavanajataka 
of MlnarSJa has 30 verses on Anapha, 30 verses on SunaphS, 178 
verseB on DurudharS. The rSsi which is 2nd from the rfisi

agrees with Sanskrit Dyaus and not with Jlva and Zeus is an 
Indo-European word meaning ' Heaven ' or ' sky '. The different 
forms of the word dreskana or ' dyutam for ' dyunam ' should 
not be separately counted The word hora is used in early Indian 
astrology in three different senses, none of which agrees with 
the sense of hour. It is possible that even in Greek it is a word 
borrowed from Egypt or Babylonia, since in the definite sense 
of an hour, it is much later and it is doubtful whether Hipparchus 
( 140 B. ) uses it in that sense. If we exclude these four words 
only 33 words may at the most be argued to have been adapted 
from Greek. Some of these words such as the 12 names of rSsis 
and she of the planets, some names of the bhavas like hibuka, 
jarmtra, dyuna and kendrahsve several synonyms ( sometimes by 
the dozen ) in Sanskrit employed in Br. J. and so no emphasis 
should be laid on them. They were mentioned by Br J. because 
they had been employed by ancient Greek authors who wrote in 
Sanskrit and so Br. J. took cognisance of them for the sake of 
completeness of treatment Even Icendra meaning 1st, 4th, ?th 
and 10th houses or bhavas has two Sanskrit synonyms ' kantaka * 
and 'oatustaya'.besides the fact that its meaning is different in San- 
skrit astrology from the meaning of the Greek-word (kenti on, spike) 
Therefore, barely ten Greek words like Anapha, Sunapha remain 
which have a very minor role to play in Indian astrology and 
it is a far cry to argue or assert from the occurrence of these few 
words that the whole Indian astrology as developed in Varaha- 
mihira was borrowed from Greek works It is extremely doubtful 
whether any Indians except a few sages or gymnosophists ever 
went to Greece or lived long in Greece or settled there and 
returned to India to spread Greek words and astrological know- 
ledge in India; but we have ample evidence that Greeks settled 
in India, composed inscriptions in Sanskrit and wrote extensive 
works on astrology in Sanskrit. Vide * L * Astrologie Greoque '

Four kinds of power of planets 587 

9th from each other There are differences of opinion here but 
they are passed over. 

The bala ( strength ) of planets is of four kinds ( arises in 
four ways } viz place, direction, aotivity ( ce?i8 ), time. A planet 
is powerful in its position when it is in its own house or in 
exaltation ( ttcca ) or in its friend's house or in its tnkona or 
navSmsa. This is sbhanabala. Mercury and Jupiter are powerful 
in the east ( i e when they are in the lagna ), the Sun and Mars 
in the south ( i. a. in the 10th house ), Saturn in the WeBt ( i e. 
7th house ), the Moon and Venus are powerful in the north ( i e. 
4th house ), This is dtgbala. The Sun and Moon are powerful 
in the northern ayana 872 ( i. e. in the six raiis from Capricorn ) ; 
the remaining planets are powerful when they are retrograde or 
in conjunction with the Moon or whea there is a fight ( between 
planets other than the Sun and the Moon ), the one to the north 
being more powerful Garga quoted in the Adbhutas&gara says 
that graliayvddha (fight of planets) occurs when one planet 
occults the other, or when it slightly covers, or when the light of 
one throws into the background the light of another or when 
one planet is to the left of the other slightly. This is cesiSbala. 
The Moon, Mars and Saturn are powerful at night, Mercury is 
powerful both by day and night, and others are powerful by day ; 
kiura and sowntfa planets axe respectively powerful in the dark 
half and bright half of the month, a planet is powerful in the 
year of which he is the lord, or on his own week-day or hora or in

verse ot aron^ rtmw smum ^SatwroSlOTm^i ssanfffi at

of three kinds, when any planet is in conjunction with the sun. that is 
called astamaya (setting), when in conjunction with the moon it is called 
samSgema, when the other planets. Mars ic. are in conjunction with each 
other that is called yuddha ( fight of the planets) . ( in the case of ynddha) 
that planet which is to the north of the other is called victorious or power-

other) «Ph.3iB ^ *yw ^^w4^, „ , an^ngrBre ^ ^S^-

tho month of which he is the lord This is kffldbala. m Yavane- 
svara says ' for ten days from the 1st tithi of the bright half the 
Moon is of middling power but in the nest period of ten days 
( from sukla 11th to krsna ) 5th Moon's power is highest and in 
the last ten days (from krena 6th to amaiasya) the Meon has 
slight power .but if Moon has an aspect with saumya planets 
(Jupiter &c. ) ho is always powerful 

A planet is said by SSrarall to have nine vicissitudes, m 
dtpla ( blazing, when it is in exaltation), staslha ( st ease when 
it is in its svagrha), mudita (glad, when it is in a friend's 
siagrha ), santa ( quiet, when it is in an auspicious xarga ), sakta 
( capable, when it is shining brightly ), mpidita ( oppressed, when 
it is overwhelmed by another planet ), bhita (frightened, when it 
is in depression ), vtMa ( impaired when its light is lost is Sun's 
light), lhala (evil, when it is in the midst of evil company). 
The Saravall ( V- 5-13 ) describes at length the results of a planet 
being in these nine conditions. 

How even mythological accounts are pressed into service 
by astrological wor&s may be well illustrated by two verses from 
the YogayStrS of VarShamftira : « The Sun was born in Anga 
(Bengal), the Moon among Yavanas.Mars in Avanti rUjjaymU, 
Mercury in Magadha, Jupiter in Sindhn, Venus in Bhojakata 
Sarorn in Surastra(Kathiawar), Eetu among ^°^*f*f 
Bahu in Kalinga; if these planets are affected, they cause distress 
to the countries in which they were born- hence a king should

Doctrine of drsti 589 

A very important doctrine of Indian astrology is that of drsti 
(lit. glance, i e aspect ) The Br. J. II. 13, Laghujataka n. 8, 
Saxavall IV. 32-33, M\murtadarsana 1 27 lay down the following 
rules. All planets 878 have a fall aspeot ( puma dcsti ) on the 7th 
house from the one which each occupies Besides, Saturn has full 
aspeot on the 3rd and 10th rasi from the one which it occupies 
and on the planet which is 3rd or 10th from its own position. 
Similarly, Jupiter has full aspeot on the 5th and 9th rasi from the 
one it occupies and also on the planet that is 5th or 9th from 
itself; Mars has full drsti on the 4th and 8thrasis and the 
planet in the same. So the Sun, Moon, Mercury and Venus have 
full drsti only on the 7th rasi from the one each of them occupies 
and on the planet that is 7th from them. Besides, all planets 
have l/4th drsti on the 3rd and 10th, half drsti on 5th and 
9th, £ drsti on 4th and 9th There is no aspect of any planet 
on any rasi or sthaita except the seven expressly mentioned 
( viz 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th ) and in the case of 
partial drstis the fruit also is partial (Le. J, £ or J) The 
Tetrabihlos ( 1. 13 and 20 ) treats of four aspects vie. opposition 
( 7th house of VarSha ), trine ( 5th and 9th houses ), quartale ( 4th 
and 10th ), sextile ( difference of 60 degrees and two signs ) and 
does not distinguish between fractions of drstis as Varaha does. 
So in the matter of aspects also there is substantial difference 
between Ptolemy and Varaha-mihira. 

Another important doctrine is that of qocara It means 87 * 8 
the consideration about the auspicious or inauspicious positions 
of planets at any particular pe riod in question in places either

declared auspicious or inauspicious judging from the rSsi of birth. 
The Muhurta-cintamani in five verses (of chap 4) deals with this 
subject I shall illustrate tbe application of tbe word by some 
examples If the Sun is in the 6th place from the rSsi of birth 
be is auspicious but if at the same time tbe 12th place from the 
raSi of birth is occupied by other planets ( except Saturn ), then, 
though auspicious by himself, he beoomes -inauspicious This 
result does not arise in case one planet is tbe father or son of 
the other ( as Saturn is the son of tbe Sun and Mercury is the 
son of the Moon ). Similarly, if Mercury is in 2nd place from 
rSsi of birth or in the 4th or 6th or 8tb or 10th or 11th and other 
planets ( except the Moon who is the father of Mercury ) are 
respectively in the 5th, 3rd, 9th, 1st, 8th or 12tb, Mercury, though 
originally auspicious, becomes inauspicious for the time being 
Karalca is another word to be explained It is rather compli- 
cated Br. J. TnnT and Ssravall 8 ** VI and VH deal with it 
As many planets as occupy their own grha or ucca or MiOatoi- 
kona and also are in the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th places (m the 
horoscope ) they become Kardkas of each other, while the planet 
that is in the 10th place (in horoscope) is specially karate*. 
Suppose the lagna is Karka and the moon occupies it ( it is 
moon's svagrha ) and Mars, Saturn, the Sun and Jupiter are in 
their uccasd e in Makara, Tula, Mesa and Karkata respec-

divisions of antardasas This doctrine is elaborated in the 8th 
chapter of the Brhajjataka and Utpala quotes numerous verses 
from Yavanesvara on this The theory of Astakavarga is set 
out by VarSha in chapter 9 of the Brhajjataka viz that the seven 
planets and lagna are eight entities and they produce their 
fullest or auspicious results only when they are in particular 
houses and at particular periods of a man's life All this has 
to be passed over for reasons of space 

In the BrhatsamhitS, the Brhaj-]ataka, and the two works 
on Yafcra, Varahamihira mentions a host of his predecessors

Tho vast literature prosiipposod by these numerous authors 
cannot bo compressed as said above within the brief space of a 
hundred years or so but roquiros tho lapse of several centuries 
From Garga, who is astignod to 50 B C. by Kern to Varaha- 
mfhira thoro ii a period of about five centuries which might bo 
hold to suffico for the production of this vast .istrological 
literature Garga himself know the rasi system, the tystem of 
tbo exaltation of planets and of dr&tis as the quotation in note 
879 will show. Ptolemy came at least two hundred years after 
Garga and Ftrmious four hundrod years after him. Therefore 
there is nothing to prove that the rssl system m India was 
borrowed from Greek authors The Greeks themselves got their 
inspiration for horosoopio astrology from Babylon after the 
invasion of Alexander in 4th century B. C and particularly after 
Borossus 

It would be necessary to say something about the signs of 
the Zodiac. The word Zodiac is derived from a Greek word 
1 Zodion ' meaning ' little animals ' and means literally a * circle 
of animals '. In Herodotus I. 70 it is used in the sense of ' figure 
painted or carved '. It was then applied to one of the figures 
imagined as formed by certain star-groups in the belt of the 
heavens. The Zodiac is a belt in the sky about 16 degrees broad, 
divided in two by the ecliptic, in winch the Sun, Moon and 
planets move. The expression ' signs of the Zodiac' may be used 
in two senses,** 1 viz. (1 ) the 18 groups of constellat ions which

are found sown in the vicinity of the eoliptlo (the path of the 
Sun ) irregular in position, unequal in extent and in brightness , 
( 2 } the twelve equal artificial divisions of the belt each extending 
to 30 degrees of longitude Jt ib generally held that the first 
meaning alone can be the earlier of the BM two. Meissner points 
out that the most ancient Babylonian observation text belonging 
to the 87th yeai of Nebuchadnezzar ( 567 B. O. ) knows only the 
figuies or pictures of the constellations, while the twelve equal 
divisions oocur first of all in a text of the reign of Darius H 
(about 418 B 0.). Nothing definite is known about the first 
formation of these pioture-signs nor is it known who gave these 
fanciful names to stars There is hardly any doubt that the 
picture names were due to popular fancy and not to men of 
t-cience. The names were probably given at different times. 
MeissneT states that the picture signs are already mentioned in 
part in a Hittite text of the 13th century B C and are also to be 
found on boundary stones of the same period. 

Schiaparelli in ' Astronomy in the old Testament ' ( p. 85 ) 
observes that in Babylonia upright stones were placed in fields 
as boundary marks ( Kuihm u in Babylonian ) or rather as titles 
of properly by way of public notice, of which thirty have been 
so far discovered on which figures are drawn and on which 
inscriptions aTe found containing most terrible curses on those 
who would remove the stones. On p 86 he gives the drawing on 
a Babylonian monument of the 13th century B. C. in which the 
Moon, the Sun and Tenus occupy the central position and round 
about them there is a crowd of figures, of which one can easily 
recognize the scoipion, the goat with a fish's tail ( Oapiicornus ) 
and the Archer. 8 * 3 Hooks remarks that several constellations are

assigned to Ea in the astrological teste, the two most freouentlv 
mentioned being Pisces and Aquarius and that EaTsymS £ 
presented on boundary stones was either Ram's hVadTgoal- 
fish. It is stated by Frankfort ms that of Zodiacal signs intheir 
Babylonian forms only two, Oanoar and Sagittarins, do not occur 
on the seals of the first dynasty of Babylonia 

It is possible to argue thai in two voiaes of the Jrgveda (1 
84.8 and 1. 1G4. 11 ) there is a reference to the Zodiacal belt 
' Sing Varuna made a wide path in order that the San may 
follow it *; ' the wheel of rta has twelve spokes and it again and 
again revolves round the Bky, but it is not worn out' »« 

The above references to Babylonian boundary stones and 
monuments are enough to show that in Babylonia some four or 
five signs of the Zodiao had been distinguished before 1000 B. C 
But the complete list of picture sings of the Zodiac was known 
in Babylonia at least from about 6th century B. 0. as Meissner 
(referred to above) says. 8 ' 7 Sarton cautiously suggests tho 
probability of Babylonian influence on other Oriental peoples 
(Iranian, Indian and Chinese ) but he gives up the disoussion of 
this question as a debatable 888 one. Authorities are agreed that 
the oldest horosoopes are found in Mesopotamia and not in 
Greece nor in Egypt. Sarton states that the first known horo- 
scope is a ouneiform tablet in the Bodleian referring to the date 
89th April 410 B 0., and that the second is another tablet in the

that tho figure contains tho symbols of the Son and Moon, a Scorpion, do\c< 
winged lion, a ziggutat (toner). Ono can also detect therein n bnll and 
a goat with fishes ' tail. Waerdcn in Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vol 6 
nt p 22, holds that sjmbols on boundary stones are of little help and thnf 
the figure of Scorpion might fiist be an earthly Scorpion considered as a 
symbol of a god or it might be a zodiacal Scorpion,

pierpont Morgan Library referring (o April 263 B 0. ( in JAOS. 
vol 75, No. 3 p. 172 ). F. 0. Cramer in ' Astrology in Roman Law 
and Politics' ( Philadelphia, 1954 ) agrees with this and gives 
references to horoscopes of 258 B. C , 235 B C and 142 B. C. 
( pp. 5-8 ). Prof. Neugebauer on the other hand remarks 839 that 
only seven horoscopes are found preserved from Mesopotamia, 
all written in Seleucid period, the earliest being of 263 B. C. 
C. V. Maclean refers to a horoscope of 28th February 142 B C. 
Sarton says that the very word ' horoscopos ' was coined very 
late in Greece, that it is used by Manillas ( first century AD) 
and Clement of Alexandria ( 150-220 AD.) and that its use 
cannot be found earlier.*™ The earliest Greek horoscope from 
Egypt concerns the yeaT 4 B 0. and Prof Neugebauer says that 
he knows ahout GO horoscopes from 4 B. 0. to 500 A. D. The 
earliest Demotic and Greek horoscopes were written ahout the 
beginning of the Christian era and the earliest Demotic horo- 
scope refers to 13 A D. M1 Prof. Neugebauer holds that the rising 
times of zodiacal signs mentioned in Brhajjataka (1.19) are 
precisely the same as the rising timeB of zodiacal signs in the 
Babylonian system ( called A ) Vide Journal of Cuneiform 
Studies, vol. 7 No , 3 pp 100-103 

It has been seen above that not only was general astrology 
developed m early Vedio times, but individual astrology based 
on naksatras had begun te be studied even as early as the 
Atharvaveda. 8 ' 2 , tLat beginnings of a regular terminology 
resembling the later bhuva nomenclature had been made and 
prognostications had been based on the naksatra of birth and on 
the naksatras at certain distances from the naksatra of birth

medieval astrology, viz. that a parson's future* is determined at 
the time of the birth and that his destiny can be inferred from 
liis horoscope. It will bo shown immediately that India was in 
contact with Mesopotamia and the countries of the Near Bast 
from vejy ancient times. This contact became very dose after 
Alexander's invasion of India about 335 B 0. and in the 3rd 
century B. C. It appears to mo probable that Indians who had 
nlroady the naksntra astrology bbw the signs of the Zodiac on 
Babylonian monuments and boundary stones and adapted them 
to their own astrological purposes just about the time when the 
Greeks derived their inspiration for individual astrology from 
Babylonians. 

In * Gaya and Buddha Gaya ' ( Galoutta, 1934 ) Dr. B. M 
Bnrua draws attention ( pp 90-93 and 121 of vol. II ) to the fact 
that one can deteot on the railing pillars at Buddha Gay3 some 
of the motifs representing the rasis or signs of the Zodiac ( vide 
figure** 43 a to 3, which resemble the signs from Vrsa to Tula, 
Dbamwand Makara). These figures were drawn in the 1st 
century B. O and would go at least some way towards negativing 
the view of Weber and others that the rfisi system was borrowed 
by Indians from such Greek writers as Fmnicus and Paulus in tt» 
4th century A.D. These Buddha Gaya figures closely resemble the 
fieuies drawn on monuments and boundary stones in Babylonia

Kikkuli of the land of Mitanni in which are found certain

Antiyoga (Antioohus of Syria), Turamaya (Ptolemy II of 
Egypt), Antikina ( Antigonus of Macedonia ), Mags ( Magas of 
Gyrene) and Alikasundara raj (of Epirus) The Gospel of 
Matthew ( chap. 2. 1-2 ) states that at the birth of Christ in 
Bethlehem wise men from the east came to Jerusalem saying 
that they had seen in the east the star of the newlv born child 
and had come to worship him. The life of Apollonius of Tyana 
written by Fhflostratus 900 ( in the first quartet of the 3rd century 
A. D.) states that it was usual in India to show great hospitality 
to Babylonians and that the Indian king, Iarohus. presented to 
Apollonhit Beven rings named after the seven planets of which 
he was to wear one on each week day, 

The theory that is sought to be propoundedhate is that the sight 
of the signs of the Zodiac on such patent obieots as monuments 
and boundary stones in the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C excited the 
curiosity of Indians visiting Babylonia, that on knowing their 
signi6cance they brought the knowledge baok to their country 
and fitted it on to the naksatra astrology that already existed in 
India and developed the rasi astrology m their own way Vaiaho.-

astrology had been derived from the Yavanas there was nothing

several substantial points. m About 200 B. C. the vernal equinox 
was at the beginning of the divisional sign Aries, which very 
closely coincided with the picture sign Aries The Indian 
astronomers, when they began to make use of the signs Mesa 
and others, switched over from the reckoning with the Krttikas as 
the beginning of the series of naksatras onto the reckoning from 
the naksatra AsvinI, and counted AsvinI as the first naksatra, 
though the vernal equinoctial point has now receded owing to 
precession to the Uttarabbadrapada naksatra group. It is 
difficult to trace and describe the early efforts of Indian astro- 
logers in the centuries preceding the Christian era on the system 
of rSsis, sinoe the excellent work of Varaha, the Brhajjataka, 
eclipsed all its predecessors and led to their gradual disappearance 
just as the two works of Ptolemy, Syntaxis ( or Almagest ) and 
Tetrabiblos, led to the gradual loss and disappearance of Greek 
works on astronomy and astrology composed before Ptolemy. 
Though all scholars maintain that Greek horoscopic astrology 
was influenced by Babylonian astronomy and astrology, the 
connecting links have snapped and become obliterated. 902 It is 
likely that, as both India and Greece were influenced by the 
Babylonian system of signs and astrology, both show some 
common characteristics. Bat it is too wide of the mark to assert 
that Indian astrology as developed in YarShamihira was boi rowed 
from Firmicus and Paulus Alexandrinus. Prof. Neugebauer, 
while asserting that the SOrya-siddhanta is based on Greek 
eccentric and epicyolic devices, holds that they were modified by 



901. To mention only a few striking matters of differences of opinion 
between Varaha and Yavanas. (1) Yavanas favoured the view that all 
planets coold be lords of bora ( half of a rasi ), while By J. said no to this 
(I 11-12); (2) Yavanas held that the moon was never a malefic planet, 
Br J. (II 5) said it was so in certain cases; (3) Yavanas regarded Mars 
as sSttviU. while Br. J.UI. 7 ) held Mars to be tamasika , ( 4 ) Yavanas held 
that planets could only be friends or enemies among themselves, while Br. J. 
{ II. 15 )J>eld that they conld also be neither friends nor foes ; ( 5 ) Yavanas 
and Varaha differed on the temporary friendship or enmity of planets ( Br. J . 
II. IS ) , ( 6 ) Yavanas spoke of Vajrayoga, but Br J. (XII 3 and 6 } held 
that such a yoga was impossible , ( 7 ) Yavanas held that only the Kumbha- 
dvadasamsa was inauspicious, the Br J. ( XXI 3 ) found fault with this. 

902. Vide Prof Kcugebauer in E. S, A., p. 93 Prof. Waerden ( in 
Journal of Mear Eastern studies, vol 8 p. 76 ) remarks that Hellenistic 
Astrology is a mixtnreof Chaldean, Egyptian and Greek elements and that 
there arc more Babylonian elements in this mixture than is general! 
supposed.

Indian astrology about rSsie and bhavas was developed before 
even Ptolemy I have pointed out the differences between 
Ptolemy and Yarfiha in many places. *" 

Horoscopes are oast not only for individuals, but also for 
companies, ships, animals, 953 * foundations of buildings, cities 
and countries. If a person comes to an astrologer for consulta- 
tion on any matter, the astrologer notes the sign rising at the 
time the question is asked, calculates the positions of the planets 
also for that day and tune and then makes his prognostications ™ 
For casting the horoscope of an individual one must know the 
year, month, day, hour or ghahlcu of birth and the place of 
birth. Almanacs are prepared on the basis of the latitudes and 
longitudes of cities like Bombay or Poona or Calcutta and they 
furnish tables by following which one can find the Bign rising 
at the time of the birth of a person But the almanacs being 
based on the latitudes and longitudes of certain towns and 
cities, if a person uses an almanac prepared in Poona for casting 
the horoscope of a person born in Berar or Central India there is 
likely to be some inaccuracy in arriving at the proper lagtm.

Figures of horoscopes 



60S 



Horoscopes are framed either in square figures or in circular 
figureB and even as to square horoscopes, there is some variance 
in the practice of placing the lagna (the sign rising on the 
horizon at the time of birth ). Supposing the lagna is Simha, 
the square horoscope as usually drawn in MahSrSstca would be 
as follows where the figures 6, 2 and i would represent the 
2nd, 10th and 12th bhavas ( places ), while a horoscope cast on 
the modern European method would be like the one next to it 
with the same lagna and employs symbols for the signs as for 
Aries and for planets such as for Mars.

CHAPTER XVn 

MUHURTAS FOR RELIGIOUS RITES 

We shall now torn to the muhurtas for religious rites and 
actions of individuals. Only a few of the rites and actions oan 
be briefly dealt with here. 

A few general rales may however be first stated The 
ittharrana 905 Jyotisa says that a wise man should perform an 
act or rite with the concurrence of all the four, viz. Mhi, 
naksalra, km ana and muhurta, if he wants success in it. if a 
proper tithi cannot be secured then the other three should be 
availed of, if the first two are not available then the next two, 
if the first three are not available then secure muhurta alone ; 
but if there be necessity to hurry and none of the four oan be 
secured, then with the loud declaration by ( learned ) brahmanas 
that it is an auspicious day he should do the aot and success is 
secured Certain religious acts have to be done at stated times 
and in those cases, one should not consider the conditions of 
Jupiter and Venus called batua and old age or the fact of Jupiter 
being in Lion sign, or of dakstnayana or there being an inter- 
oalary month, as for example, in the rites from pumsawma up 
to anmpn&mi. The BajamSrtanda** states 'the correct 
astrological position of planets and days is not meant for times 
of distress, all these ( rules about auspicious positions ) are to be 
considered when life is easy (matters are in good condition), 
so savs Bhrgu*. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday 
LTsuccess in all actions ( begun on those days), only those 
Succeed on Sunday, Tuesday and Saturday for which 
those days are expressly laid down as proper But the Nfirada- 
Sia lays that Wednesday, Thursday •»«»«*'«• «" 

^Mtaflfto 85 a. verse 388 ^^ ^^ wgifo^&wftS* 



When do all undertakings succeed 605 

The general role is that all undertakings succeed when they 
are begun while the 3rd, 6th, 10th and 11th places from the 
lagna are either in conjunction with or have an aspect with an 
auspicious planet and the lagna is also in conjunction with the 
two, when the 8th and 12th places are faultless and the Moon is 
in the 3rd, 6th, 10th or 11th place. 908 

It should be remembered that the usual tendency of our 
medieval Dharmasastra writers is generally to heap details on 
what were originally simple ceremonies. 

Among the samskaras it is best to begin with Jatakarma 
( rites at the birth of a child ). The Ratnamala 909 - provides that 
the rites on the birth of a son should be performed on a mrdu, 
dfauva, k&tpia or a cora naksatra and the good recommend the 
giving of a name when Jupiter or Venus iB in catustaya ( i e. in 
the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th bbfiva in the infant's horoscope). As 
regards birth some writers ( e. g. M. M. IV. 19 ) speak of 
GandSnta which is inauspicious in birth, marriage and starting 
on a journey or invasion, viz the conjunction of 15th tithi with 
prahpad for two ghaltkas, similarly half a ghatika when Cancer 
and Lion or Scorpion and Archer or Fish and Earn join and the 
four ghatikss of the junction of RevatI and Asvin!, Sales* and 
MaghS, Jyestha and Mula These Gand&nta conjunctions 
produce evil for the child's father or mother &a Similar results 
are predicted for birth on certain parts of Aslesa and Mflla. 
About naming a child Manu provides that it should be performed 
on the 10th or 12th day from birth or on an auspicious tithi or 
on a muhurta or naksatra possessed of auspicious characteris- 
tics m About caitia or cadakarma ( tonsure ) Ssvalayana-gchy a 
(1. 17. 1) provides a simple rule that it should be performed in the 
third year after birth or according to family usage, while Manu 

35 ^ Provides that it may be performed in the first or third 
year; the Asv. gr , however, has provided for oaula, upanayana, 
gotona and marriage the proper time of the northward passage 
of the sun, the fortnight of the waring moon and an auspicious 
naksatra The Ap. gr . ( 16. 3 ) states that it may be performed

in the 3rd year after birth on Punarvasu naksatra. But medieval 
writers have added numerous astrological details For example, 
the Rajamartanda devotes thirty-two verses to crula ( folios 16 
to 18 ), one remarkable provision being that the Yavanas regarded 
cudaltii ma in the Sun's northward passage as auspicious m 
Vyfisa quoted by Sm. C says ' tonsure should be performed on 
AsvinI, Sravana, SvSti, Citrs, Fusya, Punarvasu, Dhamstha, 
BevatI, Jyestha, Mrgaslrsa and Hasta and should not be per- 
formed on the person's naksatra of birth, nor onFurvabh&drapada, 
Uttarabhadrapada and Krttika, one should avoid for tonsure 
the first tithi ( after amavasya ), nlda tithi ( 4th, 9th and 14th ), 
Vish, Sunday, Tuesday, Saturday and night 9a 

Similar rules are laid down for ordinary shaving in the case 
of grown-up men 9a * Some verses may be quoted here ' the 
following naksatras are benefioial in the matter of shaving, vjss. 
the naksatras, Hasta, 913 Oitra, Svati, MrgasiraB, Sravana, 
DhanisthS Satabhisak, Eevatr, Asvml, Jyestha, Pusya and 
Punarvasu or when any naksatra is at the time of its rise in 
conjunction with the moon provided there is also ISrSbala ( as 
defined below ). Shaving is commended when the rising sign 
isMakara, Dhanus, Kanys, Mithuna or Vrsa; observing this 
produces prosperity, strength and growth of intelligence, if 
shaving is done when any of the other signs is rising, that leads 
to disease and danger Shaving is allowed on all naksatras 
at the king's command, with a brahmana's consent, at the time 
of marriage, on the advent of impurity due to death, on the 
release of an imprisoned person and m rfifea (consecration 
rites ) on a solemn Vedio sacrifice ' 

We now turn to Upanayana, one of the two most important 
samkaras. Asval&yana-grhya (I 4. 1 ) as noted ab ove (p flOa) 

(Continued on next page ) 



Muhurtas for upmiayana 607 

laid down one simple tuIb for the proper time of four samskaras. 
Ap Dh *" S. laid down two further rulesprovidingthatthe upana- 
yana of a brabmana, ksatriya or vaisyaboy should be performed 
respectively in spring, summer and autumn and the proper ages 
for these tinee are respectively the 8th, 11th and 12th from 
conception The same ages are prescribed by Manu H, 36 and 
Yaj. I. 14. It may be noted that none of the sutras nor the 
smrtis of Manu and Yajnavalkya say a word about the position 
of planets or r&sis or week-days or month. Gradually such rules 
were heaped up. The Bajamartanda devotes 70 verses (from 304 
to 373 on folios 20a to 24a } to upanayana It states that the 
years were to be counted from conception or birth To find 
proper muhurtas for upanayana has become a very intricate 
matter and such muhurtas are few and far between. Only a few 
suoh rules can be indicated here, first as to months. One text 
lays down ' Upanayana is commended ( for all ) when performed 
in the five months from Magha ( \ e from Migha to Jyestha ) ; 
while Vrddha-Gargya quoted in Kaladarsa provides that it may 
be performed in the six months from Magha. 9a Another rule 
provided ' that no auspicious rites ( like upanayana and marriage } 
should be performed on the naksatra, month and week-day on 
which the person concerned was born and no auspicious rite 
for the eldest son or eldest daughter should be performed in the 
month of Jyestha' 916 The sages differed about the month of 
birth. Vasistha said that only the day of birth was to be avoided, 
Garga says only eight days of the month of birth were to be

gomeda for Eahu (inS.W.), fine sapphire for Saturn ( "West ), 
Vaidurya ( cat's eye gem) for Ketu ( N. W. ), pusyaraga ( topaz ) 
for Jupiter ( North ), emerald for Mercury ( K. E. ). Such rings 
are worn even in these days by some people. 

As in ancient times upanayana was meant for conferring on 
the boy the authority to study Yeda and as the planet Jupiter 
( Guru ) was identified with Brhaspati, the guru of the gods and 
the Lord of Speech, great importance was attached to the position 
of Jupiter But exceptions were introduced even when Jupiter 
was apparently not favourable. One exception was 'even if 
Jupiter be in the 8th place from the tasi of birth or be in the 
sign of Lion ( which is the svagrha of the Sun ) or in depression 
( L e in Makara ) or in the house of his enemy, upanayana 
would be auspicious if performed in Caitra when the Sun is in 
Pisces ( which is the svagrha of Jupiter ) This exception is due 
to the fact that the principal time for upanayana is the 8th year 
from conception or birth and other conditions are of secondary 
importance, as the Dharmasindhu says. 922 Certain naksatras 
alone were declared to be auspicious for upanayana and soma- 
varlana of dvijas viz on the naksatras Easta, Oitra, SvatI, 
Pusya, Dhanistha, Revafcl, AsvinI, Mrgasiras, Punarvasu and 
Sravana; upanayana was to be performed on a commended tithi 
when the Moon is powerful ( i e from 5th of bright half to the 
5th of the dark half ) "

the proper times for four samskSras which has been quoted above 
(p. 536 note 778). The Baud. gr. {I 1. 18-20) provides that 
marriage may be celebrated in all months, that according to 
some, the months of itaddha, MSgha and Phalguna are to be 
avoided and that the auspicious naksatras for marriage are 
EohinI, Mrgaslrsa, Uttara-Pholgunl and SvatI ( vide notes 726 
and 777 above ). The.lp gr. (12. 12-13 ) is to the same effect 
as to months (vide note 775). The Kausikasutra « (75.2-4) 
approaches medieval and modern praotice as it prescribes that 
marriage should be celebrated after the Full Moon of Kartika 
up to the Pull moon of Vaisakha or one may do as one likes but 
one should avoid the month or half month of Caitra. In medieval 
and modern times there was some difference of opinion. The 
BSjamSrtanda ( that devotes over 150 verses to the treatment of 
marriage) allowed all months for marriage except Caitra and 
Pausa 9S But works like the Dharmasindhu say that the months 
of Mfigha, Phalguna, Vaisakha and Jye9iha are auspicious, 
Margaslraa is middling and in some works AsSdha and Kartika 
are allowed and that usages of the country should be followed. 

Then consideration is to be given to the naksatras, the week 
days, the positions of the planets, particularly Jupiter, Venus, 
Sun and Moon. But before doing so I would like to draw the 
attention of modern sticklers for astrological retirements about 
the marriage of a girl to the practical advice "^JfJ*

( an invading ) king has seized a country or when war is raging 
or when the life of the parents is in danger, a maiden who is 
very much grown up is not to wait for an ( auspicious ) time ; 
when a maiden is very much grown np, but does not act against 
the rules of dharma she should be given in marriage, even though 
she is impure, without minding whether the Moon and the lagna 
are powerful '. The Bhujabala m { or Bhujabalabhlma ) provides 
' the sages declare that in the case of maidens the auspioiousness 
of planets and of the year, the month, ayana, season and days 
is to be considered only before maidens reach the age of ten 
years'. 

There is some difference of opinion about the auspicious 
naksatras for marriage, but all are agreed as to BohinI, 
Mrgasiras, Maghs, TTttara-Phalgunl, UttarasSdha, UttarS- 
bhadrapads, Hasta, Svati, Mula, AnurSdha, BevatI ( vide Br. 
S. 100. 1 ). Others like Haradatta add four more viz. AsvinI, 
Oitra, Sravana, Dhanisths. But if any one of these is in 
conjunction with a malefic planet, it should be avoided. Among 
weekdays, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and l"riday are 
auspicious, the other three are middling. According to a verse 
quoted in Jyotistattva weekdays have no force at night and 
particularly Tuesday, Saturday and Sunday. «■ Among tithis 
amavaaya is forbidden; nktn tithis ( 4th, 9th, 14th ) yield little 
good, the other tithis yield much good; the bright half of a 
month is the best and the dark half of a month unto 13th tithi 
is middling.

beneficent If Jupiter is in exaltation 930 or in its own house or 
in the house of a friendly planet then he confers full life, variouB 
kinds of wealth and happiness, hut if Jupiter is in the first or 
Sth or is depressed or in the house of an enemical planet or lost 
in the brilliance of the Sun he produces widowhood and distress 
to the issue. As regards the lagna at the time of marriage the 
Sun in the 3rd, 6th, 8th from it, the Moon in the 2nd, 3rd or 4th 
place from it, Mars in the 3rd and 6th, Mercury and Jupiter 
in the 8th and 12th are to he avoided. H Venus is in the lagna 
or in the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 9th or 10th place from it, Saturn, Bshu 
and Ketu in 3rd, 6th and 8th from it and every planet in the 
11th place from lagna conduces to happiness in marriage. If 
at the time of marriage Jupiter 931 is 2nd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th 
from the r5si of birth he is auspicious to the maiden; if in 1st, 
3rd, 6th or 10th place therefrom, he becomes beneficent by 
performing a fenti rite; if be is 4th, 8th or 12th he is inauspi- 
cious: but if Jupiter is (at the time of marriage) in Kafta, 
Dhanus or Mlna, he ceases to be inauspioiouB even though be 
may be in the 4th, 8th or 12th place ( from ifisi of birth ); in a 
time of pressing difficulty Jupiter though in the 4thorl2& 
beoomeB auspicious after performing two santis (Brhaspati 
nomas ) and though in the 8tb after three s&ntiB. In the case of 
the bridegroom *he Sun in the 3rd, 6th, 10th or 11th iSsi from 
the bridegroom's rSsi at birth is auspicious; if in other issis the 
Sun beoomeB auspioious after the performance of a boma. 

If a maiden*" baa attained the age of puberty then one 
should not stop to consider whether Jupiter is auspioious; even 
KJupiter be 8th from the girl's raSi of birtb marriage should be 
brought about after three santis.

Gorajas muhUrta for montage 613 

A good deal Is said in the medieval works on Simhastha 
Guru and the rules laid down on this topic are even now observed 
by most paople. The BsjamSitanda devotes six verses to it When 
Jupiter is in the sign Lion several rites would become inauspici- 
ous such as marching on an invasion, marriage, upanayana, first 
entrance in a newly built house, the establishment of the image of 
a god. Certain modifications were introduced by sages. Parasara 
provided that no marriage should be performed in the countries 
between the Ganges and the Godavarl, when Jupiter was in Lion 
sign and that when Jupiter was in Magna naksatra ( the first of 
the 2£ naksatras of Simha ) and when the Sun was in Mlna no 
marriage in all the countries (of India) should take place; 
Vasistha said 'marriage and TTpanayana are not bad in simhastha 
Guru when performed in a country north of the Ganges and to 
the south of the GodSvaxI. 933 

On account of the complicated nature of the muhortafor 
marriage, a short out was hit upon called Godliull or Gorajas 
(literally, dust raised by cows) muhurta The BSjamartanda 
devotes ten verses to it (folios 34b and 35a, verses 550-559). 
Three of them are set out here.** 'While the Sun, though 
' setting, appears like saffron or red sandalwood paste, while the 
stars in the sky are not seen to sparkle with their light, while 
the sky is filled with the dust pounded by cows ( returning to 
their pens) with the tips of their hoofs, that time is declared to be 
Godhulika, which gives rise to wealth and crops and prosperity. 
In this muhurta the planets, the tithis, Visti or stars or constel- 
lations do not create an obstacle; this unimpeded yoga was

declared by Bhargava as time for marriage and for starting on 
an invasion. When no other auspicious lagna oan be found then 
sages direct that GodhulikS(muhurta) is auspicious; but if a 
lagna which is auspicious and powerful can be found the 
GodhulikS muhurta doss not bring about auspicious results. 
The Dharmasindhu ( p. 254 ) simply quotes the Muhurta-mSrtanda 
IV. 38, which says that this muhurta is intended for sudras, but 
that in times of great difficulty when the girl has reached puberty 
it may be auspicious also for brahmanas and persons of other 
varnas. In these days also this Gorajas muhurta is sometimes 
resorted to by all varnas. 

There are other complicated astrologioal matters for con- 
sideration in marriage suoh as Dasayogacakra (R M. folios 
35b-36b ), Saptasalakfioakra ( R. M folio 36b-37b ), which are 
passed over here. But there in one matter that is sometimes 
gone into even now and that must be briefly alluded to, viz the 
calculation of the qiinas (marks) on the comparison of eight 
matters ooncernmg the naksatra and rSsi on which the intending 
bride and bridegroom were born This is designated 'vadhu- 
varamelakavicara ' or ' ghatitagunavicara ' The eight matters 
(kutas as they are called) are varna, vasya, tara, yoni, 
grahamaitrl, ganamaitrl, r&sikuta and nadl, 535 varna carrying 
one mark, each succeeding one having one more mark ( in all 36 ) 
than the one immediately preceding All of them are not 
described even m the latest works ; for example, the Dharmasindhu 
deals only with the last four. Two of these, viz gana and 
nadl are attached great importance even now among WmHW 
and other classes also. I have described these two in H of Db. 
vol H. P 515. All these eight are described at length m 
Muhurtamartanda (IV. 1-12) and Muhurta-oint5mam( VI. 81-35), 
Samskaraprakasa (part of Vlramiteodaya ) pp W8ff and

in some cases, viz when the rasi of birth of both bride and 
bri«Koom was the same, but the naksatras of their birth were

and the like and if the naksatra of both is one and the same it 
would be auspicious if they were born on different quarters of the 
same naksatra Now that in most educated families the age 
of the bride and bridegroom is twenty years and beyond and 
there are also love marriages the rigours of this examination of 
astrological details have been very muoh reduced, but they axe 
not completely gone even now. In the author's youth nearly 
sixty years ago, even if the girl was quite eligible from all other 
points of view, a marriage among the well-to-do classes was 
almost impossible if this tallying of marks was not astrologically 
favourable. 

Great importance was attached to the favourable position 
of Jupiter in the case of marriages. The Batnamala 937 states 
' Mercury that could be seen ( being a good deal away from the 
Sun ) and occupying the 1st, 4th or 10th place in the horoscope 
removes one hundred astrological defects; Venus removes double 
of suoh defects and the teacher of the gods ( Jupiter ) when 
powerful certainly renders nugatory even one hundred thousand 

3_* t . » 



In marriages both candrabala and tatabala were required. 
As stated in note 772 above the 3rd, 5th and 7th naksatras from 
the naksatra of birth were called respectively * vipad { calamity ), 
* pratyari ' ( facing enemy ) and ' vadha ' ( destruction ) and they 
yielded results in consonance with their names; therefore they 
were tobe avoided in auspicious rites and particularly in marriage. 
The naksatras from that of birth were arranged in three groups 
of nine In the 2nd group the evil ones would be 13th, 14th and 
16th and in the 3rd group 31st, 38rd and 25th. It was laid down 
that, where the Moon 538 is powerful, the tarabala need not be 
considered, but where the Moon is weak (as in the dark half ), 
then the strength of taias is pre-eminent. Some authors regarded 
even the naksatra of birth as one to be avoided in certain rites, 
though acceptable in others. The evil tax&B called 'vipad', 
pratyari* and 'vadha' ware to be placated respectively by 
gifts to brahm anas of jaggery, salt, and gold with sesame.

In relation to marijage the BsjaaiartaBda^ Bays; tithi is 
decfcrad to have a single value while weekday is four times as 
good, nafaatra is 16 times better, yoga has a hundredfold result 
the Sun is a thousandfold efHeacions, while the Moon is effioa- 
oious one hundred thousand times; therefore leaving aside all 
other balas (astrological strengths) one should look to the 
strength of the Moon as ( the preeminent) strength. 

Xaw that in most countries inomding India the kingly 
office has been abolished, nmhurtas for coronation are of purely 
academic interest and therefore they are not set out here. Those 
interested may refer to BatnamalS XLV. 1-8, MuhartamSrtanda 
Vili. 1, Muharta-ointSmani X 1-4, Itejanltiratnakara pp. 82-84 
( ed. by K. P. Jayaswal ) 

One very important astrological subject was YStra, which 
has two meanings, viz. starting on a journey for going to tirihas 
or for earning wealth and marching out for victory by kings 
The first kind of yfitea is common to persons of all varnas, while 
the second is concerned only with ksatriyas or the king. Ml It 
appears that not only professed works on astrology but also the 
Smrtis, the ArthasSstra of Kautilya and FurSnas attached great 
importance to this subject. The ^sramavSsikaparva 9 * 7 18-18, 
Manu 721. 181-212, Matsya 240-243, Agni 233-^35, Yisnu-

of one who wants to be an invader* ) and X ( relating to war ) 
deal exhaustively with the subjeot of Tana or YStrU. The 
subjects of TstrS are summarised in the Brhat-samhita as

called Yogayatra is as follows: When a war 91 * is impending, to 
look out and wait for auspicious tithis, week-days, nafcsatras 
would involve a great delay. Therefore, the conjunctions and 
positions of certain planets in some fixed places (i e. yoga) is 
looked upon as the principal astrological matter The Yoga- 
y3tr3 and Ratnamala say : ws Just as even a poison may work 
like nectar when mixed (with other substances like milk) or just 
as even honey taken with ghee may act like poison, in the same 
way a planet giving up its own peculiar power yields results 
due to certain conjunctions. Kings march out on conjunctions, 
thieves and bards act on salainas, brahmanas act on the efficacy 
ofnaksatras, others (than these) secure their objects on the 
strength of muhfirtas. 

In Brhai-jafcaka { 28. 3 ) VarSha declares that he will enume- 
rate the topics concerning Yatra ws and verses 4-5 specify th 
topics, which agree in the main as to names of titles and their 
order with those in the Brhad-yogayatra chapters H-XK and 
not with those of the YogayStra All these works cover a very 
wide field and deal with many subjects that are not strictly 
astrological (as the quotation from the Brhatsamhita cited above 
in note 942 will show) Evan the purely astrological material 
runs into hundreds of verses and all that can be attempted here 
is to indicate very briefly some of the material 

If a person's rising sign at birth (lagna) is not known, then 
the lagna at the time of asking a question about Yatra may be 
used for astrological purposes. If such alagniis either Masa, 
Karka, Tula or Makara and is occupied by auspicious

planets or has an auspicious aspect -with any of them, than the 
questioner becomes successful in bis undertaking; but if 
tbe lagna, whatever it may be, is occupied by Mars and 
the Moon or if the Moon is aspeoted by Saturn or is in 
the 7th or 8th place and the Sun is in lagna or if a malefic 
planet occupies the lagna or the 4th, 7th or 8th place, then in 
all these cases the questioner would be defeated or destroyed 
(by his enemies ) ,OT The week-days were regarded as not of 
much importance in Yatra. The 6th, 8th, 12th tithi, Full Moon 
tithi, amavasya, rikta tithi (4th, 9th, 14th) and the first of the 
bright half wrae not commended for YatrS ( the rest were com- 
mended ) and yatra was commended on nine naksatras, viz. on 
AsvinI, Punarvasu, Anur&dha, Mrgasiras, Pusya, BevatI, 
Hasta, Sravana and Dhanistha The YogayatrS IV, Raja- 
martanda ( verses 695-752 ), BatnamSla X.V verses 1-74,

that would make a king successful A few are set out here by

one should avoid vrata and yStra for seven days thereafter; 
unseasonable rainfall does not create any defects to a king 
(starting on an invasion) if the ground is not (so muddy as to 
be ) marked with the soiled footprints of men and beasts ** The 
MuhGrtacintamani says 953 'one (the king) should not start as 
long as the periods of npanayana rite, the establishment of an 
itnHge, marriage, festivals (like hohka ) and impurity ( on brrth 
or death) have not come to an end and for seven days after 
unseasonable flashes of lightning, clouds, fall of rain or snow'. 

Going out of the house on the 9th tithi from the tithi of 
entrance, or entering a house on the 9th tithi after the tithi of 
leaving it and the 9th tithi itself are prohibited and the same 
applies to week-day and naksatra also. 954 

One should avoid starting in such a way as to face Venus. 
This belief is very old as the Santiparva and KahdSsa refer 
to it* 5 If the king or any one else has decided on a -very 
auspicious day and conjunction for marching out, but some 
unforeseen or urgent business prevents him from actually going, 
he should arrange for what is called prasthSna ( starting, but 
returning after going a very short distance or sending forward 
something on the auspicious day and starting within a certain 
number of days thereafter) A brahmana should 956 send out a 
eacred thread, (a ksatriya) a weapon, vaisya should send 
honey and a sadra should send out a pure fruit ( like coooamit ) 
or anyone of whatever varna may send whatever is dear to Ms 
heart The sages differed as to the distance one should proceed

for prasth&na and then return. Gargya* 7 said that he may 
prooeed from his own house to another house ( though very near ), 
Bhrgu holds that one should leave the boundaries of one's village 
and stay in another village, Bharadvaja provides that one may 
go as far as an arrow may be discharged and Vasistha says he 
must go out of the city The praht ftZEiw should be made in the 
direction in which one intended to proceed. If the king resorts 
to prasth&na he cannot stay in one place for ten days { i e he 
may Btay nine days ), a feudatory chief not for seven days and 
any other ordinary person not for five days and if a person stays 
beyond these limits he can only start again on a fresh good 
muhurta. 958 Even in modern times some people resort to this 
method of piasthSna and generally it is a friendly neighbour's 
house where the bundle of substances (some rice, betelnut, 
turmeric &c. ) is kept and taken away when actually starting on 
a journey. 

The Yogayatra XTTT. 3 provides that a king when starting 
on an expedition should see, hear and touch mangalas and enumer- 
ates them in verses 4-6, 10-15 at length. A few of them are 
noted here. Auspicious sounds are those of the recitations of the 
Veda and the auxiliary lores of the Yeda, of conches, drums, ol

Dharmasastras, Arthasastras, the Mahabharata and the Rama

Muhurtadarsana IX, Jyotistattva pp. 662-670, Muhurtacinta- 
mani XII. 1-29, Nirnayasindhu p. 364 deal with the construction 
of a house Matsya ( 252 2-4 ) names eighteen teachers of 
Vastusastra. A few astrological details are set out here Matsya 
( 253 1-5 ) states the results of beginning the construction of a 
house in the twelve months from Oaitra respectively as_ disease, 
fine cows, death, good servants and plenty of cattle ( in Asadha ), 
servants, loss, wife's death, wealth and crops ( in Kartika ), rice, 
danger from thieves, various benefits, gold and son (in Fhalguna ). 
The auspicious naksatras for commencing a house are Asvini, 
Bohinl, Mula, the three Uttaras, Mrgasiras, SvatI, Hasta and 
Anuradbs and all weekdays ( except Sunday and Tuesday ) are 
auspicious ( Matsya 253. 6-7 ) The Bajamartanda 9 " 1 puts 
many of the astrological requirements in two verses as follows; 
' the sages say that the auspicious work of ( constructing ) a 
house should be begun on the auspicious naksatras of Punarvasu, 
Fusya, Bohinl, Mrgasiras, Citra, Dhanistha, Uttara ( three of 
them ), BevatI, Sravana, Satabhisak, Anuradha, SvatI endowed 
with auspicious taras, on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday or 
Friday, on an auspicious Yoga, on a tithi other than rikta ( i. e 
4th, 9th, 14th) and on a day when there is noVisti.when 
beneficial planets occupy the kendra ( 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th 
places ), the 8th and 12th places, when malefic planets occupy 
the third, 6th and 11th places, when Jupiter is in the lagna or 
ftendra, or Venus occupies any of these latter and when the iSit 
of the owner is auspicious, and when any of the slhtra naksatras 
are rising, one should commence a house or make the first 
entrance into it. The Ratnamala says that the construction of 
a house should not be begun on com rasis. There are several 
other complicated calculations and diagrams employed in finding 
out a proper time for beginning the construction of a houso 
such as Stfa, vyaya and RahumuMiacakra that are pasBed over

Muhurtacintamani XDI, Nirnayasindhu p. 366 for rules about 

grha-pravesa (first entrance into house). The Hajamartanda 

says that* 2 first entrance into a newly built house should be 

made on the naksatras Revatl, Bhanistha, Satabhisak, Bohinl, 

the three Uttaras, on an auspicious week-day, when the moon is' 

not weak, on' a tithi other than nlOS He should enter the 

house on the floor of which plenty of flowers are strewn, which 

has good ornamental arches, which is adorned with jars filled 

with water, in which the gods have been worshipped with 

sandalwood paste, flowers and offerings and which rings with 

the recitation of ( the Yedas by ) brahmanas 

It may be stated here that some of the astrologicial require- 
ments about the construction of a house and the first entrance 
into a newly built house are observed even now. 

The proper times for the establishment of the images of gods 
are specified in many works such as Brhatsamhita 60. 20-21, 
Matsya-purana ( 264 ), Visnudharmottara HL 96, Bajamartanda

Jyotistattva pp 666-667 and 672-73, JNirnayasindhu pp. 334-335, 
Dharmasindhu p 318 The Brhatsamhita* 3 lays down the 
general rules for the establishment of the images of all gods, 
' In the northward passage of the sun, in the bright half, when 
the moon is in the virgo. of Jupiter, when the lagna is a sthira 
rasi and the navamamsa xasi of the lagna is sthira and beneficent 
planets occupy the kendra places or the 5th and 9th places in

Muhrirta for establishment of images 625 

ox mrdu or on Sravana, Pusya ox Svati naksatra, on a favourable 
week day ( other than Tuesday ) the establishment of the images 
of gods is commended'. The Matsya states (264. 3-18) that 
the establishment (prattstha) of the images of all gods leads to 
beneficent results when done in the months of Oaitra, Vaisakha, 
Jyestha, Magha or Phalguna, in the bright fortnight after 
daksinayana ends, on the tithis 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th, Full 
moon, 13th ( this is the best ), on sixteen named naksatras 
( excepting Bharanl, KrttikS, Aidra.Punarvasu, JSilesS, Magha, 
Pfirva^phalgunl, Citia, Vifcakha, Dhauistba, Satataraka), when 
the lagna has an aspect with the three beneficent planets 
Mercury, Jupiter and Venus, on an auspicious yoga, when the 
lagna or naksatra ( of establisher ) is free from malefic planets 
and on brtlhma muhfirta. 

The Bataamala 961 provides different naksatras for the 
establishment of the images of different gods, one interesting 
provision being that the image of Buddha was to be established 
on 6ravana naksatra.' In the case of the images of the Matrs, 
Bhairava, the Var&ha, Narasimha and Trivikrama incarnations 
and of Devi, the killer of Mahisasuia, establishment may he 
made even in Daksinayana. For the establishment of Linga 
special rules are provided for which Nirnayasindbu (pp. 335- 
336 ) may be consulted. 

The Bajamartanda* 5 provides that the 2nd, 3rd, 10th, 13th 
and 15th tithis are always commended for establishment of 
images of gods and even the 7th and 6th if the establisher likes. 

In the Indian Antiquary voL VL p. 363 we find an insori- 
tion of Oalukya king Mangalisa dated sake 500 (578-79 A. D.) 
recording the grant of a village named Lafijlsvara on the

Auspicious times were prescribed for wearing new garments 
for the first time The Nirnayasindhu quotes two verses* 6 
'It is desirable to put on new garments for the first time on 
naksatras of Asvinl, the three Uttaras, Punarvasu, Pusya, ReratI, 
EhanistbS. The following are the consequences of wearing ubw 
garments for the first time on the week days from Sunday 
respectively, viz becoming worn out, constantly wet with water, 
sorrow, wealth, knowledge, meeting with one's dear ones, 
becoming dirty; the woman who wears new garments or new 
ornaments for the first time on BohinI, Pusya, Punarvasu, 
UfctarS-Phalgunl and take3 a bath on SatatSraks naksatra does 
not stay with her husband (i e. she leaves him ) If a woman 
wears for the first time a garment dyed with Kttsrtmbha (safilower} 
or ornaments of gold, precious stones, coral, glass, conch-shell 
on Revatt, Asvinl, Dhanistha, Hasta, CitrS, SvStl, VisakhS, 
AnuradhS, that leads to male progeny, wealth and happiness, 
but if she puts on these on Rohinl, the three Uttaras, Punarvasu 
and Pusya, that lead3 to the unbappines3 of the husband. 

MuhSrtas are prescribed for beginning to take medioine in 
Rajamattanda ( folio 63a, verses 973 ff ), Jyotistattva pp 67S ff,

The foregoing discussion about the -h^WJhw* 

astrology and o mens havenad a very mm 



Ftrm hold of astrology on Indian minds 627 

of Indians for the last two thousand years or more. With regard 
to favourable and unfavourable omens Yarahamihira himself 
says ' If all favourable and unfavourable signs 953 were on one 
side and on the other side there is purity of heart, it is the latter 
that brings success' or ' on one side all omens, on the other the 
purity of the mind ( it is the mind that Counts ) , in a battle the 
mind may be suddenly seised with fear and even the wind may 
be the cause of victory or defeat*. The Matsyapurana after 
mentioning unusual occurrences and omens in connection with 
the march of a king on an invasion winds up as follows; 969 
' Auspicious planets are commended, particularly Jupiter ( as 
indicative of future success ). Belief in god, faith, honouring 
those that deserve honour-all these are commended and whatever 
else may be approved by one's conscience. In this matter 
( of invasion ) the peace of the mind is the highest indication of 
( coming } suocess, when all omens are on one side and the mind's 
peace on the other '. A purely astrological work like the Ratna- 
mala 9 " of Srlpati says the same thing. 

Owing to the almost universal belief in astrology, there was 
always the temptation to fasten fanoiful horoscopes on renowned 
avatSras and heroes Some Mss. of the Ramayana 971 contain 
a few details of the horoscope of Rama, the principal ones being 
that the lagna was Earfcata, in which the Moon and Jupiter 
were in conjunction and that five planets were in exaltation 
( new ) As the Moon was in Cancer, that planet was not in 
exaltation, since Taurus ( Bull ) is exaltation of the Moon. As 
Rama was born on Oaitra bright half 9th the Sun was in Mesa 
(Aries, Ram), which is also the ucca of the Sua Therefore,

Vido Pilloi's 'Indian Ephomoris* voLIparflpp 112-123 for 
discussion on Rama's horoscope. Kalidasa in the Raghuvamsa 
( I1L 13 ) statos that Raghu, the ancestor of Rama, was born 
when fivo planets were in exaltation andrwere not setting ( i e 
woro a good many degrees away from the Sun ) But he does 
not furnish tho lagna nor oven the month of his birth 

As regards Parosurama, tbe Nirnayasindhu quotes the 
Bh5igavfircanadIpikS w3 to the effect that Visnu himself was 
bora as tho son of Renuka on Vaisakha, bright half, 3rd tlthi, 
on Punorvasu naksatra in the first quarter of the night, when 
sue planets were in exaltation and Rshu was in Mithuna 
(Gemini, Twins). The Moon being in Punarvasu, that is 
either in Mithuna or Karkata, none of which is Moon's ucca all the 
remaining Bit planets must be held to be in exaltation. There- 
fore, Parasurama's horoscope must be supposed to be somewhat 
like this -

This horoscope cannot he right. The ucca signs of the San a: 
Mercury are Mesa (Aries) and Kanya (Virgo) respective 
Mercury cannot he so fax away from the Sun. So this is onlj 
fancy horoscope without any reality behind it 

Coming to historical times, Sftaabhatta 9 " in the Harsacari 
( 4th TJoehvasa ) tells us that Harsa was born on the 12th of t 
dark half of the month of Jyestha, on Krttiks naksatra, at nig] 
fall when all the planets were in exaltation. But Bana 
delightfully vague about the name of the lagna and it is z 
dear what he means by 'all planets' being in exaltation. . 
the end of Jyestha the Sun cannot be in Mesa, which is i 
ucca of the Sun, but may be in Vrsabha or Mithuna. 

The commentary Sudhavidyotinl 975 on the Sanndaryalahs 
a work attributed to the great philosopher Sanfcar&carya, funds! 
a horoscope of Sankaraoarya, viz. the lagna was Simha (Lie 
Jupiter in Fishes„Sun in Bam, Mercury was in Mithuna, Vei 
in Fishes, Saturn in Aquarius, Mars in Capricornus, Mc 
swallowed by Bshu (there was an eclipse) and in Hasta 
Oitra ( either in Kanys or Tula ). This horoscope also seems 
be a fancy one, since Mercury cannot be in Mithuna when I 
Sun is in Mesa.

Kalhana 976 in the RSjataranginl says that king Haraa of 
Kashmirf born 1059 AD., ruled 1089-1101 A.D ) was born on the 
Karkata lagna when Mars and Saturn were in the 5th house, 
Jupiter and Mercury in the 6th, Venus and the Sun in the 7th 
and the Moon in the 10th, that like Duryodhana he caused 
the extinction of his family as the astrological conduction at his 
birth indicated and as the authors of Samhttas declared that 
Kauravas destroyed their families because in their horoscopes 
the Moon, Venus and malefic planets were in the 10th, 7th and 
5th houses. This horoscope may be true, as Kalhana wrote only 
about fifty years after Harsa's death. 

Some inscriptions show that kings rewarded men for astro- 
logical devioes. For example, the Kadaba plates of the 
Bsstrakiita king Frabhutavar3a GovindarSja HC granted in iake 
735 to a Jain Afunt the village of Jalamangala for having warded 
off the evil influence of Saturn from VimalSditya, one of his 
governors m . 

Some of the previous volumes of this History ofDhanna- 
sasfcra have been criticized in two different ways by critics 
Some said that the author should have stopped at describing 
what transformations several of the topics dealt with underwent 
in the course of centuries and that no personal opinions should 
have been expressed about what changes should be made in the 
present or in future Another set of scholars complained feat 
the author should have expressed his personal views in many 
matters on which he expresses no definite opinion or does not 
advance a definite theory of his own. Bearing in mindjfcese 
criticisms the author proposes to indicate his own personal views 
on Indian Astrology in relation to Bharmas&sfcra. 

Modern scientists, philosophers, and theologians have gene- 
rally ignored astrology. Some ridicule it, some have condemned 
itas sSerstitious, as 'a delusion and a snare'. & spite of

astrological works. The mote effective method would perhaps 
have been to study the horoscopes of well-known poisons, to 
examine them by the rules of the astrologers themselves, to show 
that the application of their own rules leads to contradictions, 
confusion and absurd results and lastly to exhibit that the 
principles on which they evolve their rales and make their 
predictions have hardly any basis in fact and are imaginary. 

The fundamental doctrine of astrology that the Sun, the 
Moon and the planets exert some influence on terrestrial life and 
things is scientific *k The matter to be considered is whether 
the principles laid down in such astrological works as the 
Brhaflataka can stand rational analysis and tests. The author 
may state here that in his boyhood there was an astrologer called 
Mahadkar Jyotishi who never took money, who was employed 
as a bailiff in a civil court in the Bombay State and who cor- 
rectly stated the lagna and the positions of the planets in the 
horoscopes of people by looking for a few minutes at their faces, 
eyes and hands. The percentage of Ms mistakes in this respect 
was very low, barely one to five percent This led many educated 
people to believe inthoBe daysthat astrological works may be 
right so far that the physical features of a man may have some 
relation to the planets and their positions at his birth But, 
when he set about the business of Btating important facts about 
the lives of the persons whose horoscopes he correctly stated he 
often went wrong. One cannot also ignore the facts that some 
predictions turn out to be true. Unless one holds that they are 
all mere inexplicable co-incidences, they require to be carefully 
considered There is an astrological sanad (grant) which 
records most wonderful and detailed predictions that came out 
to be true. The grant was made in 1793 A D. tooneChinto 
MahadeoGolebyGovindrao Gaikwad, a scion of the Gaikwad 
famfiy that ruled in Gujarat at Baroda It recites"" that 
Gcmndrao Gaikwad had to leave his inheritance at Baroda and 
SSy^.^T 16 * twent y- fl « years, that thereafter he con- 
sulted Ghmto who was a great astrologer, and it was agreed that 
he should make a prediction after consulting iSrtras as to when 
Govradrao would be able to recover his inheritance and if the 
prediction proved true Govindrao agreed to donate to Ohinto a 
village yielding five thousand rupees ye arly revenne The grant

further recites that the astrologer gave to Govfrdrao a closed letter 
which stated that the Peshwa at Poona would call Govindrao to 
his presence in the first watch of BWday, 8th tithi, MSrgaslrsa 
dark half of iake 1714 ( 7th December 179Z A. D. ) when the sign 
ascending would beDhanus (Archer) and, after taking from 
Govindrao an agreement to give certain cash and to oede some 
territory, would restore him to his inheritance and honour him 
by the present of three dtrpeadi ( turban ornaments or spray 
of gems) containing 45 rubies and 14 diamonds (out of which 
three would be large and eleven small), one pearl cores): ( con- 
taining about 496 pearls ), one elephant and one blue horse. It 
is further recited in that sanad that the letter stated that even 
after this Govindrao would have to stay for eleven months in 
Poona out of which he would suffer for eight months great 
calamities, that thereafter the Peshwa would return to Govindrao 
the territories he had agreed to cede, that he would then return 
to Baroda in the month of Magna. The sanad in the end recites 
that all this that was contained in the closed letter came to be 
true to the very letter and therefore as agreed before the village 
of Ayana was donated. It would be noticed in what details the 
prediction entered. There is no reason to doubt the solemn 
words of this grant that everything as predicted came out to be 
true. How the astrologer pointed out all these details is not at 
all clear, as no astrological work that I know of, enters into such 
detailed predictions or gives rules for that purpose. 

Just as the Sun and the Moc-n influence terrestrial pheno- 
mena such as the tides, the author feels from the instance of the 
Mahadkar Jyotishi mentioned above and from the hundreds of 
horoscopes that he has seen that it might be possible to state 
the physical characteristics of the persons conoerned from their 
horoscopes. But no such efforts have been made by anybody 
nor published if made. The author, however, feels also that 
hardly anything can be said about the mental capacities of a 
person or the fortunes and vxcissitudeB of his life from his horo- 
scope. It would not be relevant to enter into further discussion 
of this matter in this work. 

What firm grip astrological considerations had on the minds 
ofneonle and writers on astrology is demonstrated by certain 
rulSfai astrological works about a child's birth on AslesS or 
Serfhinaksatraor on what is called Goho* « «^*f£ 
wftWeoommended that the innocent and helpless infant 
£"«XS5»-a very unlucky times should be abandoned 



Concerning child born on untucks itaksatra 633 

in spite of what love and pity should dictate. We have Been above 
that the roots of this belief go hack to the Atharvaveda (vide 
note 753 above). Some verses are translated here. Garga 
quoted in ErayogapSriiata 880 prescribes 'a child born on 
Gandanta by day causes the father's death, one born in the 
night on Gandanta causes the mother's death and one horn at 
twilight oauses its own death; no Ganda is safe (free from 
danger ). Abandonment of children bom on Ganda is laid down 
or ( the father ) should avoid seeing it or hearing its cry for Biz 
months '. Bhallsta 581 provides ' a child horn during the period 
of the last ghakkct of JyesthS and the first two ghatikss of Mala 
should be abandoned or the father should not see its face for 
eight years; in the case of a child born on the first quarter (of 
Mala ) the father dies, if horn in the second Quarter of Mala the 
mother dies, if born in the third quarter there is loss of wealth 
and ( birth in ) the 4th quarter ( of Mala ) is auspicious ; the same 
results follow in the case of hirth onfislesa but in the reverse 
order from the last quarter of it.' The author knowB the case of 
his father's first cousin who was horn to his father when the 
latter was over forty years of age and when he had been long 
and anxiously waiting for a son, that was horn on an unlucky 
quarter of Mala naksatra. The astrologers recommended that 
the child be abandoned at the foot of a sacred tree. The father 
ahsolutely refused to accept the advice, saying that he would 
rather gladly die than abandon an innocent and anxiously 
desired son. The author saw the father when he had lived 
beyond 80, and the son also reached a pretty old age. 

Ptolemy subscribed to the geocentric hypothesis and in order 
to account for the puzzling movements of the planets adopted 
the theory of eocenfcrio orbits and epicycles Though his theories 
viewed in the light of modem astronomical science were wrong,

lie and his followers could predict eclipses. That suggests that 
correot inferences may be drawn in certain oases from premises 
some of which may he wrong. Besides, no one appears to bare 
examined the theory of VarShamihira and his followers that a 
horoscope is only like a sketch or plan that indicates only future 
trends in a man's life depending on his actions in his previous 
life or lives. It is not probable that this theory will ever be 
tested and examined. There are weighty and practical reasons 
for this. Millions of people are not at all interested in knowing 
what they did in their past lives nor do many of them believe in 
metempsychosis or the theory of past and future lives of the 
individual souL They are mainly concerned with predictions 
about their future. The theory of horoscopes being only sketches 
ox maps indicating future tendencies cuts the very ground 
from under the feet of professional astrologers They would, if they 
persisted only in telling their clients mere future tendencies and 
did not furnish positive predictions, find that their occupation 
was gone. In the minds of millions not only in India but in many 
parts of the world astrology is a living faith and it appears that 
neither scientists nor historians can possibly destroy suoha 
tenaciously held and deep-seated belief. But the belief that 
planets cause persons to do certain things is likely to have 
serious consequences The sense of moral responsibility for aH acts 
done by a person will bs impaired by such a belief; and a person 
guilty of a crime may plead ( or may at least believe ) that he 
was helpless before the influence of the heavenly bodies. 

Before dosing this brief account of Indian astrology I must 
in a few words advert to a work called Bhrgusamhits in Sanskrit 
Which is supposed to contain numberless horoscopes with 
descriptions of persons born on the twelve rasa ^ Mesa ° n " 
wards, references to the deeds of such persons in P™^ 1 "^ 
£" horoscope with the positions of the »««*»*£ 
important happenings in each person's present Ma £«&»££ 
'of his birth to his death. Persons who profess to have m their 
MMNtanChe Bhrgusamhife are generally averse to showing 

examined four Mss in ^""J^a^ ^d to have been 



BhrgusaAiliitS 685 

Sana whioh contain about 600 horoscopes each of the four 
lagnas, Mesa, Vrsabha, Mithuna and Karka, deaoiibing in 15 to 
20 verses each of the horoscopes in the same lagna but with 
different positions of the planets in each case. 3STo BhrgusamhitS 
can be accommodated even in a big library if it contains des- 
criptions of all possible horoscopes in 15 or 20 verses each. There 
are twelve rasis as lagnas, 9 planets ( including Kahu and Eetu ) 
and twelve bhavas. By permutations and combinations of these 
there would be crores of possible horoscopes and if at least 15 
verses were to be assigned to each there would be millions on 
millions of verseB. Hence describing a horoscope by extracts 
from Bhrgusamhita is often a fraud. 

In Indian Astrology the most important matters are the 
rasis, the planets and the twelve bhavas ( or places ). Take the 
rasis first. What is the reason for naming certain groups of stars 
or constellations as Mesa or Vrsabha &o. ? There are no Bams 
and Bulls in the sky. Some observers on the earth imagined 
that certain constellations presented to the eye the appearance of 
certain animals, human figures and mythical beings. As shown 
above ( p. 565 ) the Chinese and Japanese name them differently. 
Therefore, there is a great element of arbitrariness and ima- 
ginary analogies in naming the so-called rasis. Once named, 
the rasiB are classified in various ways and predictions are based 
on the olass to which a rasi belongs. All these classifications are 
based on ideas of symmetrical sequence and fancy. Why should 
Mesa and Mithuna ( which is represented as ' twins ' man and 
woman) be called male, while Vrsabha and Vrsoika be classed 
as female ? There is no explanation except this that the twelve 
rasis had to be classified in two groups, male and female, and 
symmetry required that they be alternately called male and 
female. For the same reason of symmetrical order Mesa and 
Karka are grouped as caro ( mobile ), while Simha and Vrsoika 
are classified as sthira (firm immobile). The Sun (the giver 
of all light and support of the world ) is called Jcrura or papa 
( a malefic ) planet along with Mars and Saturn, while Jupiter 
and Venus are classed as beneficent and the waning Moon is 
also held to be malefic Here association of ideas and analogy 
play a great part Jupiter and Venus are both brilliant and 
white or whitish, while Mars is red (the colour of blood). Be- 
sides, the first two are supposed to be the preoeptors of the gods 
and amras respectively. Therefore, they are beneficent and the 
blood-red Mars is malefic The Sun, Jupiter and Mars are said 



686 Bhtary of SharmaMstra {SeaB,Gh.2VlI 

to be masculine, the Moon and V eDna feminine and Mem ^ 
and Saturn neuter for the same reason, via association of ideas 
and analogy. The Moon and Venus are beautiful and mild, 
therefore they are feminine, while the Sun (that has fierce heatt 
Mare ( with Hood red hue ) and Jupiter (the Scarya of the gods) 
are masculine. Modern astronomy declares that the Moon is dry 
and waterless and contains the remains of extinct volcanoes; 
yet if the astrologers he followed we shall have to regard the 
Moon as feminine. In classical Sanskrit the Moon is called 
'SaiSnka'. The Japanese Moon Gtoddess Gwaten is drawn 
with a hare. Vide figure opposite p. 18 in Prof. Zlnuers * The 
Btars above us.' Then we may consider the doctrines of 
avagrhoa and uceas (exaltations of planets). There are twelve 
rSsis and seven planets; five must be given two rasis as svagrhas 
and the other two only one rssi each as svagrha. The Br J. 
assigns only one rasi as stagrha to the Sun and Moon, -vis. 
Simha ( Lion ) and Kafka ( Crab ) respectively, while two rSsis 
axe assigned to each of the other five planets. There is absolu- 
tely no logical or satisfactory explanation of this. Moreover, 
in assigning two rasis as svagrhas the only principle that seems 
to have been followed is that of sequence, viz. one rasi beyond 
Simha and one beyond Sarka i. e. Xanys and Mithuna to 
Mercury and in the same way to the remaining planets in the 
order of distance. The result iB that Vxsabha and Tula ( Scales } 
axe the svagrhas of the beautiful and brilliant planet Venus and 
Dhanus (Axohar) and Mlna (Sashes) are the svagrhas of 
Jupiter. If one turns to the doctrine of exaltation, no rational 
or astronomical explanation is given why Aja ( goat ), Vxsabha 
(Bull), Mahara, Kanys, Xarka, Mlna and Tula should be the 
uceas of the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus 
and Saturn respectively. The naming and arrangement of the 
twelve bhavas hardly follows any rational basis. One may at 
the most concede that the first bhava in which the sign rising at 
a person's birBi is placed is plausibly oafled Umu (body) and 
that regarding the 7th bhSva therefrom as the one on which love 
and marriage may he considered has also some plausibility. 
Birth and death are the two ends of a person's life. If the first 
hhava is called tana, the bhsva about death should be the 12th, 
the last, but in the Brhaj-jataka and other works, it is the 8Hi 
hhsva that is called mrtyu ( death). Some of the bhsvas. have 
too many matters crowded into them. For example, the «fa 
bbava is supposed to he the one on which a person's relate. 
SSs7bZe,haPPiaeBS »d conveyance are to he considered. 



Matters depending on 6th bhSva 637 

The fifth bhava is concerned with sons, intellect, learning, 
speech. Supposes that that bhava is very favourably placed, 
the prognostications would have to be that the person would 
have many sons, he would be a learned man and a good speaker. 
But all these very rarely go together. A man of great intellect 
has often no sons, while a very learned man is often not a good 



Then there is the question of friendships and enmities 
among planets. There is no rhyme nor reason in this respect. 
Why Venus, a beneficent planet in theory, should he the enemy 
of the Sun, when Jupiter another beneficent planet is a friend, 
is something which it is difficult to understand or explain. 
Besides, these relationships are not reciprocal The Moon has 
no enemy, but from the point of view of Venus, the Moon is the 
enemy of Venus. Mercury ( mythologically the son of the 
Moon ) is said to be a friend of the Moon, but from the point of 
view of Mercury the Moon is its enemy. There is a further 
strange matter to be noticed. As men fight among themselves, 
it has been supposed that the planets (excepting the Sun and 
the Moon) fight among themselves 9 * 3 (vide note 872 above). 
Besides there are thousands of minor planets between Mars and 
Jupiter and ancient and medieval horoscopes took no account 
of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto among the planets nor of 
the numerous satellites of Jupiter. 

Another important doctrine in Indian astrology is that of 
drsti ( glance, aspect) which has been explained above (note 
876 ). That doctrine had some plausibility when the distances 
between the planets and the stars were not known. But in view 
of modern astronomical knowledge the doctrine of the drstis of 
planets has hardly any meaning. Every planet and star really

The position then is tills that tho observer on tho earth sees the

to modem astronomy tho Moon it only about two hundred and 
forty thousands mile* from tho earth, Vonus a few acres of 
miles from it and Aldobaran billions of billions of miles away. 
Thoy appear to bo near only on account of tho effect of perspec-

Addition of astrological details in later works 63§ 

to oonolude that the rules of astrology should have very little 
influence in determining the times of their undertakings. It 
appears that astrological details which were conspicuous by then- 
absence in ancient DharmasSstra works have attained so much 
growth during the last two thousand years that the fundamental 
religious requirements have been smothered thereby. Those 
who believe that all events affecting men are necessitated by the 
planets and stars appear to go wrong in two ways. They thereby 
deprive God of control and providence in human affairs and 
they take away man's free will The dilemma is that if astrologers 
cannot stop or foil what the planets indicate, what is the nse or 
benefit of their prescience; if they can stop or frustrate what is 
deemed to be fated to happen how can they support the thesis 
that planets compel events 1 

The question arises then how far religious matters, such as 
tTpanayana and marriage, should be regulated by astrological 
considerations It has been already shown above ( p 606 and 
p 610) how the v astrological requirements for TTpanayana and . 
marriage were very few and simple in the times of the grhya- 
sutras and the Manasmrti ( i. e several centuries before the 
christian era), how later writers went on adding one requirement 
after another and how even in the 11th century A. D. orthodox 
works like the Rajamartanda advised neglect of all astrological 
requirements in the case of girls whose marriages had to be 
postponed very long for some reason or other. Therefore, in 
respect of religious ceremonies like TTpanayana and marriage 
the author would advise, as a first step towards getting rid of 
oppressive and meaningless astrological conditions, that people 
should revert to the simple rules of the grhyasutras and Manu. 
There axe two views on the observance of the ruleB about the 
details of religious rites. One is that a person 983 need not go 
beyond the provisions contained in the grhyasutra of his own 
Veda or ISakha and that when one observes those provisions he 
would be deemed to have performed all that the sSstra requires 
of him. The second view (held by a majority of medieval 
writers of digests) was that one should include in a religious 
rite details mentioned in works of other sakhSs, though not 
mentioned in his own sSkha, provided the former details are not

CHAPTER XVm 

Calendar, eras, various reckonings about years, 
months &c. 

In order to be able to perform watas and celebrate utsaias 
at the proper times and in order to find ont the appropriate 
times for religious rites like sacrifices, npanayana and marriage 
people require a calendar or almanac. A calendar is a methodi- 
cal combination or book about days, months and years for the 
purpose of registering in advance religious festivals and astro- 
nomical or astrological phenomena and for purposes of civil 
life. In India about thirty calendars are in use by Christians, 
Parsis, Moslems and Hindus Confining oneself to Hindus there 
is a bewildering variety of calendars in use at present. Some 
are based on the data of the SuryasiddhSnta and some on those 
of the Sxyasiddhanta, while others follow comparatively later 
manuals like the Grahalsghava; some begin the year with 
Caitra iuhla pratipad ( or pratipada ), others with Eartika snkla 
pratipad and there are small traots like the Halar 985 prant ( in 
Eathiawad) where the year begins with the 1st day of the 
bright half of Asadha. Gujarat and North India except Bengal 
use the Vikrama era, while the Deccan and South India gene- 
rally employ the Saka year, but Kashmir follows the Laulala 
reckoning. In some parts (North India and Telangana) and 
communities the months are pixrnimSnta ( i. e end with Bull 
Moon ), while other parts ( Bengal, MahSrastra and south India ) 
follow the amanta ( month ending with amavSsyS ) reckoning. 
The result is that some fasts and celebrations universally 
observed throughout India such as the EkSdasI and Sivaratri 
fasts and the celebrations of the birth of Srlkrsna are observed on 
two different days in different parts of the country and by different 
sects and there is a difference of one month between the days of 
some observances i. e while on the pSrnimSnta reckoning a cer- 
tain festival may be observed in Asvina dark half, the same month

medieval calculations based on Aryabhata whioh produce less

one ) issued under the authority of the reyos of the principality 
of that name. The Srlrangam pafioanga ( a Vskya one ) is used 
by the Snvaisnavas, while followers of another Vaisnava sect, 
the Madhvas, have a paficanga of their own. The Kanjanur 
pafioanga is the most common Vskya pafioanga used by the 
smfirtas who do not usethe drk-gcmta pafioanga issued under 
the authority of the Sankargearya. The Telugus follow the 
Siddhanta-candra* 8 pafioanga based on the Grahalaghava of 
Ganesa composed in iake 1448 (1520 A. D.). In Malabar the 
people have a drk-pafioBnga, but it is based on a revision of the 
old Malabar system oalled Farahita and is not the drk-pafioanga 
followed by the Tamils. The Telugus follow the Csndra reckon- 
ing and begin their year called Yngadi from Caitra sukla, while 
the Tamils follow the Saura reckoning, start their Caitra with 
Mesa Visu, though, their vratas and religious ceremonies being 
based on ttthts, they have to follow the Candra-mana, Bengalis 
use solar months and lunar days with triennial adjustment by 
the insertion of an intercalary month

siddhanta (relied' on in Travancore, Malabar, and by the 
Madhvas in Karnataka and in Tamil Distriots of Madras State ) 
and the Brahma-siddhsnta (followed in Gujerat and Bajputana). 
The last, however, is losing ground in favour of the first In 
the Siddhantas calculations are made from the epoch of the

on the Siddhantas are used to prepare pa&oangas, such as 
Makarandain Bengal and the Grahalaghava of Ganesa;the 
tables of the latter called Titbiointamani are nsed in the Deccan, 
Central India and some other parts of India. There are two 
important points of difference between the Siddhantas among 
themselves viz the length of the year ( but the difference is only 
of a few vtpalas ) and the second is the number of revolutions of 
the Moon and the planets in the Kalpa or .Mahayuga or Yuga. 
The Siddhantasiromani ( X 6 ) speoifies the matters with which a 
siddhanta must deal, the very first of which is the enumeration of 
the units of time from truti up to the end of pralaya. 

It should not be supposed that India is singular in this 
respect. The present European calendar is also very unsatis- 
factory. Originally it was Julius Caesar who introduced a 
revised calendar in 46 B with the provision that every 4th 
year was to be a leap year. But his calculations were not very 
accurate and the result was that by 1582 A.D. the spring equinox 
occurred on 10th March instead of on 21st March Pope 
Gregory 3HI declared that 4th October 1582 was to be followed 
by 15th October ( i. e. ten days were dropped ). He further 
provided that century years were not to have a leap year unless 
they could be divided by 400 (so that years 1700, 1800, 1900 of 
the christian era have no additional day, but 2000 would have 
one) Even so, there iB still a slight error, hut only after more 
than 33 centuries one day would have to be dropped. The 
Gregorian year is longer by 26 seconds than the correct length 
of the year arrived at by modern astronomical calculations. 
Protestant England did not follow Pope Gregory's reform till 

1750 A. D. when Acts were passed whereby 2nd of September 
1752 was to be followed not by 3rd September but by 14th 
September (dropping eleven days) Vide 'the Calendar New 
Style Act* 1750 (24 Geo. 2, chapter 23 ) and the Calendar Act 

1751 ( 25 Geo. 2, ohapter 30 ), which changed the year beginning 
from 25th March to 1st January and embodied the reforms made 
by Pope Gregory 2HI. The European calendar is still very 
inconvenient Under it a month may have from 28 to 31 days, 
the quarters of a year consist of 90 to 92 days, the two halves of 
the year ( January to June and July to December ) contain 
respectively 181 (or 182) and 184 dayB, working days per month 
vary from 24 to 27 days and years and months begin on different

Fundamental periods of Ume 645 

seasons). The years are the constituents of eras that are vital 

for chronology and history. Though the fundamental periods of 

time are the same, there are variations in the arrangement of 

days to form months and years, about the sub-divisions of the 

day, about the commencement of the day, about the divisions 

of the year among seasons and months, about the number of 

days in each month and in the year and about various kinds of 

months. The great time measurers are the Sun and the Moon. 

The day is due to the revolution of the earth round its axis. 

The month is mainly a lunar phenomenon and the year is due 

to the apparent motion of the Sun ( but in reality it is due to 

the revolution of the earth round the Bun ). The tropical year 

is the time of the passage of the Sun from one vernal equinox 

to the next. The latter is shorter than the sidereal year (i. e. the 

time between the two successive arrivals of the Sun at the same 

fixed star) by about 20 minutes as the vernal equinox point 

shifts to the west at the rate of about SO seconds per year. 987 A 

modern calendar mentions the current year ( by some era ), the 

month and the day of the month and generally the week-day, 

besides several other matters of religious and social interest. 

The eras and accurate knowledge of the length of the year and 

the month came to man rather late. The synodic month is a 

little over S9 § days, while the tropical year is a little less than 

365J days. These are incommensurable periods. For ordinary 

life and calendars whole days are required; besides, the starting 

of the year and the month must be properly defined and must 

correspond to seasons and some era -must be used These are 

the requirements of a calendar which has to be used for civil and 

religious purposes The complexity of calendars is due mainly 

to the incommensurability of the above two astronomical 

987 Besides the two motions of the earth ( vie its daily revolution 
on its own axis and its yearly revolution ronnd the sun ) there is a third 
motion which is not so well-known. The earth is sot a sphere, its equa- 
torial diameter facing longer than Its polar diameter. The result Is that 
there is a mass of matter bulging out at the equator which is in excess of 
what it would be if the earth were perfectly spherical, The earth's axis 
has a slight coiical wobbling motion like that of a toy top and it describes 
a cycle in oboat25800 years, the yearly shift being about 50"-2 seconds, doc 
to the pull of the sun and the moon on the equatorial bnlge. This canses 
the appearance of the fixed stars and even the pole-star changing their 
positions from century to century or from period to period Vide Sir

periods. The Moslems solved it by ignoring the length, of the 
tropical year and holding fast by the Moon as the measurer of 
time. They had a purely lunar year. The result was that the 
Moslems' year was of 354 days and that in about 33 years all 
their festivals travelled through all the months of the year. On 
the other hand, the anoient Egyptians ignored the moon as the 
measurer of time and their year was of 365 days ( IS months of 
30 days each plus five epagomenal, i e additional days ). Their 
priests stuck to this system for 3000 years, they had no leap 
years or intercalary months. Most anoient peoples including 
Indians followed a lnni-solar calendar and tried to adjust the 
lunar months to the solar year by the system of intercalary 
months.' It has been seen above (p. 489 note 710) that even 
the Rgveda speaks of an additional month (in I 35 8 } but how 
it was arrived at and where in the scheme of months it was intro- 
duced we do not know. We know that the VedSngajyotisa 988 
added two months in five years. The people of those anoient 
times had to solve the problem of adjusting the reckoning of the 
months by the moon and the years by the sun. People wanted 
to know in advance when the Full Moon or Mew Moon on which 
many anoient festivals were celebrated may be expected, when 
to expect monsoon or winter, when to prepare ground for sowing 
and when to sow. Sacrifices had to be in spring and other 
seasons, as also on Few Moon and Full Moon. The lunar year 
of 354 days was less by about 11 days than the solar year. 
Therefore, the seasons would shift back if the lunar year -alone 
ware observed. Hence intercalary months were introduced by 
several nations. The Greeks had the « Ootaeteris • ( eight years 
ovole), that contained 99 months of whwh three were inter- 
Sry via. in the 3rd, 5th and 8th years Then was introduced 
SS& °yole of 19 years in which occurred seven inter- 
^ months* 19 X 12 plus 7 = 835 ). Otastead ( m American

Eras 647 

The use of eras in Indiafor oalendrical purposes is not much 
older than about two thousand years. Continuous era reckoning 
first began to be employed in the records of the Lado-Soythian 
kings that ruled over modern Afganistan and North Western 
India between about 100 B. O. and 100 A. D. This is not pecu- 
liar to India, most of the anoient civilizations suoh as those of 
Egypt, Babylon, Greece and Borne did not employ a continu- 
ously running era till late in their careers. In the JyotirvidS- 
bharana ( which is a later fabrication, though it professes that it 
was finished in gatakah 3068 i. e. 33 years before the christian 
era ) mentions the names of six persons as the founders of eras 
in Ealiyuga, viz Yudhisthira, Vikrama, SalivShana, Vijayabhi- 
nandana, HTsgarmna, Kalkm 98 and states that their eras 
respectively last for 3044, 135, 18000, 10000, 400000, 821 years. 
In ancient 990 countries no continuous era was used, but only 
regnal years were employed In India also Asoka employs only 
regnal years in his edicts ( e. g the 4th pillar edict at Laurlya- 
nandana-garh and the 5th pillar edict at Bsmpurra, O LL voL I 
pp. 147, 151, were engraved in the 26th year of his kingship ).

- had six seasons, twelve months and 30 days in each month. The Arthasastra 
here says that there were sit fortnights of 29 days each and so the (lunar 
year was of 354 days In order to bring it in line with the solar year an 
intercalary month had to be resorted to.

vela (generally assigned to the 2nd century B.O.) uses only 
regnal years and no era ( vide E. I. vol. 20 p 71 at pp 79-80 ). 

A variety of eras have been used in India for hundreds of 
years; this has created a great deal of confusion m chronology 
and history. For the lists of eras now in use or met with in 
inscriptions and Sanskrit literature, vide Cunningham onlndian

only a few eras of importance will be briefly dealt with. Alberuni 
(Saohau vol II. p. 5) names five eras, viz of Sri Harsha, 
VikramSditya, Saka, Valabha and Gupta He gives two 
different versions about the first and leaves the question 
undecided. 

Differing views were held even in ancient tunes, as to when 
the Kaliyuga "* started and what event the Kaliyuga era 
commemorates. At present the Kaliyuga era is supposed to 
have started in 3102 B. C and a past Kaliyuga year is to he 
arrived at by adding 3101 to the A. D. years. There are four 
principal views about the starting point, viz. (1) the starting 
point is when Yudhisthira ascended the throne, (2) it is 36

' Ancient Indian chronology' Prof Sen-Gupta after a lengthy and somewhat 
vehement argument concludes that the date of the Bharala battle is 2449 
B C. and that the year 3102 B. C. for it is wrong ( p 1-59 ). Vide C R.C.

of Pankrar. is mentioned as the performer of an AsVamedha sacrifice in Sat

years later when. Yndhisfhira crowned as king Parfksit, &e 
grandson of Arjuna; (3) according to the FurSnas ^ Kaliyuga 
started when Krsna passed away (vide Yisnuptnana IV. 24 108

to the starting of Safca-fcaTa, Tndhisfhira era started Le. 653 
years after the start of Kaliyuga according to the 2nd -view. 
The Aihole inscription appears to follow the 2nd view, sines it 
equates "* 55s iaka year with 3735 Kalxyuga year (past). One 
of the earliest references to the Kaliyuga era is that by 
Aryabhata who states that he was twenty-three years old when 
3600 years of Kaliyuga had expired (Le he was bom in 476 
AD.). 933 There i3 an early Cola record dated 4044 of the 
Kaliyuga era (i.e 943 A. D.) Tide JRAS for 1911 pp.6S9- 
694 for several instances of the employment of Kaliyuga 
era in inscriptions. Medieval Indian astronomers believed that 
all planets (including the sun and the moon) were together at 
sunrise on Sunday of Gaitra sukla pratipad at the beginning of 
Kaliyuga and also of Kalpa, 5551 It is suggested by modem writers 
like Burgess and Dr. Saha that this epoch was arrived at by 
astronomical calculations carried back-ward at a late period and 
is a mere fiction (vide p. 253 of the C. R. C. Eeport). It is rather 
difficult to hold that this was all pure imagination on the part

Some inscriptions are also dated in the era of the Malava-gasa 
(Malava tribe), as e g the Mandasor J"" Inscription of 
Naravarman. The Krta and Malava era are held to be identical 
and the inscriptions so far discoverved as dated in these two eras 
are found in eastern Rajasthan and Western Malva. It is farther 
to be noted that, whereas we have inscriptions in 282 and 295 of 
the Krta year, no inscription of the Malava era has yet bean 
found that is dated so early. It is possible that Krta is the 
earlier name and when the Malavas adopted the same era it came 
to be called 'Malava-ganamnata' or 'Malava-gaoa-sthiti.' But

480 and also the M&lava era year 461. The author doe3 not think 
it possible that the word Etta was applied to the era because it was 
believed at its foundation that the Ktfca-yuga had started. It is 
possible that Krta has the same meaning a&siddha (just as 
krtenta means siddMnta) and it indicates that it was establi- 
shed by agreement among certain people. The Yikrama era is 
specifically mentioned by name only from about 8th or 9th 
century A. D Wl2a Besides, the Yikrama era has hardly ever 
been employed in Sanskrit astronomical works and it is generally 
desiganted samiat to distinguish it from the saka era. The 
Yedar&ve Inscription of Calukya Vikramaditya YI shows that 
that king superseded tbasaka era and started aGaluky a Yikrama 
era the first year of which was 1076-77 A. D. Vide Bombay 
Gazetteer vol 1 part % p 447 and 477 (and I. A. YII pp. 61-66

Almost all astronomical works in Sanskrit from about 500 
A D employ the Saka era Why the Saka era is so called, 
whether it was to commemorate the coming of the famous 
Kusana king Kaniska to the throne or when and where it came 
to be first used are among the most difficult and unsolved 
problems of Indian History and Chronology. In one of the 
earliest inscriptions expressly dated in the Saka era, viz that of 
Calukya king MangaleSvaxa in 500 saka ( expired, t e, 578 AD. ) 
it is cited as the era of the crowning of the Salsa™ 3 king

century of the saka era *** In later medieval and modern times 
(as also in the Jyotirvidabharana ) the saka era goes by the 
name of Salivahana. But the form Salivahana as that of the 
era occurs only in the inscriptions of the ISth or 14th century 
A D. e g. the two earliest inscriptions so far discovered men* 
tioning the word Salivahana are those recorded in the plate of 
Devagiri Yadava king Krsna dated in Salivahana era 1173 (1251 
A. D. )*"* and the plate of Bukka I dated in saka 1276, current 
( 1354 A. D. ). Vide No 455 in Kielhorn's list in B L VIL It to 
possible that the name Satavahana ( mentioned in Harsa-oarita 
as the composer of the GathasaptasatI) was changed into 
Salavahana, then into Salivahana and this conjecture is support- 
ed by the fact that in the GathasaptasatI ( V. 67 ) king Salahana 
( a Prakrit form of Satavahana ) is mentioned ; ' only two know 
how to raise high distressed families (by ilesa, the family of 
Aparna ), viz. Siva beloved of the heart of Gaurl or the king 
Salahana (Satavahana)' Vide O. R C. Beport pp. 244-256 for

he attacks some of the downright and very emphatic assertions 
of Dr. W. W. Tarn in « the Greeks in Baotria and India * 

Another era, which is current even now in Kashmir, is the 
Saptarsi era, also called Laukika era. According to the Baja- 
taranginl the Laukika year 24 was equal to saka 1070

Nine lands of time reckonings 657 

reckonings of time, viz. Brahma ( of Brahma ), Daiva ( of the 
gods ), Mfinusa ( human ), piteya < of the Pitas ), Saura, Savana, 
Candra, NakBatra and Barhaspatya, but that in ordinary wordly 
matters only five of these are employed. The Vedanga-jyotisa 
appears to refer to four when it says that in a yuga ( of five years ) 
there are 61 savana months, 62 lunar months, 67 naksatra months. 
Hemadri ( on Kala, p. 9 ) dwells on only three of these year 
reckonings, viz. candra, saura, and savana, while Madhava ( in 
Kalanirnaya-karikas 11-12 ) speaks of two more, viz Naksatra 
and Barhaspatya. The Visnudharmottara speaks of four (not 
mentioning Barhaspatya). The three mentioned by Hemadri 
are those most employed in religions and civil matters, and 
dharmasastra works are specially concerned with them, while the 
other two are rarely referred to in the latter. A candra month vaa 
is a time period from the end of one amSvasys ( Iff ew Moon ) to 
the next amaySsya and twelve such months make the candra year 
of 354 days It is also called a lunation. The length of a candra 
month varies from 29. 246 to 29. 817 days owing to the eccentri- 
city of the moon's orbit and other causes and its average period is 
29.53059 days. A saura month is the time taken by the sun 
to move through one sign of the zodiac ; twelve such months con- 
stitute the solar year, 1013 and the first day of a solar year is the

!J>m,ll 3a^<*\tdq verse 31 (Sham Shastri, ed.) The Vedinga-jyotisa 
holds that 366 days constitute a year. The modern Surya-slddhanta 
says that thero ate 365 258756 days in a year. The other siddhantas slightly 
vary from this According to modern astronomy the year consists 
of 365 242196 days Vide ■ Indian Cultnre ■ vol VIII. pp. 114-116

The meaning of the above verses is : a solar year contains 366 days. It has 
six rtus ( seasons ) and two asanas, twelve months, these multiplied five 
times make a yuga.' It does not profess to be a treatise on astronomy as then 
known, but its aim was a thoroughly practical one viz, to enable the Vedic

to the sign jh in the day time then that day fa the first day of the 
month. If the entry u in the night, the next day is the fin* 
day of the month. The time of entry of the sun into a rasi difiara 
from almanac to almanao and the result is that the entry may be 
before sunset in one almanao and after sunset in another 
Therefore, there may be the difference of one day as to the first 
day of the month. Owing to the adoption of different ayanSm- 
das and the difference in the length of the year, the Drk, Vfikya 
and SIddhSnta almanacs may differ about the fiiBt day of the year, 
about Pongal and other festivals. A S&vana year is of 12 
months of SO days each, the day being counted from one sunrise 
to the next. A naksatra month is the time taken by the moon 
to pass through the 27 naksatras; the Barhaspatya year is the 
time taken by Jupiter to pass through one sign of the zodiac 
( 1 e about 361 days ). According to modern astronomy, Jupiter 
takes 11.86 years ( for its revolution round the sun). All these 
four or five divisions are not mentioned in early works and even 
in later days all these four divisions do not appear to have 
been fully utilised, though mentioned in astronomical and 
dharmasastra works. Kautilya provides that 1014 the month foi 
workmen is of thirty days and nights, the Saura month is one 
half day larger i. e. (30} days in a month ), the lunar month a 
half day less ( i. a. 29 j days ), the naksatra month is of 27 days, 
the intercalary month is of 32 days ( or occurs in the 32nd 
month? ), the month is of 35 days ( for the wages ) of those who 
tend horses and of 40 days for those who are keepers of elephants. 
The month for workmen was of 30 days, but it need not have 
ooinoided with Full Moon or New Moon, while lunar months 
end with amavSsys orpumima. The BrShmaspmitasiddhsnta 
quoted by TXtpala on Brhat-samhita II 4 p 40 provides that from 
the saura reckoning one derives the extent of Yuga, the year, 
Visuvat, Ayana, seasons, the increase and decrease in the length

At present the year begins either in oaitra or kartika in 
different parts of India. But in ancient times it began in 
different months in different countries and for different purposes. 
Many Vedie 1015 passages show that the reckoning was purni- 
manta, that the year began after the Full moon of Phslguna and 
that Yasanta was the first season of the year. It is due to this 
that Madhava says in his EZala-nirnaya p 63 { Calcutta ed. ) 
that Sruti (Veda) is insistent on the purnimanta month 
( paurnamasyantatve sruteh katakso bhuyan) The Sm C. 
( on sraddha p 377 ) notes that the amanta reckoning is followed 
in Deccan the ( Daksina-patha ) and puraimanta in North India

cating that in north Maharsstra there was amanta reckoning then

that the first year of the cycle of five years began in Magha- 
rakla i. e. at the winter solstice Alberuni ( Saohau U. pp. 8-9 ) 
mentions that the year began in Oaitra, Bhadiapada, Kartika, 
Margaslrsa in different parts of India, Xautilya 1017 provided 
that the year for work in the Government office of Accounts was 
a candra one and ended on the Full Moon of Asadha. From 
Vanaparra 1018 it appears that the year began in Oaitra It is

possible to suggest that the year began with Margastrsa baoauae 
Anu&sana ( 106. 17-30 ) deals with the results of practising 
ekabJuikta vtata from Margash-sa to Karfcika The Ertya- 
ratuakara ( p. 452 ) quoting BrahmapurSna says that the year 
began with the prahpad of Margaslrsa in Kxtayuga. Irom 
Gits X. 85 ( mSsSnam mSrgasu-soham ) it does not, I humby 
think, follow that Margaslrsa was the first month of the year, Binoe 
most of the vibhutis with whioh Lord Krsna identifies himself 
are the best in that particular category and as even among Fanda- 
vas Axjuna is mentioned, not as first but as the best Only a few 
such as akshaia or Drandva are the first of their respective 
categories. The Varsakriya-kaumudl andlfirnayasindhup 79 say 
that the BrahmapurBna 1019 generally accepts the pfirnimanta recko- 
ning and that it (N. S.) would deal with titbi-nirnaya by generally 
following BrShmapurana. The Bhavisyapurana when speaking 
of Holika festival on Phalguna Full Moon states that it was the 
end of Fhalguna (Uttara-parva 132. 1). Matsya 159 3-6 say that 
Skanda and Visakha are said to have been born on the 15tii of 
dark half of oaitraina clump of reeds and it is added that tiie 
two were made into one by Indra on the 5th of the bright half of 
caitra and on 6th crowned as commander. It follows that 
Matsya thinks the month to have been purnimanta. 

Something must be said about the 60 year cycle called 
Barhaspatya ( Jovian). The Visnu-dharmottaratt» sayB that the

year alone 1021 . In the Deccan now ( and in older times also ) it 
appears that at the beginning of each year the Jovian name is 
changed. But in northern India Vrjaya is the first year instead 
of Prabhava. The length of Jupiter's year is 361. 9367 days 
and is shorter than the sidereal year by 4 23 days. The result 
is that in 85 sidereal years there are 86 Jovian (or samvatsara ) 
years and therefore there is the suppression (ksaya) of one year 
after 85 years (which is done only in Northern India). 

The Jovian cycle must be an ancient one . some FurSnas 
and Varahamihira speak of it as an established institution.

662 JBistory of Dhca maiSstra I Sea II, Oh. ZVIJtt 

The names of the Barhaspatya years ooour rather early in 
Inscriptions Among the earliest references are two, one to 
Siddhartha-samvatsara in the 5th year of the reign of the 
Galukya king 'Mangalesa (LA 19 p 1 ff at p. 18 ) and the other 
is to Saumya-samvatsara in the Alas plate of Rastrakfita king 
Govinda in Sake 692 ( E. I vol VI p. 209 ) How the samvatsara 
names were supposed to indicate different consequences for the 
years concerned can he illustrated hy citing two verses from the 
Brhatsamhita ( 8 28-29 ) ' when the samvatBara Frabhava starts 
there are drought, strong winds and destraotion hy fire and also 
other calamities (like excessive rain, locusts &c ), there are 
diseases due to phlegm, but still people are not distressed.' The 
consequences in the next four samvatsaras are auspicious, viz. 
the king rules over a kingdom which is full of paddy, sugarcane 
and barley and other crops, which is free from dangers, in which 
there are no hatreds, in which the people are joyous and free 
from the evil results of kaliyuga (such as adhcama, poverty, 
accidental deaths &o ). 

The subject of months is one of the most complicated. 
Indians followed the luni-solar calendar from very ancient 
times like the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Jews and the Chinese. 
All had therefore to resort to the device of intercalary months 
( adhika-mSsa or malamSsa ). But Indians had rarely a foaya 
month also which is absent in the systems of the other peoples. 
This difference arose owing to the different ways of the calcula- 
tions of the motions and positions of the sun and moon, m 
which I do not propose to enter for reasons already stated Bat 
a few words to indicate how an additional month arises may be 
said here. The solar year exceeds the lunar year by a htHe 
ovetdev^ntLis This excess amounts tc .one lunar month in 
St 32 solar months The Babylonians had a cycle of 19 sote 

SIX <!*-*■ «*»•■ n - aop io9 -* notea ww5maf p

months, one being a 2nd Asadha at the end of 2$ years and the 
other a second Pausa at the end of the yuga of five years. 
Kautilya's Arthasastra merely echoes this The Pitamaha- 
siddhanta provided that an intercalary month was to he added 
after thirty months. 1023 In the Virataparva 1024 it is said that the 
period of 13 years ( 12 years in exile and one year incognito ) 
was more than completed by the Pandavas if the oandra recko- 
ning were followed, as two months were to be added in five 
years. The puranaa and other works give varying periods after 
which an intercalary month occurs A few examples may be 
cited. Visnudharmottara 1025 states that the solar year has 
eleven days more than the lunar one and that after two years 
eight months, sixteen days and four ghatls a month has to be 
added. This is not to be taken literally, otherwise it would have 
to be held that after four ghatikaB on 2nd tithi of the dark half 
of a month an intercalary month has to be added All that the 
passage of the Pur&na does is to indicate the number of days 
in the lunar reokoning after which an additional month is 
possible Similarly, a passage of the Kathakagrhya 10 * 6 says that 
in the lunar month in which there ib no sankiantt or there are 
two sankrantis a month is added after thirty months have ex- 
pired from a previous intercalary month. This too indicates 
only a possibility and not a certainty. The BTirnayamrta 10 " 
declared that a month is added between thirty and thirtysix 
months. This too is only approximate. A more definite rule is 
that the lunar month in which no sankranti occurs is called 
adhika ( intercalary ) and bears the same name as that of the

next lunar month which is called iuddha or «y« or piSKHa to 
distinguish it from the intercalary month or if in one solar 
month two am5,vfisyas lra8 end then there is an adhikamssa or 
malamSsa. That lunar month in which two sankrSntis ooraa 
gets two names of which the first is retained and the second is 
suppressed (i. e. this socond becomes a hsoya masa). This 
moans that a lcsaya masa occurs when there are two sankrSntis 
in a month. That lunar month in whidh the sun enters Mesa 
sign is called Oaitra, that in which he enters Vrsabha is called 
VaisSkha and bo on. 1029 

Ono or two points more about adlnl^a and Ksaya months 
may be mentioned. Tho sevon months from Phalguna to 
Asvina can become only adhika but never Isaya. Kartika 
and Margaslrsa may become both Adhika and Ksaya, but 
rarely; MSgha can become adhika but it has never been 
adhika or ksaya (Tide Ketkar's work p. 40). But the 
Suddhikaumudl says that Msgha was a ksaya month in sake 
1397; I039 and the Malamasatattva quotes a text to the effect 
that Magna may be an intercalary month, but Pausa nevexi 
About Pausa, Mr. V. B. Ketkar (in 'Indian and foreign 
chronology' p. 40) says that Pausa has almost no chance of 
becoming adhtha, but has greater chance of becoming law 
than Margastrsa' (but see a little below). A ksaya month 1b 
generally preceded and followed, though not immediately, by 
on adhika month, so that there are two adhika months when 
a ksaya month occurs in some years. The Siddhfinta-siromam 
stateB that one out of the three months only viz. Kartika, 
Margaslrsa and Pausa can be ksayamSsa a nd that when a ksa ya

mtea occurs there is an adhikamSBa before and after it within 
three months ( Grabaganita, Madhyamadbiksra, verse 6, 
explanation). The curious reader may consult pp. 246-251 of 
the C. B, 0. Report for light on the intercalary months The 
Siddhanta-siromaniwa mentions some saka years in which 
ksaya-masa occurred or would occur, viz. m saka year 974 
( expired ) occurred a ksaya month and a ksaya month will occur 
in Saka 1115, saka 1356, Saka 1378 and a ksaya month generally 
occurs after 141 years and rarely in 19 years. In No. 1387 in 
the list of Inscriptions by D. B. Bhandarkar there is a reference 
to the »nd tithi of the bright half of the first 19 -* Fausa (dated 
Bamvat 34, probably of Harsa era), for a reference to 2nd 
JLsadka see Sohawal plate of Sarvan£tha in year 191 ( probably 
Gupta ) in E. I. vol. 19 at p. 130 , for 2nd Pausa Jesar plate of 
Siladitya in 357 Valabbi era in E. I. vol 22 p. 120 Snay be seen. 

The rules about what religious aots should be done or not 
done in an intercalary month will be dealt with a little later. 
The &mtiparva refers to the ksaya of samvatsaras, months, 
paksas and divasas ( tlthis ) M5S . When there is a ksayamasa, the 
adhikamSsa before it is like all ordinary mSsas i. e there is no 
prohibition of doing religious aots in it, but the adhikamSsa that 
follows a ksayamasa is the one that is declared unsuitable for 
religious rites. Adhikamaaa and ksayamasa may be illustrated 
by one example for each. Suppose that there was Mesa 
sankranti on Caitra amavasya, that from the first tithi following 
(he amSvasya to the next atnSvSsva ( which is Vaisakha ) there

it may have six parts if the signs of the zodiac are given and 
seven if the positions of the planets are mentioned. Vara i 
( weekday ) is the period of time between one sunrise and the 
next and not much will have to he said about it exoept about the 
origin of week days, A. great deal has already been said about 
tithis and naksatras What remains to he said about these, 
if at all, and the treatment of Yoga and Karana will be dealt 
with later on. We must revert to the topic of naksatras. 

The names of the twelve solar months distributed two each 
among six seasons are very ancient. They oocur in the 
Taittiriya-samhite IV 3 11. 1, Vaj S 13 25 They areMadhu, 
Madhava, Sukra, Suoi, Nabhas, Nabhasya, Isa, tJrja. Sahas, 
Sahasya, Tapas and Tapasya 1037 . In the Brfihinanas we meet 
with months (lunar) named form naksatras. It is therefore that 
some works speak of rlw. ( seasons ) as of two kinds, viz. Saura 
and Candra. The iormer begin either with Mmarasj or Mesa- 
rasl, while the latter are called Caitra and the rest i<» 8 The name 
of the naksatra is often formed into a derivative and joined 
to the word PaurnamasI, Purnamasa or Amavasya and sometimes 
the names of the months such as Phalguna and Caitra oocur 
in the Brahmanas (vide note 1015 above \ l03S 

Panini derives the names of the months like Caitra from 
PaumamSsI and expressly names the Agrahayanl ( IV. 2. 22 ), 
Phalgunt.Sravana, KartikI and &utrT (IV 2 23 ). ' PaurnamasI ' 
itself is derived from Pmvamasa by the Vartika % on Panini 
IV. 2. 35. The Full Moon tithi whioh has Fusya naksatra is 
called PausI bv the sutraS ( Pan. IV. 2. 3 and IV, 2 21 ). Thus 
there were three stages; first the 27 naksatras were distinguished 
and named in the very ancient Vedic samhitas, then the Pull 
Moan day was called Caitrl PaumamSsI ( and so en ) because 
on that tithi the Moon v. as in Otra naksatra and so on; then

the months were called Caifcra, Vaisakha &o. because they had 
Caitrl or Vaisakhl Paurnamasi in it. All this occurred long 
before Pacini. Later the eaura names Madhu, Madhava &o. 
came to be indentified with lunar months Caifcra, Vaisakha &c 
and became svnonyms. When this occurred it is difficult to say. 
But it is much older than the Christian era. It must be long 
before Ealidssa, who in his Meghaduta first speaks of Asadha 
and then refers to the next month SrSvana as Nabhas. Often 
on the Full Moon day the Moon might not actually be in or 
very near Citra or Sravana naksatra but that did not matter; 
the month would still be called Caitra or Sravana as tbe case 
may be.»"« 

It has already been shown that in ancient BrShrnana times 
the months ended with tbe Full Moon (i. e. were purnimanta ). 
When foreigners like Kaniska and Huviska ruled over Northern 
India they struck to the Purnimanta Indian months in their 
records, though here and there they employ Macedonian month 
names. For example, the Greek month Gurppiya is used in 
Huviska's reign ( 28tb year ) in the MatburS Brahml Inscription 
and the Greek month 10 * 1 Arfemfsios also occoxb. In the Zeda 
Inscription the month must be held to he purnimanta as the 
naksatra UttarSphalgunI is there said to have occurred on the 
20th day of SsSdha. 10 " The Tekkah plates of Devendravarman 
record a grant on the occasion of a lunar eclipse on the 30th day 
of MSgha."" Similarly, in the Lodhia plate? of Sivagopto

Balarjuna of KoSala ( i. e. Ghhattisgarh region ) published in RI. 
vol. 27 p. 319 the date 'Sambatsare sapta paficasattame Kaitika- 
pornamasyam ankena samvat 57, Kartika-dina 30 * (p. 325) 
shows that the month was purnimanta. The Rajataranghil 1044 
says that king Hariraja came to the throne at the beginning of 
iLsadha in the 4th year ( of the Laukika era}, who ruled only 
for twenty-two days and died on 8th of the bright half of Suci 
( i e, Ssadha ) and thereby shows that the month was purnimanta 
in Kashmir then as now. 

Though inscriptions before the Christian era rarely 

mentioned the names of months ( such as Kartika 14th in the 

KharosthI Inscription of the Greek king Menander, ia4S 2nd 

century B. O. ), the usual mode is to mention the rtu ( season ), 

then the number of the month (and not name) in the season and 

then divasa, e. g. vide the seven inscriptions from 10 * MathurS 

and the Sarnath Inscription of MabSrSja Kaniska. 10n In some 

inscriptions only the rtu ( season ), the number of the paksa and 

the day occur; vide Nagarjunikonda 10 * 8 Ins. ( 3rd century A. D. ), 

the Omgudu grant of Vqayaskandavarman ( E. I. 15 p. 252

Eaniska's time ( E. 1. 17. p. 11 ) in sa. ( Samvat ) 8, grl. 4, di

of Madhariputa Furkadata, samvacbhare 20, VasSpakham 8, 

divasam 10 ). Sometimes the month is mentioned but no paksa 

and the days are counted ocntinuously from 1 to 30, e. g. Khoh 

plates of Maharaja Jayanatha ( in year 177 and 22nd day of 

Oaitra ) and Khoh plate of Sarvanatha in year 193 month Oaitra 

day 10th without the mention of the fortnight (vide Gupta 

Inscriptions pp 121 and 125 ), E. I. vol. 20 p. 59 at p. 63 ( earn

occurs in Vaf. S. 32. 30, SankhSyaaa-srautasfitra VI. 12.15. 
The MalamgBatattva derives the word as follows : being malt 
( soiled ) rt passes on'. The words ' samsarpa ' and ' amhasaspati ' 
occur in Vaj. & 22. 30 and 31 1WS respectively, and 'amhasa- 
ppati ' in Vaj. S. 7. 31 after the mantras referring to the twelve 
antra months, Madhu, Madhava &o The Tai. S. (L 4. 14.1 and 
^.5 3. 4 ) has the formula ' sairsarpcsyaham-spataye fcva '. WS5 
' Amhaspati * literally means * the lord of sins or evil ' (i, e. a 
condemned month ). Later medieval writers make a distinction 195 * 
between * samsarpa ' and amhaspati '. When there are in one 
year two adhimasas and a Jcsaya masa, the first of Hie Wo 
adhtmSsas is called ' samsarpa * and it is not condemned for all 
religious matters but only for marriages, such sacrifices as 
Agnistoma, festivals ( that are not obligatory ) and auspicious 
rites of children (such as ' namakarana ' ). The name amhaspati 
is confined to hsayamusa. The intercalary month i3 called 
Pnrusottama-mSsa(Visnu being called Purnsottama) in some 
of the FurSnas as in Padma VI 64, probably with the purpose of 
reducing the opprobrium that attached to an intercalary month. 

In the Dharmasastra Literature considerable space is devoted 
to the intercalary month e. g. in the Agnipurana 175 29-30, the 
EaiamSrtanda (folios 68a-69, wises 1078-1115), Kalameka 
of JTmfltavabana PP- 113-168, HemSdri on Xala W JMf

Acts to be avoided in intercalary month 673 

The Agnipurana provides : ,0S7 one should avoid in an inter- 
calary month the performance of the following acts, viz. of 
consecration of Vedio fires, the establishment of images, sacrifices, 
religious gifts, vratas, the recitation of the Veda after under- 
taking it, observance of certain myamas such as mahanamul, the 
letting loose of a bull (after sapindana), tonsure of a ohild, 
upanayana, rites suoh as the samskaras of namakarana, in- 
auguration of a king. Long lists of what may or may not be 
done in an intercalary month occur in many works such as in 
Hemadri on Kala pp. 36-66, Nirnayasindhu pp 10-15, Dharma- 
sindhu pp. 5-7 It would be enough if some general provisions 
are stated The general 1058 rule is that one should perform 
obligatory acts and acts prescribed on certain occasions even in 
an intercalary month. For example, one must perform even in 
an intercalary month daily sandhya worship, the five daily 
Mahayajnas (suchasBrahmayajfia, Vaisvadeva), the offering 
into fire (as an agmhotwi) and must take a bath if there is an 
eolipse (inadhimasa), although this is nmmittika; so also one 
must perform -the funerary rites after a relative's death even if 
the death takes place in an adhimasa (this also is naimtUka). 
Bat an obligatory rite should not be performed in adhimasa if 
sastra allows its postponement, e g. Soma saorifice. The general 
rule is that no kamya rite (not obligatory, but to be performed 
for securing some object or result) is to be performed in adhimasa. 
There are exceptions to this also if a certain religious rite is 
begun before an adhimaBa falls (suoh as a PrajSpatya penance 
for twelve days or a oandrayana pBnancefor a month) it may 
be continued even in adhimasa. if there is drought and one 
desires to perform the Kmhltsh for bringing down rain, this 
may be done even inad himasa, since to wait might defeat the

Certain matters were to be done only in malamasa such as 
the gift 1860 of 33 opSpas (cakes) every day to brahmanas or at 
least once in the intercalary month; certain aots were not to be 
done in adhimasa, but only in the suddha 1W0a month, such as 
the sinking of wells, construction of tanks, solemn sacrifices, 
the mahadanas and vratas Certain matters can be done in 
adhimasa as well as in snddha-masa 1061 e. g rites on a pregnancy 
( such as pumsavana ), taking interest on money lent, wages of 
workmen for fixed periods, monthly sraddha (on amavasya), 
daily gifts, bath at a holy place, japa (muttering mantras), 
noma with barley grams or rice or sesame, rites on the birth of

One of the five angas in the Indian pafioangas is the week- 
day. A brief discussion on days and week-days has therefore 
to be held. The interval between two sunrises was considered 
as the most important unit of time This is solar and is called 
the civil day But ttthi is a lunar division of time ( as described 
above ) and begins and ends at various spaces in the solar day. 
The word * day ' has two meanings, viz ( 1 ) from sunrise 
to sunset and ( 2 ) from sunrise to sunrise 10M In Jig. 
the word 'ahah' is applied to both the dark part of it 
(i. e'ratri' night) and to the bright part. 1063 The word 
ratn is not so frequently used in the Rgveda as the word * ahan ' 
and the word * dina' is very frequently used in compounds like 
'sudinatva', 'sudina' 'madhyandina'; 'ahoratra' (day and 
night) occurs only once in the Rg. X, 190. 2 The word 
'purvahna* (first part of the day or forenoon) occurs in the 
Bgveda X. 34 11. Three parts of the day also occur in the 
Rgvedaviz pratah, sangava and madhyandina 106 * (mid-day). 
These are three out of the five parts of the day, the other two 
being aparSJma and astamaya. astagamana or sayahna, which 
five are mentioned in the Satapatha Br. II. 3 2 9 Both ' pratah * 
( morning ) and ' sayam' ( evening ) occur in Rg. V. 77. 2 and 
'sayam' alone in Bg VIII. 2 20, X 146.3 and 40. The day 
and night were also divided into eight parts by Kautilya (1 19 ) 
andbyDaksaand KatySyana The division of the day and 
night each into 15 muhurtas has been already dealt with at 
some length on pp. 537-541. 

Great divergence prevailed about the beginning of the day. 
The Jewsplaced the beginning of the oivil day in the evening (vide 
Genesis I. 5 'The evening and the morning were the first day ' 
and also I 13. ) The Egyptians diyided th e day from sunrise to

sunset into twelve parts and thus obtained hours whose length 
depended on the season, while the Babylonians 1065 began the 
day with sunrise and divided day and night into twelve parts, 
each of which corresponded to two of the equinoctial hours In 
Athens and in Greece generally the day commenced in historic 
times with the evening for the purposes of the oalendar(vide Heath's 
'Aristarohus of Samos', 1913, p. 284 ). In Borne the day began 
with midnight. With Indian writers the day begins with sun- 
rise (as in Brahmasphuta-siddhanta XL 33), but they were 
not unaware of different beginnings of the day. The Panoa* 
siddhantika 1066 remarks that Sryabhata declared that the day 
began at midnight in Lanka and again he said that it began 
with sunrise and that sunrise in Lanka coincides with sunset 
in Siddhapura, with mid-day in Yamakott and with midnight 
in the Bomaka country. 

In modern times the civil day begins at midnight. 

The seven day week is an artificial man-made arrangement. 
It corresponds to no astronomical or celestial phenomenon. The 
Mexicans had a week of five days J067 before the Spanish oongnest. 
The seven days week prevailed among Jews, Babylonians and 
the Incas of South America. The Romans had a week of eight 
dayB in Republican times, while the Egyptians and ancient 
Athenians had a week of ten days In the Old testament God 
is Baid to have gone on with the work of creation for six days, 
to have rested on the seven th and to have blessed it and sanctified

it ( Genesis 2. 1-3 }. In Exodus 20. 8-11, 23. 12-14 and Deutero- 
nomy 5. 12-15 God is said to have commanded the Jews to 
labour for six days, take rest on the seventh and to observe it as 
the Sabbath of the Lord God and to keep -it sacred. The Jews 
gave no special name3 to the week days except the Sabbath 
which was the last day of the week and which they observed on 
Satatdiy ( and not on Sunday ). 

The Old Testament contains no traces of proper names 
having been given to week days. It appears that even in the 
New Testament week days were indicated by numbers. Vide 
Matthew 28 1 ' In the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn 
towards (7ie fit si day of the week came mary Magdalen &c '; 
Mark 16 9 ' Now when. Jesus iws risen early the first day of the 
week he appeared first to Mary Magdalen &c\ Luke 24 1 
' Now upon the first day of the week being early in the morning 
they came into the sepulchre ' Each of the seven days of the 
week is designated as the sabbath or holy day by various 
nationalities and religious communities L e Monday is the 
Greek Sabbath, Tuesday the Persian, "Wednesday the Assyrian, 
Thursday the Egyptian, Eriday the Moslem, Saturday the Jewish 
and Sunday the Christian. 

On the origin and development of the seven-day cycle 
the leading work is B". H. Colson's 'the week' (Cambridge 
University Press, 1926 ). Some of his arguments may be briefly 
indicated Dion Cassius (first quarter of 3rd century A.D.) in his 
37th book says that Jerusalem was captured 1067 ' 1 by Pompey in 
63 B O. owing to the reverence of the Jews for Saturday (their 
Sabbath day) and he further makes the statements that planetary 
week originated in Egypt, that it was of recent growth and that 
it was in general use in his day; videDio's ' Roman History ' 
vol HI pp 129, 131 where two traditional explanations are given 
as to how the week days were named after planets, the 2nd of 
which is based on the 24 hours of the day and night What 
must be emphasized is that Dio is positive that week days did' 
not originate in Greece, but in Egypt and their introduction 
was recent Dio was a Eoman and wrote his History between 
200 to 222 A. D Therefore, the introduction of week days in 
Greece could not have been earlier than the first century of the 

1067 a Vide Dto's • Roman History • (Loeb Classical Librarj) vol HI

Palestine on the day of Sabbath, because they did not work on that day

Gupta year*™ 16B (i o. A. Z>. J84), which mentions Thursday and 
tho 12th tithi of tho bright half of Jisadha. Supposing for 
argument that weekdays wero originally borrowed from some 
foreign country, at least a low hundred years would be necessary 
before such o borrowed systom could become general and could 
bo utilized oven in Indian proclamations by a great Indian 
imperial dynasty like the Guptaa

PaSoasiddhantikS (in 1. 8) mentions Monday in summarising 
the features of tho Romaka eiddhSnta (vide note 1004). The 
Brhatsamhita in chapter 103 (verses 61-63) sets out what

assigns Garga to the 1st Century B. This would cany the 
knowledge of weekdays in India to the erst century before 
Christ. Fhilostratus in his life of ApoUonins of Tyana (who 
died in 98 A D ) relates ( -vide note 900 above ) how when 
Apollonius travelled in India he received from laxchus, the chief 
of the brabmanas, seven rings bearing names of seven planets, 
each one of which Apollonius was to wear on each of the week- 
days. As Fhilostratus wrote in the first quarter of the 3rd 
century A. D., this would carry the knowledge of the planetary 
week in India at least to the 1st century of the Christian era. 
The above references furnish a terminus ad quern for India's 
knowledge of the planetary week days ( viz. first century B. O. 
to first century A D. ). The terminus a quo cannot be stated 
with certainty. 

Now some other literary evidence about the dates of which 
there are likely to be doubts and disputes would be set out. In 
the Vaikhanasa-smaxta-sutia (14) and Baudhayanadharma- 
sutra ( H. 5. 23 ) tarpana ( satiation with water ) is offered to the 
Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and to 
Bshu and Ketu and the former mentions Budbavara ( Wednes- 
day ) in II IS. It has to be conceded that other sutras such as 
Asv gr HI. 4. 1-5, the Kausltaki gr (IV. 9-10 ), the Hir. gr. H. 
19-20, Bharadvaja gr. HI. 9-11 contain no tarpana to the week- 
days or their deities. The Atharvana-Vedanga Jyotisa has a 
section on weekdays (of eight verses) and points out what 
should be done on each of the seven weekdays from Sunday to 
Saturday ( two of which aTe quoted below by way of sample*"" 3 ). 
The GatbSsaptaSatl of Hala (a piakitl anthology ) mentions 
Tuesday and Visti ( DX 61 ). The Yajnavalkya-smrti ( L 296 ) 
enumerates the planets in the modern weekday order from 
Sunday to Saturday and adds Rahu and Ketu as grahas and 
provides for a sacrifice to nine grahas (I 295-308). The 
Haradapurana (I. 51.80) also does the same. The Matsya 
(chap. 93. 7 ff) provides for a more elaborate sacrifice to planets. 
The Vismidharmasutra(78 1-7) refers to Sraddhas performed 
on the seven weekdays from Sunday to Saturday and the benefits 
derived from such performance (vide H of Dh vol IV. p 373-374 
for details ). The Furanas contain numerous references to the

weekdays. The Naradrya provides that Monday 1074 , Wednes- 
day, Thursday and Friday are auspicious for all rites and 
actions, while tho other weekdays yield the desired result only 
in cruel or violent aotions The Matsya provides that all week- 
days except Sunday and Tuesday are auspicious ( 253 7 ) The 
Kurmapurana ( Uttarardha 20. 16-17) provides that sraddhas on 
weekdays from Sunday to Saturday respectively yield the benefits 
of hoalth, happiness ( or prosperity ), success, all desires, desired 
learning, wealth and long life The Visnudharmottara ( I. 142. 
30-32 Jims similar provwiong. The Brahmaparana (118.30) 
recommends touching an asvattba treo on Saturday. The 
Vamana ( 14. 49-50 ) forbids certain actions on weekdays (such 
as an oil bath on Sunday or Tuesday ) The Matsya specifically 
refers to Sunday ( in chop 55 4, 65. 5, 70. 46 ), to Monday { in 
57. 4 ), to Tuesday ( in 72. 27, 193 8 ) Though the chronology 
of all the above works is somewhat uncertain, yet it cannot be 
gainsaid that at least in the first two centuries of the Christian 
ora planets had become objects of worship and the weekdays had 
been named and their order as it exists today had been setfled. 
The Mahabhaata, in spite of its vast extent and copious dea- 
crinlions of Dbarmasastra matters, is entirely silent about tne 
names of weekdays. The cumulate effect :rf all the evidence 
adduced above is to render it extremely probable, if not certain, 
that the worship of the planets and knowledge of the weekdays 
Presided over by tbem was known to the Indians at least bet- 
JThmB o to 100 A. D One further circumstance w that

of dividing the day into 60 parts and also into 24 parts were 
accepted by Ptolemy himself ( who wrote only about 150 AD). 
Therefore, Indians could very well have used very early the 60 
divisions system for finding out the order of the weekdays instead 
of 24 divisions system. The Indians did not calculate their day 
from noon or night but from the morning. The Asvamedhika- 
parva ,0,s expressly says that the day comes first and then night. 
It is possible to advance several theories about the origin of 
the seven day week in India. The five planets ( Mercury, Venus, 
Mars, Jupiter and Saturn ) were especially regarded by the ancient 
Babylonians as the powers controlling the destinies of men and 
therefore five leading Babylonian divinities were identified with 
the above five planets In course of transmission Babylonian 
names of divinities assumed Roman forms i. e Ishtar, goddess of 
love, became Venus, the great god Marduk became Jupiter and so 
on ( vide note 748 above ) The five planets together with the Sun 
and the Moon made a group of seven heavenly bodies In 
Ghaldean temple worship which spread to Syria, it became the 
custom to sing the praises of each god on a particular day. The 
name of the god worshipped on a particular day was transferred 
to the day itself. The days which were sacred to the Sun and 
the Moon were called Sunday and Monday. Some Norse words 
like Wednesday ( Woden's day ) and Thursday ( Thor's day ) 
were introduced in England But weekdays in Europe are ulti- 
mately derived from the Babylonian gods. It has already been 
shown ( pp 598-600 above ) that India and Babylonia had close 
commercial and other contacts from very ancient times. Vide 
the recent work on * Hittites ' by O. B» Gurney ( in Pelican 
Books, 1958 ), pp 104-105 and 124 for technical Sanskrit words 
in hone breeding Vedic gods and royal names in Sanskrit in the 
14th century B O It is possible to aTgue that seeing the temples 
of planetary gods in which worship was performed on certain 
days some Indians got the suggestion of a planetary week, as it 
has been suggested above that the ideas of the Zodiacal signs 
were derived from Babylonian boundary stones and similar 
monum ents There were Sun temples in ancient India 1076

No 18 p,79 for temples of the San and Br S %hap 57, Matsya, chap 257-263, 
Vimudhannoltara III 60-69 and Bhavisya I 13 1 for temples and images. 
Br s 57 ( verBes 46-48 ) describes the appearance of the Sun image and 
Vixnodharmottara III. 67-69 give directions as to how images of the Sun, 
the Moon and planets (Mars and others) are to be made.

letters is pram, prSnos are equal to pala, 60 pales are equal to 
a danda, ghatf or nfidt {Suryasiddhantat 11, Jyotist-attvap. 562). 
Panmf derives the word 'nadindhama' 10 " from nSdr Nsdlfaavery 
ancient word «•» It occurs in the Bgveda and appears to mean 
Borne cylindrical instrument like a flute. *"» It appears that the 
word nfidl came to mean a period of time when a conch or a 
trumpet or similar instrument was blown to announce the lapse 
of one nadt ( 60th part of the day ) as there were no docks then. 
Hence division into 60 nadls or ghatls (both words heing men- 
tioned by Patafijali who is generally held to have flourished 
about 150 B.C.) was the ancient mode of dividing the day in 
India and if any Sanskrit work (like the S&ryasiddhanta, chap 
12. 78-79) refers to 84 parts of the day, that work may he regarded 
as one of later times, but the whole system of time measuring by 
weekdays in India cannot be said to have been borrowed from a 
foreign source. Even Fatanjali refers to the words nSdl and ghati 
as long in nse hef ore Mb time Therefore, lie division of the day

Division of day into nafis 685 

into nadls or ghatls must be held to be long anterior to 300 B. O. 
On the whole it would not be far from the truth to say 
that weekdays were not borrowed by ancient India en bloc from 
elsewhere It iB arguable that usages in Babylon and Syria 
might have suggested the arrangement of days into weeks, but 
there is hardly any cogent evidence beyond similarity and 
prejudice to show that the origin of the nomenclature and the 
method of arriving at the order of the weekdays were not indi- 
genous Yide Cunningham in I A. vol 14 pp. 1 ft in which he 
shows by diagrams how the calculation by Indian ghatls results 
in the same order of weekdays as the European division. Sham 
Shastri in Annals of Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 
vol IV pp 1-31 after mentioning some rather hazy and obscure 
passages from the Vedio literature arrives at the conclusion that 
India was not indebted to the Greeks or Babylonians for week 
days or for the discovery of planets. It may be mentioned that 
Alberuni (tr by Sachau, voL J. ohap XIX pp. 214-215) illustrates 
how week-days received names from planets, narrates (p. 215) 
that it was the custom with Hindus to enumerate the planets in 
the order of the weekdays and that the Hindus persisted in using 
these in their astronomical books and declined to use any other 
order or method even if it was more correct. 



CHAPTER XIX 

ICalpa, Manvaniara, Mahayuga, Yuga 

After dealing with time measures from yuga ( of five yearn ) 
down to weekdays and the day one must now briefly deal with 
Hie other measures of time such as Yuga, MabSyuga, Manvan- 
tara and Kalpa The word Kalpa has its germ in the Bgveda 1l,M 
X. 190 3, where it is said that the Creator created the Sun and 
the Moon, the heaven, the earth and mid-region as before ' 
The earliest datable reference to Kalpa is found in Asoka's 
edicts o g the 4th Book edict 1081 at Girnar and Kalsi have ' Sva 
savata kapa ' ( yavat samvartakalpam ) and ' ava kapam ' in the 
5th Rock Edict at ShahabazgaThi and Mansera This establishes 
that the theories about the vast extent of ICalpa had been pro- 
mulgated in India long before the third century B 0. The 
Buddhists also took oyer the theory of Kalpas as is clear from 
the MahSparinibbanasutta IH. 53 * Vouchsafe, Lord, to remain 
during the Kalpa Lire on, O Blessed One, through the Kalpa 
for the good and happiness of the great multitudes &c '. 

The beliefs that in the dim past there was an ideally perfect 
Booiety followed by agradual degeneracy and decline in standards 
of morals, health and length of life and that the cycle of decline 
would be followed in the far distant future by a golden age of 
perfection in morals &ft have been dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. 
HI pp. 885 ff The word « yuga ' has been shown there as having 
probably several meanings, vw a short period of time ( Bg DX 
26 3 ), a oycle of five years and also a long period and a period 
of thousands of years Prof. Mankad m Poona Onentabst 
( to! VI pp 311-212 ) assigns as many as ten meanings to the 

use. ^^^wtftoa-m' %<**firfr *i*rfferstf w ■

word One cannot agree with him in all that be says. For 
example, he appeals to be wrong when he says that in Sakuntala 
IV ( yugantaram arudhah savita ) yuga means Jth of a day ; 
yuga does not, so far as I know, mean £th anywhere, it means 
* four ' in some cases In Sakuntala * yug&ntara &c * should be 
taken to mean that ' the sun has come up in tbe sky as much as 
the length of a yoke (from the eastern horizon)' That is the sense 
of 'yuga' in Rg X 60 8, X 101 3 and 4. In the Mahabharata, 
in Manu and the Puranas the theory of yugas, manianlai as and 
Tcalpas has been elaborated at great length The" four yugas are 
named Krta, Trefea, Dvapara and Tisya or Kali and concern 
only Bharata-varsa usls But it has been shown (at pp 886-890 of 
the H. of Dh. vol HI ) that originally these were the names of cer- 
tain throws of dice m gambling and that from the 4th century 
B. G. (if not earlier) they came to be the designations of the ages of 
man. The early Gupta inscriptions refer to Krtayuga as a cycle 
of great virtues (as in the Bilsad stone pillar Inscription of 
Kumaragupta in Gupta Samvat 96 in 'Gupta Inscriptions' p 44, 
the Ghammak copperplate of Yakataka Fravarassna IE in 'Gupta 
Inscriptions' p 237, Pattan plates of Pravarasena II. in E. 1. 23 
p. 81. The theory of Yugas, Manvantaras and Kalpas is 
elaborated among ancient works in the Mahabharata ( Vana- 
parva, chapters 149, 188 and Santiparva, chap 69 and 231-232 ),

longest account of Manvantaras), and by astronomical writers 

SWdhSntaSiromani. Hbne of these works enables us toSE 
satisfactory emanation about the rise of this system rf K*W 
Manvantaras and Yugas Pargiter (in AIHT p 175 ) thinks &at 
the division into four ages had a historical basis. That may 
or may not be bo. But what historical explanation can be 
offered about manvantaras and fcalpas is not stated anywhere. 
The theory of yugas concerned only BhSratavarsa as stated in 
several FurSnas. AU these works contain the same general 
features but there are many divergences in details As the 
Mannsmrti contains one of the oldest accounts, a summary of 
its remarks will be first set out JErs^ seven Mantis are enume- 
rated viz SvSyambhava, Svarooisa, Fttama, Tsmasa, Raivata, 
Csksusa and Vaivasvata. Then divisions of time from mme$a 
are specified ( 18 nimesa - Kssths, 30 KSsihas = Kate, 30 Kates 
= Muhurta, 30 Muhflrtas - ahorfitra ); it is then said that the 
human month is the day and night of pttrs, the human year is 
divine cdiorffli a. Krta-yuga extends over 4000 WB years, saadhgB 
(twilight) before it is 400 years, sandhysmsa after it is 400 
years. The three other yugas Trets, DvSpara and Kali have 
respectively 3000, 2000, 1000 years and sandhyas and sandhya- 
mlas together of respectively 600, 400 and 200 years. The four 
yugas thus come to 12000 years ( 4800 plus 3600 phis 2400 plus 
1200); thiB is called the yuga of gods (i e this is the dtvya 
measure ) and 1000 of these four come to one day of Brahma and 
the same is the extent of the night of Brahms Seventy-one 
yugas of 12000 divine years eaoh constitute a manvantara and 
Manu ( 1 80 ) winds up by saying that manvantaras are 
numberless tt ° and so are oreations and dissolutions It should 

1082 Mann I 65-67 are the same as Santipnrva 23 1 15-17, Mann I. 
65-66 are the same as Matsya 142. 5-6 (with slight variations), Mans I. 
69-70 are the same as &nta 231 20-21, Vayu 57. 23-24 and MaUya 142. 
19-20. Mann I. 69 Is same as Vanapana 188 22 23 

1083 It was said by Manu (I 81-82 ) that Krta was « age in which 
Dhanna was four-rooted and perfect, that in the other ages dharma declined 
successively by one foot, that theft, falsehood and fraud increase in propor- 
tion Then Mann further avers ( I 83-86 J that the length of Iranian Me a 
the four ages is respectively 400, 300. 200 and 100 years, that the set of 
duties dUfcr,a the tour ages Dharma is said to be four-footed because 
Mann-Pin 16 identifies dharma with vr» (bull). Both Elato and AnetoUe 
believed that every art and science had many tames developed to >ts apogee 
and then deteriorated. 



, Kalpas and Manoantaras 689 

be noticed that the word Kalpa does not occur in this long enume- 
ration. But in other works than the Manusmrti e g Visnupurana 
(VI. 3. 11-12) fourteen Manoantaras are said to constitute a Kalpa, 
which is a day of Brahma. As a day of the gods is equal to a human 
year, the 12000 years that constitute a divine caluryuga are equal 
to 4320000 human years 10833 (12000 X 360) i. e. this is the human 
( mSousa ) measure of time. 

When and how these huge numbers of years for the 
yugas were suggested remains somewhat enigmatic. It appears 
that as early as the Satapatha-brahmana people had become 
familiar with huge figures The Satapatha "^ says that there are 
10800 muhnxtas in a year ( in one ahoratra 30 x 360 ), that 
Praj&pati arranged the Rgveda in such a way that the number 
of syllables it contains is equal to 12000 Brhatls ( each BrhatI 
having 36 syllables ) i e. 432000 syllables and it is further stated 
that the Rgveda also contains 10800 panktis (each pankti having 
40 syllables i e the syllables are 10800x40=432000. Prajapati is 
said to have arranged the other two Yedas also and the three Vedas 
amounted to ten thousand eight hundred eighties(that is 80 x lOiOO 
= 864000 syllables ), that muhurta by muhurta he gained eighty 
syllables ( as there are 10800 muhUrtas in a sacrificial year of 
360 days ). Dr. Jean Rilliozat, Professor at the College de France, 
Paris, puts forward the theory in a recent article ( in the Bulletin 

10S3 a. Many ancient authors in almost all countries believed that there 
were different ages with differing levels of virtne and that they themselves 
lived in the worst age. Vide Hesiod's * Works and days ' pp. 11-17 ( Loob 
Classical Library) where Hesiod's own age was said to be the worst of five 
ages. The Babylonians made out 2160000 years for the duration of the 
world and imagined there were three ages, viz golden, silver and copper. 
Vide pp. 33-34 of Maclean's ' Babylonian astrology in relation to the Old 
Testament ' Sarton also thinks that the Snmerians originated a golden age 
of man and speak of huge numbers of years, viz 12,960,000 (pp 69 and 118 
of ' a History of Science ' ) Berossns gave a list of ten ante-delnvian kings 
reigning in all for 432000 years ( see Cambridge Ancient History, 1923, vol. 
I page 150) Vide Heath's 'Greek astronomy' (Introduction, p. XIV ) 
re Egyptians' claim for possessing records of observations of stars for 
630,000 years and a umilar claim of Babylonians for 1,444,000 years.

was suggested by these figures in the Satapatha, that the high 
figures in the ancient Indian literature are scientific and not 
astrological, and that in the opinion of Herachtns 10800 ordinary 
human years were equal to one ' great year ', that Bbtossub held 
that a great astronomical period was of 432000 years and that 
as the ^atapatha-brahmana is far more ancient than both 
Heraclitus and Berossus, the borrowing, if it exists, must have 
been by the Greeks from India Vide ' Ancient relations between

Brahma come to 8640000000 human years; the year of Brahma 
would then be equal to 3120400000000 human years (taking 
360 days as a year ); one hundred years of Brahms thus come

Uttaina, Tamasa, Raivata, Caksusa and the present is Vaivasvata, 
the 7th Manu (Brahma 5 4-5, Xuima 1.51.4-5, Visnu III 
1. 6-7 ) The remaining seven Manns are differently named in 
several Puranas e. g. Visnu ( III 2 14 if) and ITarasimhapurana 
24 17-35 mention the future Manns as Savarni, Daksa Savarni, 
Brahmasavarm, Dharmasavarnika, Rudra-Bavarni, Ruci and 
Bhauma; while Brahma (5.5-6) mentions four of the future' 
seven as Savarni, Raihhya, Rauoya, Merusavarni Kurma 
(I 53 30-31) names the future four in the same way as Visnu 
( only substituting Savarna for Savarni wherever it ocours and 
the'last two as Raucya and Bhautya ) All the fourteen Manus 
are enumerated in Naradapurana I 40 20-23 Alberuni ( tr by 
Sachau, vol I chap. XLIV p 387 ) gives the names of Manvan- 
taras according to the "Visnudharmottara, Visnupurana'and other 
sources Savarnya tow Manu as a great benefactor and leader 
of some territory ocours in Rg X 62 11 It is said that each 
Manvantara had a separate set of sages, sons of Manu, gods, 
kings, smrtis, Indra and guardians for the proper regulation of 
dbarma and for the protection of the people ( Brahma 5 39, 
Visnupurana HI chapters 1-2) In the Visnupurana it is said that 
some gods remain for four yugas, some for a manvantara and 
some stay for a kalpa 1Mto The Visnudharmasatra (chap. 
XX 1-15 ) haB the same account of Manvantaras and Kalpas as 
Manu's but it adds one detail viz that the whole age of Brahma 
is equal to a day of Furusa ( "Visnu ) and the night of Purusa is 
also as long. It is remarkable that the same view is attributed 
by Alberuni ( Sachau vol J. p. 332 ) to the Pulisasiddhanta. 
It is not known whether those European scholars who regard 
Pulisa to be Faulus Alexandrinus have shown that this detail 
occurs in the work of the Greek Astrologer Faulus. In the 
Vanaparva ( 188 22-29 ) the same account as in Manu occurs

is applied to Tama in several passages of the Bgveda ( X 14 1, 
X. 58. 1, X 60 10, X 164 2 ) The AnukramanI, however, 
ascribes Bg. VIII 27-31 to Vaivasvata Manu as the ra and in

verse ' O India 1 just as you drank the soma extracted in ( the

that the Manusmrti names only the seven Manns (L 61-63)

writers (like Dr. Daftari) think 10906 that in ancient times there 
was an Indian institution of public functionaries oalled Manu 
and the Saptarsis, whose function was to legislate and promul- 
gate the YedaB. With great respect to the erudite scholar, I dis- 
agree with him. The extant Purana passages are less than 2000 
years old, while the present Vaivasvata Manvantara started 
several millions of years ago and even Kaliyuga in which we are 
deemed to lire started in 3102 B C. Besides, there is a dissolution 
of the world at each day of Brahma, if one is to rely on the Fauranik 
accounts. How could a tradition of the several Manus survive 
such pralaya ? A rationalistic interpretation requires that all this 
that is stated in the PuranaB is mere conjecture and imagination 
and that one cannot safely build theories about the governance 
of society in anoient times on the accounts contained in Puranas. 
The Manusmrti ( H. 19 ) appears to assign the function of the 
regulation of the conduct of all men in the world to the learned 
brahmanas born in Brahmarsidesa ( i e. Kuruksetra, the countries 
of Matsya, Pancala and Surasena or Mathura ) at least after his 
own code was promulgated 

Pessimistic and dismal accounts of what will happen in 
Kaliyuga ( which extends according to the Puranas over 432000 
years and of which only about 5057 years have gone by this time 
in 1956 ) are set forth in the Vanaparva, chap 188, 190, Santi- 
parva 69. 80-97, the Harivamsa ( Bhavisyaparva, chap. 3-5 ff ), 
Brahmapurana chap 229-230, Vayu chap. 58 and 99 verses 
391-428, Matsya 144 32-47, Kfirma X 30, Visnupurana VI 1,

including all the nether regions are destroyed by absence of 
xains and all effects from mahat onwards are destroyed, waters 
first absorb the gandha ( the special quality of the earth ) and 
when gandha-tanmatra is destroyed, the earth is reduced to 
water; the special quality of waters, viz. rasa-lanmaha is des- 
troyed and nothing but fire remains and the whole world is filled 
with fames, then Vayu absorbs fire and i upa-tanmatra vanishes ; 
Vsyu shakes all the ten quarters; akasa absorbs the sparsargima 
of Vayu and only akasa remains as a void and iabda-tanmalra 
is gone and in this way the seven prakrtis including maJiat and 
aJmnkaia are absorbed in order; even Frakrti and Furusa are 
dissolved in Faramatman ( named Yisnu ). The day of Visnu is 
said to be two Farardhas of human years. 

Some works like the Harivamsa ( Bhavisyaparva chap. 10. 
12-68) provide that at the end of Kalpa the sage Markandeya alone 
remains and lies at the time of the pralaya ( or kalpa ) in the side 
of Lord Vismi and then comes out of His mouth. The Brahma- 
purana ( 52. li— 19 and 53 55) says that Markandeya sees a utta 
tree at the end of Kalpa and a jewelled bBd on which he sees a 
boy lying down ( i. e. Yisnu himself ) and then he enters the side 
of that boy and later comes out Vide also Matsya 167 (14-66) 
f or the same story in almost the same words. The Bhagavadglta 
( VJJJ. 18-19 ) speaks of the recurrent absorption of all beings at 
the advent of the night of Brahma and reappearance of beings 
when the day of Brahma starts. 

The theory of yugas, manvantaras and kalpas with their 
fabulous numbers of years and harrowing descriptions of pralaya, 
appears unreal, bizarre and called up by sheer fancy. But under- 
lying it there is the idea of the timelessness of the universe, 
though from time to time it evolves, gradually declines and 
perishes, only to reappear in perfection after a cosmic night. 
There is also the hankering after Reality and pursuit of different 
ideals. It enshrines the ideas that humanity embarks on a 
certain goal, pursues it with great efforts and, after achiev- 
ing some success, gives up that goal and the way that was 
thought to lead to it and pursues some other goal for aeons in 
the hope that at some distant date it will be able to evolve and

construct a perfect society. These ideas are at the bottom of 
what Manu 1053 and others say ' Tapaa was the highest goal 
( deemed to yield great results ) in Krtayuga, knowledge ( of the 
self) was the highest in Treta.yajfia (sacrifices to Qod)inDvapara, 
charity alone in Kali'. This further implies that there are different 
impelling motives in different ages and modern men should not 
assess the actions and ideals of past ages by the same yardstick 
that is applied to contemporary aotions and ideals. It is im- 
plicit in the words of Manu ( XX 301 ) that the four ages are not 
water-tight specific periods of time, hut that the Ruler or Govern- 
ment oan produce conditions of Krta age in what is popularly 
called Kali by appropriate conduct or measures and Medhstithi 
expressly says so. m3a Prof. Mankad has a nove l theory in a 
paper on the manvantaraB in I H Q. vol XVIJI, pp. 208-830, 
where he states that the Oaturyuga formula took 40 years for 
a ruling unit and not for one king's regnal period and that the 
manvantara was the regular method of calculating regnal periods 
of different kings in a dynasty ( p. 2S7 ). Hardly any scholar has 
accepted this theory and for reasons of space and relevance, it is 
not possible to discuss it here. 

In the details about the theory of yugas, manvantaras and 
kalpas there are some divergences. A few may be pointed out 
5ryabhata appears to hold that the extent of eaoh of the four 
yugaB was the same and not in the traditional proportion of 4, 
3 2 1, when he says that he was twenty-three years old when 
three yiuvBAn and 3600 years had elapsed (vide KalatoiySipaaa 
10 quoted in note 995 above ) Brahmagupta (L 9 ) says «* feat, 
though JSryabhata de clared that the four psoas of yugas, viz. Ma

Aryabhata and Brahmagupta 697 

and the others, ware equal, not one of them was equal to what 
thesmrtis declare them to he There is another discrepancy 
also Aryabhata in his Dasagltika verse 3 states that Manu is 
a period of 72 yugas, while all the smrtis and puranas declare 
that a manvantara is equal to 71 yugas. Aryabhata appears 
to have held that the day of Brahma is equal to 1008 catui yugas 
and Brahmagupta ( I 12 ) refers to this view. The celebrated 
scientific astronomer Bhaskaracarya ,(HS (born in saka 1036, 
111! AD) impatiently says ' some say that half of the life of 
Brahma ( L e 50 years ) has passed away, while others say that 
half plus eight years has passed away Whatever the true tradi- 
tion may be, it is of no use, since planetary positions are to be 
established from the days that have passed in the current day 
of Brahma ' 

As incidental to tbe colossal figures of the years of Kalpas 
and Yugas, a few words on numerals, their antiquity and the 
methods of writing numerals would not be out of place, In the 
Rgveda numerals from 1 to 10 are frequently used. ' Sahasra ' 
( thousand ) and ' ayuta ' ( ten thousand ) occur in Rg. IV. 26. 7* 
VEL 1 5, Vm 21 18 One of these says" 96 * O wielder of 
thunderbolt I O immensely rich ( Indra ) 1 I shall not give thee 
away even for a big price, not for a thousand, not for ten 
thousand, nor for hundreds '. In Rg Vill 46. 22 a poet says ' I 
secured 60000 and several tens of thousands of horses, 20 hundreds 
of camels, one thousand dark-coloured mares and ten thousands 
of cows bright in three parts of their bodies ' In Rg I S3 9 
Indra is said to have struck down sixty thousand and 99 enemies. 
Vide Rg. 1126 3 (for sixty thousand cows), Vm 4. 20 and 
VHI 46 29 for 60000 and VI. 63 10 for one hundred thousand 
horses. In some of these the larger numbers are mentioned first 
and the smaller ones next ( as in Rg L 53 9, VBX 46 22 ); in 
others it is the reverse No conclusion can therefore be drawn 
that the smaller numbers come first in the Rgvedic times In 
Tai. B 17 4 11 3-4 reference is made to bricks in numbers from 
one, one hundred, thousand, ayuta (ten thousand), niyuta, 
•prayuta, arbuda, nyarbuda, samudra, madhya, anta and parardha,

of the latest works on this system is « From Zero to Sr? 

TMswork says that the zero escaped even the greatest Greeks, 
Pythagoras, Euclid and Archimedes (p 4) The Egyptians" 81 
had a decimal system of numerals but no sign for zero and 
therefore no positional notation, which even the Greeks did not 
know, ancient Babylonians also had no definite symbol for zero 
and there is no example of zero signs at the end of numbers even 
m their latest astronomical writings It is difficult to say when 
exactly a symbol or word for zero was employed in India Bnfc 
it must have been several oenturieB before the beginning of the 
Christian era Pingala Work on metres is a ietftfo^B Progala'B 
sutra on metres makes use of zero (sunya) in vIII 88-31. 
Even the Satapatha Br. (XI 4 3 20) seems to be aware of 
Vedangas. But it may be argued that there is nothing to show 
that Pingala's work was known to it It is most probably 

1102. Vide * Legacy of Egypt '( Glanvtlle p 166), E S A by Nenge- 
baner p. 20, Sarton in * a History of Science ' p 69, Prof Neugebauer in 
JAOS. vol. 61 pp 213-215 avers that strong arguments exist for the assump- 
tion that the Babylonian methods of calculation went, together with GreeL 
Astronomy, to India, and that, sometime in the first centnnes ol the 
Christian era, the corresponding decimal place value notation in India, 
which through the Arabs gave rise to the modern system of Europe Witt 
great respect the author must demur to these assertions. The learned write! 
endeavours to show that a peculiar sign was used for zero in Mesopotamian 
cuneiform texts The important questions that must be answered are, who 
discovered the symbol for zero now used almost throughout the world, 
whether the so-called sign for zero which Prof Neugebauer asserts he has 
discovered in cuneiform texts was ever used in Europe orfor that matter any- 
where in the world except in Mesopotamia, what direct relation exists 
between the Indian zero symbol and the recently discovered zero symbol 
( which no one had found so far ), whether the symbols for 1 to 9 in India 
bear any resemblance to the Mesapotarman symbols for these numbers, 
whether the Greets (who admittedly borrowed many things from Meso- 
potamia) used the Mesopotamian zero symbol and, if so, when The 19th 
centnry was distinguished by the theories of Western Scholars claiming 
that science, philosophy and arts began in Greece and that other nations 
borrowed these from the Greets That bubble of Greek primacy in tbe£S 
matters has now been pricked. The twentinth century appears to be heading 
for giving to Mesopotamia the place once assigned to the Greeks The 
Mesopotamian bubble raised by some scholars may be pricked in course of 
tJnje, particularly as regards others borrowing from them. 



Several methods of writing numerals 701 

mentioned as Ghandovioiti in the Apastamba-dharmasutra U(B 
Sahara "°* ( about 200 A D. and not later than 400 A D. ) 
speaks of Pingala's work as on the same level with Panini's 
sutra It is unnecessary to offer further proofs of the antiquity 
of Pingala's sutra. 

There were several methods of writing numerals One was 
the place value notation, in which the same numeral has different 
values according to the place it occupies; for example, the figure 
two may have the value of only two or twenty or two hundred 
and so on according as it occupies the units place or tens place 
or hundreds place Another way is that of employing words to 
denote complete numbers This was a very reliable method when in 
astronomy huge figures had to be employed and works were not 
printed but only copied by hand. In ancient times, the writers 
of mss. might often omit zeros or other figures, but if words with 
a fixed meaning in relation to numbers were used, they would 
not be so easily dropped and as many works were metrical, the 
omission of a word, if any, might have been far mors easily 
detected It is difficult to say when this system was introduced. 
But its beginnings are ancient For example, the word krla is 
used in the Taittirlya 110s Brabmana in the sense of 'four*. 
Varahamihira ( beginning of the 6th century A. D. ) employs 
these word numerals but in the place value system ( vide H of 
Dh. vol HI p 897 n. 17b3.) The following is a list of some of the 
very usual numbers with the corresponding words employed 
to indicate them It should be noted that the list is not exhaus- 
tive. Any number of synonyms 1106 may be employed to indicate 
the same number. Vide the lists in Alberuni ( Sachau, vol. I. 
pp. 174-179 ) and Bidder's ' Indian Paleography * { L A. vol 33 ;

and in Brhat-samhita 8. 20 and by all later astronomical 
writers uw The particular matter to be noted is that the first 
word in a group ( denoting a number ) is to be assigned to the 
units place, the next to its left in the tens place, so that a word 
like ' saptasvi-veda-sankhyam ' becomes 427 (by the rule 
' ankanam vamato gatih ' ) 

Another method for expressing numbers is elaborated by 
Aryabhata in his Dasagltikapada 1116 ( verse 3 ) where the letters 
from k ( ka also ) to m have the values of 1 to 25, while ya, ?a, la, 
va, sa, sa, sa and ha stand for 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 
and so on towards more complicated matters 

The fourth cmga in a panc&nga is called Yoga. There is no 
direct astronomical phenomena corresponding to it It is 
calculated from the sum of the longitudes of the Sun and the 
Moon ( or it is the time during which the sun and the moon 
together accomplish 13 degreeB and 20 minutes of space ) When 
this amounts to degrees 13 20 the first Yoga called Viskambha 
ends; when it amounts to 26,40 the 2nd Yoga Prlti ends and 
so on. The yogas are 27 ( that thus make 860 degrees ) as stated

Eier-recurring yogas 705 

These axe nttya ( ever-recurring ) Yogas The Ratnamala 
states that they yield good or bad results in keeping with their 
names. The Muhntfcadaisana llu states that among these 27 
yogas nine are condemned, viz. Parigha, Vyatlpata, Vajra, 
Vyaghata, Vaidhrti, Viskambha, Sula, Ganda im and Atiganda. 
The Ratnamala provides that Vyatlpata and Vaidhrti are wholly 
inauspicious, the first half of Farigha is so and only .the first 
quarter of those Yogas the names of which are odious; and that 
one should avoid in all auspicious rites the first three ghatikfis 
in Viskambha and Vajra, nine ghatls in Vyaghata, five in Sola, 
six in Ganda and Atiganda. The AgnipurSna 1113 (127. 1-8) has 
similar verses. The Kalanirnaya-kSrika 1114 provides that when 
a Yoga spreads over two days, fasts and the like are to be observed 
on the first of the two days provided that Yoga exists at sunset 
on that day, and vratas and religious gifts are to be performed 
on the latter ( of two days ) provided the Yoga exists for three 
muhurtas ( i. e. six ghatts ) after sunrise and for sraddha the day 
on which the Yoga extends over the time required for the sraddha 
rite should be accepted. 

The system of Yogas must be held to be ancient. The Ysjfia- 
valkyasmrti ( L 218 ) when specifying the times for the perfor- 
mance of sraddhas includes Vyatlpata among them. In the 
Eaisacarita of Bana it is said ( Ucchvasa IV ) that Harsa was 
born on a day free from the taint of all defects such as Vyatlpata 
( vyatlpatadi-sarvados&bhisanga^rahiteshani ) There would gene-

included ( vide H. of Dh vol IV pp, 382-383 and note 861). 
Besides these 27 Yogas, there are others that occur when there 
are special conjunctions of weekdays with certain tithis and 
naksatras or when certain planets occupy certain rails on 
certain tithis and naksatras. For Kapilasasthfyoga and Ardho- 
daya, vide above pp 279 and 261. Vyatlpata itself has two 
technical senses apart from being 17th out of the 27 Yogas 
mentioned above viz. (1) When amavasyS 1115 occurs on a Sunday 
and the moon is in the first quarter on any one of the naksatras 
, Sravana, AsvinI, Dhanistha, £idra and£slesa that is Vyatlpata ; 
( 2 ) When on the 12th of the bright half Jupiter and Mare are 
in the sign Lion, the Sun is in Bam and when that tithi has 
Hasta naksatra on it, it is Vyatlpata 1116 Yoga. These two are 
sometimes called MahSvyatlpata Gifts made on those conjunc- 
tions are very much commended, 1117 'gifts on amavSsya yield one 
hundred-fold merit, on the suppression of a tithi a thousand-fold, 
on Visuva day ten thousand-fold, but on Vyatlpata endless (merit). 
By gifts of cows, land, gold and clothes made on this the donor 
becomes free from sin and secures godhead, the position of India, 
health, the rulership of men." 18 The Suryasiddhanta ( XL 1-2 ) 
gives an explanation of Vyatlpata and Vaidhrta 1119 (or Vaidhrti}- 
when the sun and the moon are on the same side of either solstice 
and when,the sum of their longitudes being a circle they are of 
equal declination it is styled Vaidhrti When the moon and the 
sun are on opposite sides of either solstice and their minntes of 
declination are the same, it is Vyatlpata, the snm of their

Vyatlpata and Vaidhrti 707 

longitudes being a half circle Why the times mentioned should 
be looked upon as specially inauspicious or unfortunate is not 
at all dear and no plausible reason has been assigned The 27th 
Yoga called Vaidhrti was just like Vyatlpata in all respects. 
Bharadvaja says that the merit of gifts made on Vyatlpata and 
Vaidhrti is endless. 

In the pancangas several Yogas ( that have nothing to do 
with the 27 yogas ) like Amrtasiddhi, Yamaghanta, Dagdhayoga, 
Mrtyuyoga, Ghabada are mentioned ; they are purely astrological 
and all of them except three are passed over here for reasons of 
space. When on Sunday there is Hasta, on Monday Mrgastrsa, 
on Tuesday AsvinI, on Wednesday Anuradha, on Thursday Tisya 
( i. e. Fusya ), on Friday BevatI and on Saturday Rohinl, all 
these are Amrtasiddhiyogas ( fortunate ones MM ). Avoid Anu- 
radha on Sunday, TTttarasadha on Monday, Satataraka on 
Tuesday, Asvini on Wednesday, Mrgaslrsa on Thursday, Aslesa 
on Friday and Hasta on Saturday — these are seven Mrtyuyogas 
(inauspicious). If the weekdays from Sunday to Saturday 
occur on the tithis, 12th, 11th, 10th, 3rd, 6th, 2nd, 7th respec- 
tively, these are Dagdhayogas ( inauspicious yogas ). 

The fifth item in a pancanga is Earana. Half of a tithi is 
Karana and thus there are two Karanas in a tithi and 60 Karanas 
in a lunar month. Karanas are of two kinds, viz. cava ( moving ) 
and sthira ( immoveable ). The seven oat a karanas with their 
presiding deities according to Brhatsamhita, chap 99. 1-2 
are: 1. Bava-Indra; 2. Balava-Brahma; 3 Kaulava-Mitra , 
4. Taitila-Aryaman, 5. Gara(or Garaja)- Earth; 6 Vanija- 
SrX, 7. Visti-Yama. The four sthira karanas with their deities 
are: 1 Sakuni-Kali; 2. Oatuspada-Vrsa; 3. Naga- snake; 
4. Kimstughna-Vayu Some works transpose the two, Catuspada 
and Naga This division of a tithi into two halves resembles 
the division of a rasi into two horas ( Brha^ataka 19) It is 
likely that one was suggested by the other The difficulty is to 
decide which was the earlier. I believe it likely that the division 
of tithis into two karanas is the earlier of the two. The sthira 
karanas occur only once in a month i e. on the latter half of

14th tithi of dark half occurs &akuni : Oatuspada and Nsga 
occupy the two halves of amavasya and Kimstughna oocuis on 
the first half of Pratipad i. e If the 30 tithis of an amanta month 
are divided into 60 halves, Sakuni, Oataspada and NSga occupy 
the 58th, 59th and 60th parts and Kimstughna occupies the first 
half of the pratipad of the next month. Bava occupies the second 
half of sukla pratipad and the others follow one after another 
and as they are only seven they are repeated eight times in a 
month from the 2nd half of pratipad to the first half of the 14th , 
tithi of a dark half, which would be 57th of the sixty halves of the 
tithis of the month and would be occupied by Visti In the 
pafioangas, two karanas should properly be shown under eaoh 
tithi, but in paSoSngas only that Karana is shown against a 
tithi whose ending moment is 30 ghatikas or leas from sunrisa 
The ending times, of Karanas which are assigned to the 2nd 
halves of tithis coinoide with those of the tithis themselves and 
therefore there is no need for their calculation. The ending 
times of the first halves of tithis which correspond to certain 
Karanas are got in the manner described by Pillai in his * Indian 
Bphemeris ', vol. 1 part 1 p 37, paragraphs 106-107 

The word Karana is derived from the root ' kr ' ( to do ) and 
is said to have bean so named because it divides a tithi in two 
parts. 1131 The names of most of the Karanas are somewhat 
strange and inexplicable. The word ' Taitila-kadra ' occurs in 
Panini VL 2. 42 (with regard to aoosnt) but the KsSika ex- 
plains that Taitila means * a descendant or pupil or Trtilin . 
If a mere oonjeoture were to be offered, the Karana Taitite 
might have been first named after a man so called The Saranw 
are only of astrological use and must have been named many 
centuries before 400 A D. The mrad a puigna«a mentaonsboa

Vedio sacrifices (called istis) and acts leading to physical 
prosperity and mangala acts (marriage &c.) and other acts that 
bring success in these matters. 

One very noticeable feature is that the 7th mobile Karana 
called Visti appears to have inspired great terror in the minds 
of medieval writers on Dharmasastra It will be noticed that 
dividing the lunar month into 60 halves of tithis, and beginning 
Bava on the second half of the pratipad of an amanta month, 
the Karana Visti will ooour eight times in one month as the

In the dark half, "» Viati will occur in the latter half of the 
third and 10th tithis and in the first half of the 7th and 14th 
tithis; in the bright half Visti will occur in the latter half of the 
4th and 11th tithis and the fiist half of the 8th and 15th ( i e. 
Paurnamasi ) tithis The Kajamartanda 1 " 5 states ' Some regard 
Visti as having the form of a cobra and as terrible; there is 
danger in the mouth of a snake but not in its tail The mouth, 
-neck, chest, navel region, waist and tail of Visti are respectively' 
of five, one, eleven, four, sis and three ghatikas Great sages 
declare that it ( Visti) does not confer fortunate results, therefore 
a good man should avoid these except the tail ' { on last three 
ghatikas of Visti auspicious acts may be performed ) Visti is 
also euphemistically called BhadrS or Kalyanl (it is really 
dbhadi a ). The terrible nature of Visti is described in two verses 
of Bhhna-parakrama quoted in Bhujabala-mbandha p 30 (vidB 
pp. 95-96 of my paper on * Bhoja and his works &o ' in Journal 
of Oriental Research, Madras, vol XXHIfor 1953-54) whioh 
also occur in Rajatnartanda, verses 1021-23 

The whole scheme of Karanas is itself fanciful But to draw 
a lurid picture of one of them, Visti ( which occurs eight tunes 
in a month ), and say that it is like a cobra or an ogress is the 
height of imagination dominated by astrological consideration* 

Having described at some length the five angas in a 
pancanga, a few words must be said about Hindu calendars,

Numerous paficangas in. India 711 

continent of India there axe numerous paficangas in vogue and 
there is something like anarchy in this sphere Hardly any Wo 
paficangas agree completely Many educated I ndians have 
been demanding that such matters as eclipses, the times of which 
can he noted by anyone, should he accurately predicted by the 
almanacs and that our ancient methods of calculating the 
motions of heavenly bodies should be brought in line with 
modern accurate calculations based upon observations This is 
just what scientific astronomers like Varahamihira would have 
done if they were living in modern times At the end of his two 
works Yaraha makes a very candid but solemn request 1116 
' whatever in this work comes to be unscientific while it is being 
used or on account of defects in the mss, or whatever may have 
been badly executed by me or insufficiently done or not done at 
all, that should be corrected by learned men, leaving aside all 
passion ( jealousy ), and after acquiring ( knowledge ) from the 
lips of well-read men ' Some almanac-makers follow the Nautical 
Almanac tables as to eclipses and the like and set out other 
matters according to the old tables As already stated there are 
three main schools of astronomers in India, ( 1 ) the school that 
follows the Surya-siddhanta ( and is called Saurapaksa }, ( 2 ) the 
second follows the Brahma-siddhanta (and is called Brahma- 
paksa ), ( 3 } the third follows the Aryasiddhanta ( and is styled 
Sjyapaksa ) There are two main points of difference between 
these, viz ( 1 ) the length of the year, ( 2 ) the number of revolu- 
tions of the sun, the moon and the planets in a certain period 
such as a mahayuga The difference in the length of the year 
among the siddhantas is very small viz a few vipilns ( a vipala 
being B Vth part of &pala, which again is *\jth of a ghatika that 
is equal to 24 minutes ). The length of the year according to the 
SuryasiddhSnta is 365 days 15 ghatls, 31 523 pcdus, while the 
interval in time between two successive returns of the sun to the 
vernal equinox (called the tropical year ) is only 365 days, 
14 ghatls and 31 972 palas and the correct sideral ( naksatra ) 
year is 365 days, 15 ghatls, 22 palas and 53 vipalas ( vide C. R O. 
Report p 240 in hours, minutes and seconds and Dikshit's 
History ed of 1931 pp. 159, 440 ) The result is that if one follows 
the Suryasiddhanta, the starting point of Hindu astronomers 
is at present more than 23 degrees to the east of the correct 
vernal equinox point This difference is called the ayanamsa. 



W2 History of MarmaiSsh a. [See. II, Ch. XIX 

As the longitudes of heavenly bodies reckoned from the equinox 
include these ayanSAisas they are called sayana ( sa + ayana ). 
The places of heavenly bodies obtained by the methods of the 
Suryasiddhanta and medieval Sanskrit works are distinguished 
by being called mi ayana (devoid of taking into account 
precession }. At present according to most almanacs that employ 
the Suryasiddhanta values Makarasankranti (Sun's entrance into 
Capricorn ) falls generally on 14th January, but according to the 
most accurate modern calculations, it should fell on 21st 
December, even in calendars that pride themselves on being 
iuddha the Makarasankrfinti falls on 9th January ie. our 
Makarasankranti is celebrated UZ7 about 23 or 18 days Ister 
than it should be and the same happens to the vernal equinox, 
autumnal equinox and the summer solstice and many 
other observances AsvinI is still reckoned as the first naksatra 
( in which the vernal equinox is deemed to have occurred about 
saka 444 ), although the vernal equinox point has receded to the 
TJttara-bhadrapada group of stars ( which should now be treated 
as the first naksatra). Efforts have been made by those familiar 
with the modern accurate calculations (such as the late KeioL. 
Gbatre J to introduce modrn calculations in our almanacs; but 
they have met with little response. The late LokamSnya Tilak 
(who was a great Vedio scholar and mathematician) held several 
conferences of Indian astronomers and other interested people at 
Bombay ( 1904 ),Poona( 1917) and at Sangli (1919). At the 
last conference several resolutions were passed which without 
making a total break with the past were calculated to reform 
our calendar and to prevent furthur deterioration It is un- 
necessary to set out all the resolutions, but the most impor- 
tant were that the length of the year should be that of the 
Saryasiddbsnta but subject to necessary corrections, tne 
rate of precession should be accepted at 50 3 ukalSs a year (as 
determined by modern astronomical observations), that aw

which was published in 1924. Almanacs "based on its data have 
been published and are sometimes known as ' Tilak Paficanga ' 
But it mustibe confessed that our people in general are so much 
custom-ridden that the 'popular response 'to the reformed 
calendar iB poor. People still follow the pancangas based on the 
old Biddh&ntas. According to the sastraB every religiouB festival 
is to be celebrated at the proper, time i.- e in the right season and 
on the proper tithi. ,The tithi depends upon ,the correct calcula- 
tion of the movements of the moon, which are most ,diffioult to* 
reduce to rules that' will give accurate results. Many people will 
not observe the ekadaii fast if the eleventh tithi is mixed »p 
with the lOttf tithi even for a few ghatikas. Biit what guarantee 
is there that the 10th tithi has been accurately calculated ? The 
ending moments of tithis do not agree with those given by (he 
Nautical Almanac which are based on modern formula and are 
verified by actual observation. > If -tithis be calculated 'according 
to different' Sanskrit 'astronomical treatises the moment of a 
particular tithi may .differ by as much as five hours and the same 
festival ( such as KranajamnastamI or Dussei a ) may be celebrated 
on two successive days in the same city. • 

Besides, it must not be forgotten thatapaficanga'prepared on 
the basis of the latitude and longitude of Poona or Bombay will 
be slightly wrong even at a distance of 30 or 40 miles to the west* 
or east or north. It would be a great mistake from the religious 
point of view to employ a paficanga prepared on the basis ofethe' 
longitude and latitude of Poona or Bombay in a plaoe several 
hundred miles away ( such as in Hyderabad or AurangabacU), 
Rrom the religious point t of view if accuracy is to be preserved 
there must be a separate paficanga for every town or every place, 
not more than 10 or 15 miles from places like Bombay or Poona 
where pafioangas 'are at present" prepared.' " ' - v ' 

In November "19 52 the Government of India appointed a 
committee called the" Calendar Reform Committee presided over 
by Dr. Meghanad Saha to examine all existing calendars being 
followed at present in India and to submit proposals for an 
accurate and uniform calendar for the whole of India That 
h. d. so 



I?1 * History of Dharmaisstro I Sec. IT, Ch, Zt£ 

committee submitted a very exhaustive and valuable report in 
November 1955. The final recommendations of the Committee 
for a civil calendar and for a religious calendar are set out on 
pp. 6-8 of the report. They are deserving? of the moat serious 
consideration by all who feel that religious observances must be 
done at the proper time and that now at least in independent 
India there should not only be one uniform civil calendar, but 
also one uniform Hindu religious calendar. 1 " 9 It appears that 
unless Government makes great efforts for the introduction of a 
correot calendar even for religious purposes, it would be futile to 
assume that common people will spontaneously adopt a correct 
pancSnga. 

Some of the important recommendations of the Committee 
may be set out here for the information of readers. 
Recommendations for ami calendar 
( 1 ) The Saka era should be used in the unified national calendar. 
The Saka year 1876 corresponds to 1954-55 A D 

( Z ) The year should start from the day following the vernal 
equinox day. 

( 3 ) Normal year is to consist of 365 days, while a leap year 
would have 366 days After adding 78 to the Saka era 
year, if the sum is divisible by 4, then it would be a leap 
year. But when the sum becomes a multiple of 100, it 
would be a leap year only when ft is divisible by 400; 
otherwise it would be a common year. 

( 4 ) Caitra ( or Ghaitra as often written ) should be the first 
month of the year and the lengths of the different months 
should be fixed as follows :— 



Caitra— 30 days (31 days in a 

leap year ). 
VaisSkha— 31 days. 
Jyestha — 31 days. 
AsSdha — 31 days ' 
Sravana— 31 days 
Bhfidrapada— 31 dayB. 



Asvina — 30 dayB. 

K&rtika — 30 days. 
Margaslrsa — 30 days. 
Fausa — 30 days. 
Magha— 30 days. 
Phalguna— 30 days.

Calendar Committee's Recommendations 



Hi 



The dates of the reformed Indian calendar would thuB have 
a permanent correspondence with the Gregorian 1130 calendar. 
The corresponding dates would be : 

Hindu Gregorian 

Caitral — March 22 in a 

common year and 

21 in a leap year. 
Vaisakha 1— April 21. 
Jyestha 1 — May 22. 
Asadha 1— June 22. 
SrSvana 1— July 28. 
Bhadrapada 1 — August 23. 



Asvina 1 — September 23. 

ESrtika 1— October 23. 
Margaslraa 1 — November 2 
Fausa 1 — December 22. 
M&gha 1 — January 21. 
Fhalguna 1 — February 20. 



The Indian seasons would thus be permanently fixed with 
respect to the reformed Calendar as follows : 



Hemanta — E&rtika and 
( late autumn ) Margaslraa. 

Sisira — Paosa and M&gha. 
( winter ) 

Yasanta — Fhalguna and 
( Spring ) Oaitra. 



Qxlsma —Vaisakha and 
( summer ) Jyestha. 

Varsa — As&dha and 
(rains) Sravana 

Sarad — Bhsdrapada and 
( Autumn ) Sivina. 



The States now having the Bolar calendars for civil and 
partly religious purposes which start the year from Vaisakha 
( April 14th ) will have to begin the year 23 days earlier, but the 
first month will be Caitra. The effect of this will be that in 
Bengal, Orissa and Assam solar months start approximately 
seven days later than now, and in Tamil-nad solar months start 
approximately 23 days earlier than now, for the month called 
Vaisakha ( 14th April to 14th May ) in Bengal and Orissa is 
called Ckithrai (or caitra) in Tamil-nad. Those who use the lunar 
calendar beginning with Caitra also for civil purposes would 
experience no great difficulty in adopting this unified calendar 

1130 It may be noted that ander the Indian Limitation Act (Act I of 
1908 ) section 25, all Instruments (ball, for the pnrpossesot the Limitation 
Act, be deamed to be made with reference to the Gregorian Calendar. This 
rale is absolute and therefore even if a bond is made on a lltht of a lunar 
month in a certain safea year and is made payable four months after the 
ma date, the period of limitation applicable to a suit brought on the bond 
rant from the expiration of fonr months after the date computed according 
» the Gregorian Calendar. 



716 History of DharmaS&stra lSecH,Ch 21X 

as they have at present the beginning of their year on -various 
datos from 15th March to 13th April and the first month is Oaitra. 

Recommendations for tehgious calendar. 

(5) The calculation for Bauta (solar) months necessary 
for determining the lunar months of the same name will start 
23 degrees and 15 minutes ( fixed ayanSmsa ) ahead of the vernal 
equinox point. This tallies with the present practice of most 
almanac-makers. 

The months would thus commence at the moments when.the 
tropical longitude of the sun attains the following values; viz. 
Saura Vaisakha commences when the sun has the longitude of

Calendar Committee's Recommendations 717 

astronomically correct seasons, bat those determined by the 
lunar calendar would continue to be observed in times conform- 
ing to the present practice and the correction introduced by this 
report in line length of the year would prevent their farther shift 
in relation to the seasons. 

The dates of festivals have already shifted by twenty-three 
days from the seasons in which they were observed about 1400 
years ago as a result of our almanc-makers having ignored the 
precession of the equinoxes. Although it might appear to some 
desirable that the entire amount of shifting be wiped out at 
once, the authors of the Report consider it expedient to maintain 
this as constant difference and to stop its further increase. As a 
result there would at present be no deviation from the prevail- 
ing custom in the observance of religious festivals. 

In the calculation of naLsatras, however, the Report has 

adopted a variable ayanamia, so that at the time of a particular 

naksatra the moon may be seen in the sky in the star or star- 

> group of that name. Tiis praotioe has been followed in our 

country from Vedie times and is perfectly scientific. 

( 8 ) The day should be reckoned from midnight to mid- 
night of the central station ( 82$ degrees E Longitude and 23 s 
11' North Latitude ) for civil purposes but for religious purposes 
the local sunrise system may be followed. 

( 9 ) l"or the purpose of all calculations, the longitudes of 
the sun and the moon should be obtained by applying the most 
upto-date and complete equations of their motions, so that they 
may tally with their actually observed values 

{10) Steps should be taken to compile an 'Indian Ephe- 
meris and Nautical Almanac ' by the Government of India, 
showing in advance the positions of the • sun, the moon f the 
planets and other heavenly bodies ' The Indian calendar, both 
civil and religious, prepared according to the above recommenda- 
tions should be included in that publication every year ' _ ' 

til ' 

One can only express the hope 'that the above mentioned 
recommendations of the Committee of distinguished astronomers 
and Sanskrit scholars wjll receive a wide and hearty response 
from the Hindu people and that the present confusion and 
'anarohy in the matter of .religious observances in our country 
will> come to an end as 'soon as possible < The Government of 
India accepted the principal recommendations of the Committee

by issuing a Press Note on 23rd October 1956 which decided 
that the Uniform National Calendar should he adopted with 
effect from March 22, 1957 corresponding to ( Solar ) Obaifcra 1, 
1879, Saka Era, for certain official purposes in conjunction with 
the Gregorian Calendar and laid down the steps to be taken by 
the Central Government and the States Governments for imple- 
menting the decision. To avoid misunderstandings and to encou- 
rage the use by the mass of the people of this Solar Calendar, 
Government has deoided to make use of both the Gregorian 
Calendar and the New Indian Solar Calendar together in some 
Government business, such as publishing the Indian Government 
Gazette with both dates, the All India Badio Broadcasting news 
every day announcing both dates at the beginning. But 
Government is not going to give up as far as possible the 
practice of declaring public holidays on religious festivals 
according to the old Calendars. The Government will publish 
translations of the Calendar Reform Committee's Report in the 
principal languages of India, It must be said however that this 
Calendar does not remove all the defects of the Gregorian 
Calendar. 1131 The years will still commence on different week days 
and the number of days in each month still varies. It is feared 
that this will add only one more calendar to the existing ones.
