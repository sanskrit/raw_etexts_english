Read by the General Editor, Dr. V. S. Sukthankar, on the occasion oj 
the publication of the Udyogaparvan and the presentation of it to 
the Rajasaheb of Aundh, on 6th July, 1940 

Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, 

On this happy and auspicious day, which is the twenty-third anniversary 
of the foundation of this Institute, I am glad to announce the publication of 
the edition of the* Udyogaparvan by Professor Dr. S. K. De of the Dacca 
University, which is volume six of our Critical Edition of the Mahabhlarata. 
This is, as you are no doubt aware, the third parvan to be completed by us. 
The Adiparvan, edited by myself, was completed in 1933. It was followed 
three years later by the Virataparvan edited by Professor Dr. Raghu ViRA 
of the Sanatan Dharma College, Lahore. And now we have the Udyoga- 
parvan, which, I hope, will testify to our industry and perseverance. 

The amount of matter published during the last 21 years, since the com- 
mencement of the work in 1919, may appear to you small. And it is a fact 
that some editions of the Mahabhlarata which were begun long after we had 
started have already been long completed. But you must not confuse those 
editions with ours. Those other editions implied only work for compositors 
and proof-readers. Their procedure, which is very simple, is this. Older 
editions of thdv Mahabharata are put in the hands of compositors, who pro- 
ceed to manufacture a new edition, faithfully copying, in every detail, all the 
old mistakes and adding some of their own making,, in the bargain. 

When this Institute undertook to bring out a Critical Edition of the 
Mahabharata, it was not meant to bring out a new edition in this time- 
honoured way, which has made the term Indian edition a synonym of a 
bad edition.’' In Indian editions of the past, the paper was bad, the type 
was bad, the ink was bad, and the text also was generally bad. I do not 
wish to say that we have produced an ideal edition of the Mahabharata, but 
I do maintain that we have taken a distinct step forward in that direction, 
and that our work has marked an appreciable advance in the technique of 
the editing of Sanskrit texts. And when I say that I am giving you not my 
own opinion but the considered opinion of savants, published repeatedly in 
the course erf lengthy and elaborate reviews of our edition, in high-dass and 
authoritative Journals throughout the world. The edition has been before 
the world of scholars for nearly fifteai years, and there has been a steady 



432 A STATEMENT I^GARiDING PROGRESS OF CRIT. ED. OF THE MBH. 

chorus of enthusiastic approbation greeting the appearance of every successive 
fascicule, whose publication is eagerly awaited by Indologists in all parts of 
the world. 

When we say we are bringing out an edition of the Mahabharata, we 
are really considerably underrating our own work. It is not merely a text- 
edition that we are preparing. What we have undertaken is a research into 
the Mahabharata manuscript tradition, which, you will realize, is a very dif- 
ferent thing and which — let me emphasize — has now been undertaken for the 
first time in the long history of our Great Epic. 

Let us glance for a moment at the history of the project. Since 1897 
there has been a steady and persistent demand for a critical edition of the 
Mahabharata, which was wanted, as the late Professor Winternitz put it, 
“as the only sound basis for all Mahabharata studies, nay, for all studies 
connected with the epic literature of India.” In 1904, as a result of the 
agitation which was kept up in Europe by certain Indologists, the Interna- 
tional Association of the Academies of Europe and America undertook the 
work. And for that purpose, even some money was collected by the Sans- 
kritists in England, through the Secretary of State for India, from certain 
sources in India, and the amount was placed in the hands of Trustees in 
England, which is still lying there, in the name of the Trustees, in some 
English bank. The last great European War put an end to this project of 
a European edition of the Mahabharata, which ended as a matter of fact 
without achieving anything beyond son^ preliminary work. After that war, 
this Institute undertook the work, making a fresh start. The difficulty was 
of course the money. What really made it possible for the Institute to launch, 
some twenty years ago, this gigantic and ambitious scheme was the promise 
made by Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, Raja Saheb of Aundh,-~-our 
worthy guest of this evening — ^to contribute a lakh of rupees to the Maha- 
bharata Publication Fund. Sir Ramkrishna Bhandarkar, the then senior- 
most Acarya of Indology in Western India, w*as naturally consulted. He is 
reported to have said that the project was certainly worth undertaking, but 
it would cost ten lakhs of rupees ; and if was no use undertaking the work 
unless there were prospects of raising that sum. When he was assured that 
that amount would be found, he agreed to sptmsor the undertaking, and as a 
matter of fact himself inaugurated it 'here, in this hall, in April 1919, by 
writing down the mantra of the Great Epic, ndrdyanam nafnskjtya etc. The 
Institute, it may be observed, undertook then to prepare an edition in which 
all the different versions of the epic have been turned to account and which 
will meet with the highest requirements of critical scholarship. 

With that our work has been chalked out for us. It divides itself natu- 
rally into five stages : (1) search for old and reliable MSS. ; (2) collation 
of the MSS. ; (3) constitution of the text with the help of the collations; 



A STATEMENT REGARDING PROGRESS OF CRIT. ED. OF THE MBH. 433 

(4) preparation of the critical apparatus, to be printed along with the consti- 
tuted text ; and, finally, (5) seeing the matter through the press. 

From the published volumes you will see that on every page from a half 
to two-thirds of the space is taken up by the critical notes, which give a very 
detailed account of the M9S. examined and collated and which form the bulk 
of our evidence for the text. It is this which necessitates laborious work and 
demands endless patience ; and its completion for the parvans so far publish- 
ed is, I consider, the abiding achievement of our edition. Our edition thus 
gives you not only a text, a critical text, but also a digest of the MSS. tradi- 
tion of the Mahabharata extending over nearly 2000 years. I may observe 
that in the case of every text, when the manuscript tradition fluctuates to any 
extent, it is only a careful study of the collations of the MSS., and nothing 
else, that can give you an authentic text ; just as when there is a dispute 
between two or more litigants an impartial judge trying the case would decide 
it only after examining the depositions and hearing the evidence of all the 
parties and their witnesses. 

I am glad to say that the method which has been worked out by the 
Institute for dealing with the Mahabharata textual problem has commended 
itself to all scholars who are competent to pass an opinion on the merits of 
the question. Professor Walter Ruben, of the University of Ankara, who 
has made a close study of Ramayana MSS., has declared that the same me- 
thod may be applied, mutatis mutandis, to the Ramayapa also. Appreciative 
reviews of our edition, as I remarked already, have been published during 
the last thirteen years not only in Indian, but also in English, French, Ger- 
man, Italian, Czecho-Slovakian, Polish and American Journals. The scheme 
has been commended by the International Oriental Congress, by the All- 
India Oriental Conference and by many of the learned bodies specializing in 
Oriental studies. There have been heard a few dissentient voices, but they 
are mostly of persons who do not know the ABC of textual criticism and 
who have never even seen a Mahabharata MS. in their whole life. Such 
uninformed criticism of self-styled scholars we may safely ignore. 

But we need not rest on the judgment of other scholars alone, for a 
justification of our method. The correctness of the method adopted by us 
has been vindicated now by independent and objective evidence. The now 
famous Rajaguru MS., discovered in Nepal by the Rajaguru Pandit Hema- 
RAJ, which is nearly 800 years old and is therefore the? oldest extant MS. of 
the Adi'parvan, confirms not only many of the disputed readings of the critical 
text but justifies even some of the emendations made by me, which is — it 
will be admitted— unimpeachable evidence of the correctness of the method 
we havd been following. 

We have completed now in this fashion, as I said, three whole bodts of 
the Mahabharata : the Adiparvan, the Virataparvan and the Udyogaparvan. 



434 A STATEMENT REGARDING PROGRESS OF CRIT. ED. OF THE MBH. 

As for the other parvans, you are no doubt aware that the Sabhaparvan has 
been assigned to Professor Frankling Eogerton of Yale University, who came 
over to Poona in 1938 in order to examine for himself the MSS. of the Sabha 
which had been collated by the Institute for him, and also to give* the finish- 
ing touches to his edition in consultation with me. His work has been lying 
with him ready for publication and would have been sent to the press long 
ago, but for this war, which is hampering inter-communication and delaying 
the publication of the parvan. 

The next parvan we took in hand is the Vanaparvan (or rather the 
Aranyakaparvan, to give it its correct name) , which is being edited by myself. 
It is passings through the press as rapidly as we can take it through. It will 
comprise about 11(X) pages of our edition, of which nearly 7(X) pages have 
already been printed off. I hope to finish it — if nothing untoward happens 
to hinder its progress— by the end of this year. 

As regards the Bhismaparvan, which has been assigned to Rao Bahadur 
Dr. Belvalkar, I am glad to report that considerable advance has been 
made by the editor in the preparation of the press-copy. Not only has Dr. 
Belvalkar completed his draft of the constituted text, but the compilation 
of the critical notes has been taken in hand and is proceeding apace. 

When the Bhismaparvan is completed, which we hope to do in a little 
over a year from now, we shall have completed nearly 45 per cent, of this 
gigantic work. You will realize the amount of work that will be accomplisli- 
ed when I tell you that we shall have critically dealt with a little under 40,(X>0 
slokas and printed about 4500 pages of our edition. 

The collation work has made considerable advance and is a long way 
ahead of the publication. We possess now nearly complete collations of all 
the parvans up to the Anu^sana, which means that we have nearly finished 
that part of our task ; because there remains now only the short tail, consist- 
ing of some easy and unimportant parvans, which I am confident, will offer 
no great difficulties either to the collator or to the editor. 

1 have given you, gentlemen, a very brief outline of the main work done 
under the name of the Critical Edition of the Mahiabharata. Our work has, 
moreover, given rise to many other sul>&idiary undertakings, which are being 
carried out by different scholars, in different places, to some extent independ- 
ently of our work here. 

Noteworthy among these works are the following four. Our edition has 
given to a student of the Dacca University a subject for a Ph.D. thesis en- 
titled '‘Studies in Epic Grammatical Forms,” which is an essay towards the 
compilation of epic grammar and which is based entirely on our edition of 
the Adiparvan. Our Mahabharata researches have further inspired another 
studmt of the epic to submit to the Bombay University a Ph.D. thesis oh 



A STATEMENT REGARDING PROGRESS 6F ORIT. ED. OF THE MBH. 43B 

the Bhrgvahgirasa element in the Mahabharata. There is a third Ph.D. 
dissertation for which a subject has been furnished by our edition. The 
subject is the phenomenon of case-variation in the epic dialect, which is being 
investigated by a student of Dr. S. M. Katre at the Deccan College Research 
Institute. A Spanish professor, Dr. Jose Canedo, I understand, has planned 
an elaborate grammatical work on Epic Syntax, which has made considerable 
advance and which would have been published by now but for this war, which, 
as you know, is paralyzing all literary and scholarly activity in Europe. 

I shall pass on to some minor studies which have arisen out of our Maha- 
bharata work. Arising out of his study of the Sabhaparvan, Professor Edger- 
TON has recently published three important papers. One of them is about 
the mention of the city of Rome in the Digvijaya section of the Sabhaparvan, 
which is the first time that a clear reference has been found in Indian litera- 
ture to the name of the capital of ancient Italy, Roma. Another paper by 
him deals with the question of “ Epic Tii^ubh and its Hypermetric Varieties.” 
A third paper by him' concerns the reading and interpretation of a Sabha- 
parvan! stanza, an old crux, which has become famous as the parable of the 
“ Goat and "the Knife ” (“ ajakrpamya ”) . 

In connection with his study of the BMsmaparvan, which is being edited 
by him, Eh. Belvalkar has published several valuable papers, among them 
the “Miscarriage of the attempted stratification of the Bhagavad^ta,*' the 
" Kashmiri Version of the Bhagavad^ta,” and the “ Cosmographical Episode 
in the Mahabharata and the Padmapuraina.” He has other papers in prepa- 
ration. 

You will thus see, gentlemen, that the time and the money spent during 
the last twenty years of silent and arduous work of the Mahabharata Depart- 
ment of the Institute have not been spent in vain. The Institute has not 
only brought out critical editions of three of the parvans of the Mahabharata, 
but it has built up an independent school of textual criticism and perfected 
the technique of the editing of Sanskrit texts. It has opened out new vistas 
of work with immense possibilities, which will occupy Indologists, I imagine, 
for at least half a century, if not more* It has stimulated vivid interest in 
Mahabharata studies, which were languishing for want of a critical edition 
of the text. They are carried out now on a sound basis and in a scientific 
spirit, differing conspicuously from the somewhat gassy ebullitions of previous 
writers on the subject of the Mahabharata. 

The Critical Edition of the Mahabharata is thus a comprehensive and 
many-sided literary activity, with ramifications in many directions. It is 
this aspect of our Mahabharata work, I imagine, which impressed the British 
Academy in London and which induced that august body to vote a grant to 
our Mahabharata Publication Fund in order to show its appreciation of the 



436 A STATt;MENT REGARDING PRCX5RESS OF CRIT. ED. OF THE MEH. 

work which is being done by the Institute and which is not merely of national 
but international interest and importance. 

It is gratifying to note that we have all along been staunchly supported 
in our enterprise financially by the Governments, the Princes and the People 
of India, — and at least by one University, the University of Bombay. During 
the last twenty years they have contributed in the aggregate some Rs. 3,50,000. 
That is a considerable sum, you will admit. But much more will be needed 
to complete the work. As we progress and inspire confidence among the 
people, who will begin to realize the great literary and scientific importance 
of this project, more help will, I am confident, be coming forth. Indeed there 
are indications that these are no false hopes. As the Secretary of the Insti- 
tute, Dr. Dandekar, has just told you, the Sir Dorabjee Tata Charities 
have only recently, despite the prevailing financial strigency, sanctioned a 
grant of Rs, 5,000 for the Mahabhfirata work, which has been a welcome addi- 
tion to our attenuated resources, and for which we* are extremely grateful 
to the Trustees of that Fund. Some of our annual subsidies, which had been 
granted for a fixed period of years, have expired. We have been endeavour- 
ing to get them renewed, and the response has been very encouraging, not- 
withstanding the chaos into which the? war has thrown our national economy. 
Of the patrons whom we have thus approached, the first one to respond was 
the Chief Saheb of Ichalkaranji, who, as the Secretary has just announced, 
has kindly promised to continue his patronage. This is a great encouragement 
to us and we are most grateful to the Chief Saheb, who is a staunch patron 
of learning and a great friend of all earnest students. On behalf of the 
Mahabharata Editorial Board I must also express our most grateful thanks 
to Shrimant Raja Saheb of Phaltan, who in response to our urgent appeal 
has, as announced by the Secretary, been pleased to continue his annual 
grant of Rs. 500 for the MahaWiiarata work for a further period of five years. 
If the work is not finished by then, we shall again have to approach the kind 
Raja Saheb, who, I am sure, will again be pleased to renew the grant. Small 
though these donations be which we have now secured, there is no need to 
lose courage. They are indicative of good-will and confidence, which are 
worth a great deal. When the war clouds have passed away, better days 
will surely dawn for us ; when the thoughts of men will again turn to the pre- 
sefrvation and growth of cultural values. We shall then have again, I am 
oanfident, the same share of bounty from our patrons of learning which we 
havei hitherto enjoyed and which will help us to cany to completion one of 
the most important of our national projects.

A STATEMENT REGARDING THE PROGRESS OF THE CRITICAL EDITION OF THE MAHABHARATA 

(Read by Dr. V. S. Sukthankar, on the occasion of the presentation of the 
Araijyakaparvan to Shrimant Rajasaheb of Aundh on 5th January 1943.) 

Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, 

It is now more than seventeen years since I took over charge of the 
Mahabharata work and reorgani 2 ed, on somewhat different lines, this De- 
partment of the Institute, having profited by the experiences and experi- 
ments of my predecessor, the late lamented Mr. Utgikar. During this 
interval the Institute has published Critical Editions of four complete Books 
of the Mahabharata ; Adipatvan (1933), Virataparvan (1936), the Udyo- 
gaparvan (1940), and now the Arapyakaparvan (1942). These four 
parvahs comprise, according to the Parvasaimgrahaparvan, about 28,400 
slokas. In addition to this a fasdcule of the Sabhgfrarvan edited by Prof. 
Franklin Edgerton of Yale University (U. S. A.), which has been ready 
for some time and which could be takeni up for printing only owing to the 
very generous special grant of Rs. 10,000 recently made by the Government 
of Bombay, is being published today. Furthermore, the press-ct^y of the 
Bhismaparvan, which is being edited by Rao Bahadur Dr. S. K. Belvalkar, 
is almost ready and is now undergoing final revision at the hands of its 
editor. It will be ready for being sent to the press very shortly. In fact 
the work is advanced as far that it can be got ready for the press within 
three months. But can we send it to the press? Not unless we can find 
a generous donor prepared to pay for the cost of the printing of the new 
volume, in these days when the cost of printing has almost doubled. The 
present financial situaticm of the Department is such that we can just rngnagf 
to get the press-copies ready ; but the large world of schdars outside the 
walls of this Institute, eagerly awaiting the appearance of our now-famous 
yellow-covered fascicules, must unfortunately be kept waiting until more 
funds are available. 

Any way, during the past 17 years the Institute has critically dealt with 
the first 6 parvans of the Great Epic : the Adi, Sabha, Araajyaka, Virata, 
Udyoga and Bhisma. The six parvans make up a total of about 36,800 
3okas, out of an aggregate of 82,150 Slokas, a portion which is approxi- 
mately 45% of the entire Mahabh&rata, excluding, of course, the Harivaihla, 
which I have kept out of my calculation in order not to frighten you too 
much. Even this is tio mean achievement, I think. The part of the epic 



438 A STATEMENT REGARPING PROGRESS OF CRIT. EI>. OP THE MBH. 

critically dealt with so far is, I imagine, in bulk about four times as great 
as the Greek epics, Iliad and Odyssey put together and one and a half times 
as our Rami^yaiua. 

That a work of this nature and these din^nsions is not one man's job 
is very very evident* Many friends, collaborators, sympathisers and patrons 
have contributed to such measure of success as has been achieved so far, 
and they include among them princes and potentates, curators and librarians, 
printers and parvan-editors, not to speak of the General Editor and his 
modest staff of collators in the background. Surely, the most potent among 
these multifarious contributory factors have been our generous patrons, who, 
out of regard for this venerable monument of Indian antiquity, this great 
and lustrous heritage of Bhiaratavar§a', have in the past liberally supplied 
the Institute, through all these! years, with funds to carry on this costly but 
vital work. 

Ladies and Gentlemen, I must tell you frankly this is a costly work. 
All good work costs money now-a-days I Good mahuscripts cost money. 
Good printing costs money. Good editors cost money. 

The British natic«i once paid out one million pounds for one rare Ms. 
of the Bible. Would India pay a similar amount for any book ? Why not ? 
Are the British people greater lovers of books, greater lovers of literature, 
greater lovers of religion, greater lovers of knowledge than we Indians ? Cer- 
tainly not. Great Britain is a small nation, a young naticMi, compared to India'. 
And our love of knowledge, love of literature, love of scriptures, is greater. 
We are the inheritors of the great book, this “book of books" composed 
at a time when Great Britain was not yet entered on the map of civilized 
nations. And the entire cost of making this Critical Edition of the Maha- 
bharata is only one million! rupees — and not pounds — ^which is only l/15th 
of the cost of the Bible. We haVe collected and spent already 5 lakhs of 
rupees. We want now only 5 lakhs more. And we are not pessimistic 
about it. We have no reason to be that. When the war clouds have passed 
away, better days will surely dawn for us ; then the thoughts of men will 
again turn to the preservation and growth of cultural values. We shall 
then, I am confident, enjoy the same generous support from patrons of 
learning as we have hitherto enjoyed and that will help us to carry to com- 
pletion one of the naost important of our national projects. 

If you' want me to point out to you just one: man who is responsible 
for origiiialting and furthering the project, he is sitting in front of you, I 
mean, Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, the Raja of Aundh. 

The question may occur to you. Is it worth all this expenditure? 
Whether wd realize it or not, we still stand under the spdl of the MahS- 
bh^rata. Amid the deepest strands that woven in tbd thread of oqr 



A Statement regarding progress of crit. Ed. of the Mbh, 43& 

civilization, there is more than wie that is dravm originally from Bharata- 
var§a and from Sanskrit literature. And well in the centre of this vast mass 
of literature, there stands this deathless, traditional book of divine inspiration, 
unapproachable and far removed from possibilities of human competition. 

There is a danger that in our pseudo-scientific mood, we may be 
tempted to discard this great book, thinking that we have outgrown it. That 
would be a capital blunder ! That would in fact mean nothing but an 
indication of our will to commit suicide, national suicide, the signal of our 
national extinction. For never was truer word spoken than when the late 
German Indologist Hermann Oldenberg said that “in the Mahabharata 
breathe the united soul of India, and the individual souls of her people.” 
And why is that ? Because the MaMbharata is the national saga of India. 
It is, in other words, the content of our collective unconscious. And just 
for that reasm it refuses to be discarded. We must therefore grasp this 
great book with both hands and face it squarely. Then we shall recognize 
that it is our past which has prolonged itself into the present. We ari it : 
I mean the real WE ! Shall we be guilty of strangling our own soul ? 
NEVER!
