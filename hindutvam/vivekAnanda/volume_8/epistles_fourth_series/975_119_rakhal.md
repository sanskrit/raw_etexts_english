## CXIX

(*Translated from [Bengali](b8392e8119.pdf)* )

*To Swami Brahmananda*

KHETRI,  
*14th December, 1897*.

MY DEAR RAKHAL,

I have today sent your power of attorney with my signature. . . . Draw
the money as early as you can, and wire to me as soon as you have done
so. A Raja of a place in Bundelkhand named Chatrapur has invited me. I
shall visit the place on my way to the Math. The Raja of Limbdi, too, is
writing earnestly. I cannot avoid going there also. I shall make a
lightning tour of Kathiawar — that is what it will come to. I shall feel
great relief as soon as I reach Calcutta. . . . There is no news from
Boston as yet; perhaps Sharat is coming; anyway, whenever any news comes
from anywhere, write to me immediately.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.

PS. How is Kanai? I hear that his health is not good. Pay special
attention to him and see that nobody is unduly bossed over. Write to me
about your health as well as Hari's.

V.
