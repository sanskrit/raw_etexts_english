## XXXI

*To Mrs. George W. Hale*

1125 ST. PAUL ST.,  
BALTIMORE,  
*October, 1894*.

DEAR MOTHER,

You see where I am now. Did you see a telegram from India in the
*Chicago Tribune*? Did they print the address from Calcutta? From here I
go to Washington, thence to Philadelphia and then to New York; send me
the address of Miss Mary in Philadelphia so that I may look in on my way
to New York. Hope your worry is over. 

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
