[The great kShemendra in his characterization of the qualities of a kavI
had mentioned how he should be a good
naturalist.](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/02/13/thinking-of-kshemendra/)
This is an old quality whose germs are seen in vAlmIki himself. Here is
a little word-painting by the great vAkpatirAja of the court of
yashovarman, the neo-maurya, in this tradition:

utplutya dUraM paridhUya pakShAv adho nirIkShya kShaNa-baddha-lakShyaH
|  
madhye-jalaM buDDati datta-jhampaH samatsyam utsarpati matsya-ra\~NkaH
||  
utplutya- springing; dUram- far up; paridhUya- shaking; pakShau- two
wings; adhaH- below; nirIkShya- examining; kShaNa-baddha-lakShyaH-
connecting to the target in an instance; madhye-jalaM-into the water;
buDDati – dives; datta-jhampaH – gives a jump; samatsyam- with a fish;
utsarpati – rises up; matsya-ra\~NkaH – kingfisher.

Springing far upwards, fluttering its two wings, examining below, and in
an instance connecting to its target, it dives with a jump into the
water, with a fish rises up the kingfisher.
