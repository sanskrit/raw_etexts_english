She said would only marry ranganAtha. In a dream the triple-strider
appeared to her father and asked him to send her decked in wedding
attire to his shrine. Even as she neared the shrirangaM her father was
filled with that inexplicable mixture of joy and sorrow, but she was
experiencing unrestrained excitement. As the party reached the temple
she jumped out of her palanquin and rushed to the garbhAgR^iha and
merged with the 4-handed one in a flash of light.

He appeared in the form of a brahmin and asked the saint iyarpakai
nAyanAr (saint Hostile-Nature) to give his bride to him for conjugal
pleasure. He seeing The god (rudra) within the brahmin and filled with
peity offered up his bride to him. As he did so his relatives furious
over his deed attacked the brahmin to disrupt the act. But he drew a
sword and cut up his own relatives and allowed the brahmin proceed
un-interrupted. Please with his devotion the 3-eyed one gave saint
Hostile-Nature a vision of his physical form and then restored his wife
and dead relatives.

These acts are still remembered by many Hindus with their hair standing
on its ends, tears of devotion streaming from their eyes and an inner
excitement filling their body.

Much before this the hoary seer of vishvAmitras had chanted:  
“Come here \[o indra\], you who are always going around, from here or
from the heavenly realm of light. These chants propitiate you around.”

Or my ancient ancestor, the bhArgava, recited:  
“indra enjoy- drive on, come, hero- with your two golden steeds, drink
the soma, like a seer, loving the sweet brew, pleased with its
exhilaration.”

At the face of it some may see the same force that drove the later day
saints in these vipras of yore. But a careful look at the sacrificial
ritual shows that the Hindus come in at least two fundamentally distinct
categories. The nature of this distinction is suggested by the tradition
of mImAmasa in sutra 9.1.9:  
**” api vA shabda-pUrvatvAdyaGYana-karma pradhAnaM syAd-guNatve
devatA-shrutiH “**

The great ritualist-scholar shabara svamin explains this sUtra:  
“The deity and the offering are both accomplished entities, while the
act of ritual is what is to be accomplished. The deity, therefore,
cannot be the prompter…The view of the opponet makes it necessary to
admit of deities having material bodies and actually eating and drinking
the substances offered; and this idea is utterly repugnant to the
shrutI, which does not lend support to any such idea regarding deities.

The text quoted by the opponent regarding the right hand of the great
god indra(“we have taken hold of what is indra’s right hand”) does not
mean that indra possesses a right hand. Moreover, even if he did, it
would be impossible for any human to ‘take hold’ of it… The texts that
speak of the “arms” of indra being hairy or his “eyes” as tawny-all the
are purely eulogistic. Nor is there actual feedng or eating at rituals;
in fact, the deity never eats …”  
\[this is based on the Sanskrit text, translation and summary of shabara
svamin’s mImAmsa bhAShya by Ganganatha Jha\]

Furthermore, the mImAmsakas, who are in continuity with the tradition of
the brAhmaNa texts clarify that the mantras and gAnaMs recited in the
vedic ritual are themselves the embodiment of the deity. This remarkable
concept, not easily grasped by outsiders to the mantra tradition, is
actually also at the heart of the tantric rites. These despite their
superficial differences from the vedic rite are based on the same
principle of the mantra embodying the deity. Thus, rites stress what
Frits Staal termed, orthopraxy- practice approximating an ideal process
with increasing accuracy as against orthodoxy- opinion approximating an
ideal ideology.

The vedic and tantric rite stress the deity lying embedded in the mantra
and this manifests in the form of structures that the mantras possess.
Thus the vedic seer composing his hymn or a sAman song and the tantric
revealing a mantra with its bIjas was not like the later day saint
merely composing a devotional outpouring. The deity was manifesting in
the chant with a deep link to is structure: a striking example of this
the organization of the sAmidhenI chant with its structure bearing an
equivalence to the year with the 365+x elements. At the junction of the
veda and the tantra the hymn being an embodiment of the deity spawn new
deities by virtue of its structure:  
oM hoM / ishAna sarvavidyAnAm \[shashinyai\] /urdhvamUrdhni /oM hoM
/ishvaraH sarvabhUtAnAM \[a\~ngadAyai\] pUrvamUrdhni / oM hoM /
brahmAdhipatir brahmaNo.adhipatir brahmA \[ishTAyai\] /
dakShiNamUrdhni/oM hoM /shivo me astu \[marIchyai\] uttaramUrdhni /om
hoM / sadAshivoM / \[jvAlinyai namaH\] / paschimamUrdhni /  
\[from the shiva nyAsa compiled by rAja bhoja\]  
In this way from the expanded expression of great rudra embodied in the
chant from the taittiriya brAhmaNa emerged the five goddess of the head:
shashinI, a\~ngadA, iShTA, marIchI and jvAlinI.

Thus the hindus are of two types :1) those who follow the path of
ritual, for whom the deity manifests in the mantra. 2) those who follow
the path of devotion, the deity is anthropomorphic and really “something
else” from what the ritualist perceives. The fundamental division is not
between the tantra and veda. I term the former the path of the brAhmaNa.
The latter is the path of the shUdra. But the interesting part is that
both have co-existed since the earliest reconstructions of the
Indo-European society.
