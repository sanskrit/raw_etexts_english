DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE MANUSCRIPTS
Sx

(The Saradia Codex.)

Poona, Bombay Government Collection (deposited at the BORI), No. 159 of
1875-76. Total number of folios, for this parvan, 192 (some frayed and patched
at ends) , with about 24 lines to a page. Size 12" X 19". CleaT Sarada diaracters.
Birchbark (bhurjapatra).

The codfex, which is unfortunately incomplete and fragmentary, must
have originally contained at least the first three parvans (Adi, Sabha, and
Araaiya or Araioyaka), writteh, as far as one can judge, by the same hand.
The extant portion contains the Sabha in its entirety, but only fragments of
the other two parvans, the beginning of Adi and thei end of Arapyaka being
lost. The text of Araipyaka begins on fol. 211a, line 1 ; and ends, or rather
breaks off, at the end, of a folio marked 194b (sic). The numbering of the
pages is most erratic. There are in all 192 folios pertaining to this parvan. The
fragment breaks off in the middle of our 3. 253. 18*^, ending with the words :

The margins are mostly clean, andi corrections are few and
far between. Erasures have been made in a few places with green pigment.
{3} In good many places (e.g., folios numbered 156a, 185b, 186a, 193b,
194a, dtc.), the scribe has written dots to denote portions of the text which
were either lost or illegible to him : sign of a conscientious copyist. On
fol. 220a, some stanzas which had been omitted (? hapl.) in the text have
been written on the margin (s'esc. w.), in a diffetent and inferior ink. The top



INTRODUCTION


143


parts of the four folios numbered 89-92 are broken off and lost, involving a
loss of from 5 to 8 top lines on' each page. The names of sub-parvans have
been sporadically mentioned. The manuscript has been fully described at
p. X of the Prolegamma to Adiparvan (q. v.)

Poona, Bombay Government Collection ( deposited at the BORI), Visrambiag
I, No. 474 , Folios 486 (numbered 55-540; first 54 folios missing), with about 10
lines to a page. Size 12i" X 5i". Devaniagari characters. Thin glazed superior
Indian paper.

First 54 folios are lost ; fol. 55 begins with 3. 32. 4®. Number 237 is
given to two consecutive folios, but the second folio thus marked is sub-
sequently corrected (5€c. m.) to 238. The missing portion of the text at the
end of the first of the two folios marked as 237 is written out in small letters
(? sec, m.) at the bottom of the page. Fol. 485 is written only on one side ;
and at the end of this folio is the remark 3T& i) ^ \\, the

contents of this folio (485) have been copied out again sec, m. (on a separate
sheet of modem paper with watermarks), including the final remark
...II -if II, with the addition, I II % II

which shows that the copyist of this sheet was some Gujarati scribe. The
handwriting of the original, which is Kashmirian in style is not quite uniform :
some folios show very thick, black, broad upright characters, while others are
appreciably thinner and somewhat slanting. Frequently in the colophons, and
the references to speakers, only alternate letters are written, blanks being left
to be filled with red ink, which,, however, has not been done. Mere folds,
without vertical lines, mark the right and left margins of folios. The ink used
is jet black and of a superior quality. The sub-parva0 names are generally
mentioned.


K,

Poona, BORI, Mbh. Collection No. 15 (—Institute’s Collection, No. 246).
Folioal 3(X), with about 14 lines to a page. Size 13i" X 6|/'. Devanagari characters.
Dated V. Saiiivat 1828 and Saka 1693 (ca, a.d. 1772). Grey Indian paper.

This manuscript is described' as Di at p. vii of the Introduction to the
Udyogapyarvan, for which parvan it was first used. The name of the scribe,
which comes after the date (year) at the end of this parvan, appears as :
3^*1 feqPRt fersft I the day and month come last : ^

Udyogaparvan, the scribe's name is given as Ka§-
miriya Sadananda. Very incorrect, containing numerous little errors of spell-
ing, such as writing ^ for Adhyaya colophons and margins are< marked
with red pigment, corrections with yellow pigment. Marginal (vertical) lines
o( tpages are in black and red, separated by a thick yellow line. The manu-
script is almost without any marks of punctuation. The dmidas were probably
to be marked with red ink, but the £4} revision was never actually carried

cript of the' Mahabhiarata written by one hand, and as such important.

Poona, Bombay Government Collection (deposited at the BORI), No. 184 of
1891-95. Folios 285, with about 17 lines to! a page. Size 10^" X Sj". Devanagari
characters. Indian paper.

Total number of folios is 294, of which fol. 270, 272-279 are missing. Fol.
152a has only six lines of writing, the greater part of the folio being left
blank, and the writing continued on the reverse, without any loss of text. In
the references to speaker the word (resp. ) is generally omitted ;
the name of the' speaker to be generally given in some abbreviated form like
manuscript seems to be fairly old. The edges, especially
of the last folios, are brittle and worn. Characters are short and broad, re-
presenting an old style of writing in. Writing is incorrect on the whole.
There are occasional corrections in margin {sec. m.). Adhyaya colophons
and nam^ of speakers are generally coloured with red pigment. The manus-
cript mentions sub-parvans as a rule. It doe's not distinguish between ^ and
^ . both are again often confused with

,1882-83. Folios 370 (numbered 52-421), with about 10 lines to a page. Size
12 J X Devanagari characters. Old Indian paper.

First 51 folios are lost ; fol. 52 begins with 3. 36. 1«. The hand-writing
of the manuscript, though it seems to be of one scribe, is not uniform. For
some portion we have large round letters with flourishes, while for others
the characters are thin and upright. Pi^thamatras are almost invariably
used. Marginal notes, especially variants, are written {sec. m.) with the
clear remark that it is a patha ; there are explanatory notes also, written on
the margins. Colophons, references to speakers, and sloka endings (the
latter sporadically) are marked with red pigment. — ^The manuscript breaks
off at the last folio (421), where it ends with the colophon of the last adhyaya
of this! parvan. There is no phalasniti, nor the list of contents, which we
often find at the end of Mahabharata manuscripts.

Dacca, University Libraiy, No. 495. Folios 1-323, and 325. Bengali characters.
Dated ^aka 1393 (ca. a.d. 1471). Paper. Slightly damaged.

164, and anothe!r between fol. 247 and 24S.-~Collat€\di at the Visvabharati

a broad, short, round, broken styld up to folio 265 ; from the next fol. (266),
the style of writing again becomes long, slanting and thin ; and towards the
end the lettering becomes a little thick and bold. Right and left margins are
marked by double lines in red, and stops in the text and the commentary, are
also marked by double dain<Jas in red. The lower borders of folios of this

gari characters. Thick Indian paper.

Text with the commentary of Nilakaintha, called the Bharatabhdvadlpa,
The manuscript is written in a uniformly neat upright handwriting. Right and
left margins are marked by two double lines in red. Double daindas in red
are used on some folios to mark the stops in the text as well as in the com-
mentary. Adhyaya colophons in both the text and the commentary are also
in red ink. On some pages, continuations are written on the right side along
the marginal red lines.

Text with the commentary of Nflakantha, called the Bhdratabhdvadlpa.
The’* manuscript has its right and left margins marked with close double lines
in red as usual. The first three folios and the last folio have an illuminated
border with floral designs. The writing, though incorrect, is bold and upright.
Numerous corrections are made in the text by using yellow pigment. Fol. 401-
439 are written with ink of a faint black colour. Subsequent portion is written
in a shaky style, with short and round letters. There are also marginal cor-
rections, entered sec. m., throughout the manuscript. Adhyaya colophons are
marked with red pigment. The last colophon in the commentary is left in-
complete, and the last but one fol. (625) breaks off with : The

first sloka of the Virata too, is left incomplete, while the* last folio is num-
bered 626 in one (right bottom) corner and 627 in the other (left top) cor-
ner. The usual table of contents is also wanting. All this suggests that the
actual fol. 626 is lost.

A few folios of this manuscript are missing. This manuscript was writ-
ten by the same scribe who wrote manuscript No. 266 of Vi^ramhag II,
which is described as Dj 4 at pp. xx of the Prolegamma to the Adiparvan» Most
folios of this manuscript have a soiled appearance, while the last (225) reveals
at its top left comer signs of burning by £7} fire ; some folios are partly
damaged. The mahuscript is carefully written in a perfectly uniform style
and the characters are short and round. The name is written at

the lower right margin above the Mio number. The corrections in the text
are made by deleting the original incorrect reading with yellow pigmoit and

At fol. 75, the Sabhaparvan ends and the Araioyakaparvan begins thereafter
immediately. After the end of the Araioyaka, about five ^lokas from the
Virata are written on the last folio (351), which indicates that thd manus-
ript originally contained some more parvans .— at Tanjore.

considerably worn and uneven ; the central holes are enlarged, apparently
from constant use ; one corner of the last folio (numbered 258) is broken off
and part of text is lost. The margins are clean ; codrections, which are
interlinear, are few and far between.

MANUSCRIPTS NOT INCLUDED IN THE CRITICAL APPARATUS

Besides the twenty-eight manuscripts detailed above, the following two
manuscripts were also e'xamined by me, which deserve notice.

1. Calcutta, Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal Collection, No. 33,12 ( 4066).
   Folios 166; size 13" X 10". Sarada characters. Dated Saka 1630 (ca. a.d. 1706).
   Kasnuri paper.

2. Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society's Collection, No. 966 ( =
   B.D. 245). Folios 235, with about 15 lines to a page ; size 14^" X 6^". Old Deva-
   nagari characters. Dated! Sarhvat 1573 (ca. a.d. 1516). Indian paper. Illustrated,

The dated Sarada manuscript belcmging to the Royal Asiatic Society of
Bengal is a very fragmentary and fragile manuscript, in an extremely delapi-
dated' condition. The custodians of the manuscript would not part with it
for collation at the Institute, but allowed it to be collated and photographed
on the premises of the Society. The difficulty in the way of collating — as of
photographing — it, was that many of the folios were stuck together and could
be separated only at the risk of damaging the writing. A partial study of the
manuscript showed that the basic text is probably Kasmiri, but it is contami-
nated deeply from the Mid-Indian versions (Bengali-Devanagari). The ma-
nuscript is briefly described in Haraprasada Shastri's Descriptive Catalogue,
Vol. 5, at p. 166. A facsimile of a page from this manuscript, containing
the text from 3. 242. 20^ to 243. 15% is given at the' end of Volume 4 of this
edition. Note the bits of commentary wrongly incorporated, in lines

9-10, and in lines 12-13.

The other manuscript, which belongs to the Bombay Branch of the Royal
Asiatic Society, is, on the other hand, an extremely valuable old manuscript,
dated in V. Samvat 1573 (= a.d. 1516). It would! have been fully collated
and used for our edition, but for the circumstance that it is also very frag-
mentary, nearly one-third of the number of folios being, unfortunately, irre-
coverably lost. The original manuscript was written at Yoginipura (modem
Delhi) during the reign of “Sulitrap Sikandara”, who. appears to be the
famous Sikandar Shah Lodi, Sultan of Delhi, for Bhanudiasa Chaudharl — z
resident of Kacchauva (a “ water- fortress ”, jalddmga),^ The manuscript was

give. I have cited its evidence occasionally, in the Critical Notes ’’ at the

town in Udaipur State. The Imperkd Gazetteer (1866) states that in former times
the town, which stood on the western bank of a large lake, must have been a place
of some irnportance ; for all around, the giouhd is strewn with fragments of extremely
fine sculpture, and half way up the hill the ruins of a temple are visible.

TESTIMONIA

The ’testimonia of the Aranyaka consist of ancient commentaries and
epitomes, of which there are not very many in the case of this parvan.

Devabodha’s commentary on the Arainyaka has unfortunately been lost,
or at least has not been retovered so far. The same is true of the Javanese
version. This parvan thus unfortuniately lacks two of the oldest — and the
TWst important — of the testimonia of the Mahabharata, — ^works which have
rendered yeoman service in some of the parvans already edited.

As regards other works of that nature, there is, as far as I know, extant
at least one complete manuscript of the commentary of Arjunamisra on the
Aranyaka. It belongs to the Government Sanskrit College Collection in Cal-
cutta^ (No. 310); cf. Catalogue, Vol. 4, p. 190. There are also incomplete
copies of the commentary in the Sanskrit College at Benares (MSS. No. 2279 ;
and q I 65 34). .1 had the use of a rough copy of the Calcutta Sanskrit
College manuscript mentioned above, which was kindly supplied to me’, at my
request, by the Principal of the College. The copy was however found to be
full of clerical errors and was not exactly suitable for collation. It was there-
fore used by me merely for occasional consultation. The text used by Arjuna-
mi^ra is, as usual, of a superior type, jand his commetitary would repay care-
ful study, if good manuscripts of the commentary could be obtained. A fac-
simile of the single e^xtant page of a paper manuscript of what proved to be
Arjunami^ra's commentary on the Arainyakaparvan, written in i^rada cha-
racters and included by chance in the iSaradia manuscript of this parvan be-
longing to the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, forms the frontispiece of the
second part of the Arainyakaparvan (Vol. 4 ). The passage commented on is
3. 133. 20 to 134. 9. Note the consecutive numbering of the lines in the left
        margin.

Fr<Mn this list of contents, it can be seen that almost all the stories and
episodes which we now find in our text of the Araijyaka were there already in
K§emendra’s time (ca. 1050 A.D.). The parvan must therefore have had then
the same gaieral form and appearance as now. More significant is the fact
that all important passages — ^without exception — ^that are lacking in our manus-
cripts of the Ka&niri version are likewise missing in the Manjan. This fact
alone cannot prove that these passages were laddng in the Kaimlri versicm of
the devmth century. Some or even all of them could have been omitted by
a poet who was making an epitome of an extensive work like the Araijyaka-
parvan : he would be within his rights in doing so. But the Mmj^l does not
omit any important episode or passage which is not omitted at the same time
in the KaSmari version of the Great Epic. Consequently, unless the version of
the Araijyakapafvan used by Ksemendra was nearly indentical with our
KaSmlii version, the coincidence that our Kairrflri manuscripts omit just
those passages which K§emendra had considered not worth including in his
epitome, and no other, would be extremdy curious, if not miraculous. It
seems accordingly most probable that the episodes which are not found in
Ksemendra’s Manjati were already lacking in the Ka^mlif version of the Mahfi-
tharata in the eleventh century,. I think, therefore, that with the help of this
testimonium, we can establish for the omissions of the KaSndtf version an anti-
quity much higher than that vouchsafed solely by the age of our manuscripts,
which are later by scane centuries than the period of the conmosition of Kj§e-
mendra’s Bhdratamah/arf.

Noteworthy among such omissions of the Mahjmi are the followii^ three

lengthy passages : (1) the Temptation of Arjuna by Urvasi (App. I, No. 6) ;
(2) Kanpa's Conquest of the World (App. I, No. 24); (3) the Visit of Dur-
vasas to Yudhi^thira (App. I, No. 25). The first of these three interpola-
tions has insinuated itself in the manuscripts of almost all versions and is now
lacking only in some manuscripts of the Kasmiri version.^ The second among
them is documented only by Devanagail manuscripts, excepting a few con-
flated manuscripts of other versions ; consequently its claim' to be recognized
as an authentic passage is not very substantial. Finally, the last i>assage in-
troducing Ehirviasas into the story, a passage which is really restricted to the
Nilakantha version, with the casual support of a few DevanlagaTl and some
conflated manuscripts, does not really come into question ; because its spurious
character is very £133 ^ideht and does not need an elobate proof. ^

The versions of the commentators Caturbhuja and Nilakaintha are des-
cribed below under the Devanagari version.

in which Sri Kr^a is irepresented as hearing from a ^stance, as it were by clair-
audience or divine omniscience, the prayers of his distressed devotees and as either
coming instantly to their help in person or providing invisibly the means of their
rescue or safety. The other episode I had in mind, which has likewise proved to
be an interpolation, is the well-known scene, in the Sabhiparvan of the disrobing
of Draupadi (Draupa<£-vasitra-haraina), when, according to the Vulgate version,
Draupaefi prays to Sri whq hears her prayer and comes running to her rescue.

( tqfcsrr ^«rf mw- l B. 2. es, 45), and she is clothed again and

again, miraculously, but presumably by the intervention and grace of Sri Kp^a.
They undoubtedly represent a later phase of K|Wa wor^ip.



154 ARAI^YAKAPARVAN

A CRITICAL SURVEY OF THE RECENSIONS AND THEIR

VERSIONS

general survey

A description of the forest life of the Pajoidavas constitutes the topic of the
Third Book, the Araijyaka — (Araipya — or Arajoya — ). parvan, conmionly
called (for short) the Vanaparvan, whose extent is between 11,000 and 12,000
slokas (i.e. “ granthas ”) . The actual incidents narrate, pertaining to the life-
history of the heroes in this parvan, are indeed few and unimportant compar-
ed to the size of the book. The entire narrative has been condensed by
K§emendra in his into less than 2,000 stanzas, without omitting

any of the main incidents. The great extent of the parvan has been made
up by the inclusion of episodes of the most diverse kind : stories of ancient
kings, sages, and virtuous women ; description of places of pilgrimage {ttrtha-
yatrd); discourses {14} on moral, ethical and philosophical topics, ancient
gathas and anuvarhsa stanzas. It was a fashion for some time to obelize this
episodic matter as late interpolation. But that is a misguided view, originating
with a certain type of critics who haVe exhibited a uniform lack of under- ^
standing of the meaning of the Mahabharata and of the basic plan and aim
of the creators of our great epic. The episodical material in the Mahabha-
rata is, in general, not secondarily introduced ; it belongs to the original
plan and serves a distinct purpose. As Pisani has pointed cut in his paper
on the Rise of the Mahabharata the bulk of didactic and episodic matter
has been used to fill up the great temporal hiatuses in the narrative, viz,
in the first place, the twelve years of exile in forest (Araipyaka), and then the
long interval between the end of the Bharata War a!nd the last adventure of
the P^^avas (Santi and Anu^sana). ** This distribution remarks Pisani,
“to fill up! temporal hiatuses has not only the scope of not disturbing the
course of narration, but also that of helping the raider to pass over irrele-
vant years^ without striking against too strong a contrast betweoi periods mil-
nutely narrated and others rapidly surpassed . In a not different manner Ho-
mer introduces often dialogues and episodic stories when he must conceal the
flowing of times without noteworthy events.”^

The episodic material is largely Puraipic in character. Many of the Pu-
rmic stories we find here narrated over again. Moreover, as the references
given in the foot-notes to the text and the critical notes at the end of this
Book (pp. 1091-1109) will show, there is considerable verbal agreement bet-
ween the epic and Pura)i>ic versions of the stories. The Pur^as which show
the closest contact and widest parallelism are the Skanda;, 'Padma and Brali-
ma. The aitire story of Skanda (adhy. 213-221), togdber with the passage
containing the 108 names of the Sun (our adhy. 3, stanzas 18-28), recurs

almost verbatim in the ^anda Punaji^. The story of the Bhiargava sage
Cyavana and the princess Sukahya, the prose story of the Frog-girl, and a
considerable portion of the Ramopiakhyana are also to be met with in the
Skanda, worded almost identically with the M^abharata, The 108 names
of the Sun, recur beteides in the Brahma Puiiapa, which, moreover, has a por-
tion of the story of Markaindeya in common with the Araipyakaparvan. Fur-
thermore, sections of our tirthayatra are to be met with again in the Padma
and Matsya. A Bengali manuscript^ of the Padma Pur^a contains besides a
version of the IJsya§rnga legend. In all these cases, the parallelism of ver-
bal expression of the epic and the Purmjic narratives is so complete and drik-
ing, that the possibility of their having originated independently of each other
is at once ruled out. Many stray stanzas from our parvan are found in the
Kurma, Varaha, Vayu, Vi§|nu„ Vi§iiiudharmottara, and in the Harivam&i.

Our recensions of the Puranas are admittedly of a very late date', and it
is not to be expected that the Mahabharata would have borrowed any of its
material from our Puranas. The claim that the the Mahabharata owed certain
geographical and cosmographical sections of the Bhi$maparvan to the Padma
Parana, preferred by Luise Hilgenberg,^ £15} has been answered and liqui-
dated by Rao Bahadur Professor Dr. S. K. Belvalkar, who has shown that
in reality the converse of this proposition is true.^ This scholar has now
shown from internal evidence that the Padma Pur^a must have written up
its geographical section from the information supplied by the Mahabharata.
Similarly, the question of relationship between our Pulastya Tirthayatra and a
very similar episode in the Padma Puraipa has been discussed by my assistant,
Mr. M. V. Vaidya, m.a., who has likewise shown from intrinsic evidence that
the Mahabharata passage is the source of the Padma Puranja version.^

It must, however, be admitted that although in most cases the compilers
of our Pur^as appear to have drawn their material from the Mahabharata,
there may be — indeed there must b&— a few cases in which both the Maha-
bharata and the Punkas may have drawn independently upon a third com-
mon source. We can also say this with regard to episodes like the Savitn
episode, which likewise occurs in the Matsya Pur^a, where it is narrated in
an entirely different manner from that in the epic, and where all traces of

mutual relationship are absent or obliterated, except for two or three common
stanzas and stray piadas.

The reference in our parvan to Vayu, (3, 189. 14), is

worth considering in this connection. Nothing corresponding to the general
contents of the passage where it occurs is to be found in the extant Vayu
Purijja, as is remarked by Hopkins,^ or for the matter of that in any other
Purana proclaimed by Vayu. There are, however, a few stanzas in the Vayu
describing the dissolution of the world where verbal similarity with some
stanzas of this passage is pronounced, even though they are introduced in the
Vayu in a different context. The Mahabhlarata, as mentioned in it (3. 189.
14), draws upon a Puiwa of Vayu — ^and indeed, the topic narrated belongs
properly to a Puraria in its right, a Puraija which is older than the extant
Pumaias and which must be presumed to be now irretrievably lost. The evi-
dence for establishing a relation^ip between the extant Vayu and its old
namesake to which the epic is indebted is lacking, barring these few stray
stanzas.

Our parvan also contains an epitome of the legend of Rama, son of Da^-
ratha, the hero of the Ramiayaioa, which is known as Ramopakhyana (adhy.
258-275) ; but in the Parvassamgraha this passage is called
(1. 2. 126). Does this name imply any connection with' our “ Ramayairia ” ?
Jacobi has tried to show that the Ramop^hyana is indeed an epitome of
the work commonly known as Valmlki's Ramayama, a conclusion which has
been confirmed by subsequent researchers.®

This book, as already observed, is particularly rich in legends of ahcient
India. Among them are three worthy of special mention, viz., the Tale of
Nala, the IJsyai§phga L^end and the Story of Savirtri which have been critical-
ly edited here for the first time. The first of these, the Tale of Nala, has by
way of translations into English, £16} French, Gemum, Dutch, Italian and
other European languages, passed into the great stream of world literature.
The second, the IJ^yaSinga Legend, though not so well known, has yet a long
and interesting history and shows many modulations and ramifications, as has
been convincingly shown by Professor Heinrich Luders in his well-known
monograph on the subject, “ Die Sage von Ifeyagpiga."' ® The story of
Siavitri portraying woman in the role of the saviour of man, which r^resents
the high-water mark of epic poetry, is in a class by itself, and deserves to be
more widely known. It is to be hoped that this first critical edition of the
three of the most famous episodes of the Mahabhlarata will evoke the interest
of Indologists and encourage further study of them.

INTRODUCTION


157


THE TWO RECENSIONS

The text of the Arainyakaparvan is, relatively speaking, remarkably
smooth, offering no special difficulties for textual reconstruction. There are
of course, as usual, discrepancies between the Northern and the Southern
recensions, and between the various versions comprising these two main recen-
sions. But it is noteworthy that in the whole of this big parvan, comprising
between 11,000 and 12,000 “slokas*’, there are not many transpositions of
any consequence and there are also remarkably few “ substitute passages
By the latter I mean parallel versions of fairly long passages in two or more
conflicting recensions which agree in general sense but are worded differently
in different groups of manuscripts, so that they cannot be co-ordinated line by
line, — passages which we find in large numbers in some of the other parvans,
notably in the Virataparvan. These substitute passage's are very clear evidences
of textual corruption — or, shall we say, derangement ? — and indeed very em-
barrassing to the textual critic. As for the transpositions, there is only one that
is worth noting here, and that is of the last adhyaya of this parvan. The
whole of this ^adhyaya is bodily transferred in the Southern recension to the
next parvan and appears there incorporated in the first adhyaya of that par-
van ! It is not possible to say with certainty whether this chapter, which in
all probability is itself an interpolation, belongs legitimately to our parvan
or to the next ; but it appears to be distinctly more appropriate* in its North-
ern setting, as its intrusion in the Virataparvan seems to lead to some obvious
repetitions as well as disturbance of context.^

There are naturally quite a number of large and small insertions in the
various versions. But in this matter also the present parvani prepares a sur-
prise for us. From the experience* gained from our critical editions of the Adi,
Sabha, and Virata parvans especially, we are inclined to regard the Southern
recension as a highly inflated version of the text. Now, in this parvan — strange
to say — the Vulgate version, which is based on the late Northern tradition, is
actually considerably longer than the Southern, as may be seen from the
extent of this parvan according to the existing printed editions of the Vul-
gate and the Southern recension : the Calcutta edition has 12,848 slokas
(corrected figure) as against 11,138 slokas in Sastri's Southern Recension.

£17} The large excess in the Calcutta-Bombay editions compared with
Sastri's is explained by the fact that the Vulgate text contains about a dozen
adhyayas which are lacking entirely in the Southern recension ; whereas the
Southern recension contains only two passages of any considerable length
(App. I, Nos. 4' and 23 )j which are not found in representative manuscripts
of the Northern recension, they being peculiar to the Southern, — ^with the
result that the Calcutta edition has 1710 Slokas in excess of Sastri's edition

of the Aranyaka-parvan. Thus we see that though, as a whole, the Southern
recension is unquestionably inflated, yet the process of inflation, as is evident
from this parvan, is not uniform throughout the epic, — which is a very imr
portant and significant fact.

Though the best version of the Northern recension — namely, the §arada-K
version — and the Southern recension agree remarkably well as regards the
general extent of the parvan, there are nevertheless numerous specific indivi-
dual readings, characterizing the two recensions — Northern and Southern —
and distinguishing them sharply] from each other. Here is a selection of
readings peculiar to the two main recensions, the references being to adhyayas
and slokas.

It may be observed that all these additions in the Southern recension
(with the exception of only one or two), numerous as they are, are uniformly
short, eadi usually consisting of not more than a couple of lines.

As remarked already, the text of this parvan is remarkably smooth, not
presenting any unusual difficulties in the way of restitution. When the
Sarada-K version (which is the best Northern version) and the Southern
recension are placed vis-o-vis, we can in general reconstruct the original with
confidence, barring a certain number of minor verbal fluctuations in the shape
of synonymous phrasings, which remain indeterminate without affecting the
construction or obscuring the sense. The concord between the :§arada-K ver-
sion and th -3 Southern recension in point of general content is striking, and
forms a sure basis for constituting a single text. Contamination between the
Kasnun version and the Southern recension cannot be proved, but contami-
nation between the Bengali-Devanagarl version and the Southern recension is
not impossible. The agreements between the Bengali-Devanagari and the
Southern recension have nevertheless been as a rule utilized to arrive at a
tentative stop-gap, based on the indications of documental evidence. But it
should be noted that the Kasmiri-Southem agreements have for greater docu-
mental authority ahd probative value than the Bengali-cum-Devanagari and
Southern agreements.

Let me put the matter in a slightly different way. The highest docu-
mental probability we can demand and expect is when all manuscripts of our cri-
tical appaiatu&--which is the same as saying, all our different versions— agree
on a reading or a feature. We must accept this as the original ; at least we
do not want to question it, at present. In the absence of such complete con-,-
cord, the next best combination is the agreement between the Sarada version
and the Southern recension (against Bengali-DevanagarJ). Third in import-
ance is, in my opinion, the concord between the Southern recension and the
Bengali-cum-Devanagari version (against the iSarada). Fourth in order
stands the agreement between only Northern versions or only Southern ver-
sions inter se, which I consider, in general, as of equal value. With the pro-
viso that a passage or a stanza or even a line, which is not necessary to the
context, may be rejected, if it is actually omitted entirely in even one of the
important versions, since — as experience has shown — ^the chances of confla-
tion are always very much greater than those of accidental or intenticmal
omission.

The §a^<idd K^ssnUri) Version,

We are fortunate in possessing for this parvan also, a genuine Ka^tniri
manuscript written, in old iSaradia characters, on folios prepared from the
Himalayan birch-bark {bhurjopatra) , The manuscript is no other than the
now world-famous “Sarada Codex”, the unique birch-bark manuscript of
the Mahabharata belonging toi the Bombay Government Collection, now
deposited at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, with identification
No. 159 of 1875-76, which is the only extant genuine representative* of the
old {19} version of Ka^ir.^ Our manuscript is, irt other words, the conti-
nuation of the iSarada manuscript used for the Adi and Sabha. The manus-
cript is fragmentaiy, breaking off in the middle of 3. 253. 18*^, thus lacking
unfortunately the last 46 adhyaya^ of our text. For this lacuna we have to
depend upon the “ K ” version, some manuscripts of which have proved to be
moderately good copies of the iSarada version, especially Kg, which is des-
cribed below.

It is now recognized by the competent authorities on the subject that the
Sarada version is, in many respects, the most faithful representative of the
original now extant ; and the text of the Araoyakaparvan as preserved in our
Sarada Codex only confirms this view.

The tSarada text of the Araaiyaka is of a piece with the texts of the Adi
and the Sabha. The sitanzas comprising the text have not been actually
counted — it would not be easy to cdmpute its exact extent, as the text com-
prises slokas, tri^tubhs and two lengthy prose passages — but it is, in all prob-
ability, the shortest version of the parvan now extant, since it omits many
passages which are found in other versions and manuscripts, while it does not
contain new additions of any consequence. The text includes many archaic
survivals in point of linguistic usage and shows what may fairly be regarded
as “difficult readings” (lect, diff,), in comparison with those of other
manuscripts.

The most striking omission of the Ka^miii version is the story of UrvaSJ
(adhy. 45-46 of the Vulgate =pa‘ssage No. 6 of our App. I), which idates
how Arjuna is tempted by Urva-SI during his isojoum in Indra’s heaven, and


i The KaMii character of the text of our Sarada manuscript, which is sug-
gested by the script (^rada) and the writing material (bhurjapatra), is confirmed
not only by the reading in the third pada of the introductory mantra

; but also by the regular onussion of the word in such reference as
further by such Ka^miri spellings of names like^^^OT (for^gj^)
in 3. 17. 22. corresponding to ^for in the Viitfa ; RAGHU Vira,

Introdurtion to the Virataparvan, p. xi. The Bharutcmmjmi h^ in 3. 159

and in 4. 36, etc. That is ai real KaSmiri trait.

how he refuses her advances on the ground that she is ah ancestress of his.
Although this piquant story has permeated all Versions of the epic except the
Ka4nflri (Sj and some K), there is no reason to doubt that it is a late addi-
tion. The highly erotic description of the voluptuous hetare of the gods, Urvali,
with its pronounced sex appeal, is in my opinicm totally incompatible with
the epic setting, which lacks all “ feminine ” interest and esdiews all erotic
topics as such. The stanzas I refer to are (App. I. No. 6. lines 50-57— Bom-
bay ed. 3. 46.8-11 = Calcutta! dd. 3. 1824-1827) :

{20} The spurious character of this lengthy erotic interlude seems to me
to be further revealed by two stanzas of pkalasruii with which the passage ends
(App. I, No. 6, lines 157-163=Bomb. ed. 3. 46. 62-63-Cal. ed. 3, 1877-
1878) :

The object of the interpolations seems to be also clear. It is primarily
intencted to motivate Arjuna’s masquerading as the dancmg master to Prin-
cess Uttara in the harem at the court of Virata, which is narrated in the
next parvan. The devout see in it a trial, a test, to see if Arjrma’s mind was
as pure as his body was strong. Arjuna withstands the test successfully. But
the reward he gets for his patience and self-contrd is a curious raie : he is
cursed by the angry and disappointed nympdi that he would live as a amuch
among women ! This apparent curse is, however, looked upon as a blessing
in disguise, for it was to take effect and serve its purpose in the thirteenth
year of the exile through which Arjuna along with his brothers must remain
unrecognized {ajAatiavdsa) . -

This jejune inventicm creates, however, many oomplicaticxis not foreseen
by the interpolator, as it is unfortunately contradicted by Arjuna himself in

the very next parvan, when he confesses to Uttara, that though he has been
telling people that he is a eunuch (4. 10. 8-9), he is in reality nothing of the
kind, and that he has only been practising strict continence, having taken the
vow of rigid celibacy for one full year by order of his eldest brother, Yudhi§-
thira (4. 40. 12-13) :

If that be so, then we must assume that either Urva^'s curse had failed
to materialize or — ^what is more plausible — ^that Arjuna was never under any
curse such as the one implied in this interpolation. Such an interpolation
could have been made only when it was considered necessary that Arjuna
ought in reJality to have been a eunuch to be admitted into the ladies’ apart-
ments at the Virata court, or at least to justify his specific statement to the
effect that he was a eunuch. But this appalling realism is as clumsy as it is
unnecessary. The original conception was obviously quite different. At the
end of the twelfth year of their exile Dharma tells Yudhi!§thira that they
cculd go to Virata’s kingdom in any capacity or with any profession, and no
one would recognize them under any circumstances. Their samkatpa would
be so strong that they would appear to others in any shape or form desired
by themselves, without any external aid or make-up (3. 298. 17, 19) :

In these circumstances I think there is not much doubt that the sus-
pected episode is in fatt a clumsy interpolation, and the circumstance that
the iSarrada version lacks is only an additional proof of the superiority of
this version.

I may add here that the whole story is likewise missing not only in the
Bhdratamanjart but also in the fragmentary but excellent Devanagari manus-
cript of the Araioyakaparvan belonging to the Bombay Branch of the Royal
Asiatic Society (No. 966, fol. 43b), which I have occasionally consulted in
doubtful cases.^

Further particulars of the iSarada version will be found under the account
of the ‘‘ K ” version, which follows next, and with which the Sarad§ verson
is intimately connected.

INTRODUCTION l63

A facsimile of a! page of the “Sarada Codex’' (i§i) appears as the fron-
tispiece of this volume. The text is 3. 45. 1-25.

The “ K ” Version.

This version, as is the! case of the other parvans, is a specific Devanagari
version, closely related to the iSarada, and clearly differentiated frc^ the so-
called Devanagari version. The manuscripts comprising this version must in
part be merely Devanagari copies of Sarada originals and may in part repre-
sent the version of a province or a region adjoining the iSarada zone, which
it has not been possible to localize more precisely.

That the manuscripts of the K version are akin to and cognate with
may be seen from the numerous readings common to Si and K (with or with-
out seme other E>evanagari manuscripts). But it is demonstrated especially
forcibly by their common omission of certain important and well-known pas-
sages found in all other manuscripts, or at least in all other manuscripts of
the Northern recension. Of such passages, given in our App. I, the most
important are numbered 16-18, 22, 27 and 31.

Of these passages No. 16, which forms a separate adhyaya of about 130
lines, and is a medley of legends — among them the story of Narakasura and
the legend of the rescue of the Earth by Vi?nu in the Boair incarnation, — is
omitted in all five' manuscripts of the group i§i K, besides Di.g of the North-
ern recension. It is, in other words, characteristic cf the Mid-Indian group,
Bengali and late Devanagari. — ^Passage No. 17 (42 lines), describing the
return of the Pajnjdavas to the hermitage at Badari, has permeated more
widely, and is now found not only in the entire Southern recension but also
in all manuscripts of the Northern recension except K (with Here

also we notice that the group tSi K is clearly distinguished from the typical
Central sub-recension B Dc Dn 04.^. — ^No. 18 is a short passage of 24 lines
of exactly the same type ; that is to say, it is omitted in K (with some
other allied Devanagari manuscripts) in opposition to the typical Mid-Indian
group B Dc Dn D^.^. K3 secondarily incorporates ip its text only the first
four lines of the passage, which is as indication of the manner in which the
additions of the Central slib>-recension (B D) haVe contaminated the Sarada-
K version. — Another passage tof that type is No. 22 (giving the names of
Skanda); which is omitted in the whole group (i§i K), with £22} the single
exception of tfie conflated manuscript Kg. — ^The next passiage of that kind is
No. 27, a lengthy passage of 87 lines describing in detail how Jayadratha,
after being, released from captivity by Yudhi^thira, seeks the help of the god
Mahiadeva in order to avenge himself ; it is found in all Northern manuscripts
except §1 K Dj. — The last passage in our list is No. 31, a long spun out lament
by Yudhi^thira on seeing his brothers lying on the ground as if dead near
the Enchanted Lake, a passage which is also found in all Northern manus-
cripts except iSi K (with Dj. 3. 5).

The OMitrast between Sj K and the Mid-Indian group is wdl brought
out by two different single-line inserticms, which are nothing but two different
attempts to fill out a supposed lacuna aifter 3. 107. 18. After this stanza,

Notwithstanding the fact that the manuscripts comprising the K version
show many ^riking agreements which distinguish them from other groups,
the K group itself cannot be said to be quite homogeneous. Of these is
distinctly conflated and rather more deeply contaminated than the others.
While preserving a' large number of Ka§m5ri readings, it sides frequently
(especially in the early adhyayas) with the BengaJi-Devanagari group ; at
times even showing readings peculiar to the late Nilakaaitha tradition. Kj
is really a manuscript of the same type, though the degree of contamination
is ccmsiderably less. K3, on the other hand, sha!res with iSj many unique
readings, coming closest to it. Indeed I am inclined to regard the concordant
readings of ahd K3 as the specific Kasmiri readings. In K4 the last manus-
cript of the K version, the contamination has gone yet further than in any
other K manuscript, incorporating occasionally not merely Southern read-
ings, but sporadically even what are diaracteristic Southern insertions.

I append here eixamples of readings showing special affinity between
and K3 (references are to adhyayas and slokas) :

'Die contamination of K. is further proved by the circumstance that it

D(i); and passage No. 12 of App. I (also found in D«, but with a different
point of insertion).

The contamination of Ks from Dn is especially noticeable in the Nala
Episode. Its Ka4niirl character, however, again comes to the surface in such
wrong transcription from the iSarada as (for io 3. 97. 17.

Sporadic contamination of from S is seen in the insertion 159*, and in
pa'ssage No. 4 of App. I (cf. v. 1. 3. 38. 18).

Manuscripts Di _3 of the Devanagari version show pronounced affinities
with the K version, often supporting the specific readings and omissions of
the latter, and they might have been classed under the K version.

The Bengali Versicn.

Our four Bengali manuscripts form on the whole a very homogeneous
group, presenting generally a single common reading. The version has very
close affinities|iwith £24} a particular type of Devanagari manuscripts repre-
sented by our Dn D 4 .P (with or without Dc). These two groups — B and Dc
Dn D 4 .,. — ^show as a rule the same readings, and contain the same insertions. A
notable exception is 939*, which is a specific Bengali insertion lacking even in
Dc D 4.6 and found only in Dn of the Devanagairi manuscripts.

The affinity of B (Dc) Dn D 4.6 (often with the conflated manuscript
K 2 ) is exemplified by the following rdaciings :

11. 27 Ks B Dn D 4 .G : rest
28. 32 K 2 B Dc Dn D 4.6 % *• rest %

104. 9 B Dn D 4 .G ^ 21 % : rest ( mostly )

Similarly B (Dc) Dn D 4 . 6 , differing from most other manuscripts, have
the following short additions : 446*, 448*, 455* (also in two Southern
MSS.) 466*, 467*, 477*, 498*, 512*, (with KJ, 532*, (with D3), 540*,
541*, 684*, 806*, (with K 3 ), 844*, etc., etc.

The Devanagari Versions {other than K).

I have divided the Devanagari Versions into three groups : ( 1 ) the
Version of Caturbhuja ; (2) the Version of Nilakantha ; and (3) the Com-
posite Version. The first two are the versions respectively of the commen-
tators Chaturbhuja and Nilakantha, being accompanied by their glosses ; the
third is a group of Devanagari manuscripts not associated with any commen-
tary.

The Devanagari Version of Caturbimja,

The version of the commentator Caturbhuja has little to recommend for
itself. It generally sides with the BD group, showing a slight preference for
B ; thus B and Dc have a coihmon insertion 415*, not found in other manus-
cripts of our critical apparatus. But it is definitely superior to the version
of Nilakaa?tha, in so far that it lacks many of the very clearly spurious addi-

tions of the latter. The best known of such additions is a passage of 39
lines (App. I, No. 12) inserted in the Nala Episode after our 3. 62. 10, which
is found only in K 2 Dn Dg and is comparable to the passage substituted in
K 4 for stanzas 1-17 of our adhy. 62 (cf. App. I, No. 10). Especially
in the later adhyayas of this parvan, Dc and Dg go tojgether, showing numer-
ous agreements peculiar to themselves. Dc shows some unique additions,
though their number is small ; examples are 129* and 402*, both being one-
line insertions.

Manuscripts of Caturbhuja’s commentary on different parvans are avail-
able ; that on the Virata has been published by the Gujarati Printing Press
(Bombay 1915). It is not unlikely that Caturbhuja had written a commen-
tary on the whole of the Mahabharata, though it is doubtful whether com-
plete manuscripts of the whole of his commentary are now extant. The
manuscripts I have hitherto seen were invariably of individual parvans
separately handed down.

{25} Very little is known about this scholiast. He bore the surname or
title Misra, like his fellow commentator Arjuna Misra. It is therefore likely
that he hails from Eastern India. It has not been possible to fix his chronology
with precision even in relation to the five major Mahabharata commentators,
Devabodha, Vimalabodha, Sarvajna-Narayana, Arjunamisra and Nilakantha.
But it is most unlikely that he is a very early commeftitator.'^ In our manus-
cripts the* commentary is called Vakyadipika (fol. 1) :

This name is analogous to the titles of the commentaries by Devabodha
and Arjunamisra, Jndnadipikd and Arthadipikd respectively ; compare also
the title of Nilakafitha’s commentary Bhdratn-bhdvadipa,

The Devmdgml Version of Nilakant\ha : the Vulgate,

The version of Nilakantha has never inspired confidence, and in the case
of the present parvan, it is singularly disappointing. It contains (along with
some other manuscript groups) fourteen additional adhyayas, some of which
are palpably very late intenxilations. Notable among the latter are adhy.
262-263 of the Vulgate (our App. I, No. 25), which relate how Duryodhana
sends the I?!§i Durvasas, with 10,000 disciples, to Yudhisthira at a moment
when the latter would not be able to feed such an alarming crowd of hungry
mendicants. In answer to Draupadrs prayers, however, tSii Krsna appears,
all of a sudden, from Dvaraka, and so contrives . it that the mendicant
fraternity, without having eaten a morsel of food, inexplicably feels all of a
sudden completely satiated and slinks away in fear and trepidation. They
vanish without even making an effort to e'xplain the situation and express

their apologies to Yudhisthira, who had managed in the meantime to cook
food enough to feed that astonishing large troop of beggars. This naive

story, which is not without an element of humour, is found only in Dci

besides Dn, a very poor collection of manuscripts, and is therefore
obviously a very late interpolation. Its omission from our text, I feel sure,
will not be regretted.

The Vulgate contains many lines which are extremely weakly supported,
at least by manuscripts of our critical apparatus. Thus, besides Dn, 5”' is
found only in D5 ; 25* only in K3 ; 30* only in Kg Dg ; 48* only in :
50* and 55* only in Kg ; 874* only in ; 1193* only in D3 ; and passage

No. 32 of App. I (a long interpolation of 72 lines) only in G3 !

Dn also shows a surprisingly large number of unique readings, not found
in my other manuscript, a few of which are noted below as illustrations :

Nilakantha appears to have been an adept in the Kama-sastra also. In
the course of his commentary on the chapter describing the general dege-
neracy of the Kali age, he discusses certain pornographic details with a frank-

The Composite Devandgan Version.

The Devanagari has always been found to be a composite version. Our
composite Devanagari manuscripts may be roughly divided into three groups.

(1) The best group, from our view-point, is Di_3 which frequently agrees
wdth §i K (but especially K4) in opposition to other D manuscripts and
might have been classed under the K version. Of these D2 agrees, however,
frequently — especially in later adhyayas — ^with Dc, the version of Caturbhuja.

( 2 ) Then there is the group which generally agrees with B Dc Dn.

( 3 ) The remaining manuscript D5 is in a class by itself, presenting a text
which is, for large parts, almost the same as that of the Nilakantha version,
but which shows exceptionally some noteworthy discrepancies. Groups 2
and 3 are frequently seen in combination, and we accordingly very often get
a wider group B Dc Dn D4.C (sometimes joined by K2).

The affinity of the group Di_3 is exemplified by the following concordant
readings of these three manuscripts.

1. 3 Di _3 cT^ : ( Parasm. ) : rest ^ ( Atm. ) qfrm:

1. 5 D1.3 : Other MSS. ( text ),

1. 13 D1.3 : other MSS. U w( or gg

6. 22 Dj .3 : rest

48. 29 Di _3 ifqx ; other MSS. ( text),

167. 19 Dj .3 jffvff ; other N MSS. ( text ) etc., etc.

Examples of insertions, almost peculiar to Dj., and showing the close
affinity between these three manuscripts, are : 182* (with K,,), 288*, 334*

manuscripts, frequently agrees with S, K. Examples of insertions common
to Si K and Di-j (often with D5) are : 640*, 707*, 711*, 715*, etc. etc.

Group Di-a is important for the reason that it lacks (like S, K) many
of the interpolations of the B D group ; e.g. 44*, 128*, 130*, 131*, 133*, 162*,

The Telugu Version,

Only two manuscripts of the Telugu version were collated, of which one
(|^s is often the case with these manuscripts) is certainly conta‘minated, to
a very high degree, from {28} Northern! sources. In such conflated parts, T.
is generally associated with G^. Examples of such contamination will be found
below, under the Grantha version.

Ti, differing from Tg often side's with G^ Mjl (with or without M2),
giving what app>ears to be the real Southern rc'ading.

For examples of contamination of T2 through the Northern recension,
cf. 174*, 248*, 484*, 568*, 570*, 572*, 577*, 661*, 673*, 932*, (with MJ.
991 *„ etc., etc. Many of these are marginal insertions, added sec. m.

The Grantha Version.

Most of our Grantha manuscripts are unfortunately contaminated from
the Northern recension. The contamination is particularly noticeable in the
case of G3, and it increases towards the end of the parvan ; so much so that
in the final chapters G3 often omits the specific insertions of the Southern
recension, absorbing at the same time the characteristic insertions of the
Northern ! Such manuscripts are valuable for a study of the fusion of
recensionsi.

Examples of omission in G3 of specific Southern insertions are : 1050
1059*, 1060*, 1061*, 1062*, 1069*, 1071*, 1077*, 1082*, 1085*, 1086*,

1091*, 1092*, 1093*, 1102*, 1114*, 1137*, 1138*, 1139*, 1142*, 1146*,

1148*, 1149*,, 1152*, 1154*, 1226*, 1343*, 1372*, 1373*, etc., etc.— Examples
of the incorporation of Northern insertions in G3 (sometimes with TJ are :
1046*, 1048*, 1063*', 1065*, 1066*, 1067*, 1073*, 1074*, 1088*, 1103*,

1120*, 1126*, 1131*, 1134*, 1167*, 1203*, 1224*, 1226*, 1227*, 1229*,

1230*, 1279*, 1331*, 1337*, 1358*, 1365*, 1382*, 1385*, etc., etc. ; and passages
Nos. 24, 27, and 32 of App. I.

But the most striking instance of conflation is the inclusion in G3 of our
final adhyaya (299), which is regularly transposed in all genuine Southern
manuscripts to the beginning of the Virataparvan. The evidence of G3 is
thus seen to be fully inconclusive and therefore untrustworthy for the consti-
tution of the Grantha version and the Southern recension.

The M^alayalam Version.

While forming an integral part of the Southern recension, the Malaya-
1am version has its own peculiarities, which distinguish it clearly trom the
T G version, as regards both readings and insertions. Here is a list of T G



172 araivjyakApArvan

insertions, which are lacking in the Malayalam version : 183*, 218*, 232*,
243*, 286*, 356*, 620*, 667*, 674*, 685*, 802*, 803*, 805*, 824*, 856*,
859*, 867*, 868*, 869*, etc., etc. — On the other hand, M also shows a certain
number of specific insertions which are not known to the Telugu and Grantha
versions, such as 307*, 494*, 560*, 581*, 949*, 1028*, 1041*, 1083*, 1158*,
1262*, 1336*, etc., etc. — Nearly all of these insertions (of both types) are
single-line insertions ; a few are of two lines.

But our M is not homogeneous, and exhibiting among them-
selves numerous differences. shows clear signs of contamination from
Northern sources, and is by no means a good representative of the Malaya-
lam version. Examples of Northern accretions in M. are 96*, 99*,, 466*,
516*, 796*, 955*, eta etc. is again often excepted from the common
Southern reading, as in 3. 41. 24 : S (except Mg) against N

(with MJ £29} where agrees with N. M. (like G;{)

also omits a few of the typical Southern insertions; e.g., 102*, 723*. is
not altogether free from contamination from some Northern source or sources
as is indicated by 629*, 677*, 932* (with marg. sec. m.), etc.,, etc.

A very good example of the contamination of from N is furnished
by the conflated reading of M 2 in 3. 22. 8. N reads op-
posed to S, which has ; hut Mg reads which

is very evidently a result of the conflation of the Southern and Northern
readings: (S) ^ (N)- ^he most convincing

proof is furnished by a palpable mistake in Mg. The manuscript inserts
line 1 of a Northern additional stanza (95* )| after 3. 28. 16^*^, but line 2 of
that stanza after 16^^. The two lines of the stanza, though superfluous, do
convey some meaning when read together ; but arranged as in M^, they serve
no useful purpose except to betray the conflated character of the manuscript
in question.

With regard to the status and merit of the Malayalam version in general,
I ami glad to cite here an observation of Professor P. P. S. SaSTRI,, which I
am able to confirm from my own experience. Ip the course of his remarks
on the Southern recension in the Introduction to his edition of the Arapyaka-
parvan. Professor Sastri writes : “ Not having been subject to NSyak influ-
ence in any manner whatsoever, the tradition handed down by the Malayalam
manuscripts preserved the Grantha text, in a purer and more unmixed form
than even some comparatively early Grantha manuscripts, as the Malayalam
Mss. do not at all seem to have come into contact with the Northern Recen-
sion till very recent times''.^ This is in substantial agreement with what
I had stated in my Prolegomena to the Adiparvan regarding the Malayalam

The MahabhlSrata (Southern Recension), Vd. IV (1933), Introduction,

version, namely, that it is “ the best Soutkern version''''^ I am happy to find
that this cautious remark of mine has subsequently been confirmed by the
editor of the Southern Recension himself in a clear and unambiguous manner.

THE PARVASAI^GRAHA

The number of adhyayas and slokas of the Aranyaka, according to the

£30} With regard to the above figures the following particulars may be
noted. According to the count of the Calcutta edition the number of slokas in
this parvan is 17,478. But this calculation misses the correct figure by several
thousands. The Calcutta Pandits responsible for the edition, who were
apparently not very good mathematicians, have made repeated mistakes in
the counting of the lines, being evidently baffled by the complicacies of calcu-
lation at the turn of the century ! They have numbered the lines, by fives,
without committing any mistake up to 3095. They make their first mistake
by putting down the next figure (after 3095) as 4000, in place of 3100 ; and
this is followed by several other lapses of that type ! The correct total as
computed by JacobP is 12,848 as shown above. — The figure' for the slokas of
the Bombay edition has been taken from the edition of text and Marathi
translation by Kashinath alias Bhau Shastri Lele of Wai (Saka 1821), who
has counted the stanzas! in his edition, adhyaya by adhyaya ; and, after
correcting his own errors in three different places, gives the correct figure,
according to him, at the end of the Vanaparvan volume (p, 1344) as 12,002.3

of the "Vanaparvan.”





174 arainjyakaparvan

P. P. S. Sastri’s Southern Recension has been given by himself in the Intro-
duction to the second part of his Araaniyakaparvan (vol. 5, p. xiv). — ^The
figure for the critical text has been intentionally left blank by me, since the
parvan contains two prose adhyayas, in addition, toi a large number of Tri^-
tubh stanzas, and it is difficult to compute their equivalent in slokas. Indeed
the figures given for the other editions are all defective for the same retison.
In fact they are all purely fictitious^ being obtained by the addition of figures
for the stmzas and prose sections, but may be taken to represent a very rough
approximation of the extent. It will thus be realized that it is futile to com-
pare these figures with the Parvasamgraha figures, which are often themselves
doubtful. It has been the general experience that ancient figures, when at all
complicated, seldom come out quite right. And there is no reason to think
that fhe Parvasamgraha figures for the number of stanzas are an exception
to the rule.

We do not expect strict agreement between our figures and the Parva-
sarhgraha figures in respect of the number of stanzas in such a voluminous
work but we do expect some agreement as regards the number of adhyayas.
It is, therefore, surprising to find that almost all extant manuscripts contain
about 30 adhyayas at least more than the figure given by the Parvasam-
graha ! This discrepancy is the more striking, as the manuscripts of the
Parvasamgraha, of all versions and recensions without exception, agree — for
a change — in giving the same figure for the number of adhyiayas, namely,
269. As regards the manuscripts of the Aranyaka, the Ka^miri (Sarada)
     and the Southern manuscripts agree in having about 300 adhyayas, while the
     Central Sub-recetision (Bengali-Devanagari group) show in fact about 315
     adhyayas. The former may be taken as the more reliable figure. Professor
     P. P. S. Sastri’s device of arriving at the Parvasarhgraha figure (269), by
     omitting arbitrarily about 31 colophons actually contained in all of his
     manuxripts is hardly commendable.

{31} Due to these discrepancies between the data of the Parvasalmgraha
and the manuscripts, which are patent, two probabilities are presented to us :
either, the compiler of the Parvasalmgraha had made a mistake in counting
the adhyiayas, or some thirty adhyayas have been added to our parvan since
the time of the Parvasamgraha count. No third explanation is possible, and
both these , are significant alternatives. If we admit that there has been an
original error in the counting of adhyayas, it is rou^ly a mistake of 30 in
300, that is 10 per cent., which is indeed a very high percentage of error. If
we could prove even two or three such errors, the value of the figures in the
Parvasamgraha will dwindle down to an insignificant quantity. Ifi on the
other hand,~~as is more likely— our critical text contains about 30 adhyayas
(equivalent to about 1500 stanzas) more than the text which was the basis
of the Parvasamgraha calculation, then even in the matter of general contents

it is nowhere near the Parvasamgraha standard and must be very far re-
moved from the hypothetical archetype of the Mahabhiarata ; for it is hardly
credible that as many as thirty colophons could get displaced or lost in a
mere aggregate of 300 colophons. There are moreover no means to excise
these spurious accretions except by methods of higher criticism, which owing
to the peculiar character of our work would be a very delicate operation
indeed, and withal one of doubtful utility. We thus see how easy it would
be to delude ourselves that just by collating a small fraction of the extant
manuscripts, we could arrive at the archetype.

The passage in the Parvasamgraha giving the conte^nis of this parvan
exists in two versions (1. 2. 111-126) : the longer version of the Vulgate
being based on the Central Sub-recension (the Bengali-Devanagari) , the
shorter version on the Kasmiri-Southem tradition. I have adopted the latter
in this edition, relying mainly on the superiority of the agreement between
what appear prima jmie to be independent versions. But I think it is pos-
sible to fortify the argument in the present case from intrinsic considerations.
It will be seen that in the shorter version, the sequence of the* incidents men-
tioned in the list of contents does not tally with the actual sequence in the
original text of the parvan, given uniformly by all extant manuscripts ; the
sequence of the longer version on the other hand tallies exactly with the
present text. Moreover, the latter — ^namely, the longer version — is much
fuller, containing as it does far more details. Is it now likely that the
Kasmiri and Southern traditions had independently— or in collusion with
each other — discarded the original fuller and more correct version in favour
of a shorter and defective version ? It seems far more probable that the
defects of the original short version, which has been preserved independently
by the Ka^nnrl and Southern traditions, had been noticed early, and that had
led to its being modified and corrected by the revisers of the Central Sub-
recension, which then adopted the revised version of the contents.

The Parvasamgraha mentions sixteen sub-parvans, which is also our
number, but the Vulgate has twenty-two ; that is six more. The latter
number is obtained by adding to the list the names of certain episodes like
the Nalopakhyina, Riamopakhyiana, Savitryupakhyiana, which originally did
not form separate sub-parvans at all, as will be seen from the following table.

The limits of these sub-parvans can be fixed, as a rule, with tolerable
certainty with the aid of the colophons of our manuscripts, which give indi-
cations sufficient for purposes of approximate identification.


OTHER EDITIONS

Of the numerous printed editions of the Arajiyaka-parvan (almost uni-
formly passing under the name Vanaparvan) , I have consulted the following :

(1) The edifia prmceps of the Mahabharata printed in Calcutta between 1834
and 1839. Its Vanaparvan comprises, according to its own data, 17478 ^lokas in
314 adhyayas,, It gives in general the Nilakaajtha version, which we have called
the Vulgate and which has been reproduced in many subsequent editions, sometimes
accompanied by translation and commentary. The editio princeps still remains the
best edition available of the Vulgate version of the Araioyakaparvan, though that
is not saying very much.

(2) The oblong pothi-form edition, published by Ganapat Krishna ji in
Saka 1799 in Bombay (hence commionly known as the Bombay edition). It is
accompanied by Nilakajatha'a commentary, Bharata^bhaviidipa, and should there-
fore represent the £33} Nilakaotha tradition. But it oohtains as a matter of fact


^ The Parvasamgraha of the Vulgate cites Nos. 19 and 20 in reverse order,
that is, the Pativratamahatmya precedes the Ramopakhyana.

quite a large number of lines and readings not countenanced by Nilakantha himself.
The text is divided into 315 adyhiayas, and contains (according to some editions
which give the aggregate number of stanzas in the parvan) 12,002 stanzas.^

(3) The Kumbhakonam edition published by T. R. Krishnacharya and T. R.
Vyasacharya, and described on its title-page as' “A New Edition, mainly based on
the South Indian Texts”. Its Vanaparvan comprises (according to the Index
Volume) 12,476 llokas and 315 adhyayas, but contains like our misch-codices a good
number of specific Northern passages unknown to the true Southern recen^n.2

(4) Professor P. P. S. Sastri’s Southern Recension, Volumes 4-5, comprising
(according to his own count) 11,136 slokas dividied into 269 adhyayas.

As these old editions contain nothing of any serious importance which
is not to be found in the different manuscripts already collated for this edi-
tion, they have been only sparingly used and cursorily studied by me. The
following observations may be of use to those who may wish to consult these
editions.

As remarked above, there are some gilave mistakes in the numbering of
the stanzas of the Calcutta edition. The first mistake occurs after stanza
3095, where the next number suddenly jumps up to 4000 (when it should be
3100). Similarly after 8895, the following number jumps up to 9900 (when
it should be 8900). For the third time, after 10,095, the following number
is given as 11, OCX) (instead of 10,100). For the fourth time, after 11,095,
the next number jumps up to 12j000, when it should be 11,1(K). At the next
step, however, the number equally suddenly jumps back to 10,200 ! Thus
at one place three successive numbers (which are supposed to increase by
five at each step) are 11095, 12,000, 10,200 ! ! After adhy. 117, there ap-
pear to be no new mistakes, and from that point onwards the numbering
may be taken to be continuous and correct. But the result of these earlier
miscalculations is that the extent of the parvan appears to be 17,478, when
it should in reality be (according to Jacobi’s computation) 12,848, the Par-
vasairiigraha figure being 11,664 ! Several numbers occur twice, and in giv-
ing reference to the Calcutta edition, it is advisable to cite the adhyaya num-
ber as well.

The Bombay edition, like the Calcutta, is based on the Nilakaiotha ver-
sion but (like yet other editions of the Mahabharata prepared in the same
fashion, e.g., the Chitrashala edition) does not represent the Nilakaiptha tra-
dition very faithfully. In the footnotes to the text, and the critical notes at
the end, I have frequently drawn attention to unwarranted departure from
Nilakaaitha’s original text. The vagaries are small and of no great conse-
quence, but they are there nevertheless. They prove very clearly that tdth-

^ According to the Chitrashala Edition the number is 11,859, though ’the text
is precisely the same in both editions.

name of this parvan is given on the title-page and in the captions as ” Vanaparva
the colophons invariably give the name correctly as Araiiya-ur — Araijyakaparvan

any conscious effort^ at alteration or emendation — and perhaps, notwith-
standing the half-hearted efforts to preserve intact the received text-
discrepancies do arise in course of time, and the text does drift away from the
norm, imperceptibly, within a relaUvely short period of time. Thus in 3. 9.
7 fcr our (which is documented {34} uniformly by almost all our

manuscripts), the different editions printed in the Bombay province, and exa-
mined by me, all have the reading a reading which has not been found

in a single manuscript ! In 3. 83. 30, the Bombay edition (with the Kum-
bhakonam and some other editions) reads when the Nilakantha

manuscripts themselves (along with a host of other manuscripts) have the
correct reading {lect. diff.), which is the reading of the constitut-
ed text ! Likewise in 3. 249. 8, out edition reads which is the read-

ing offered by all manuscripts collated for our edition, except one inferior
Grantha manuscript (G3), which reads and yet this latter reading

( been adopted in many of the Bombay editions .

Professor Sastri’s edition is based chiefly on four manuscripts, of
which one ( ^ ) is in Telugu script, two ( 3T, ^ ) in Grantha, and one ( ^ }
in Malayalam. For adhyayas 67-130, that is, for about 64 adhyayas out of
his total of 269 adhyayas, a fifth manuscript was partly utilized. Ac-
cording to the editor, manuscript e? (Grantha) “represents the Principal
Text printed It bears a date corresponding to a.d. 1795, that is, it is less
than 150 years old. As an edition of the Southern recension, Professor Sas-
tri’s edition is preferable and indeed much superior to the Kumbhakonam
edition. But it seems to me that in: its preparation the manuscript material
has not been as fully and carefully utilized as it should have been. Judging
by the Southern manuscripts collated for our edition and examined by me,
which cannot be very different frdm his, it should seem that too often
Sastri’s edition agrees in its mislections and other short-comings with the
Kumbhakonam edition to the exclusion of the genuine Southern tradition. I
miss in his critical apparatus many of the readings which are given uniformly
by all Southern manuscripts. Even if the editor, for some occult reasons, did
not wish to adopt in his text these perfectly good and authenticated Southern
readings, they should have appeared in the footnotes as discarded readings.
Instances of Northern readings having contaminated his text will be found in
the following stanzas (reference is to slokas and adhyayas of his text) :

1. 27^ 28^ 2. 13i^ 22^ 46", 71J^ 80J^ 4. 8^ 8", 15^ 5. l^ 6", 7", 22^; 7. 2^

14. 6^ 17. ; 18. 5* ; ^tc., etc. These examples have been select-

ed at random from the first US adhyayas only ; but such lapses keep turning
up on page after page up to the end of the book.


As his edition is based on four manuscripts only and even these manus-
cripts appear not to have been rigorously collated and fully utilized, I should

179


hesitate to accept his text as a true representative of the Southern recension,
even ignoring the deficiencies of the critical apparatus.

In the division into adhyayas, Professor Sastri seems to have followed
the Grantha edition of Sarahhojirajapuram (Tanjore District) printed in
1895. The reason given by Professor Sastri for following the edition instead
      of the manuscripts is that the division of the Tanjore edition “accords ex-
      actly with the enumeration of the number of chapters for the Vana Parvan
      (sic) in the AnukramainJkadhyaya of both the Northern and the Southern
      Recensions*'.^ This is a dangerously vicious circle ! As the Tanjore edition
      does not pretend that it has followed any manuscript tradition, the adhyaya
      division of both these editions (Tanjore andi Sastri) remain unsupportel by
      manuscript authority £35} and therefore perfectly arbitrary. Adopting the Par-
      vasarhgraha figure, Sastri has divided the parvan into 269 adhyayas, while
      the actual numbering of the adhyayas in Southern manuscripts reaches the
      figure 300 approximately, the number according to our Southern manuscripts
      varying between 299 and 302.

While Sastri by arbitrary elimination of colophons, has equated his
adhyaya-number to that given by the Parvasamgraha, he could not make the
figures for the slokas tally ! According to the Parvasarhgraha the number of
slokas should be 11,664. “ The total number of stanzas, *’ says Professor

Sastri, “printed in the Text of the Southern Recension comes to 11,136,
which is short by 528 As his text is short by over 500 stanzas, his equa-
tion of the number of adhyayas with the Parvasamgraha figure, by arbitrary
omission of about thirty colophons, which are found in all Southern manus-
cripts, has no significance, and remains a piece of useless and unmeaning
manipulation.

It is exactly seventeen years since I took over charge of the Mahabharata
work, and reorganized, on somewhat different lines, this Department of the Insti-
tute, having profited by the experiments and experiences of my predecessor, the
late lamented Mr. N. B. Utgikar, m.a. During this interval the Mahabharata
Department of the Institute has prepared and) published critical editions of four
whole parvans (in this sequence) : the Adi (1933), the Virata (1936), the Udyoga
(1940), and now the Araajyaka (1942). These four parvans comprisfe, according
to the data of the Parvasamgraha-parvan, about 28,4(X) “Islokas". In addition to
this : the Sabhaparvan, which is being edited by Professor Franklin Edgerton of
the Yale University (U.S.A.) and which has been ready for some time, has been
taken up for printing, and its printing has made considerable progress ; nearly the
whole of the text, along with the critical apparatus pertaining to it, has been
printed off, and the printed portion may even be issued in the near future, as a
separate fascicule. Furthermiore, the press-copy of the BhX§maparvan, which is be-
ing edited by Rao Bahadur Dr. S. K. Belvalkar, i.e.s (Retd), is almost ready
and is now undergoing final revision at the hands of its editor. Funds permitting,
it will be sent to the press in the not very distant future. Thus, during these sevcn-

ARANYAKAPARVAN


teen years the Insititute has critically dealt with the first six parvans of the Great
Epic : the Adi, Sabha, Araoyaka, Virata, Udyoga and Bhisma. These six parvans
make up a total of about 36,800 *'islokas’', out of the aggregate of about 82,150
“slokas*' comprising the entire Mahabharata, a portion which is approximately 45
per cent, of the aggregate, excluding of course the Supplement ”, Harivaih§a, which,
for the time being, we have placed aside. This is no mean achievement, we think.
The part of the epic critically dealt with so far is, I imagine, in bulk, about four
times as great as the Iliad and the Odyssey put together, and one and a half times
as great as our Ramayana.

That a work of this nature and these dimensions is not one man’s job is very
evident. Many collaborators, sympathisers, friends, benefactors and patrons have
contributed to such measure of success as has been achieved so far, and they in-
clude among them, princes and potentates, persons owning manuscripts, curators
and librarians, printers and parvan-editors, not to speak of the General Editor
and his modest staff in £36} the background. Surely the most potent among these
multifarious contributory factors have been —

srfe 5^ ST I

— the generous patrons of learning, who out of regard for this venerable monument
of Indian antiquity, this great and lustrous heritage of Bharatavarsa, have liberal-
ly supplied the Institute, all through these years, with funds to carry on this cost-
ly but very vital work.

First among these generous patrons stands in our estimation Shrimant Bala-
saheb Pant Pratinidhi, B.A., Rajasaheb of Aundh, whose princely liberality made
it, in the first instance, possible for the Institute to think of undertaking this am-
bitious project. The Rajasaheb has already paid up a large part of the Foun-
dation Grant of a lakh of rupees promised by him, and thus placed under his ob-
ligations not only the Institute but all those who love the Great Epic of India.

I have next to record the gratitude of the promotersl of this scheme — which
has now become nothing less than a great national undertaking--to a number of
other distinguished and generous donors, scattered all over India, who have con-
tributed liberally to our Mahabharata Publication Fund, the chief among them be-
ing : The Imperial Government of India, the Provincial Governments of Bombay,
Madras, Burma and United Provinces; the Gwalior, Hyderabad (Deccan), Baroda,
Bhavnagar, Phaltan, Mysore, Porbunder, Kolhapur, Patiala, Sangli, Ichalkaranji,
Ramdurg, and other Indian States, The Trustees of the Sir Dorab Tata Trust,
the Savitribai Bhat Trust, and the Tulsidas Charities also deserve a grateful men-
tion here for their kind help to our finances. We must gratefully think also of
those persons less gifted by Fortune, who have contributed vsmaller sums — with the
one idea of helping on this great cause — each according to his ability.

The Institute is indebted, for subsidies to its Mahabharata work, to the Trus-
tees of the Mahabharata Fund of Great Britain in London ; and indebted also for
a token grant, in appreciation of this work, to the British Academy of London.

And last, but not least, I must mention, in this connection,, our Alma Mater —
The University of Bombay — who has been exceptionally generous and appreciative
of our endeavours in this field, supply us with funds, lending us manuscripts, and
generally taking a very keen and active interest in the welfare and rapid progress
of our project.

In connection with further assistance rendered by extra-mural collaborators and
helpers, I must put on record our special obligations to Pandit Rajaguru Hemraj,

C.I.E., of Nepal ; as also to Professor Kshitimohan Sen, who has succeeded Profes-
sor Vidhushdchar Bhattacharya as Principal of the Visvabharati ; further to Mr.
S. Gopalan, B.A., B.L., who has succeeded the late Raosaheb Sambamurthi Rao,
as Honorary Secretary of the Saraswathi Mahal Library of Tanjore. Both these
latter gentlemen have been kind enough to carry on, in a purely honorary capacity,
the onerous and responsible task of supervising the Mahabharata collations done
in their respective institutions.

The thanks of the Institute are also due to the Curators, Trustees, and Custo-
dians of the following libraries and insititutions for keeping us equipped with the
manuscripts required for our Mahabharata work, during almost two decades : the
Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal,
the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad, the Adyar Library, the Oriental Institute of Baroda,
Madras Government £37} Library, Mysore Oriental Manuscripts Library, Sri Yadu-
giri Yatiraj Math (Melkote, Mysore), Cochin State Library, Pudukkottah State Lib-
rary, and the India Office Library (London). The Institute has also received ma-
nuscripts or photo-copies or hand- made copies of manuscripts from the Bombay
University, the Visvabharati, Dacca University, Dayananda Angk>-Vedic College of
Lahore (Research Department), Benares Sanskrit College, and Calcutta Sanskrit
College — all of whom I wish to thank! on behalf of the Institute very cordially for
their kind help in the matter. The Institute is, moreover, obliged to Sardar M. V.
Kibe, M . A . of Indore for the loan of a complete Nllakantlia manuscript of the
Mahabharata. It is further indebted for the free loan of Southern manuscripts of
the Mahabharata to the Chief of Idapalli, Mr. Kallenkara Pisharam, Mankavu
Padinnare Kovilakam, Killimangalam Nambudiripad, and to the proprietors of
the following Malabar estates ; Poomullimana, Avaijapparambu Mana, Nareri Mana,
Ponnokkottu Mana, Paliyam Estate, Channamangalam.

Once more I would fain express my gratitude for help of various kinds from
my colleagues on the Mahabharata Editorial Board, who have throughout reposed,
very generously, full confidence in me, and helped and supported me invariably in
the true spirit of camaraderie. It is sad to reflect that before we are even half-
way through our work, several members of the old Editoial Board, formed in 1925,
are no longer with us ; from among whom I remember particularly my friends
Father R. Zimmermann, SJ., Professor M. WiNTEJRNiTZ, and Mr. Vishvanath
P. Vaidya.

I have to record here my keen appreciation of the willing compliance and un-
grudging assistance I have uniformly received from members of the Permanent
Staff of the Mahabharata Department of this Institute. Mr. S. N. Tadpatrikar,
M.A., Supervisor of Collations, who is in special charge of the collations, has
been moreover, as usual, always by my side, helping me with useful suggestions,
when I was engaged in constituting the text of this extensive parvan. The critical
notes were compiled from the collation ^eets by Mr. B. G. Bhide Shastri, Mr.
D. V. Naravane, and Mr, G, G. Soman. We shall miss, in future, the expert
assistance of Mr. Bhide in several fields, who having served the Institute in the
Mahabharata Department since 1921, has now owing to old age, retired from ser-
vice. The Sarada manuscripts have been invariably collated by our Sarada expert,
Shankar Shastri Bhilavadikar, Head Shastri of the Mahabharata I>epartment. The
proof-reading has been done by the Codlator and Reader Pandit K. V. Krishnamurti
Sharma Shastri, of Erode (^th India), who is now helped in that work by Mr.
M. V. Vaidya, M. A., both of whom have worked with praiseworthy diligence,
exemplary zeal, and signal devotion to their work. Collations of Southern manus-
cripts have been done at the Institute uniformly by the Pandits K. V, Anantana-

rayan Shastri of Erode, and K. S. Vishvanath Shastri of Kolengode (South
India), both of whom also are very accurate and conscientious woilcers, exhibiting
characteristically a single-minded devotion to duty.

The superior finish of the Aranyakaparvan Volumes, from the typographical
viewpoint, is due solely to the care and thought personally bestowed on them by
my indefatigable friend Professor Dr. Raghu Vira of the International Academy of
Indian Culture, who, as part of a programme of multifarious activities for the re^
generation of our culture, has equipped at Lahore a small but efficient printing es-
tablishment — ^the £38} Arya Bharati Press — ^which is solely devoted to the cause of
the service of the arya-bhdratl for endowing Sarasvati with better vestments than she
grudgingly receives in India at the hands of very mercenary printers and publi-
shers. At great trouble and inconvenience to himself — and, I fear, even at the risk
of pecuniary loss— he undertook and has carried out successfully the printing of
these two big tomes, and thus led us safely out of the first big forest our little party
of explorers had encountered on our way to the yet distant Ut(H>ia of a complete cri-
tical edition of the Mahabharata.

If Mahai^i Kp^ina Dvaipayana Vyasa tells us that he has cried himself hoarse,
urging people to follow the Path of I^ty :

wmset ^ 5f II

his shouting with uplifted arms has not been entirely in vain. He has not failed
in his mission. Across the reverberating corridors of Time, we his descendants can
still hear dimly his clarion call to Duty. It is in response to that call and in a
spirit of reverent homage to that sage of unfathomable wisdom — ^that embodied
Voice of the Collective Unconscious of the Indian people — ^we offer this work, pledg-
ed to broadcast to mankind, in this hour of its need and its peril, the luminous mes-
sage of the Mahajn§i :
