ii Htdory of Dharmaf&sttfa 

It transcends the distinction of subject and object, the 
duality which is essential for knowledge 

The absolute of experience is not the absolute of 
language or of logic. The Real to which we belong is 
beyond description in its majesty, power and glory. 
Spiritual humility requires us to look upon the varied 
expressions and interpretations as suggestions of the 
Supreme. By encouraging dogmatism and the use of 
force to spread belief, religions have become discredited. 

The seers affirm that they are one with the Sup- 
reme : ahaih brahmasmi. Hallaj exclaims . " I am the 
truth " and was executed for his heterodoxy. 

A well-known Sufi tradition attributes to the pro- 
phet a saying : " He who knows the self knows the 
Lord ". Of Abu Yazid it is recorded that he said : " I 
sloughed off my self as a snake sloughs off its skin ; 
then I looked into my self, and lo, I was He " - 1 Reli- 
gion, it is said, springs from the great ' I am ' in each 
' me '. The fountains are within. 

On the pathway to the goal we feel that the 
attainment of the goal is conditioned by the effort of 
the seeker and the grace of God — tapah-prabhava and 
deva-pi-asdda. 

The seekers look upon the Supreme as a Person 
separate from us, whose commands we obey, whose will 
we accept with reverence. The One beyond sense-per- 
ception, speech and logic is also the Controller, the 
Lord of all, the Creator and Ordainer of all. " There is 
nothing marvellous in my love for you, O God, you- are 
a mighty being but your love for me a poor slave is 
really marvellous. It is impossible_to know thee and 
not to love thee. " The personal is not a falsification of

iv History of Dharmasdstra 

Vyavasaydtmikd buddhw eke 'ha kurunandana. The 
trained understanding is single-minded. Integrity 
refers to the quality of oneness. It does not mean 
alienation from the world. Religion does not mean 
other-worldiness, separating oneself from all created 
things. It is denial of egoism. Turning one's back on 
the world is a part of ascetic discipline which is not an 
end in itself. Liberation from the tyranny of time is 
not liberation from time. When we become spiritual 
in outlook we do not cease to be human. 

The secret of true greatness is love of fellowmen. 
Love of neighbour is not only a moral duty but a wise 
policy. The right course today is co-operation and not 
conflict. " What merit is there in the goodness of a 
man who returns good for good ? A good man verily 
is one who returns good for evil. nl Rdmardjya or the 
Kingdom of God is the ideal for the human community. 
The one hope for the peoples of the world to get to- 
gether is a change in the human heart. 

Ethical standards are the only criteria for the 
distinction between high and low ,among men. Purity 
of conduct elevates a man even as impurity degrades 
him All other distinctions are irrelevant The Chdn- 
dogya Upamsad refers to patitas. The Candalas are 
those given to stealing, drinking, adultery and murder. 
These four are fallen ete patanti catvarah* A patita, 
a fallen man, is a wicked man, a small-minded selfish 
man, not an untouchable. 

The caste distinctions may have had their value in 
another context of society but we have out-grown it.

Foreword v 

The Bhagavadgita speaks of the four-fold classification 
as based on guna ( character ) and karma ( work ). 

We are all unregenerate at birth and become re- 
generate by our effort. 

janmana jayate sudrah 
samsMrad dvija ucyate \ 

Some are advanced ; others not. We should give 
equal facilities to all. The Mahdbhdraia says that there 
•was only one varna at the beginning and the four castes 
arose out of later developments. / 

ekavarnam idam purvam visvam dsld yudhisfliira i 
karma-kr iyd-mbhedena caturvarnyarii pralis}hitam \\ 

But we have come to base caste on birth though some 
of our leading writers have held that it is not birth or 
learning but conduct alone that constitutes its basis ; 
for dvijatva, 

vpttam eva tu kdranam i 
vedcvpafhena vvpras tu brahmajndndt tu brahmanah \\ 
It is not the colour of the skin but the conduct of the 
person that counts. The only way to progress is by 
means of good conduct. The Sarhvarta-Smrti says : 
sadaodrena devaPoam rsitvarh vai taihaiva ca i 
prdpnwmnti kuyonitvam mcmusyds ladviparyaye \\ 
Great achievement is possible for each one of us. 

Professor Kane brings out with great learning and 
lucidity the frequent changes our society has passed 
through. When Manu ( I. 85 ) tells us that different 

ST" !T* ailed in different ages he su sg ests that tta 

!!!^^^^ Social 



vi History of Bhai'masdstra 

customs and institutions are subject to change Yajna- 
valkya tells us that " one should not practise that 
which, though ordained by the Smrto, is condemned by 
the people." 1 What appeals to one's conscience, 
atmanas tustih, the conscience of the disciplined, not of 
the superficial, the forms which the elect praise, 2 should 
be our standard. 

Vital changes may be introduced in the habits of 
the people by parisads or assemblies of the learned. 
When such assemblies cannot be constituted even the 
decision of one learned in dharma will be authoritative. 
The Apastamba Dharmasutra says dharmajna-samayah 
pramanam. 3 People who are learned and compassionate, 
who are practical-minded can decide the issues of right 
and wrong. They are the conscience of the commu- 
nity. What we are doing by legislative enactments is 
consistent with our tradition.

PREFACE TO VOLUME V 

The fourth volume of the History of Dharma^dstra 
was published in October 1953, i.e. more than eight 
years ago. This last volume was in the Press for more 
than five years. The delay is due to several causes 
This volume in two parts contains over 1700 pages. It 
is thus far more bulky than any of the previous volumes. 
Nonavailability of sufficient quantity of good printing 
paper was another cause. The third cause was my age 
( I am now 82 years old ) and frequent bad health. 
It is gratifying to my friends and myself that at last 
this undertaking spread over thirty-seven years is 
completed. 

This volume is divided into ten sections. The first 

section deals with Vratas and Utsavas ( religious vows 

and festivals •) ; the second with Kala ( time ), Muhurta 

(auspicious times ), and calendar ; the third with 

Santis ( propitiatory rites for averting the wrath of a 

deity, a calamity or unlucky event ) ; the fourth and 

fifth with Puranas and Dharmasastra and the causes of 

the disappearance of Buddhism from India ; the sixth 

with Tantrik doctrines and Dharmas'astra ; the seventh 

with Mimamsa and Dharmas'astra ; the eighth with 

Sankhya, Yoga, Tarka and Dharmasastra ; the ninth 

with cosmology, Karma and Punarjanma ; the tenth 

with the fundamental conceptions and characteristics of 

Hindu ( Bharatiya ) culture and civilization, and future 

trends. 

In the Preface to the 2nd volume I have indicated 
the reasons for numerous and lengthy Sanskrit quota- 
tions In the Preface to the 4th volume I have mentio- 
ned the aim I had in view in bringing together the facts 



viii History of Dharmaiastra 

in each branch of Dharmaiastra with detachment and 
integrity and -without bias. The same aim and mental 
attitude have been kept in view in this volume also. 
But it may be argued that when an author selects 
some of the numerous facts he passes a judgement 
about the importance of facts and his judgement may 
be biased all the same. I do not dispute this argu- 
ment, but will only argue that, facts being numerous 
and there being limitations imposed by the space 
available, the author has a right to pronounce a judge- 
ment as to the importance of the facts he selects. 

As regards volumes two, three and four, I could 
rely on a tower of strength in the person of Parama- 
hamsa Svami Kevalananda Sarasvati of Wai. But, 
unfortunately the Svami passed away in March 1955 
before I began to write this last volume, and I 
could not get the benefit of his wise counsel in this fifth 
volume. 

In this last volume I received help from many 
people, either personally or by correspondence. I have 
to thank Mr. M. B. Arte, Dr. R. N. Dandekar, and 
Prof. EL. D. Velankar for help in translating impor- 
tant passages from several French and German works. 
Prof. Gode, Curator of the Bhandarkar Oriental Resea- 
rch Institute, Poona, was always ready to render help 
as to manuscripts and books. He had been a close 
friend for nearly forty years and his sudden death has 
meant for me the loss of a learned, sympathetic, and 
ever-obliging friend. Dr. A. D. Pusalker very carefully 
read the chapters on Puranas and indicated several mis- 
prints and some inaccurate statements. Dr. Raghavan 
very kindly brought to my notice the calendars in use 
in Southern India and certain works on Vratas ; Pandit 
Srijiva Nyayatlrtha sent me in Sanskrit the Naiyayika 
view on Kala ; Miss BLunda Sathe ( now Mrs. Savkar )

kindly sent me from Paris information from French 
scholars on Babylonian, Assyrian and Greek astronomy. 
I am highly obliged to Dr. B. S. Joshi for sending me 
microfilms of certain papers (not available m India) 
from Cambridge and Chicago. Prof Durgamohan Bha- 
ttacharya kindly sent me a copy of the Ralarsiddkantar 
cZorf.nl. I am under deep obligations to Svami Kuva- 
layananda of Lonavla for reading my chapter on Yoga 
and suggesting valuable changes and amendments. Prof. 
Zala g°ave me details about the Vratas observed in 
Saurastra. Prof. G. H. Bhatt ( Baroda ) and Mr. S. D. 
Katre ( Curator, Scindia Institute, "Ujjain ) very kindly 
showed me the manuscript- w ealth of their Institutes 
and helped me with the contents of several relevant 
mss. on Vratas and Kala. Shri Padesastrl of Baroda 
discussed with me, personally and by correspondence, 
several points about Ancient Hindu Astronomy. 
MM. Dr. Umesh Mishra brought to my notice his edi- 
tion of the Vxjnanadipika of Padruapada and Dr. H. G. 
Narahari wrote to me about the Prarabdha-dhvantctr 
vidhvamsana of Acyutar&ya and sent me off-prints of 
his papers thereon. Mr. Shankarrao Joshi of the 
Bharata Itibasa Sari^odhaka Mandala of Poona helped 
me by bringing to my notice hand-written calendars 
more than two hundred years old. To all these I offer 
my best thanks. I am highly obliged to Mr. S. N. Savadi 
b. a. ( hohs. ) of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research 
Institute for help in the correction of the proofs of 
this volume. I have to thank Mr. P. M. Purandare, 
Advocate (O. S.), Bombay High Court, Tarkatirtha 
Baghunathasastri Kokje of Lonavla, and Dr. Bhaba- 
tosh Bhattacharya for reading the printed sheets and 
making suggestions and pointing out misprints. 
Mr, N. G. Chapekar, in spite of his being now 
over 91 years of age, read some chapters when they 

were only typewritten, and discussed them personally 
it

with me for some hours. To him I owe a deep debt 
of gratitude for having taken so much trouble at such 
a very advanced age. I am highly obliged to Dr. A. 
Ghosh, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey 
of India, and to the Librarian Mr. L. G. Parab and the 
staff of the Archaeological Library for rendering all 
help to me while I had been collecting material for 
this volume 

I cannot find words adequate enough to express 
my sense of deep gratitude to Dr. Radhakrishnan, now 
President of India, who has favoured me with many 
kindnesses during the last fourteen years. As for this 
volume of the Histwy of Dhovrmaidstra,, in the midst 
of numerous engagements and heavy work, he found 
time to look into its last two chapteis, made vital sug- 
gestions for their improvement, and finally contributed 
a learned Foreword. 

I am aware that, in spite of so much help rendered 
by so many friends and well-wishers, this large volume 
might contain many mistakes, for which I alone am 
responsible. In the process of printing, some diacritical 
marks have either been elided or placed in wrong places, 
for which I seek the indulgence of all scholars and 
readers. 

Lastly, I thank the Manager of the Aryabhushan 
Press of Poona for carrying out with energy and zeal 
the work of printing this very large volume bristling 
with thousands of quotations, in the face of great diffi- 
culties caused by shortage of paper, the Poona floods, 
and other unforeseen happenings

CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE 
of some important works and authors . 
referred to in vol. V. 

K B. Some dates, particularly of ancient works, are 
more or less conjectural. 

4000 B. C -1000 B. C— The period of the Vedic Sam* 
hitas, Brahmanas and Upanisads ; some hymns of 
the Rgveda, of the Atharvaveda and verses in the 
Taittiriya Samhita and Brahmanas may possibly go 
back to a period earlier than 4000 B. C. and some* 
of the Upanisads ( even from among those that are* 
regarded by most scholars as the earliest ones J 
may be later than 1000 B. C. . Some scholars have 
criticized me for assigning the Vedic Sariibitas t& 
such an early date as 4000 B. G. Bloomfield, in 
• Religion of the Veda' (New York, 1908 ) was will- 
ing ( on p. 20 ) to regard 2000 B. C. for the begin- 
nings of Vedic literary productions and to assign a 
much earlier date for institutions and religious 
concepts which the Veda derived and he denies 
that there is any better proof for any later date 
such as 1C00, 1200 or 1000 BC rather than for 
one of the earlier viz. 2000 B. C. Winternitz ( in 
' Some problems of Indian Literature ' which are 
his Calcutta Readership Lectures, p. 20 ) remarks 
' it is more probable that this un'known time of the 
Vedic Literature was nearer 2500 B. C. or 2000 
B. C. than to 1500 or 1200 B. C " Both Bloomfield 
and Winternitz frankly confess that they know" 
nothing at all about the date of the early Vedic 
Literature. Some Western scholars are rather 
too cocksure or dogmatic than the facts warrant.

References to pages of important works consulted 

In former volumes lists of important works con- 
sulted were set out at length. It is not necessary to 
do this in this volume because in each section lists of 
important Sanskrit works and English works and papers 
have been provided. Therefore, all that need be done is 
to bring together the pages of this volume where such 
lists are mostly mentioned.

SECTION III 

&ANTI (Propitiatory riles for averting a deity's wrath, 
a calamity or unlucky event), 

CHAPTER XX 
Vedic meaning and procedure of Santis 

The word Santiis derived from the root 'sam', which has 
several meanings (such as 'to stop', 'to be appeased', 'to kill' 
rarely) and belongs to the 4th conjugation and also to the 9th. 
The word Santi itself does not occur in the Tjlgveda, but it occurs 
in the Atharvaveda and the Vajasaneya Sarhhita. The root 
*sam', its several forms and derivatives and the indeclinable 
particle ' sam' occur hundreds of times even in the Rgveda, 
The word ' sam' is often conjoined in the Rgveda to ' yoh' either 
as 'samyoh* ($g. 1.93.7, 1.106.5, HI 17.3, EL 18.4, IV. 13.5, 

V. 47.7, V. 53.14, V. 69 3, VI. 50.7, V3X 35.1, V3X 69.5, X 9.4, 
X 15.4, X 37.11, X. 182.1-3 ) or as ' sam ca yosca ' ( as in $g. 
1. 114.2, 189.2, H. 33.13, YEL. 39.4, VIII. 71.15 ). In these places 
the words are generally rendered as ' happiness and welfare ' or 
'health and wealth' (by Keith in translation of Tai. S. II. 6.10.3) 
and these meanings generally suit the context, e. g. in &g. 

VI. 50.7 ' dhata tokaya tanayaya sam yoh' ( confer on our sons 
and progeny happiness and welfare), in Rg. X. 182 the words 
' atha karad-yajamanaya sam yoh ' ( may Brhaspati confer happi- 
ness and welfare on the sacrificer) occur as the last quarter 
of all the three verses. 'Sam' by itself occurs about 160 times 
in the Bgveda and it is somewhat remarkable that in Rg. VII. 
35. 1-13 "32 the word sam occurs in each verse from 4 to 7 times 
(68 times in all). ftg.I H4.1"33 « we bring thege lauds to 

Rudrawho is powerful, who has braided hair, who rules over 
valiant men, so that there may result welfare to our two-footed 
and four-footed beings and every thing in this village may be 
prosperous and free from distress' will bring out the import of 

1132. Verses 1-10 of Rg. VII 35 are Ihe same as Atbarva 19.10 1-10.

'sam'. In some oases 'sam' and 'yoh' clearly appear to bo 
employed like nouns in the objective case For example, Jig. 
H. 33. 13 «m " I hanker after tho ' sam ' and ' yoh ' of Rudra ( i. o. 
under the power of Rudra), Rg. 1.114.2 "ORudra! may wo 
secure by your guidance that ' sam ' and ' yoh ' that father Manu 
procured through sacrifice". Yaska (Nirukta IV. 21) while 
dealing with Rg. X 15. 4 * atha, nah sam yor-arapo dadhata ' 
holds 'samyoh' to he ablative or genitive of samyu and explains 
as 'samanam ca roganam yavanam ca bhayunam' { allaying of 
diseases and warding off of dangers). This is an etymological 
explanation and is in some cases acceptod by Sayana and in 
others he paraphrases ' sam ' by ' sukha ' (happiness) and ' yoh ' as 
'duhkha-viyoga' (freedom from pain or distress) The word 
'yoh' presents the appearance of tho ablative or genitive 
singular of a noun from the root ' yu ' which means ' to bind ' or 
' separate ' or from ' y3 ' to go. 'Yoh ' by itself occurs only three 
times in the Rgveda ( i. e in I. 74. 7, X. 105 3, X 176. 3 ). The 
meaning of * yoh' in these three cases is doubtful In the Tai. 
Br. 1135 we have thd mantra 'we choose that happiness and wel- 
fare and success ( or progress ) to the sacrifice and the sacrificer , 
may divine fortune be ours; let there be good fortune for (our) 
men; may medioine (or remedy) go up, may there be happiness 
to our men and quadrupeds '. 

In Atharvaveda 19. 9 the word sSnti occurs about 17 times. 
In verses 3 to 5 speech ( vak ), the mind ( manah ) lS3S and the five 
senses are referred to and it is said that these seven usually 
produce what is glioia ( terrible or inauspicious ) and these same 
must exert themselves for producing santi ( i. e. appeasement of 
angered deities or averting calamities or misfortunes). Verses 
6-11 pray to several gods, planets ( grahah ), the earth, falling 
stars, cows, the naksatras, magical rites, Rahu, Dhumaketu 
(comets), the Rudras.Vasus and Sdityas, sages and Brhaspati 
to confer happiness Verse 12 prays to Indra, Brahma, and all

the gods for refuge to the composer of the hymn and 13 declares 
that 'whatever things were appeased (by santis) in this world — 
these the seven sages know. May they all be happiness for me ; 
may happiness be mine and may freedom from fear be mine'. 
Verse 14 which is similar to Vaj. S. 36. 17 declares that ' the earth, 
mid-regions, heaven, waters, trees and plants, all gods-these have 
become appeased and auspicious by the santi rites performed by 
the composer and that by those santis, by all santis I ( we ) 
appease ( remove the evil effect of ) what is here terrible, what is 
cruel ( or inauspicious ), what is evil; may all that be appeased, 
be beneficial and happy for us , ." 37 Atharva 19. 10 (verses 1-10) 
contains the woTd 'sam' 51 times and prays for welfare to 
several gods and 19. 11 is also a santi containing the word 'sam' 
18 times. The Vajasaneya-samhita chapter 36 ( verses 8-12 ) 
similarly contain the word ' sam ' several times One of these 
via. ( Taj. S. 36. 12 ) occurs in many Vedio texts 1138 'May the 
divine waters confer on us happiness, help and protection; may 
they flow towards us for our our happiness and welfare*. 

IntheTai. S. the words 'samayati' and 'santi' are fre- 
quently used often in the same passage or context. For example, 
it is said " Rudra 1139 is the fierce ( or harsh ) one among gods... ; 
He (the priest) does as it were a harsh thing when he recites 
(that passage containing the word) Rudra; 'in the path of 
Mitra'hesaysfor the sake of appeasing". There is a similar 
passage in the Ait. Br. While _prescribing the recital of a rk 
verse ( Rg. II. 33. 1 ) in the Agnimaruta-sastra the Ait. Br. 
changes the original words of the latter half of the verse in the 
Bgveda and also suggests another verse altogether for recital

( I 43. 6 ' 6am nah karatyarvate sugam mesaya mesye nrbhyo 
naribhyo gave ' ) because in the first place that verse begins with 
the auspicious word ' sam* and in the second place because tbat 
verse, though the deiata (deity) thereof is Eudra, does not 
expressly mention that word; the result, says the Ait Br , is that 
that verse being one of appeasement (santi) the priest secures 
long life and procures long life for the sacrificer 

Another example of ' samayati in the Tai S is as follows : 
When an agnihotrm is going on a journey with his household he 
should offer homa to Vastospati, but if he goes without offering 
a homa to Vastospati evil consequences follow , ' Eudra is indeed 
Vastospati; if he were to go out without offering boma to 
Vastospati, Agni would become Eudra, would leap after him and 
kill him ; ( but ) when he offers to Vastospati, he appeases him 
( Eudra-Agni ) with his own share and the sacrificer meets no 
injury ( or distress )'. 1140 

Another example of 'samayati' and 'santi' in the Tai S 
( VL 3 3 3-3 ) may be set out. 'O tree ' protect it, O axe 1 do 
not harm it; the axe indeed is a thunderbolt, (therefore he utters 
those words ) for allaying ( the fierce power of the axe ) ; these 
worlds are afraid of the tree ( of which the yupa is made ) when 
it moves; (therefore he recites 'with thy top do not graze the 
sky, with thy middle do not harm the atmospheric region'. ( By 
these words ) he appeases ( removes the terrible power for evil of) 
this tree'. 1141 

The foregoing passages are quite sufficient for showing the 
significance attached to the words 'sam', ' samayati' and 'santi' 
in the Vedio samhitas The word 'santama' occurs in the 
Egveda about two dozen times It is applied to the great gods 
like Agni, India, Soma (116 7, L 77 2, IX. 104 3), to the 
praises of gods ( I 76 1, VL 32. 1 ), to the worshipper or singer 
(VHX13. 22), to protection by gods (V 76. 3, X. 15. 4) and 
generally means "beneficent or conferring happiness*. Simi-

The riieaning of ' samayali ' 723 

larly, the word 'santati* (Bg. I. 113. 20, VIE. 18.7) means 
'beneficent'. 

The causal ( samayati ) of the verb ' sam ' and the word 
'santi* do not occur in the Bgveda, but they are as said above 
frequently employed in the Taittirlya and other Samhitas and in 
the Brahmanas. Some further examples may be set out here. 
The Tai. S. relates the following legend " Agni was in the yonder 
worid (heaven), the sun was in this world; these worlds were 
(then) unappeased( disturbed). The gods said 'come, let us 
change ( transpose ) these two'. They placed Agni in this world 
with the words ' Agni, come here for the dainty meal' and 
(placed ) the Sun in the yonder world with the worlds ' the great 
and powerful one, O Agni ' ; then indeed these two worlds became 
free from disturbance. Since he repeated those words in this 
way, it served for the purpose of quieting these worlds (that were 
once disturbed ). These worlds became undisturbed ( auspicious) 
for him who knows thi3". li42 Here we have both the verbal form 
' asamyatama' (from ' sam' 4th conj.) and the the word ' santyai '. 

In some passages of the Rgveda the word ' sami ' occurs { as 
in I. 87. 5, 11.31. 6, III. 55. 3, Vm. 45. 27, X. 40. 1.). It is 
generally interpreted by SayaDa in these passages as the locative 
singular of ' sami', which is explained to mean ' karman ' ( action, 
sacrifice or the like). Two of these may be cited here M13 "my 
desires fly in many directions; I shall brighten ancient (lauds) 
towards 'sami* (for employing them in various sacrifices?); 
knowing the truth in Turvasa (king) and Tadu (king) he 
(Indra) enveloped Ahnavayya (their enemy) in warlike action." 
« is possible to take 'sami' as the locative singular of *sam' 
treated as a noun. The word ' sami* occurs in many passages 
of the Rgveda ( L 20. 2, I 83. 4, 1. 110. 4, H. 1. 9, HI 60. 3, IV. 
^ "• ". IV. 22. 8, IV. 33. 4, V. 77. 4, V. 42. 10, VI 3. 2, 
TttS ll, VM. 75. 14, EL 74 . 7, X 28. 12). In all these passages

Sayana interprets it as 'karma' and not as the 'saml tree or 
branch'. But in one place at least ( if not in more places ) the 
word saml can easily be held to mean * the saml wood or fuel- 
stick'. 1141 'To that mortal who worships with sacrifices and 
appeases with' samls' (saml fuel-sticks) and gives offerings to 
Agni that abounds in wealth disappointment as to glory never 
comes nor does sin nor arrogance overtake him ' 

The whole of chapter 36 of the Vajasaneya-samhita is 
employed as santi at the beginning and end of the Pravargya 
rite, according to Eat. Si. S 26 41 * santikararjam-adyantayoh'; 
verses 9-12 of Vaj. S 36 employ the word ' sam ' 17 times and 
verse 9 is the same as Rgveda L SO. 9. 

An interesting text in connection with the root 'sam' is the 
adhngu praisa, to be recited by the Hotr priest before the 
pasu is killed in a sacrifice Vide H. of DL vol II p. 
1121 note 2501 for the formula which is rather long. The 
important 1145 words for the present purpose are at the beginning 
and at the end ' divine slayers and human slayers 1 begin ( the 
process of killing the pasu) ...0 Adhrigul you should slay 
( the paiu ) in such a way that it would be properly carried out'. 
Here the root (sam) certainly means to slay, this meaning is, 
however, apparently quite different from the one so far con- 
sidered (viz to appease, to remove evil effects). But it may be 
that there is a secondary meaning, viz appease the gods by 
offering parts of the animal killed in the sacrifice 

The Taittirlya-brahmana closely connects the saml tree or 
branch with the conjuring away or appeasing the terrible or 
angry aspects of deities in the following myth 1M6 "Prajapati

created Agni; he(Prajapati) became afraid ' this Agni might 
burn me'. He (Prajapati) pacified (the terrible flame or glow of) 
Agni with sami (branch); that is the beneficent or happy aspect 
of sami in that the equipment required for Agni is full of sami 
in order to appease Agni and for freedom from being burnt 
thereafter.' The idea is that Agni, the moment it was created 
had a fierce and evil aspect, that was removed by the use of the 
sami and santi means an action or rite that appeases the evil 
aspects of a deity and makes the deity beneficent. Similarly, 
the AitaTeya-brShmana says : 1147 "He recites the verse 'they 
worship you with offerings whatever abodes you may have; . he 
says :0 Soma 1 move towards houses in such a way as not to 
kill the sons (of the sacrificer).' Houses are indeed called 
"durya' and the house of the sacrificer is afraid of the king 
Soma when he approaches the sacrificer's house; when he (the 
priest) repeats this (verse) he thereby appeases him (king Soma) 
by a santi ( propitiatory rite ) ; he ( Soma ) becoming beneficent 
( by the respetition of the mantra ) does not kill the progeny or 
the cattle ( of the sacrificer )." The idea is that king Soma might 
be angry with the sacrificer if there be any defect in the sacri- 
ficial rite and that when the hotr priest repeats the verse 
' avlraha o-' that verse is the cause of appeasement. 

In the Satapatha-brShmana there is a similar reference to 
the appeasing power of the sami branch. " He ( the priest ) 
places fuel sticks on this (Agni) ...He places (on Agni) a 
fuel stick of sami as the first This ( Agni ) was kindled 
when this oblation ( of sami branch ) was offered and flamed 
upwards. The gods became afraid of him (Agni) lest Agni. 
might harm them. They (gods) saw this sami branch and 
appeased him ( Agni ) with that; inasmuch as they appeased this 
I Agm ) by means of sami ( branch ) this is called sami. In the 
same way tins sacrificer appeases with sami this (Agni) for 
Procuring appeasement and not for food""* It would be noticed

that here the name ' saml ' is derived from the root ' sam * and it 
is the means of effecting santi ( appeasement ). 

In the Brahmanas the means of appeasement are Tariou3 
but simple Often times the recitation of a Vedic verse or hymn 
effects santi. Ibr example, the Taittirlya-brahmana lia 
prescribes the singing of sarnans at the time of consecrating tbe 
sacred =rauta fires ; the three samans are Rafhantara, Yamadevya 
and Brhat, each bsing connected with the three worlds respec- 
tively. ""When Agni is being taken out, he sings the 
Yamadevya saman; Yamadevya is the atmospheric region and 
thereby (i e, by singing Yamadevya) he makes Agni established 
in the atmospheric region; Yamadevya is santi (means of bring- 
ing about the appeasement of Agni ) ; ( on singing Yamadevya ) 
he takes out Agni that has become appeased ( beneficent ) and as 
bestower of cattle". The TaL S. says 1150 "he says 'weave ye 
with regular measure the work of the singers '. "Whatever super- 
fluity ( or flaw ) is committed in the sacrifice, this (recitation ) 
serves to eradicate it3 evil effects". The Ait Br. provides 
"(the priest) who is about to sprinkle holy water over 
him i5SI (the king) should (himself first recite the mantra and) 
make the king repeat it ( after him ) ' O Waters ' look on me with 
a beneficent eye, (and) touch my skin with (your) beneficent 
body. I invoke all the Agnis that dwell in waters for your sake; 
this should be done for the purpose that waters ( the evil aspects 
of which have been ) not appeased may not destroy the vigour of 
him who is being sprinkled over ". The Hotr performs a japa 
before and after reciting the samidhenl verses. About this the 
Sankhayana-brahmana says'' 152 that the samidhenls are a thun-

Water also is declared as a means of effecting the removal

material ( milk or rice ) when put on a fire for cooking spurts out 
or overflows ? ( The reply is ) "he should make it go down with 
water for the sake of santi ; water indeed is ( a means of ) santi 
and then he should touch the material ( that has fallen out ) 
with his right hand and recite a mantra ( that is specified ) or he 
Bhould recite another rk verse * by whose power the worlds are 
made fixed', which is addressed to Visnu andVaruna; Yisnu 
indeed is the saviour against what is badly sacrificed ( i. e. the 
defects in it ), while Varuna protects ( i. e prevents obstacles to 
securing the fruit of ) what is well sacrificed ; ( this latter mantra 
is recited ) for santi in regard to both ( defects as well as good 
points ). This is the prayascitti in this case." It should be 
noticed that here santi (rite ) and prayascitti are identified. The 
Sankh&yana 11Si Br. also (HI. 6) says "waters are (means of) 
santi, (they are) an antidote and therefore after pronouncing 
the word 'vasat' the priest touches water." In the Tai. Ax. 
( IV. 42 ) there are 37 mantras of santi used in the Pravargya 
rite. Some of these occur in the Bgveda-samhita, e. g the 8th 
(Vataavatubhesajam) is Bg. X. 186. 1, mantras 15-17 are 
equal to Eg. IV. 31. 1-3 ; mantras ZZ-U are Bg. X 9. 1-3. The 
same Aianyaka (IV. 26-35) and Baud. Sr. S. IX. 18 contain 
several mantras for santis, some of which are interesting and 
are set out here to Bhow how the theory of santis was being 
expanded or enlarged. "If the lsss sacrificial vessel called

mahavba (inPravargyarite) of the hot milk for the Gharma 
offering were to be stolen by a thief, one should offer in the 
Garhapatya fire an oblation of ghee -with the sruva ladle to the 
accompaniment of the mantra ' May Day and Night disclose 
thee as thief ". 'Ha wild 1156 forest dog were to bark ( while the 
Pravargya rite is on ), the priest should repeat by way of a 
magic formula the text 'vigalndra vicaran spaSayasva' (O 
Indra, observe the cows while you move about'), should oast a 
kindled firebrand on both sides with the words ' O Agni, converse 
with Agni, and then he worships Agni with the words 'O Agni, 
salutation to thee once, twice, thrice &c ' If a vulture screeches 
he recites the formula 'you are undistmguishable (from other 
birds ) since you have blood m your beak", if an owl or she-owl 
hoots he recites the mantra ' In this way the owl approaches 
&c. '. Therefore it may be said that santi is used in the early 
Vedic texts in several senses viz. ( 1 ) the state of being freed 
from evil aspects or effects, (3) means of appeasing or removing 
evil aspects, such as water, a Vedic verse or hymn, (3) rite for 
appeasement. 

Apart from the simple santis for appeasing deities in sacri- 
ficial matters, even the Rgveda contains indications that there 
were other occurrences which were thought to be unlucky and 
against the supposed evil effects of which some remedies were 
employed For example, $g X. 164 { 1-5 ) is a hymn declared 
by the AnukramanI and Rgvidhana IV. 30 1 as counteracting 
the indications of bad dreams' 1157 Verse 3 of it is 'May Agni 
place far away from us all evil and undesirable actions which 
we may have done while awake or asleep whether by our desires 
or imprecations or want of desire'. In$g. V 82 4-5 1M8 the

Remedies against bad dreams and cries of birds 729 

poet prays ' O God Savitr 1 today produce for us welfare endowed 
with progeny and frighten away the effects of bad dreams ; 
God Savitr I drive away all sins (or evils) and confer on us 
what is beneficent ' ( or auspioious ). In Rg. II. 28 10 the poet 
prays ' king Varuna I whoever, whether a helper or a friend, 
declares to me who ascertained a danger (from what I saw ) in a 
dream or whoever, a thief or a wolf, intends to harm me, from 
that guaTd us' In Rg. VIII. 47. 15 the sage exclaims ' we deliver 
all our bad dreams to Trita Uptya, your kindness cannot be 
obstructed by any one, the protection given by you is good '. 
Vide also $g. VHI 47 14, 16-18, X 36. 4, X. 37, 4 for bad 
dreams. Similarly, the Rgveda contains verses whioh show 
that cries of birds were deemed to indicate coming good or evil 
and the hooting of the owl was thought to be unlucky. 'It 1IS9 
(the bird ) frequently cries and proolaims what is to come and it 
propels his speech as an oarsman propels a boat; O bird! May 
you be auspicious to us; may no overpowering (or unfavourable) 
phenomenon reach you from any side'. The three verses of Rg. 
n. 43 refer to the cries of birds. ' The birds, chirping, utter cries 
towards the south ( of the house ) like composers of songs that 
speak for food at various seasons; Obird! when you chirp, 
speak what would be to out welfare, when you are silent think of 
good thoughts about us; when flying up ( from our house ) you 
utter (cries) like a lute; may we be endowed with valiant sons 
and speak much in assemblies'. &g. X. 165 contains several 
verses about a kapota bird and one about an owl Rg. X. 165. 1 
and4aia:Mo • a kapota bird, messenger of ill-luck, 'has come

bird ( expresses ) by placing its feet near our Agni( be untrue); 

here is salutation toYama, the god of Death, whose messenger is 

this (bird) sent (by the god ) '. The Sivalayana-grhya provides 

'if a kapota (pigeon) strikes against a house (enters it) or 

flies along its length, the house-holder should offer into fire 

oblations (of ghee) with each verse of the hymn ('devah 

kapota', Rg. X. 165) or he should recite it inaudibly'. The 

Kausltaki-grhya provides for the same ( in V 5. 1-2 ) and 

proceeds ,161 " if a man sees a bad dream or when the cawing of 

a crow is heard in the night and in the case of other adbhutai 

( untoward or unusual occurrences ) he should cook rice grains 

in the milk of a cow that has a calf of the same colour ( as 

itself) but in no case of a black cow and let him sacrifice with the 

hymn to Night (Rg. X. 127) verse by verse and having partaken of 

the remnants of the oblations with the maltavyatiTtts and having 

recited over his ears the verse ' bhadram katnebhih* ( Rg. X 89.8) 

and over himself the verso 'satam-in-nu' (Rg I. 89. 9) donate 

something to the brahmanas". The Sankhayana-grhya (V. 6, 

7, 10 and 11) provides : " if a disease befalls a person, he should 

offer boiled Gavedhuka grains with the hymn' these prayers to 

the powerful Eudra' &c verse by verse (Rg. L114). If the 

honey bees make honey in a man's house, he should fast 

and sacrifice a hundred and eight pieces of udumbara wood 

besmeared with curds, honey and ghee with two verses Rg. 1.114. 

8-9 and murmur the hymn (Rg. VII. 35) and if an ant-hill arises 

in his house the house should be abandoned and having fasted 

three nights ( and days ) he should perform the 'Mahasanti'. 1162

fen dreams and tantifor them 73 i 

TheAitareya-Aranyaka mentions tan dreams viz a person sees 
a dark man with black teeth and snoh a man kills him, or a boar 
Mils him, or an ape jumps on him, the wind carries him 
swiftly; having swallowed gold, he vomits it; he eats honey; he 
chews stalks of lotuses; he carries a single (red) lotus; he 
drives with a team of asses or boars; himself wearing a wreath 
of rcatafo flowers," 63 he drives towards the south a black cow 
having a black calf. If a man sees any one of these, he should 
fast, cook a dish of rice in milk in a vessel, offer into . fiw 
oblations thereof with each of the verses of the hymn to Night 
(Rg X 137. 1-8), feed brahmanas with other food { cooked in the 
house) and should himself eat boiled rice * .«" The same Aranyaka 
' mentions in the same context some unusual phenomena such as 
the sun appearing like the moon (pale and without heat) or 
the sky becoming like madder and prescribes the recital of some 
Bgvedic verses ( such as IX. 67. 21-37, VIII. 6. 30, IX 113. 6-11, 
1 50. 10 ). 

The Chandogya "dp. contains a verse saying ' if a person 
engaged in rites for securing a certain desired object sees a 
woman in a dream, one should understand on seeing such a 
sight that he will prosper ( i. e. secure that object ).' 11Ma The 
Chandogya Upanisad (YDX 10.1), the Brhadaranyaka TJpanisad 
(IV. 3. 7-30 ) and Prasna IV. 5 contain profound thoughts on 
the psychology of dream phenomena, but as that discussion 



1163. In the Asv. Sr. (quoted in H._of Dh. vol IV p. 203 n. 481 ) it ia 
provided that the corpse of an ahttagnt is to be decked with a wreath of 
mladas. The south is the direction of thepitrs, vide Satapatha Br. I. 2. S, 
17 ( esa vai dik pitrnam' ) Therefore, to see in a dream oneself wearing a 
wreath of naladas or driving towards the south was deemed to forebode death,

The Atharvaveda also has several verses on dreams and on 
birds like lapota ( pigeon }. The Kausikasutra prescribes several 
verses of the Atharvaveda as Mantis in the case of dreams . ' on 
Beeing a dream a man washes his face with the verses (Atharva 

VI. 45. 1 and 46. 1 ), if he sees a very terrible dream he offers 
into fire a cake of mixed grains 1165 or in another direction (in 
his enemy's field); he changes the side on which he sleeps 
with Atharva VII. 100. 1 ; on seeing himself eating in a dream 
he recites the mantra ( Atharva VIL 101. 1 ) and he looks on; 
with the verse 'vidmate' ( Atharva VI. 46. % ) all (dreams) 
vanish.' Two of these verses may be set out here • * dream 1 we 
know the place of thy birth, thou art the son of gods' sisters; 
thou art the helper of Yama, thou art the destroyer; thou art 
death, dream 1 we know thee to he so; O dream ! do thou save 
us from evil dreams ' ; ' I turn round ( and he on my other side ) 
from evil dreaming, from bad dreaming, from ill-luck; I make 
brahman ( vedic prayer ) my defence ; I put away the sorrows 
that come through dreams' 1167 The Katyayana-srauta-sutra 
prescribes a similar verse for japa when a dV.sita sees a dis- 
agreeable dream 118s

The same santi tn Ap.for malty adbhutas 733 

The Apastamba-gihya (8. 23.9) lumps together several 

unusual appearances and provides the same santi in the case of 

all, * H the post of a man's house puts forth shoots, or if honey 

is made in his house by bees or if the footprint of a pigeon is 

seen on the hearth or if disease arises in his family, or in the 

case of other miracles and prodigies, let him perform on the 

newmoon night, at dead of night, at a place where he does not 

hear the sound of water, the rites from the putting of wood on 

the fire to the Ijyabhaga oblations indicated in the next ( Apas- 

tambiyamantrapatha H 2%. 14-23 ), and then perform Jaya and 

following oblations.' Very similar provisions are found in 

Jaiminlya-grhya II. 7. 1169 The Samavidhanabrahmana contains 

several prayascittas (really santis) on the happening of 

numerous incidents. A few examples are set out here ; when 

bad dreams 1170 are seen, the person should make repetition of 

Bg. V. &%, 4 twice ( i. e. in all at least six times ) ; in the case of 

any other prognosticatory occurrence not known from any work 

the person should repeat twice the verse Rg. IV. 31. 1. On

enemies) would not kill him. If one's house were to be burnt 1171 
( accidentally ) one should offer oblations anointed with ghee with 
the mantra ' born with the highest Dharman ' ( SSmaveda no 90 ) 
and with words ' svaha to Agni ' In H % 2 The Samavidhana Br. 
prescribes a santi for one seized or posessed by an evil spirit. A 
portion of Sadvimsabrahmana (viz V 1-10) is styled Adbhufca- 
brahmana and contains santis for several kinds of utpataB Some 
parts of it (such as V 2-3) correspond with Asvalayana-grhya 
-parisista, 4 11-15 The Sadvimsa-brahmana V. 7. 2 provides 
for earthquakes and cracks in palaces, which are similar to Yoga- 
yatra 3. 13 The Atharvaveda 19. 9. 9 refers to showers of fall- 
ing stars (naksatramulkabhibatam sam-astu nah) and Sad- 
vimsa V 9. 2. refers to falling meteors and V 10. 2 to images 
laughing, weeping &c 

Reasons of space forbid further description of santis from 
the grhya-sutras 

The preceding discussion with regard to santis is enough to 
show that santis were prescribed in the Vedic literature, the 
srautasutras, Samavidhana-brahmana and Bgvidhana, not only 
for appeasing the angry divinities or powers of evil, but also for 
occurrences like bad dreams or of portentous phenomena like the 
sun's or moon's appearance, the cries of unlucky birds &c. 

This subject about santis against all sorts of omens and 
portents was very much elaborated in the post- Vedic literature. 
An extensive literature on santis exists in the Grhyasutras, the 
, Kausika-sutra, the Atharvaveda Parisistas (particularly Nos.

published in the Gaikwad Oriental Series. As compared with 
some other kandas, the section on santi is meagre. It deals 
only with the following; Kurmavibhaga (the distribution 
of the countries in Bharata in 9 groups); Graha-makha or 
Grahayaga quoting Yaj. L 295-308, Matsya, Narasimha and 
Bhavisya and DevSpuiana; Ayutahoma, Kotihoma ; Pusyasnana ; 
Grahasanti; Matrsanti; Lingasanti; Vinayakasanti (quoting 
Yaj. I 271-294 and Matsya ), Grahanasnan a; Sankrantisnana; 
mrtavatsabhiseka; santis for variouas utpatas; Gayatrlhoma; 
Rudrajapavidhi; abhicarikakaTma (magic rites). It is neither 
possible nor necessary to deal with this vast mass on santi in 
this work in detail. Many of the santis described therein and in 
older srauta and other works have been almost obsolete for a long 
time. Therefore, only a few santis now in vogue or very 
interesting from several viewpoints will be dealt with in this 
section. 1172 

The Kausikasutra (chapter 13, kandikas 93-136) is con- 
cerned with adbhutas, their descriptions and the santis therefor. 
Kandika 93 brings together 42 portentous phenomena and the 
kandikss that follow deal with the description of the omen or 
portent and santis for each of these. In these santis, Atharva- 
veda ma ntras play a secondary role and the majority of the

are variously given. But they are often said to be eight Vide note 1595 
below on tantras. The Rudrayamala tantra was published by Jivananda 
containing over 6000 verses in 66 chapters in 1892. There arc works 
called Ganesayamala, Brahmayamnla, Rudra-yamala, Visnuyamala, 
Sakti-yamala, and several others. Certain gtoij ( or oadis ) of certain 
tithis, weekdays and naksatras are said bj the Smrli-kaustubha to 
be visanadts or vivaghatis (producing verj disastrous results), 
but in' astrological works certain ghatis of naksatras onlj have that appella- 
tion and a person born on those ghatis forebodes the death and loss of the 
father, the mother, wealth and himself by poisoning, arms and missiles 
(according to Dharmasmdhu p 184). The Madanaratna on Santiks (folios 
15b to 20b) sets out numerous details about all the 27 naksatras from the 
work of Atreya, one (detail) being the visaghati of each naksatra e. g as to 
Asvini three nadikas after 50th ghalika constitute visanadt, as to Bharani

Santis for adbhutas in Jtausika ?3§ 

It would be impossible for reasons of space and also of use- 
fulness to set out the santis prescribed for the above adbhutas 
in Eausika, but a few may be described by way of illustration. 
When there is an earthquake u ' 7 one should offer (oblations of 
ghee) with five verses, three of which are addressed to Jisnu 
(Visnu). Three of the verses are: "Just as the sun shines 
brightly in the heaven, Vayu dwells in the sky and Agni enters 
the earth, so may this Jisnu be firm and unmoving. As the 
rivers day and night pour their sediment ( clay or mud carried 
by them) in the sea without fail, similarly may all tribes 
( of gods ? ) with one mind approach my invocation ( or sacri- 
fice) without fail; may the Goddess (Earth) along with all 
deities be firm and unmoving for me and may ( the Goddess ) 
drive away from us all evil and pierce my enemies that hate 
me. " After having offered oblations with the words ' svalia. to 
the earth ' he should offer oblations with the verses Atharva VI. 
87. 1, VI. 88. 1 and with the verses of the anuvalw. beginning 
with Atharva XII. 1. 1. This is the prSyascitti there ( in case 
of an earthquake ). 

, ^ Where darkness seizes the sun, one should offer oblations 
With the verses ' arranging according to the season divine 
wonders, ( the sun ) rises up revolving ( driving away ) the fierce 
( aspects ) of the several seasons ; may the sun passing over these 
on all sides come; may the Waters move along in all these 
worlds. May Indra and Agni, knowing well, protect thee with 
herbs (remedies); destroy all darkness according to the cosmic 
order and by true speech.* Having offered oblations with the 
words « svaha to the sun ', he Bhould again make oblations ( in 
Agni ) with the hymn Atharva XVII. 1. He worships with the 
Eohita hymns ( Atharva XIH. 1-4 ). This is the prayaicitH in 
this case.

When the (darkness) floods the moon one should offer 
oblation into fire with the verse 1178 " Rahu creeps over the 
'shining king (the moon), the former (Eahu) strikes him (the moon) 
here (i.e. before us), a thousand of his (Rahu's) bodies are to 
he destroyed; may (his) one hundred bodies perish ! '. Having 
offered oblations with the words ' svaha to the Moon ', he should 
offer oblations with the hymn 'Sakadhumam naksatrani yad- 
rajanam-akurvata' (Atharva VI. 138. 1). This is the prayasoitta 
in this case 1179 

In connection with santis three words require to be carefully 

I "understood viz. adbhuta, utpata and mmiita. Adbhuta is an 

' ancient word. It occurs several times in the Rgveda and is 

r generally applied to some gods in the sense of * wonderful'. In 

"Some passages, however, it means •future' and possibly also 

.'portentous' For example, according to Firukta I. 5 1180 the 

: sage Agastya first promised to offer an offering to Indra, but 

, later he desired to offer the same to the Maruts, that then Indra 

came to Agastya and complained to him as m Eg. I 170. 1 

(what was promised today) even that does not exist, nor will it 

(the hams) be there (for me) tomorrow; who knows (for certain)

which latter is 'gifrsiST gg^t -HtflUM ^auMuai^ qferUPT ftmars-

joints dried cowdung cakes were placed I Cbarpentier has an interesting 
paper on SPRtgyi in Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies (London ) for 
1935 pp 449-450 where he states that various scholars have given different 
meanings, viz constellation, dung smoke, weather prophet (Bloomfield), Agni 

"(Caland), milky way and himself that it means 'Krttika ' It does not clearly 
appear how, conceding that 5T5PJJT stands for $hHi, a »t(g<uf could be 
called f&iK*{ in Efitfire: 50 15 and on what grounds According to Psmni

Meaning of aShuta, utpata and nimitta ?«■ 

£fiS .£p*£-». whether already perforW or to be 
performed'. TJg.X.105.7 is perhaps a little clearer than the 
SS '(May Indra reduce our sins) Iudra W ho as golden- 
bearded who has tawny horses, whose jaw is never broken and 

bolt like the sky that is wonderful (or Ml of por tents) . The 
' word usually employed in the G&yasutras is adbhula and the 
Santis are called ' adbhuta&ntis '. Adbhuta is a word of very 
general import. It includes not only such serious phenomena as 
earth-quakes, eclipses, comets, falling stars but such compara- 
tively minor yet unexpected or unusual happenings as a cow 
yielding blood-red milk or a cow sucking the udder of another 
cow. The anoient writer Vrddha-Garga defines ' adbhuta' as 
any occurrence that had not occurred before or a total change 
coming over what has occurred before." 82 The 67th Atharvana- 
'parisistais called Adbhutasanti (pp. 432-435). It distributes 
'adbhatas' into seven groups relating to Indra, Varuna, Yama, 
Agni, Kubera, Visnu and Vayu and names some adbhutas under 
each such as a rainbow at night (relating to Indra), a vulture or 
owl alighting on a man's house or a kapota entering it ( relating . 
to Yama), smoke without Are (relating to Agni), eclipse on the 
naksatra of a man's birth (relating to Visnu) and prescribes as 
sSnti the japa of Atharvasiras, making hrShmanas say ' svasti »' 
honouring and feeding brahmanas. That parisista 1b based on 
the AdbhutahrahmaDa of the SSmaveda. 

The word 'utpata* is rare in the Srauta or Grhya sutras.

containing thousands of omens and observes that from about 700 3. C. 
systematic observational reports were made "by astronomers to the royal

select a learned, well-conducted brahmana as his purohta, 
provides that the king should give heed to what astrologers and 
interpreters of omens tell (him) and that the purohita should 
perform santi rites, rites for prosperity (such as vaBtu-homa) 
and magic rites ( on behalf of the king 1183 ). But in the Puranas 
and the medieval Sanskrit works it is far more frequent than 
the word adbhuta; sometimes adbhuta and utpata are used as 
synonyms. Garga says 1184 ' deities become unfavourable owing 
to the wrong doings of men and create extraordinary happen- 
ings in the sky, atmospheric region and on the earth. These 
are the utpatas for all worlds created by gods; these utpatas 
sally forth for the destruction (of people) and they by their 
(terrific) appearances rouse people (to do what is proper.)'. Here 
the words 'adbhuta' and 'utpata' are used as synonyms- 
Similarly, Matsya (228. 1-2) appears to regard the two words 
as synonyms. 1185 Generally, however, the word utpata denotes 
ccurrences that portend evil to all Amarakosa treats ' ajanya*, 
'utpata' and 'upasarga' as synonyms. Utpata is defined by 
Garga, Varahamihira 1186 and Atharva-parisista LXIV as the

Nimitta and utpata 743 

reverse of the visual natural order. Nimitta means, according 
to Amarakosa (nimittam hetulaksmanoh) ' cause or prognostic 
sign'. Nimitta may be auspicious or inauspicious. This is one 
distinction between utpata (which generally denotes an unlucky 
portent) and nimitta. There is another distinction. Nimitta 
is often restricted to the throbbing of a person's limbs (as in 
Matsya chap. 341), though here and there it is used in a wider 
sense as in Glta (131) {'nimittani ca pasyami viparltani 
Kesava' Kesaval I see adverse omens), Ramayana, Ayodhya- 
kanda. 4 17-19, Bhlsma-parva 2. 16-17, Virata 46. 30, Atharva- 
parisista LXEV (TJtpata-laksana) 10. 9-10. «® It may he noted 
that Manu VI. 50 mentions 'utpata' and 'nimitta' separately 
(p. 527 note 758). 

Examples of unfavourable happenings (nimittas or utpatas) 
occur plentifully in the Mahabharata, Sahhaparva 80. 28-31, 
81. 22-25, Vanaparva 179. 41, 224. 17-18, Virata .39. 4-6,

(mrghata), meteors, she-jackals howling towards the Bouth, 
fierce and dry wind with shower of sand; earth-quakes; sun 
eclipse at an unusual time ( Ramayana HL 23. 12, Sabha 80. 29, 
81. 23 Salya 56. 10, Bhisma 3. 28 ); flashes of lightning without 
clouds; carnivorous hirds like vultures and crows on temples; 
fort-walls and bastions, spontaneous fire; rent banners; halo of 
the sun and moon; river- flowing with bloody waters; rain with- 
out clouds, rain of blood or mud ; trumpeting of elephants ; sky 
filled with darkness, horses shedding tears; peals of thunder in a 
clear sky, rivers flowing in reverse direction; throbbing of the 
left arm and eye (in men), croaking of frogs; sea lashed into 
fury; images of gods trembling, dancing, laughing or weeping 
(Bhisma 112 11); pale sun, birds like pigeons and matnas and 
deer weeping with face towards the sun ; appearance of a headless 
trunk near the sun; strange births such as ass born of a cow, 
mouse born of an ichneumon (Yuddhakanda 35. 30). The 
auspicious signs described in the epics, aTe comparatively few as 
in Balakanda22.4,ndyoga83 23-26,84 117, Bhisma 3. 65-74, 
Sknti 52. 25, Asvamedhika 53. 5-6 The principal auspicious 
signs are. clear sky without clouds, wind blowing 1188 cool 
and pleasant to the skin, no dust raised, birds and animals 
proceeding to a man's right side, fire without being enveloped 
in smoke and with flames turned towards the right, shower of 
flowers, auspicious birds like casa, krauiica, peacock sending up 
chirpings to the right ( Kama 72. 12-13 ) 

The omens and portents mentioned in the two epics are 
generally described as occurring at certain important times and 
events, e. g on the eve of battles or when Dasaratha proposed 
that Rama be crowned as yuiaraja, or when Pandavas startad 
on their exile into the forest or when Bhisma was anointed as 
commander-in-chief of the Kaurava hosts or when Arjuna vowed 
that he would kill Jayadratha before sunset There is no grada- 
tion or order in mentioning the omens and portents in these two 
works, but they are set out pell-mell Untimely rain, thunder 
without clouds, croaking of frogs are on the same level and

uttered in the same breath with eclipses. But Garga," 69 

ParSsara, Sabha-parva, Brhatsamhita 45. 2, Matsyapurana 229.5, 

Atham-parisistaLXCX (1.2) and other works divide utpatas 

into three classes, rh.divya (arising from heavenly bodies), 

antariksa (springing in the sky or atmospheric region) and 

bhauim (that appear on the earth). This classification is ancient 

enough. The Atharvaveda 1190 expressly refers to the three 

classes of utpatas ' May the earthly and atmospheric utpatas and 

the planets moving in heaven confer welfare on us'. The 

Brhatsamhita 1191 says that it is the king's business to arrange 

forsantisin his kingdom for counteracting (the consequences 

of portents). Garga 1192 declared that those who, when advised 

by brabmanas for performing lantis, perform auspicious rites 

with faith do not suffer defeat, but that those who having no 

faith or because of atheism or resentment do not perform rites 

for counteracting (omens) perish in a short time. Garga, the 

Brhatsamhita, Matsya 229. 6-9, Agni 263. 12-13 furnish 

examples of the three kinds of utpatas, 1193 viz. the divya ones aTe 

concerned with the abnormal conditions of planets and naksatras, 

eclipses, comets; those of atmospheric regions are hurricanes, 

unusual clouds, fall of meteors, twilights, preternatural reddish 

appearances of the quarters, halo, 3?ata Morgana ( appearance of 

illusory town in the air), Tainbow and strange rainfall (such as

of blood-red water, or fall of rain with fishes, tortoises &c.)i 
those of the earth are earth-quake and unusual states of water 
reservoirs. The Brhatsamhita remarks that the evil conse- 
quences of earthly (bkauma) utpatas when counteracted with 
santis are removed, the evil consequences of utpatas from the 
atmospheric regions are reduced to a mild form (by santis), 
while, according to some ( aoaryas like Kasyapa, saysTJtpala) 
divya utpatas are not counteracted by santis at all; the opinion 
of Varahamihira himself appears to be that the consequences of 
even divya utpatas are conjured away by the gifts of plenty of 
gold, food, cows and land and by spilling the milk of cows on 
the ground or in a Eudra temple and by performing Kotthoma. 
Varahamihira and Matsya further provide that daiva utpata 
has evil effects (lit. bears fruit ) in eight ways, viz on the king 
himself, his son, his treasury, his conveyances (horses, elephants 
&o,), his capital, his queen, purohita and his people 1W1 

.Numerous santis bearing different names are prescribed in 
Matsya, by Varahamihira and others. The 18 santis prescribed 
in Matsya (228) 1Ws and bearing the names of several gods 
will be briefly mentioned here Abhaya-siLnti is prescribed 
when a king desires to be a conqueror or when he is attacked by 
enemies or when he fears that witchcraft has been practised 
against him or when he desireB to uproot his enemies or when 
a great danger threatens The Sdumya santi is prescribed when 
a man is attacked by Tuberculosis or is weak owing to wounds 
or when a man desires to perform a sacrifice. When there is 
an earthquake or when there is a famine of food or there is 
excessive rain or drought or there is danger of locusts or when 
thieves are operating the Vatsnavi santi is prescribed ; JEtaudri 
santi is employed against an epidemic among cattle or human 
beings or when ghosts appear or when a coronation is to take 
place or when there is fear of an invasion or there is treachery 
in one's kingdom, or when enemies aTe to be killed; Brahml 
santi is performed when it is feared that Veda study would

perish or when atheism prevails or where honour is paid to 
persons unworthy of it ; if strong winds Mow for more than 
three days and disease spreads due to vata, then Vwjavi santi 
should he performed; Varum when there is fear of drought or 
there is abnormal rain ( of blood &o. ) ; Bhurgavt when there is 
danger of false accusation ; Pi ajapahja when abnormal births 
take place; Toast) I when there are abnormal conditions of 
implements; Kaumarl when santi is to be performed for 
children; Agneyl when fire shows portentous appearances; 
Gandharvl when a person is disobeyed or his wife and servants 
perish, or he desires to perform santi for horses; Ahgnasl when 
elephants are affected ; Nmi rti when danger arises from goblins ; 
Yamya when there is fear of an accident leading to death or 
a bad dream; Kauberi when wealth is lost; Parthvl when trees 
are affected by abnormal conditions ; Aindi I when portents 
happen on Jyestha naksatra or on Anuradha. 

The Agnipurana (263.7-8) refers to these 18 santis and 
says that the best santis are Amrta, Abhaya, and Saumya. 
Varahamihira mentions numerous santis on the happenings of 
several abnormal incidents. For reasons of space nothing can 
be said here about them. But one santi deserves to be set out." 95 
'If a man perceives Taksas, the astrologer should declare that 
an epidemic is very near; for counteracting them Garga per- 
formed a propitiatory rite, viz. MahSsantis, offerings, plentiful 
food, worship of Indra and Indranl.' The Brhatsamhita sets out 
(45. 82-95 ) certain happenings as not portentous when they 
happen in certain seasons and quotes several verses of Rsiputra 
which alsooocur in Matsya 239. 14-25 with some variations ; 
e. g. in Oaitra and Vaisakha the following are auspicious ( and 
not portents requiring santi) lightning, meteors, earthquake, 
wazmg twilight, noisy storms, halo, dust in sky, B moke in 
wrests, red sunrise and sunset. 






CHAPTER XXI 

r 

Individual Santis 

It is now time to turn to individual santis, mostly post-vedic. 
The first is Vinayaka-santi or Ganapatipuja. This is performed 
at the commencement of all samskaras such as upanayana and 
marriage in order that the fruit thereof may be had without obsta- 
' cles or for averting the evil effects of portents or in order to mitigate 
the adverse effects of the death of a sapinda or the like. When 
it is performed for its own sake it sbould be performed on the 
4th tithi of the bright half, on Thursday and the auspicious 
naksatras Pusya, Sravana, TJttara, RohinI, Hasta, AsvinI, Mrga- 
itfrsa, but when performed at the commencement of Upanayana 
or the like, one may. perform it at a time suited to the time of 
the principal rite. The sankalpa is given below. 11 " 6 InH. of 
Dh. vol. II pp 213-216 it has been shown how in the earliest 
stages represented by the Manava-grhya and Baijavapa-grhya 
which speak of four Vinayakas, all were evil spirits, how in the 
next stage- represented by the Yajfiavalkyasmrti (I. 271-294). 
Vinayaka is not only represented as causing obstacles ( Vighna- 
krt) but also as bringing success in all actions and rites 
( Vighnahrt) and how later on it was prescribed that Ganapati- 
puja must be done first in all rites (GobhilaI;13). YSj.I. 293 
provides 11 " that by worshipping Vinayaka in the way pres- 
cribed and also the planets, a person secures miccess in his 
undertakings and the highest prosperity. The Visnudharmottara 
II. 105. 2-24 borrows the verses of Yaj. I. 271-292, though not 
in the same order and adds a few. The Brahmanda provides 1198

that Gajanana must be worshipped for success in all desires, in 
all samkaras such as Garbbadhana and Jatakaxma, 'J>» «*«*; 
ing on a journey or engaging in a commercial undertaking, at 
the time of battle, in the worship of gods in troublous times 
The Bbavisyottara chap. 144 has a santi called Gananathasanti 
which resembles the VinayakasSnti of Y&j. 

In the Yajfiavalkya-smrti (L 294-308), the Vaikhanasa- 
smarta-sutra (IV. 13-14), the Baudhayana-grhyasesasutra 
the Matsya-purana (93. 1-105 ), the Visnudharmottara I 93-105 
and other puranas, in the Brhad-Yogayatra (chap. 18. 1-34 }, 
and in the medieval digests provision is made for a santi rite to 
the nine gralw, viz. the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Juicer, 
Venus, Saturn (mentioned in the order of the week-days), Banu 
and Ketu. This natagrahaianti is the model {prdkrti ) of all santi- 
homas in all medieval digests. The Vaikhanasa-smartasutra llw 
provides that all religious rites should be preceded by this nava- 
graha-santi. Yajfiavalkya 1200 says ' one desirous of prosperity^ of 
removing evil or calamities, of rainf all( f or crops), long life, bodily 
health andone desirous of performing magic rites against enemies 
and others should perform a sacrifice to planets.' The Matsya 
(93. 5-8 ) states that the namgraliamaklia is of three kinds, viz 
Ayutahoma (in which 10000 oblations are made ), Laksahoma 
and Kotihoma. The first is described at length in Matsya 93.; 
7-84, Laksahoma in 93. 85-118, Kotihoma in 93. 119-139. The 
Matsya further provides 1201 that Ayutahoma should be per- 
formed in marriages, festivals, sacrifices, establishment of 
images and other rites, in order that no obstacles should arise 
therein and on occasions when the mind is perturbed or when 
some evil omen or unusual event happens.

ol the three.

The procedure in Yaj. being concise and probably the 
earliest among the extant works on graJiayajila is set out here, 
with a few additions from Matsya and Vaikhanasa, The 
images of the nine planets should respectively be made of 
copper, crystal, red sandalwood, gold (for both Mercury and 
Jupiter), silver, iron, lead, bronze or (if all these be not avail- 
able) they should be drawn on a piece of cloth with powders 
having colours appropriate to each planet or should be drawn on 
circles with fragTant substances (such as sandalwood paste). 
The Matsya 1202 (93 11-12) prescribes that in drawing the 
' images the Sun should be in the middle, that Mars, Jupiter, 
Mercury, Venus, Moon, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu should be 
established with grains of rice respectively in the south, north, 
north-east, east, south-east, west, south-west and north-west. 
Yaj. (1 298 ) proceeds garments, flowers and fragrant substances

planets, also offerings should be made, guggulu is to be the 
incense for all planets and oblations of boiled rice accompanied 
with the mantras ( specified below ) should be offered respectively 
to the nine planets. 

The Visnudharmottara (1. 102. 7-10) gives the same mantras 
as Ysj. does, Bhavisya (IV. 141, 34-36) gives the same except 
for Rahu, for which it gives ' Kaya nascitra,' as in Matsya, 
Padms(V. 82. 30-32) is same as Matsya. Yaj. then proceeds 
(L 301-302 ) that in homa for each of the planets the fuel sticks 
(samidhf m were to be 108 or 28 anointed with honey or 
clarified butter or with curds or with milk and they were respec- 
tively to be of the arka plant, palasa, khadira, apamarga,

with boiled rice mixed with jaggery, or cooked in milk and sugar, 
sacrificial food (havisya), boiled rice from paddy becoming ripe 
in 60 days from sowing mixed with milk, boiled rice with curds, 
toiled rice with ghee, boiled rice with pounded sesame, rice 
mixed with meat, rice of various colours, for the sun, the moon 
and so on in order or with food that is available and according 
to his ability. The daksina (fee) to the brahmanas should

respectively of the sun, moon and so on. The Visnudharmottara 
(I; 103. 1-6 ) contains the same fees. v* He should offer Bpeoial 
worship to that planet that may be unfavourably situated (as 
regards his naksatra or horoscope) at a particular time. Yaj. 
winds up by saying that the rise and fall of kings depend on 
planets (vide note 800 for this verse). Visnudharmottara (I. 
106. 9-10) also has the same verse, Ertyakalpataru (on 
Santika, folio 5 b) quotes Bhavisya to the effect that planets 
are always favourable to him who abstains from injury to 
others, who is self-restrained, who acquires wealth by righteous 
means, and who always observes the myamas (restrictive rules 
of conduct as in Yaj. HI. 313 ). The Santimayukha ( p. 21 ) also 
quotes this verse. 

The Yaikhanasasmartasutra (IV. 13) provides slightly 
different kinds of naivedya food for the nine planets (as in note 
1205 ) and prescribes separate Vedic mantras for the presiding 
deities (of the planets) to whom oblations of ghee were to be 
offered. The Matsya remarks at the end of the description of 
Ayutahoma : ' just as armour is a protection against the wounds 
by arrows, so santi (graha-yajfia) is protection against the 
strokes of Fate.' 1207 

The Matsya (93 92) declares 1208 that Laksahoma is ten times 
of the Ayutahoma and Kotihoma is one hundred times of Laksa- 
homa in the matter of oblations, fees and rewards, that the pro- 
cedure of invoking and bidding goodbye to the planets and presid- 
ing deities, the mantras for homa, bath and gifts are the same 
in Laksahoma and Kotihoma The Matsya gives 1209 the warning

Officiating priests, devoid of (proper) fees burns the sacrificer ; 
there is no enemy as ( disastrous as ) a sacrifice and that a poor 
man should not start on a Laksahoma, since wrangling ( about 
food or fees ) in a sacrifice always causes trouble or misfortune 
(to the sacrificer). The Brhadyogayatra of Varaha (chap. 18 
verses 1-24) deals with giahayajfin and closely follows Yaj. 
though some details are added here and there. Verses about the sun 
are quoted below (n 1213). The Yogayatra also (chap. 6) deals with 
the same matter. The Agnipurana (chap. 164) is a wholesale copy 
of Yaj. ( L 295-308 ). The Matsya ( in chapter 239 ) again deals 
with Koti-homa which continues for a year. The Matsyapurana 
(chap. 94) contains nine verses on the manner in which the 
figures of the nine planets were to be drawn or painted and 
these are quoted by the Mitaksara on Yaj. I. 297-298 and by 
Krtyakalpata.ru (on santi) folio 5a. Vide Kotihoma in list of 
vratas (p. 290 ). 

The Grahayajfia in Yaj. is short and simple, but in some 
puranas such as the Bhavisyottara ( 141. 6-85 ) and medieval and 
modern works it has become an elaborate affair by the addition 
of numerous details. One or two details may be pointed out. 
Each planet was supposed to have a goteaandwas 1210 deemed 
to have been born in a certain country (vide note 875 p. 588 
for the countries of the birth of planets ). Therefore, in invoking 
the presence of each planet these two details have to be added 
(as specified below in the note for the sun by way of illustra- 
tion). The gotras of the grahas from the Sun to Ketu are 
respectively Kasyapa, Atreya, Bharadvaja, Atreya, Angirasa, 
Bnargava, Kasyapa, Paithinasa, Jaimini. The Sarhskara-tattva 
otBaghunandana (p. 946) sets out from Skanda the gotras 
and countries of birth of the nine grahas and provides that if 
worship is offered to them without mentioning the gotras and 
countries that w ould he disrespectful to them. The Grahayajna

may be simple (hevala) as in Yaj". or Ayutahoma or Laksahoma 

or Kotihoma A few further remarks are added here from the 

Agnipuarana (chap 149 ), 2farasimha-purana ( chap. 35 ), Matsya 

( chap 93 and 339 ), Bhavisyottara ( chap 141 and 143 ), Atharva- 

pariiista XXXI (for Kotihoma) and other works. The 

Krtyakalpataru 1211 (Raj'dharma) quotes the Brahma-purana 

as follows. The king should perform two Laksahomas every 

year and one Kotihoma which confers freedom from the fear of 

all calamities and he should at once perform a Mahasanti that 

removes all evil consequences when there are eclipses of the Sun 

and, the Moon and an earthquake The Agni ( 149.13 ) says 

'Ayutahoma confers slight success, Laksahoma drives away 

all distress, while Kotihoma tends to destroy all kinds of trouble 

and confers all desired objects' The Visnudharmottara (11.36. 

3-4 ) states tbat Asvapati, father of the famous pativrata Savitri 

performed a Laksahoma with the Savitri (Gayatrl) mantras 

for securing a son. ' There is no utpala in the world that is not 

conjured away by Laksahoma, there is no more auspicious 

thing that surpasses Laksahoma. In the case of the king who 

gets a Kotihoma performed by brahmanas the enemies cannot 

stand up against him in battle excessive rainfall, drought, 

mice, locusts, parrots, evil spirits and the like and all enemies 

on the battle-field are conjured away from him. * 1212 The Bhavi- 

syottaTa ( 143 11-13 ) calls kotihoma a santi rite, which yields all 

desired objects, by which even grave sins like brahmana-murder 

are removed at once, all utpatas are conjured away and great 

happiness, follows. Bhavisyottara (chap 143.7-54) contains 

an elaborate procedure of Kotihoma and also a briefer one ( in 

chap. 143. 56-80). Atharva-pansista (No 31) describes the 

procedure of Kotihoma; it was to be begun on an auspicious 

tithi in the bright half, on the muliurta called, Vijaya and on 

one of the naksatras viz. RohinI, Pusya, Anuradha, the three 

UttaTas, Abhijit, Mrgasiras, Sravana, Oitra, Eevatl. The 

firepit was to be of eight cubits (for Laksahoma half of this), 

the brahmanas may be 30, 100, 1000 or even one crore, who

Some of the medieval works like the Santimayukha (p. 12 ) 
quote verses from the Skandapurana that state how the unfavo- 
urable aspect of Saturn led Saudasa to eat human flesh, that of 
Rahu made Nala wander over the earth, that of Mars led to 
Rama's banishment to forest, that of the Moon led to the death 
of Hiranyakasipu, that of the Sun brought about the fall of 
Havana, that of Jupiter led to the death of Duryodhana, that of 
Mercury made the Pandavas do work not fit for them, that of 
Venus led to the death of Hiranyaksa in battle. 

Some of the medieval digests (mbandhas) such as the 
Dharmasindhu lay down that certain special gifts should be 
made when any one of the planets is unfavourable to a peraon. 
They are set out here from the Dharmasindhu (p. 135). For 
the Sun— Ruby, wheat, cow, red garment, jaggery, gold, copper! 
red sandalwood, lotuses; for the Moon— rice grains in vessel

Another santi refers to the placating of Saturn when that 
planet ocoupies the 12th, 1st and 2nd rasis from the rasi of a 
man's birth. This is roughly a period of seven years and a half 
and is called ' sai dha-saptavarsika-pida' in Sanskrit and ' sade- 
satV in Marathi. The santi consists in worshipping an 
image of Saturn made of iron placed in a vessel of iron 
or clay, covered with two dark garments or a blanket 
and offering to it dark and fragrant flowers, food or 
rice mixed with sesame That food and the image are to be 
donated to a dark brahmana or to some brahmana with the 
mantra * san no devir' (Rg X. 9. 4) If the worshipper be a 
sudra he is to repeat a pauranika 1214 mantra (noted below) 
which refers to Nala getting back his kingdom by placating 
Saturn. This should be done every Saturday for a year or one 
should every day repeat the mantra containing ten names of 
Saturn (in note 1214) and should also repeat a Sanistotra (eulogy 
of Saturn ) every morning Ey doing so the trouble that Saturn 
causes for seven and half years is averted 

Some of the medieval digests try to furnish an accurate 
definition of Santi Only one may be cited here. The Santi- 
mayukha 1215 of Wilakantha (first half of 17th century A. D.) 
defines it as a rite prescribed by the sastra, which (rite) has its 
motive or urge sinfulness that is not clear (i.e that is only inferred 
or presumed ), that removes evil effects relating only to this 
world, and the performance of which does not lead on to sin 
The firBt clauses excludes gifts made to remove diseases like 
tuberculosis ; 1216 the 2nd clause distinguishes santis from sacri-

fices (intended to secure other woridly rewards) and piayasatlas 
(that yield consequences in this world as well as in the 
next) and the last clause distinguishes santis from rites of black 
magic (for destroying one'B enemies or securing a married 
woman's love &c.) which is sinful. 

The number of santis is legion. They are prescribed for 
conjuring away the effects of rare natural phenomena such as 
eclipses, earth-quakes, rainfall ( of peculiar kinds, of blood &c. ) 
hurricanes, fall of meteors, comets, halos, Fata Morgana; for 
protection against the evil effects of the positions and movements 
of planets and stars for the world andfor individuals ; for strange 
births among human beings and animals ; for the good of horses 
and elephants; for certain untoward happenings about Indra's 
banner and about images of gods falling or weeping, the 
crie3 of birds and beasts, the fall of lizards and the like on a 
person's limbs and on certain stated periods or on solemn 
occasions. 

All rites of Santi, Paustika rites and the Mahadanas were 
to be performed in ordinary fire, since there is no authority to 
prove that they are to be performed in srauta fires or in smarta 
fire. Manu 3. 67 and Yaj. I. 97 refer only to ceremonies laid down 
in the Grhyasutras, On Yaj. I. 385-86 the Mitaksara prescribes 
ordinary fire for offerings in "Vinayaka-santi. Vide also Santi- 
mayukha p. 4. 

Both Manu »» and the Visnudharmasutra prescribe that 
homas in which the Sun is the deity worshipped and Santibomas 
should be performed by a householder on the parvans |i.e on

$bi History of Dliarmaiusti a [Sec. Ill, Ch. XXI 

One of the oldest available descriptions of the Ugraratha- 
santi is found m the Baudhayanagrhyasusa-sfitra (V. 8.). It is 
brief and the mam items in it are set out here. It should be 
performed in the month of one's birth and on the naksatra of 
birth. A vedt as large as a bull's hide should be made, a jar full 
of water should be plaoed thereon and on the jar an image of 
Mrtyu (Death ) manufactured with two mskas ( i. e. gold probably 
weighing as much ) should be placed in the south-east corner; 
worship should be offered to the image and a japa of each of the 
mantras * apaitu mrtyuh ' (* may Death go away', Tai. Br. DX 7. 
14 4), 'paramMrtyo' (O Death' follow the path beyond &c.', 
Tai. Br II. 7. 14. 5 and Eg. X. 18. 1 ), «m5 nas-toke' (O Eudra! 
do not injure our progeny ' &c., Tai. S. EX 4. 11. 2 and Eg. I 
114 8), and'Tryambakam' ('we offer sacrifice to Eudra', Tai. 
S.I 8.6 & and Eg. VII 59. 12) be made 108 times; he offers 
oblations of cooked food with the put onuvukyu ( invitatory 
prayer) 'ma no mahantam* (O Eudra! do not destroy our grown 
up ones &c', Tai S IV 5 10. 2 and Eg. 1 114. 7 ) and the Yajija 
(offering prayer) 'Ma nas-toke' (Tai. S. HE. 4. 11. 2 and Eg. 1 114. 
8 ). Then he makes subsidiary offerings of ghee with eaoh verse of 
the Ghrtasukta im Then he sprinkles himself with water from- 
the jar to the accompaniment of mantras from the Mrtyusukta, 
from the iLyusyasukta and with Pauranika mantras, honours 
the officiating priest, gives daksina to the brahmanas and 
a dinner. 

There is a Ms. ( of only three folios in D. 0. No. 609 of the 
year 1882-83, now in the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute at 
Poona) which deals with this santi attributed to Saunaka and is 
called TJgrarathasanti at the end The santi is to be performed 
On the day or naksatra of one's birth On that day the person 
of 60 years should take an auspicious bath, perform his daily 
religious duties, should invite brahmanas and choose one to 
officiate who is learned in the Vedas and Vedangas and is well 
conducted. First Ganesa worship should he performed, then 

1218 It is difficult to say what hymn is intended here by the word 
'ghrtasukteaa' It is probably Rg VI 70 1-6 (ghrtavatibhuvananam &0i) 
The Mrtyusukta is probably the same as Rg X 18. The Ayusya hymn is 
a Khtla hymn after Rg X, 128 and begins "ayusyam varcasyam rayasporam 
audbhidam.' The Karmapradlpa of Gobhlla ( I 17) prescribes that Ayusya 
hymns should be recited in sraddha for santi. The Smrticandnka (sraddha 
p. £03 ) quotes Gobhila I. 17 and explains that they are hymns like the one 
beginning ' a no bh&drah ' Rg I 89. 1,

punyahavacana, worship of Mother goddesses, then nandisraddha. 
He should bring together sarwusadhis, 1 * 9 twigs and leaves of 
five trees, five jewels, paiicagavya, and paScamrta; then worship 
of nine planets should be performed; an image of Markandeya 
was to be made from one pala or * pala or J pala and the image 
was placed in a jar full of water surrounded by two garments; 
he should offer the 16 tipacat as and offer to Markandeya 1008, 
or 108 or 38 or eight offerings of fuel sticks, boiled rice, ghee, 
durvS, superior dishes with the mantra (quoted below 1220 ). Then 
he should make a homa in honour of Mrtyunjaya (Siva) with 
oblations of durva grass and sesame 10000, or 5000, or 3000 or 
one thousand in number and then he should sacrifice separately 
to the secondary objects of worship, viz. AsvatthSman, Bali, 
Vyasa, Hanumat, Bibhlsana, Krpa and Parasurama. Then he 
should perform a homa with fried grams according to his 
ability and should recite Srteukta, 1221 Rudra, the Ayusya- 
mantras, the PurusasQkta and specially the complete recitation 
of the Veda; he should finish the homa and offer purnahuti; 
then water from the jar should be sprinkled over the yajamana 
( i. e. person who has completed 60 years ), his wife and his 
near relatives; then there should be a japa of santihymn, 
the Pumsasukta, the mantra $g. X. 18. 1, the Ayusya hymn, 
Pavamana hymn ( hymn to Soma from Rg. IX. ), the six 
verses of Sivasankalpa ( Vsj S. 33 1-6 ), and Mahasanti. Then 
the jar should be donated and the garments rendered wet by 
the abhseka and a decked cow with calf should be donated 
to the officiating priest ; ten danas vai to brahmanas and gold 
weighing one hundred manas; he should perform ajyaveksana 
and offer ' bait ' (to all beings, crows &o. ) ; he should then receive 
the blessings of the brahmanas and put on a new garment; then 
he should have nirajana performed and bow to deities and feed 
a thousand or a hundred brahmanas and then himself partake 
of food along with his relatives. Whoever performs this santi,

live for a hundred years, all misfortunes will vanish and all 
prosperity will be his. The jnayoga (procedure of this santi ) 
is given below 1223 since it is often performed even now. 

It is difficult to say why this santi was called Ugraratha. 
Another santi on the completion of 70 years or on the 7th night 
of the 7th month of the 77th year is called Bhaimarathl-santi, 
according to the Sabdakalpadruma, which quotes some verses 
from Vaidyalca without stating what work is meant. 1223 " Baud, 
grhyasesasutra I. 24 prescribes a santi for one who has lived up 
to 100 years or one who has seen 1000 amavasyas. 

The general rule about the time for santis is that no definite 
time can be fixed for them, since Santi rites are performed with 
the object of removing the evil consequences of men's lapses 
suggested by such indications ( or omens ) as dreams, the evil 
aspects of planets and the like i. e. they are to be performed as 
and when omens or portents occur or are observed and one 
should not wait for such times as the northward passage of the 
Sun, bright fortnight and that one may perform santis even in 
the southward passage of the Sun or even m an intercalary

month. 1124 If there is no hurry, then a santi was to be per? 
formed on an auspicious week-day, an auspicious tithi and on 
certain naksatoas, viz. the three Uttaras, RohinI, Sravana, 
Dhanistha, Satataraka, Punarvasu, Svati, Magha, Asvinl, Hasta, 
Pusya, Anuradha and Revati. 1225 As regards the Laksahoma 
the Matsya (93. 86 ) prescribes that it should be performed after 
securing favourable planets and Taras (stars). Vide also p. 290 
above about Kotihoma prescribed by the Atharva-parisista 
( XXXI pp. 187-191 ). The Matsya prescribes that a Kotihoma 
should be begun in Caitra or Kartika (239 20-21'); the invisi- 
bility of Jupiter and Venus and similar matters need not be 
considered when a santi has to be performed immediately on the 
occurrence of an omen ( or portent ) or when the santi is meant 
for alleviating the disease from which a person may be suffering. 

As against several adbhutas and utpatas, texts prescribe a 
rite called Mahasanti. The Sankhayana Gr. ( V. 11 ) speaks of a 
Mahasanti, when an ant-hill grows in one's house, which has been 
referred to above on p. 730 note 1162. The details of a Mahasanti 
differ in different texts and on different occasions. The Ad- 
bhuta-sagara provides that where no specific details about santis 
against certain utpatas like a fall of meteors aTe prescribed one 
should have recourse to a santi consisting in homa offerings to the 
accompaniment of one million repetitions of the Bacred Gayatri 
verse ('tat-savitur' &c. Rg m. 62. 10) or to the Mahasanti 
called Abhaya according to the nature (grave or light) of the 
omen or portent."** In the Marathi commentary on the

Nirnayasindhu (p. 233 ) about the question of a rite on the -first 
appearance of a woman's monthly illness a japa of Mahasanti is 
prescribed after an elaborate homa and worship and the Maha- 
santi is explained as consisting of the recitation of Rg 1. 89. 
1-10 (beginning with 'a no bhadra'), Bg V. 51. 11-15 (beginning 
with ' svasti no mimitam &o ') and Eg. VH 35, 1-15 (begin- 
ning with ' san-na Indragni ' ). The Bhavisyottara ( 143. 2-46 ) 
describes a Mahasanti to be performed at a king's coronation* 
on his marching out on an invasion, when one has bad dreams 
or inauspicious omens {mmtttas), when the planets are un- 
favourable or when there is lightning and the fall of meteors, 
when a Ketu appears, in a hurricane, earthquake, birth on 
a Mula naksatra or Gandanta, on birth of twins, when parasols 
and banners fall on the ground, when a crow, owl or pigeon 
enters a house, when malefic planets are retrograde (especially 
in the naksatra or rasi of birth), when Jupiter, Saturn, 
Mars and the Sun aTe in the 1st, 4th, 8th or 12th houses 
(in a person's horoscope), when there is grahayuddha', when 
garments, weapons, horses and cows, or jewels and hair 
Me lost, or when rainbow is seen at night in front, when the 
beam on a house pillar is smashed, when a she — mule conceives, 
on eclipses of the Sun and the Moon — on these a Mahasanti 
is commended. The procedure is briefly as follows ■ Five learned 
and well-conducted brahmanas should officiate in a mandapa 
ten or twelve cubits on each side, in the midst of which there 
should he a raised platform four cubits on each side and in the 
Bouth-east corner of that platform there should be a kiwda 
( receptacle for fire ) Five jars should be placed, four in the four 
intermediate quarters (south-east &c. ) and the fifth in the 
middle of the platform and numerous things such as twigs and 
leaves of some plants, jewels, sandalwood, mustard grains, sarm 
and duna, Jctiias and grains of rice should be collected thereon; 
Vedic mantras such as 'asuhsisano' (Bg. X 103 1) on north- 
west, c Isavasya'("Va.j S. 40.1) on north-east, were to be recited 
over the jars, worship is to be offered with qandlia, flowers, lamp3, 
fruits like cocoanut to the jars and fire should be placed in the 
Kunda with ' agnim dutam' (Bg 1 12 1), seat (asana) should 
be offerred with the mantra 'hiranya-garbhah' (SgX 121.1). 
then payasa should be cooked to the accompaniment of Purusa- 
sukta ( Bg X 90), eighteen fuel sticks of sami and seven palasa 
one3 should be cast into Agni, seven ahutts of clarified ghee and 
seven of rice boiled in milk should be offered to Agni with a 
mantra 'Jatavedase' (Bg L 99 1), four more with the hymn

ahutis to the 27 naksatras, then performance of 'svistakrt' 
homa, grahahoma with sesame covered with ghee, then praya- 
scitta; thus ends the homa; then the yajamana sitting on a 
throne of kasmarya wood should have sprinkled over him to the 
accompaniment of drum-heating and conch-blowing water from 
the five jars with five different mantras, then an offering to all 
the directions (digbali) with the mantra 'salutation to all 
bhutas'. After the hath, brahmanas recite a santi over him 
after letting fall a stream of santi water all round ; then punyaha- 
vacana and then close of the santi rite, then gifts of land, gold, 
beds, seats according to the person's ability to brahmanas; he 
should treat to a sumptuous meal the poor and helpless and men 
learned in the Yeda. On doing this he secures long life, quick 
victory over enemies, even difficult undertakings succeed. 

The huge work Adbhutasagara is mostly concerned with 
rare natural phenomena such as halo, rainbows, hurricanes, 
glowing horizon (digdaha), meteors, comets, earthquakes, rain 
without clouds, red rain, shower of fish, Fata Morgama &o. 

A few words must be said about some striking ones out of 

these. Ifrst comes earthquake. The Br. S. { 32. 1-2 ) puts forth 

four theories of his predecessors about the cause of an earthquake 

viz. it was caused by huge animals dwelling inside the seas 

(view of Kasyapa) or according to others (Garga ) it was caused 

by the heavy breaths emitted by the elephants of the quarters 

when tired by carrying the weight of the earth; others (like 

Vasistha) said that earthquake noise is caused by the winds 

Btriking against each other ( in the sky) and falling on the earth ; 

other ScSryas (like Vrddhagarga) held that an earthquake was 

caused by adrsta (i. e. by the sins of the people on the earth 1227 ). 

In verses 3-7 of Br. S. ( chap. 32 ) Varaha narrates the myth 

that mountains had in the dim past wings and the earth being 

much shaken by their movements approached Pitamaha 

(Brahma) and Brahma seeing her sad plight asked lndra to 

discharge his thunderbolt for clipping the wings of mountains 

and for removing the anger (or sorrow) of the earth; lndra did 

so, but he told the earth that Yayu, Agni, lndra (himself) and

Varuna would (each) at different parts of the day and night make 
the earth shake in order to indicate (to mortals) the fruits of their 
good and bad deeds. In Br. S 32 8-22 Varaha describes the 
spheres and premonitory signs of Vayu, Agni, Indra and Vanma 
with the naksatras and the countries they affect The Adbhuta- 
sagara (pp 383-409) quotes most of the verses of Varaha and pres- 
cribes santis for each of the four deities that are deemed to be con- 
nected with earthquakes. The Adbhutasagara refers to earthquakes 
that happened when angry Arjuna got no sleep after he made a 
vow that he would kill Jayadratha before the next day's sunset 
(Dronaparva 77 4) and when Duryodhana challenged Bhima for 
a mace fight (Salyaparva 56 10 and 58 49 ) 

It should not be a matter for surprise that ancient and 
medieval Indians regarded earthquakes as punishments sent by 
God for the sins of men. The English poet Cowper gives vent to 
this belief in his poem * Timepeace '. 1228 The most distinguished 
Indian of modern times viz Mahatma Gandhi, regarded the 
earthquake in Bihar that occurred on January 15, 1934, and 
affected an area of about 30000 square miles and a population 
of about 15 millions and that killed thousands and made 
millions homeless, as God's punishment for the prevalence of the 
evil system of nntouchabihty in Hindu 1229 society. To the 
natural and usual query why God should punish a small country 
or a small community with frightful earthquakes and overwhelm- 
ing waves when other countries and millions of other people are 
guilty of the same misdeeds, Cowper endeavours to give a reply 

1228, What then? Were they the wicked above all, 

And we the righteous, whose fast-anchored isle 
Moved not, while theirs was rocked like a light skiff, 
The sport of every wave. No I none are clear, 
And none than we more guilty But where all 
Stand chargeable with guilt, and to the shafts 
Of wrath obnoxious, God may choose his mark. 
May punish, if he please, the less, to warn 
The more malignant

Tendulkar, vol 3 pp 304-308 and vol 4 pp. 41-42. The characteristic 
sentences arc ' A man of prayer regards what are known as physical cala- 
mities as divine chastisement alike for individuals and nations'. 'A man 
like mc cannot but believe that this earthquake is a divine chastisement 
sent by God for our sins* (vol 3p 303), • I share the belief with the 
whole world, utilized and nnciwlizcd, that calamities such as the Bihar 
one come to mankind as chastisement for their sins' ( tbid. p 305 ). 



Earthquakes and comets 765 

in the lines quoted above It appears that, in spite of the be- 
liefs now discredited, Vrddha Garga and Varaha appear to have 
also believed that comets had orbits like planets and were visible 
in the firmament at certain long intervals of time. 

The rules to be observed about eclipses have already been 

stated above (pp. 243-250). Though the real causes of lunar 

and solar eclipses were known long before the time of Varaha- 

mihira as shown above (p. 242, n 622) this knowledge was not 

accepted by the masses for centuries and even now many people 

in India still entertain the old beliefs about eclipses. 1230 Varaha 

criticises ancient writers like Vrddha Garga and Parasara who 

prophesied an eclipse when five planets including Mercury 

came together or there were such mrmttas as halo of the Sun, dim 

rays " 31 (Br. S. V. 16-17 ). Here the Santi for it will be briefly 

described. One -view was that an eclipse was auspicious ,232 to 

a person, if the eclipse occurs when the Sun or the Moon is in 

the 3rd, 6th, 10th or 11th rasi ( zodiacal sign ) from the rasi of 

the birth of a person, it is neither auspicious nor inauspicious 

when any one of the two is in 2nd, 5th, 7th or 9th rasi from that 

of birth and it is inauspicious when the eclipsed sun or moon is 

in the 1st, 4th, 8th and 12th rasi from the rasi of birth. The 

view of Garga was that if an eclipse occurs when the sun or 

moon is in the rasi of the birth of a person or if any of them is 

in the 1st, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th or 12th rasi from that of birth or 

if any of them occupies the naksatra of the birth of a person or 

the 9th naksatra from that of birth, it leads to calamities for 

that person. If an eclipse occurred when the Sun or Moon 

occupied the naksatra of the day of the coronation of the king, 

that portends the ruin of the kingdom, the loss of friends and'

Beliefs about meteors 767 

-■wn to the earth (for fresh births) after enjoying in heaven 
;he favourable results of their actions. 1237 Meteors are often 
referred to in the epics as falling on serious occasions e. g. the 
Salya-parva mentions 1238 the fall of a flaming meteor accomp- 
anied by a great noise and whirlwind when Duryodhana fell in 
ihe macefight with Bhlma. In Dronaparva a flaming meteor is 
referred to as indicative of the coming death of the great acarya 
and warrior Drona. The Adbhutasagara (pp. 342-344) quotes 
a long passage ( of 23§ verses ) from Atharvanadbhuta about the 
fall of meteors I239 by day. It is said therein tbat such a fall of 
meteors by day portends the destruction of the country and its 
king and therefore a Mahasanti called Amrta should be per- 
formed. There is an Atharvana-parisista LVIII b on ulka, but 
the Adbhutasagara verses do not appear to have been extracted 
from that. 

Certain natural phenomena, though they may be called 
utpatas if they occur at certain times, are not to be regarded as 
such at certain other times. In Br. S. 45. 82 Varaha says that 
certain occurrences natural to certain seasons do not lead to any 
unfavourable consequences; one should know them from the 
verses composed by Rsiputra that are concise. Then he pro- 
ceeds: in Madhu and Madhava (Caitra and Vaisakha) the 
following occurrences lead to good viz. lightning, meteors, earth- 
quake, glowing twilight, noisy whirl-winds, halo (of Sun and 
Moon), dust in the sky, vapour (in forest), red sunrise and 
sunset; possibility of getting from trees food, rasas (sweet &c), 
oily substances, numerous flowers and fruits, and amorous 
activities among cows and birds. The f ollowing are beneficial 
(au p icious ) J n summer ( Jyestha and Asadha) viz. sky rendered 
ousky by the fall of stars and meteors, or in which the appear- 
ance of the Sun and the Moon is dark-brown, which is full of 
Aery glow without a flaring fire, loud noises, vapour, dust and

winds, in which evenings are like red lotus and which look like 
a stormy sea, and when rivers are dried up. In the rains 
( Sravana and Bhadrapada ) the following portend no danger viz. 
rainbow, halo (of Sun and Moon), lightning, dried trees giving 
out fresh sprouts, the earth quaking or rolling or showing other 
than its usual appearance, noises in the earth or gaps therein, 
or when lakes increase in expanse of water or rivers rise up ( in 
floods ), or when wells are full or when houses on hills roll down. 
In Sarad (Asvina and Kartika) the following are not of evil 
import viz the sight of divine damsels, ghosts, gandharvas, air 
conveyances and other adbhutas, the planets, naksatras and 
other stars becoming visible by day in the sky, noises of song 
and music in forests and on mountain peaks, abundance of 
crops and reduction of waters In Hemanta (Margaslrsaand 
Pausa) the following are auspicious viz. the presence of cool 
winds and frost, loud cries of birds and beasts, the sight of 
raksas (evil spirits), Yaksas and other (usually invisible) 
beings, non-human voices, directions darkened by vapour 
together with the sky, forests and mountains, the appearance of 
the rise and setting of the Sun -at a higher point than usual. 
The following appearances are auspicious in Sisira (Magha and 
Phalguna) viz the fall of snow, portentous winds, sight of 
terrible beings and adbhutas, sky resembling dark collyrium and 
rendered reddish-yellow by the fall of meteors and stars, the 
birth of various strange issue from women, cows, sheep, mares, 
beasts, and birds, strange appearances of leaves, sprouts and 
creepers. These when seen in the proper seasons are auspicious 
in those respective seasons, but when seen at other than the 
proper seasons they are very terrible portents. Two verses UM

and 95 The occurrence of these twelve verses ( 45, 83-94 ) both in Br S. 
and Visnudharmottara raises the important question of the chronological 
relation of the two works Varabamihira expressly tells us that he took the 
twelve verses (45 83-94 ) from Rsiputra or shortened them Therefore, he 
did not borrow from the Visnudharmottara Rsiputra has been often quoted 
by Varaha in his works (vide above p 593 and my paper in JBBRAS for 
1948-49, \ol 24-25, p 15) The 31 ^r PP 743-744 quotes the verses 
from sn^oTT, twmW i fttStmRTC and muj g Rdl The twelve verses occnr

When certain happenings a? e not utpatas 769 

about Madhu-Madhava and the last one (Br. S, 45. 84-85 and 
95) are quoted below. The Br. S. further provides 12 ' 1 that whatever 
Gathas ( prakrit verses or simply verses ) are recited by persons of 
distracted intellect, the utterances of children and what women 
speak out does not turn out to be wrong and that a person that 
understands utpatas, even though he may be devoid of mathema- 
tics (about planets), becomes famous and a favourite of the king* 
and by knowing the secret (or esoteric) words of the sage 
(Bsiputra ) which are stated (by me), a person sees the past, the 
present and the future. 

Another very curious portent mentioned in the Maha- 
bharata, Kausikasutra 1242 ( kandika 105 ), Matsya ( 243 ), Visnu- 
dharmottara, Brhatsamhita and the Adbhutasagara (pp". 425- 
436), Hemadri on Vrata vol. II (pp. 1078-79 ) and Madanaratna 
( on santi, folio 54b) is the trembling, dancing, laughing and 
weeping of the images of gods. The Bhlsmaparva 12 * 3 refers to 
the images in the temples of the Kaurava king doing these acts.

my ■ History of Sanskrit Poetics ■ ( 1951 ) pp 64-70 I arrived for the 
Viamdharmottara at a date between 500-600 A. D on other evidence In 
my opinion it is probable that the Visnudharmottars borrows the verses 
from the Brhat-samhiti. If that he accepted, the Visnudharmottara (at 
least the 2nd section of it ) mnst be later than 600 A.. D It is possible to

"Visnu the Matsyapurana 1244 states 'the images of all gods shut 
and open their eyes, laugh, weep, scream, emit smoke, blaze, and 
these signs indicate that great danger impends.' In the 
Siiharvana-parisista 1245 LXXII this matter is treated (in prose). 
It says ' there are portents called divya which occur in temples, 
they (images) laugh, sing, weep, shriek, perspire, cause smoke 
t to issue out of them, they blaze, they tremble, open their eyeB 
and shut them, blood oozes from them, they move to and fro.' 
These strange phenomena are said to forebode drought, danger 
from weapons, famine, epidemic in the country and destruction 
of the king and his ministers (or relatives). The santi pre- 
scribed in the same JLtharvana-parisista (4 7) is as follows: one 
should boil payasa in the milk of 108 kapila cows, if such cows 
are not available one should cook pUyasa with the milk of one 
hundred milch cows ; he should put on the fire fuel sticks with 
ends towards the east, should spread round the fire darbha grass 
and should offer oblations ( of rice) in fire to the accompaniment 
of the mantras addressed to Rudra UM and called Raudra-gana 
and also offer clarified butter ( in fire ) He should present white 
flowers, he should treat brahmanas with boiled rice and should 
donate the same cows (the milk of which was used for cooking 
payasa) or donate the kingdom for a limited period for the 
satisfaction of a brahmana, he should give to the officiating 
priest a thousand cows and donate a good village. 

Now santis on the birth of human beings should be referred 
to. There are several santis concerning the birth of a human 
being, such as aohild's birth on Mula, iLslesa, Jyesfha naksatras, 
on ganfonta, on the 14th tithi of the dark fortnight or on

ianti for birth on Aslesa 771 

amavasya, on Vyatipata-yoga or on Vaidhrfci or in an eclipse, 
or on tlie birth of twins, or when a girl ia born to a person after 
three successive births of sons or a son is born after three succes- 
sive births of girls. Some of these santis are performed even 
now. Therefore two of them which are still in vogue, though 
gradually becoming infrequent, are briefly described here. The 
consequences xrf birth on Mula, Jyestha and Aslesa, are more or 
less similar. Here the santi for birth on Aslesa is briefly 
set out. 

The Aslesa naksatra has a mean measure of 60 ghatls. It 
is to be divided into ten parts in order 1216 " viz. 5, 7, 2, 3, 4, 
8, 11, 6, 9 and 5 ; birth of a son in these parts indicates in order 
the loss of kingdom, death of father, death of mother, addiction 
to lovemaking, he has devotion to father, has strength, loses pro- 
perty, has proneness to charity, pleasures, 'wealth. If the naksatra 
be divided into four parts, birth in the first part is auspicious but in 
the other three parts indicates loss of wealth, death of father, death 
of mother. If the child is a girl borcron the last three quarters of 
Aslesa indicates the death of the future mother-in-law of the 
girl; if the child be a boy and is born in the last three quarters 
of Aslesa, that indicates death of his future mother-in-law. One 
should perform a Santi for birth on any quarter of Aslesa, either 
on the 12th day from birth, or if that be not possible, on the next 
■Sslesa or on any auspicious day. On that day he ( the father or 
other performer) should make a sankalpa 1247 as noted below

receive the tonch of the cow's limbs at the hands of the priest with the 
mantra of Vwau (Rg.X. 184 1). The officiating priest should take the 
child that is (now imagined as) born from (the mouth of) the cowhand

after performing the Gomukhaprasava-santi. He should worship 
Rudra and Varuna on two jars, should invoke the serpents, the 
lords of Aslesa, on an image placed on a Jar established on the 
figure of a lotus with twentyfour petals and invoke Brhaspati, 
the lord of Pusya naksatra, to the south of the jar (for serpents) 
and the pitrs (the lords of Magha) to the north of Aslesa jar and 
invoke on the twentyfour petals, beginning from the petal which 
is due east and proceeding to the right therefrom, twentyfour 
deities beginning with Bhaga, the lord of Purva Phalgunl up to 
Aditi,lordof Punarvasu, then he should invoke the lokapalas 
(eight); then worship all the deities invoked, establish fire (for 
homa) and the planets and perform antadhana (putting fuel on 
the sacred Agni). After the anvadhana of the Sun and other 
planets he should offer to the principal deities, viz the serpents, 
108 or 28 of each of the materials viz. payasa mixed with ghee, 
fuel sticks, clarified butter and boiled rice, to Brhaspati and pitrs 
38 or 8 offerings of the same materials and to the 24 deities (of 
naksatras ) viz Bhaga and the rest eight ahutis of payasa to 
each with the verse 'raksohanam' (Bg. X.87 1) The other 
deities are to be worshipped as in santi for birth on Mula naksatra 
and the offerings and mantras are to be the same as in that 
santi A santi for the birth of a child on the 14th tithi of the 
dark half is still in vogue and the author knows about it 
personally; it is described at length in the Madanaratna( folio 
24 from GSrgya) and in Santi-kamalakara. The santi on the 
birth of a child on Mula naksatra is described in MadanaTatna 
from Garga (folio 37b to 28b, ) one peculiarity of which is that 
the father had to collect one hundred roots of trees and plants 
( mula means 'root' ). Vide also Santi-kamalakara ( folio 77a ).

hand tt over to the mother who should pass it on to the father who should 
then return it to the mother The child should be placed on a piece of cloth 
and the father should look at the face of the infant Then the priest should 
sprinkle the infant with drops from the mixture of cow's urine, dung, milk, 
cnrds and ghee with the mantras beginning with ' Apo hi sfha ' ( Rg. X. 9 
I ). The father then smells thnce parts of the child's head with the

( that vi as born on an unlncky naksatra &c ) as having been born from the 
mouth of a cow ( a very sacred animal from Vedic times ) Vide utfi^^S

Triliaprasavasanti 773 

The birth of a girl after three successive births of boys or of 
a boy after three successive births of girls was supposed to 
indicate unfavourable consequences to the parents and the family 
and death of the eldest, loss of wealth and great sorrow. There- 
fore a santi was recommended on the 11th or 12th day from the 
birth of a girl or boy (as the case may be) or on an auspicious day. 
He (the father) should choose acarys (chief officiating priest) and 
other priests, then perform a sacrifice to planets and offer worship 
to the golden images of Brahma, Visnu, Siva and Indra on 
ajar placed on a heap of grains. On a fifth jaT he should 
worship Eudra and one brahmana should recite four hymns to 
Rudra eleven times and all santisuktas when homa is being 
performed. The acarya should cast into the fire fuel-sticks, ghee, 
sesame and boiled rice 1003, 108 or 300 times to four deities viz. 
Brahma, "Visnu, Mahesa and Indra respectively with the mantras 
'Brahma iajnanam' (Tai. S. IV. 2.8.2, Vaj. S. 13.3), «idam 
Visnur' (Eg. I 23.17), 'Tryamabakam yajamahe' (Eg. VII. 
59.12), 'Yata Indra bhayamahe' (Eg. VHI. 61. 13). Then he 
should perform 'Svistakrt' homa, im then offer bali and 
purmhuti. The family members should be sprinkled with the 
sacred water. The performer should honour the acarya and 
donate some gold and a cow to him and give dahsiTfa to the other 
priests, should look into a vessel full of ghee and should make 
the brahmanas recite santi verses. The images with the addi- 
tions ot decorations thereof should be donated to the guru, 
brahmanas, poor and helpless people should be fed according to 
his ability. By doing this santi all misfortunes are destroyed. 
(Nirnayasindhu p. 248 and Santiratnakara, folio 109 ). 

The Kausikasutra (kandikas 110 and 111 ), Brhatsamhita 1 ^ 
(chap. 45. 51-54) and the Adbhutasagara pp. 559-569 deal at 
length with the portents of births to women, cows, mares, she 
asses &c. A few passages only are set out here. Varahamihira 
says 'when women give birth to monstrosities, or to two 
three, four or more children at the same time or they are 
delivered much before or after the pr oper time, then results

destruction of the country or family'. The Matsyapurana 235. 
1-3 and Vismidbannottara H. 140. 1-3 have identical verses 
similar to the above. The Bhlsmaparva 1230 (chap 3 2-7) refersto 
portentous births such as the following; 'pregnant women and 
women who had never before given birth to sons produce mon- 
strosities; so also even wives of men who are Vedic scholars are 
giving birth to eagles and peacocks, mare3 give birth to calves, 
dogs to jackals; some women have given birth to four or five girls 
(at the same time)&c\ The Br. S proceeds 1251 'If mares, 
camels, she-buffaloes and cow-elephants give birth to twins, that 
portends death to them The effect of such births will come to 
pass about six months later; Garga has declared ±wo slokas as to 
the santi in such cases The women that give birth ( to twins or 
monstrosities) should be removed to another place (or country) 
by one that desires his own happiness, he should gratify 
brahmanas by gifts of things desired by them and should cause 
a santi ( propitiatory rite) to be performed; 33 to quadrupeds, 
they should be removed from their flocks or herds and be aband- 
oned in other countries; otherwise there would be ruin of the 
town, the owner and the flock or herd" 

Various modes were employed to divine the future, viz. 
(1) the position of planets and stars, (2) individual horoscopes, 
(3) flight and cries of birds like khanjana and crow, (4) natural 
phenomena (eclipses, meteors &c ), (5) dreams, (6) voices 
suddenly heard, (7 ) the physical and mental conditions of men, 
animals &c The first four have already been briefly dealt with. 
Now dreams will be taken up for discussion. 

It has already been seen (p 728, note3 1157 and 1158) how in 
the Vedic literature dream3 had been associated with good luck or 
51-luck. The two epics, the Svapnadhyaya (of 5iharrana-pari- 
sista IiXV'illpp 438-449), the Brhad-yoga-yatra of Varaha 
( chap 16. 1-31 ), Purauas such as Vayu (chap 19. 13-18;, Matsya 
(chap.242), Visnudbarmottara (IL 176), Bhavisya 1. 194, Brahma- 
vafrarta-purana (Ganesa-khanda 34.10-40), describe good or 
bad dreams; Agni (229, many verses of which are the same

Works on ianhs about dreams " 5 

as those of Matsya chap. 243), Bhujabala of Bhoja (pp. ****** 
verses 1347-1378 ), the Adbhutasagara pp. 493-515 deal 
at length with the matters relating to dreams and santis 
therefor. Sankaracarya in his commentary on Vedantasutra - 
remarks that those who have studied the Svapnadbyaya 
declare that to see oneself riding on an elephant or the like 
is auspicious and to see oneself sitting in a conveyance 
drawn by asses is inauspicious (or unlucky). It appears that 
rarely an ancient writer like Angiras"* 3 said ' the movements 
of planets, dreams, nimittas (like throbbing ), utpatas (portents) 
produce some consequences by chance; wise men are not afraid 
of them'. Numerous dreams are mentioned in the Rimayana on 
several occasions. Some examples may be given. In the 
Sundarakanda (chap. 27, 23 ff ) Trijata ( a raksasi ) details several 
dreams that she saw and that indicated the destruction of 
raksasas and that were favourable to Rama. Among the evil 
omens that she saw in her dream about Havana were ; he had his 
head shaved, he drank oil with which he was drenched, he was 
dressed in red garments, wa3 intoxicated, wore wreaths of 
Karavlra flowers, he fell on the eaTth from his puspaka balloon, 
he was carried in a chariot drawn by asses, he was wearing red 
flowers and was anointed with red unguents &c. (verses 19-27 ). 
Similar dreams occur as seen by Trijata in the story of Rama 
contained in the Vanaparva chap. 280. verses 64-66. In the 
Ayodhyakanda (cbap. 69. 8. ff) Bharata who was with his 
maternal uncle saw jn a dream his father (Da&aratha) dirty and 
with dishevelled hair, falling from a mountain peak in a turbid 
lake full of cowdung, drinking that dirty water and oil; he also 
saw the ocean dried up and the moon fallen on the earth, he saw 
his father seated on a dark seat of iron and wearing black gar- 
ments and beaten by women dark and tawny in colour, he saw 
him going to the south in a chariot drawn by asses &c. Bharata 
says that these dreams indicated the death of thejking (Dasaratba) 
or of Rama or Laksmana. In the Mausalaparva of the Maha- 
hharata (chap. 3. 1-4) the Yadavas saw in dreams a black 
woman with whitish teeth running to Dvaraka with a laugh and 
kidnapping their women and terrible vultures were seen to be 
devouring the Vrsnis and Andhakas in their own houses in 
which sacred fires had been established &c

It is impossible to point out the unlucky and lucky dreams 
as their number mentioned in Adbhutasagara (pp 502-513), 
quoting the Furanas, Parasara, the works of Yaraha and others 
is extremely large One passage from the Matsyapurana ( 242 
verses 2-14, quoted in AdbhutasSgara pp 502-503 ) is cited here 
by way of illustration; ' the springing of grass and plants from 
one's body (except from the navel); bronze vessels dashed 
against one's head and pulverized; shaving of the head; 
nakedness; wearing dirty garments; bath with oil; being 
smeared with mud; fall from a high spot (hill&c); sitting 
in a swing, collecting mud and iron, killing horses; ascend- 
ing trees that have flowers and over circles and riding hoars, 
bears, asses and camels; eating of (the flesh of) birds and 
fishes and oil and rice mixed with mudga, or niasa, dancing, 
laughing, marriage and singing ; playing on musical instru- 
ments other than stringed ones; going for a dip in a river, 
bath with water mixed with cowdung or mud or with water 
fallen on bare earth; entering the womb of one's mother, 
ascending a funeral pyre; the fall of Indra's banner; the 
fall of the Sun and the Moon; seeing portents of the three 
kinds (heavenly, those in atmospheric regions and earthly); 
anger of gods, brahmanas, king3 and one's g-a us , embracing 
maidens; sodomy, loss of one's limbs; vomiting and purging, 
going to the southern direction, being overwhelmed by a 
disease; fall of fruits and of flowers; fall of houses; sweeping 
of houses with a broom; playing with goblins, birds or animals 
that subsist on putrid flesh, monkeys, bears and men, humilia- 
tion by strangers (or enemies); arising of calamity brought on 
by another person (or enemy); wearing ochre-coloured garments; 
playing with women ; plunging into oil or drinks; wearing red 
flowers and applying red unguents; these and others are inaus- 
picious dreams. 

In the Brhadyogayatra 1251 Varaha prescribes that the king

The manner of e ramining King's dream 777 

astrologers and purohita should enter the temple of his favourite 
deity, should place the images of the dikpalas therein, worship 
them with mantras, place four jars full of water in the four 
directions, should thrice repeat the mantras beginning with 
' Yaftagrato duram' { Vaj. S. 34. 1 ), should eat only once that day, 
sleep on his right side and pray to Rudra (as noted in n 1254) and 
examine the dream, auspicious or inauspicious, seen towards the 
close of night. 

The Matsya (242. 21-35) sets out 12s5 lucky dreams as follows : 
ascending (or riding on) mountains, palaces, elephants, horses 
and bulls; going among trees having white flowers; the shooting 
of trees and grass from the navel and seeing (the sleeper) 
endowed with many hands or heads ; wearing garlands of very 
white flowers and very white garments; eclipse of the Sun, Moon 
and naksatras; sprinkling water (on one's body) all over; 
embracing or raising the banner of Indra , seizure of the earth 
and seas; slaughter of enemies; victory in disputes, in gambling 
and in battle; eating of wet (fresh) meat, of fish and of payasa 
(rice boiled in milk and sugar); seeing blood or being bathed 
with it; drinking liquor, blood, intoxicants and milk; being 
surrounded on the earth with intestines; sight of bright sky; 
sucking the udders (the milk) of cows and she-buffaloes and of 
lionesses, cow-elephants and mares; receiving favours from 
(images of) gods, gurus andbrahmanas , bath with water flowing 
from the horns of cows or falling from the Moon (this prognos- 
ticates the acquisition of a kingdom); being crowned as aking; the 
cutting of one's head , one's death ; being burnt by fire ; one's house 
and the like being burnt down by fire; securing the insignia of 
royalty; playing on the lute , swimming beyond waters, crossing 
difficult places; the delivery in one's own house of cows, mares 
and cow-elephants; being mounted on horses ; weeping; obtain- 
ing of handsome women or embracing them ; being bound with 
tetters; being smeared with excreta; seeing living kings and 
mends; seemg images of gods and pure (or pellucid) waters.

anointing of the goddess Sri, a garland, the Moon, the Sun, a 
flag, a vase, a lotus lake, the ocean, celestial abode, a heap of 
jewels, a flame and on pp. £31-238 elaborate details of these 
dreams are given. 

Matsya (chap 243. 2-12) sets out the sights that are 
unlucky when they come before a king who is going on an 
invasion (such as improper drugs, corn with dark exterior, 
cotton, grass, dry oowdung and many others ) and prescribes 
that on seeing these for the first time he should worship Kesava 
with a laud and that if he sees it a second time he should enter 
his palace Yogayatra, ( chap. 13. 4 ff) provides what the king 
starting on an expedition should hear viz such recitations as that 
of the Veda, Vedangas, Dharmasastras, Arthasastra, Mahabharata, 
Ramayana.Purana passages Matsya (chap 243. 15-25) prescribes 
the sights that are auspicious ( such as white flowers, jars full of 
water, aquatio birds, meat and fish, flaming fire, courtezans, Durva 
grass, fresh cowdung, gold, silver, copper and all jewels besides 
several others and winds up with a fine sentiment, 1256 viz the ease 
(or satisfaction) of one's mind is the highest sign of success; on 
one side are all prognostications and on the other is the mind's 
ease. The Brhad-yogayatra of Varaha has a similar verse Vide 
H. of Dh. vol, II pp. 511, 876 and notes 1192 and 2048 therein 
for two sets of auspicious sights. The Jyotistattva (pp. 729- 
730 ) quotes several verses on the objects that are auspicious or 
inauspicious when seen by a person starting on a journey or 
expedition and remarks that the same objects when seen in a 
dream are of the same ( auspicious or inauspicious) quality. The 
Vasantaraja-sakuna (V. 2-6) sets out fifty objects tbat are 
auspicious when starting on a journey or entering a home such 
as curds, sandal wood, ghee, durva, a jar full of water &c. and 
(V. 10-11) specifies the thirty objects that are inauspicious. 

The Matsya provides 12S7 . " dreams seen in the first watch of 
the night bear fruit in a year, those seen in the 2nd watoh after

six months, those seen in the third watoh after three months and 
those seen in the last watch in a month. If on the same night 
one sees both auspicious and inauspicious dreams, one ( the 
astrologer) should declare that the last dream (alone) will yield 
consequences. Therefore, when a person sees an auspicious 
dream he should not go to sleep thereafter. Declaring a had 
dream to another is commended as also sleeping after seeing it ; 
bath with water mixed with the viscous sediment of oily 
substances, homa of sesame, honouring brahmanas, hymn of 
praise to Vasudeva and worship of him and listening to the 
story of the liberation of Gajendra— these remove the evil effects 
of bad dreams. " In connection with the vrata oalled ' Siddhar- 
thakadi-saptami' performed for gaining the favour of the Sun the 
Bhavisya (Brahma-parva, 194. 1-25 ) sets out the dreams which 
are auspioious or favourable to the person performing the vrata. 
Those verses are similar to those in the Matsya and are quoted 
by Ertyakalpataru ( on vrata pp. 176-179 ). One verse says ' on 
seeing a favourable dream one should not sleep again, but 
declare in the morning the dream as seen to Bhojakas and 
brahmanas (or to Bhojaka brahmanas).* The Brhadyoga-yatra 
contains similar verses as quoted by Adbhutasagara p. 501. 

The Jyotistattva quotes 1258 a verse *I shall declare what 
matters seen in dreams tend to bring knowledge (of impending 
consequences) to men who do not understand the true nature

(significance) of objects seen in dreams that arise from their 
meritorious or sinful actions (in previous lives)' and remarks 
that from this verse it follows that dreams are purely indicative 
and do not produce consequences (by themselves) The higher 
thought in India held that dreams were only indicative or 
suggestive of future auspicious or inauspicious events, as affirmed 
by the Vedantasutra (HI. 2 4) and by Sankaracarya's comment- 
ary thereon. On the other hand Bhujabala provides 125 ' *to 
sleep again (after a dream), not to declare it to another, bath 
in the Ganges, japa ( of holy texts), santi, staslywjana (asking 
brahmanas to say 'it would be auspicious'), to resort in the 
morning to cows and an Asvattha tree, honouring brahmanas 
with food mixed with sesame, with gold and flowers according 
to one's means, merit-giving recital of the Mahabharata— -these 
tend to destroy (the effects of) bad dreams ' Bhujabala further 
says that all white objects except cotton, ashes, bones, butter- 
milk are auspicious ( in dreams ) and all dark obj'ects except 
cows, images of gods, elephants, horses and brahmanas are 
inauspicious. 

The Atharvana-parisista"^ LXVITI (pp. 438-449) states 
that persons have different dreams according as their constitu- 
tions (prakrti) are choleric or windy or phlegmatic {pitta, iata 
and hapha) and long lists of dreams and their interpretations 
are given and it prescribes the same remedies against bad 
dreams as Varaha does.

The Dharmasindhu (pp. 359-360) collects in one place 
numerous dreams that are lucky or auspicious and that are 
unlucky or inauspicious and then prescribes (p, 361) the rem- 
edies to avert the consequences of unlucky dreams vie worship 
of the Sun with the mantra (.ftg II 28.10, Tai S. IV. 14-123) 
' king Yaruna ! protect us from the danger which my helper 
or friend declares to me (from what I saw) in a dream or from 
the thief or wolf who desires or is ahout to injure us ' ; or one 
may recite inaudibly the verse ' Adha svapnasya' (Bg. 1. 120.12) 
or perform a sraddha like the one on Amavasya, or should 
recite the Saptasati in honour of Candl or the thousand names 
of Visnu or recite or listen to the recitation of the liberation 
of Gajendra in the Bharata or Bhagavata. 

All ancient countries and peoples believed in dreams and 
satisfied their curiosity to know the future by interpreting 
them. The Chaldean astrologers and dream-interpreters were in 
high favour at Babylonian and Assyrian courts The Book of 
Daniel (chap 2) tells us how Nebuchadnezzar, a great king of 
Babylon, asked the Chaldeans not only to interpret dreams but 
commanded them on threat of death to make known to him the 
dream which he had forgotten and then to interpret it. Plato, the 
greatest of the Greek philosophers, regards dreams as important 
physical and psychic symptoms while certain dreams are con- 
ceded as of supernatural origin and explains in his Timaeus (chap. 
46 and 47 ) that dreams are prophetic visions received by the 
lower appetitive soul ( through the liver ). In JR AS ( old series ) 
vol 16 pp. 118-171 IT. Bland contributes a long and inter- 
esting article on ' the Mahomedan science of Tabir or inter- 
pretation of dreams * There are striking parallels between the 
rules to be observed by the dreamer and by the interpreter and 
the principles of interpretation (of dreams) by contraries and 
by dependence upon the religion, country and bodily conditions 
Isuch as total fast or full stomach) of the dreamer. On p. 141 
of JRAS there is an interesting account of a dream of Nushirwan 
aSassaman-king (531-579 A. D.), who saw a dream that he 
orank from a golden goblet and that a black hog put its 
aead m the goblet and drank from it. Then we are told 
auzurmihr his minister, whom he consulted, told him it signi- 
ned that his favourite princess had a black slave who was her

Vazh's interpretation was verified.' The name of theVazir 
remarkably agrees in sound with the name Varahamihira and 
it is not very fantastic to suppose that Varahamihira, probably 
the most famous astrologer and astronomer of early times in 
India, had been patronized by Kushirvan and held a high 
position in his court Chronology is quite in favour of this 
identification since Varahamihira takes saka 427 ( 505 A D.} as 
the starting point for finding out the ahai gana. 

In modern 1261 times many educated people think dreams as 
of no consequence whatever, while there are others who regard 
dreams as almost infallible indicators of coming events; there is 
also a third class of people who are willing to listen to the argu- 
ments advanced on behalf of the interpreters of dreams and also 
of those who regard thoughts on the use and value of dreams as 
frivolous To those who want to hear arguments on both sides 
and to form a judgment of their own about dreams, I would 
recommend the 'Fabric of Dreams' by Catherine Taylor 
Craig ( Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, London, 1918 ) ; Freud's 
' Interpretation of dreams ' is the most important of his works, 
in which he develops his psycho-analytio technique. Then 
there is the work ' Second sight in daily life 'by W H. W. 
Sabine who has a theory of his own. His work deals witn 
precognition ( or foreknowledge ) which according to him is a sub- 
division of Extra-sensory perception He propounds the theory 
that the mind comprises of not only normal memory appearing to 
derive from physical perception but also ' anticipatory memory 
deriving from the Basic Experience which from time to time 
passes to some degree into conscious awareness Time is one and 
does not exist except as a verbal convenience and that what we 
call 'future' has already happened but it is not indicated m 
what form it has happened Considerations of spaoe and rele- 
vance preclude further discussion of this subject here 

Certain other interesting santis will now be described.

(pp 241-268) on 'two illustrated manuscripts on dreams', the contents o 
■which do not attempt any elaborate theory about dreams but recor 
empirical observations on dreams for the guidance of people in general.

is born to a person a santi has to be performed when he sees the 
face of the great-grandson. The sankalpa 126J is given below. 
He should perform the rites beginning with the worship of 
Ganesa and ending with Matrpuja, then establish a jar full 
of water and worship (the image of ) Varuna therein, perform 
the rite of nlrajana mi to the accompaniment of the sound of 
drums, sit on a seat of udumbara tree covered with a blanket 
and should request brahmanas to sprinkle sacred water on his 
person. The hrahmanas should sprinkle water on him to the 
accompaniment of a hymn to Varuna and a hymn to the Ganges. 
At the end of the abhi seka the performer should give up old 
garments and wear new ones and should worship the Ganges. 
Melted ghee should be put in a vessel of bronze and the performer 
should see the reflection of his face therein and then should see 
the face of his great-grandson in the light of a lamp placed in a 
golden vessel. Then he should sprinkle drops of water on the 
great-grandson with one hundred flowers of gold Then he 
should sprinkle the great-grandson with water from the jar used 
for abhseka. For completing the ceremony of seeing the face 
of the grandson, he should donate a cow and feed hrahmanas 
according to his means. Then he should worship an image of 
Visnu, offer payasa to it and address the following prayer 126s 
'O Visnu. '. by your favour I have seen the face of my great-grand- 
son. Therefore, O Lord 1 in all ways and always do what I desire'. 
Then the image should be donated with the mantra 'by the dona- 
tion of the image (of Visnu) may all evil influences of planets 
be always conjured away in the case of the child, O enemy of 
Kamsa and the Lord of the worlds,' and he should donate to the 
brahmanas the ghee in which he saw his face. 

One of the santis that is frequently performed even in these 
daysis'TJdakasanti'. It is performed for averting the conse- 
quenoes of many happenings and for securing certain Benefits

such as good health, the removal of the diseases due to the three 
constituent elements of the human body, viz. bile, phlegm and 
tata (wind ), that may have already arisen or are likely to arise, 
or for mitigating all the trouble that is caused by planets 
occupying unfavourable positions from the lagna in a person's 
horoscope or from the i ah of his birth, for removing the impurity 
on birth or death in one's house or family, for securing a happy 
life Therefore, the sankalpa may assume various forms that 
are noted below 1Z66 In modern times this is a very elaborate 
rite in which a very large number of Vedic verses are repeated 
and which takes up about three hours for its performance. 
Therefore, even a brief resume of the modern procedure is not 
attempted here But one of the oldest available descriptions of 
this rite contained in the Baudhayana-grhya-sesasutra (1. 14) is 
set out here m order to convey an idea of this santi. As the 
Baudhayana-sutras are closely connected with the Taittiriya- 
samhita and Brahmana the references to mantras and texts are 
cited as far as possible from that Samhita and Brahmana. Many 
of the mantras occur also in the Rgveda and other samhitas 
Here are the texts; waters indeed are faith, (when a priest takes 
water) he begins (the rite with) faith itself, waters are indeed 
the sacrifice, he begins sacrifice itself ; water is indeed thunder- 
bolt, he strikes the thunderbolt against enemies; waters are 
destroyers of malignant spirits ( and it is taken) for destroying 
evil spirits , waters are the favourite abode ( or seat ) of the gods, 
waters are indeed nectar, therefore people sprinkle with water 
him who faints; waters are indeed all gods; he begins with 
gods Waters indeed are well disposed, he (priest) removes 
with the kindly (waters) the pain of this person (the Bacrificer); 
this is (what) the Brahmana (text) says 

Therefore (the priest) prepares propitiatory 1267 water with 
two htisa? dipped therein One should commence a santi on the 
naksatra of (a person's birth) or on an auspicious naksatra or 
when auspicious rites are to be performed, viz marriage, a (child s) 
tonsure, upanayana, Vedic student's return home, hairpartingfof 
a pregnant woman), establishment of the Vedic fires and other

rites, or when a planet is eclipsed, or when a planet indicates a 
portent, or when danger comes (to a person) from bipeds or 
quadruped animals. 1268 He should make an even number of brah- 
manas wash well their hands and feet and make them sip water, 
seat them on seats in each of the directions, should smear with cow- 
dung a four-cornered altar of the extent of a bull's hide, should him- 
self sit on dm blias with face towards the east, should hold darbhas 
and durva grass, have two kusas in his hand, should sprinkle with 
water the altar made by him, should draw lines thereon and 
sprinkle water over them and should spread over it durva grass 
and darbhas and sprinkle it with water scented with sandalwood 
paste and cover it with flowers, should wrap with (cotton) 
threads the sacred vessel 126Sa of palasa leaves and place it on 
them (darbhas and durva) with the mantra 'brahma jajnanam' 
(Tai. S. IV. 2. 8. 2). Then he pours water across the two blades 
of darbha grass and mutters * tat-savitur-varenyam ' (Bg. HE. 62. 
10) and throws in (the water) whole grains of rice and yavas 
with the formula 'bhur-bhuvah-suvarom' (Tai. K. X. 2.1). Then he 
spreads around flowers, durva grass and fruits, covers it (jar) with 
dfirvas and darbhas and touches with the verse 'san-no devlr' 
(Rg. X. 9. 4). When the brahmanas have placed themselves 
besides the officiating priest, he mutters the verse 'tat-savitur- 
varenyam' ($g.X. 62. 10) separately by each foot and by half 
verse in one breath and mutters the .first words of (all) the 
Vedas. Then he recites the following 1269 viz. the anuvaka 
beginning with 'krnusva pajah' (Tai. S. I. 2. 14) but omit- 
ting the hah" verse 'made oid-asya' (Tai. S. I. 2.14.7), the

sprinkled with the mixture Similarly, the Matsya ^ prescribes 
for one in whose birth rasi an eclipse takes place a sacred bath 
with water from four jars full of water in which earth from the 
stables of horses, elephants, from an ant-hill, from a confluence, 
a deep reservoir of water, from a cowpen and from entrance of 
a palace is cast, and also paficagatya, five jewels, rocana, lotuses, 
sandalwood, saffron, usira, guggulu; mantras also are to ac- 
company the bath; Indra, Varuna, Kubera and other gods are 
invoked for removing the evil results of eclipses. 

If a person suffers from fever the Madanaratna( folio 11) 
provides for santis for the tithis (from the first onwards) on 
which the fever started, derived from Baudhayana in which the 
presiding deity of each tithi is to be offered worship (puja) and 
homa, for each of which the mantra ( of which japa is to be 
made) is different, and the incense, flowers, naivedya also are 
different There are also santis, when a person suffers from 
fever, about the weekday on which the fever started and images 
of the presiding deity of the weekday made of different metals 
according to the name of the day are to be worshipped with 
different mantras (Madanaratna, folio 12a). For example, if 
fever started on a Sunday or on a Monday, then the images of 
Eudra (for Sunday ) and Parvatl (for Monday ) were to be made 
of gold or silver and the mantras to be recited were respectively 
■ya te Eudra* (Tai S IV. 5. 1. 1 ), 'gaurlr-mimaya' (Eg 1 16* 
il). The gandlva, flowers, incense, lamp and nanedya were 
different in each case. If the fever starts on any one of the 
37 naksatras, the Madanaratna (folios 12b-15b) prescribes 
santis for all the 27 naksatras, specifying the deity of each 
naksatra, the figure of the deity, its colour, mantra, the five 
upacaras from gandha, the kinds of fuel-sticks to be employed, 
the ffliutts, the gifts &c If the mantra 1176 be not known, the

disease. The Madanratna (folios 15b-20b) quotes from Atreya

in each naksatra, whether a naksatra is masculine, feminine or 
neuter, its figure, colour, deity, tree, its gam™ 6 * (whether 
demgava or raksasagana or manusyagana), what actions should 
be done on each, the Visanadl of each. 

The Dharmasindhu provides a santi for the extremely rare 
occurrence of a person coming to life after people thinking 
him to be dead take his body for cremation to a cemetery. The 
person in whose house such a person enters meets death. There- 
fore, a homa should be performed wherein eight thousand 
udumbara fuel-sticks anointed withmilk and ghee are to be offered 
to the accompaniment of the Qayatrl mantra ( Bg. HI. 62. 10 ). 
At the end of the homa a kapila cow and a bronze vessel full 
of sesame should be donated to a brahmana; the bronze vessel 
should weigh 81 palas or 40$ or 20ior9, 6 or at least three 
palas according 1277 to one's means. 

Some works prescribe a santi on the delivery of a cow in 
the month of Bhadrapada, of a she-buffalo in Pausa and of a 
mare by day. The santi is to be performed with 108 ahutis of 
ghee and sesame, the Asyavamiya hymn (Kg. L 164) and the 
mantra 'tad-Visnoh' (Bg. I 22. 20 ) are to be recited. It was 
supposed that if a she-buffalo was delivered in Magha and on 
a Wednesday, or a mare in Sravana by day or a cow while the

Sun is in the Lion sign, that portends death of the im owner in 
six months. It may be stated that in the author's boyhood such 
santis, particularly in the case of she-buffaloes, were performed. 
The Adbhutasagara provides that the sJnti should be performed 
on the 4th, 9th, 12th or 14th tithi, as these are declared to be 
auspicious ttthis for adbhuta-santi 1279 

In modern times the entrance into a newly built house is 
preceded on the same day or on a previous day by a santi called 
Vastusanti I2S0 or Vfistu-samana ( in Matsya 268 3 ) It has 
been described at some length m H of Dh vol. II. pp 834-836. 
The description 128 °" there is based on Matsya, chapters 256 and 
268. Vastusamana is also described in the Asvalayana grbya 
IE. 9 6-9, Par gr. III. 4 5-18, Baud gr III 5 ( which are cert- 
ainly older than Matsya by several centuries), in Baudhayana- 
grhyasesa-sutra I 18, the Satnavidhana-br3hmana III. 3. 5 and 
several medieval works. The Baud Gr S S calls it Grhasanti 
and recommends that it be performed every month, every season 
or every year in the bright fortnight on an auspicious naksatra 
by one who desires prosperity in his house. It is therefore 
passed over here. The &.sv. gr is very brief. It says 12S1 Then

he makes the house santa (as follows). He deposits gold in 
water that has rice and baTley thrown into it, he sprinkles 
the house three times going round it with his right side turned 
towards it with the santatlya hymn ( Bg. VII. 35 ) and he does 
so again three times pouring out an unbroken stream of water 
with the three verses *0 waters! you are wholesome' (Rg. X. 
9.1-3). In the middle of the house he cooks boiled rice, offers 
from it four oblations with each of the four verses 'Vastospate 
pratijanlhyasman ' (Rg. "vTL 54. 1-3 and VII. 55. 1), should then 
prepare food, should feed the brahmanas with it and make them 
say 'lucky is the house, lucky is the house.' Some details from 
Baud. Gr. (III. 5) may be mentioned here. It provides that 
oblations are offered from cooked food with the invitatory prayer 
(Puronuvakya) 'Vastospate pratijanlhi' ('O Lord of houses! 
accept us as your devotees,' ( Bg. VTL 54. 1, Tai. S. HI. 4. 10. 1 ) 
and the offering prayer (Yajya) with 'Vastospate sagmaya' 
(0 Lord of houses, may we be endowed with fellowship with 
thee &c.' Rg VII. 54. 3, Tai. S. III. 4 10. 1) Then he offers 
ahvtis of clarified butter with the mantras viz. 'Vastospate 
dhruva sthuna' (Rg. VHX 17, 14), 'grhyam bhayam yac-ced', 1282 
' aksispande-angacale,' 'duh-svapne papasvapne', 'Vastospate 
pratarano' (O Vastospati 1 mayst thou be our saviour ', Rg. 
VEL 54. 2 ), ' amlvaha Vastospate ' ( O Vastospati I Mayst thou be 
our friend destroying diseases' Rg. VII 55. 1 ). Then he places 
the remainder of the food from which offerings were made on 
bunches of darbhas in front of the Fire with the words 'salutation 
to Rudra Vastospati 1 I offer ( oblations to him ) who protects 
when we approach, or run, walk out, depart, turn round.or return.' 
Having brought together in a plate the water for cleansing 
the cooking vessel, the remainder of the clarified butter and the 
water (used in the rite) he sprinkles water therefrom on all 
sides with a twig of udumbara or palasa or sami tree or with 
a handful of darbhas, he goes round the house thrice with his 
right side towards it with the verse 'tvam viprah' (Rg. IX. 18. 
2). He prepares food, honours the brahmatias (with food and 
fees), makes them recite blessings in the words 'lucky is the 
) house, lucky is the house'.

Various prognostications were based on the sounds produced 
by the house lizard (called pallt, palhka, kudyamatsya or 
grhagodhtka), by its movements and by its fall on the several 
limbs of a person by Vasantaraja sakuna, chap, 17 (32 verses), 
the AdbhutasSgara pp. 666-668 (quoting 28 verses of Vasanta- 
raja), Jyotistattva pp. 706-707, Santiratna or Santi-kamalakara 
(folio 198), the Dharmasindhu (pp. 347-348). A few wordB 
based on the last two are set out here. A fall of the lizard on 
the right side of a male and on his head (except the chin), 
chest, navel and stomaoh is auspicious, while in the case of a 
woman such a fall would be auspicious on the left side. The 
same applies to a chameleon If a lizard or chameleon falls on 
a limb or creeps up a person's limb the person should take a bath 
with clothes on and perform a santi for removal of the inauspi- 
ciousness or for increase of auspiciouBness If a person has a 
mere contact with a house lizard or chameleon he should bathe, 
drink paficagavya, look into clarified butter, should pay honour 
to (a golden image of) the lizard or chameleon clothed in a red 
piece of cloth, offer to the image gandha and flowers, worship 
Rudra in a jar full of water, offer into fire 108 fuel sticks 
of khadtra tree to the accompaniment of the Mrtyunjaya 1282 * 
mantra and offer 1008 or 108 ahutis of sesame into fire with 
the vyahrlts and perform the rites from svistakrt to sprinkling 
with drops of water and then donate gold, clothes and sesame 12826 

The Yogayatra chap. 7 (verses 1-12) and Hemadri on Vrata 
(voLII pp 894-897 ) mention ceremonial baths on and worship 
of naksatras from AsvinI to RevatI and their presiding deities as 
yielding various benefits The SLtharvana-parisista I (called 
naksatrakalpa) sections 37-50 deal with naksatrasnana from 
Krttika to BharanI Sections 37-41 contain the mantras 
employed in worshipping and placating the presiding deities 
of the naksatras beginning with Krttika. Section 42 describes 
the general procedure of naksatrasnana; sections 43-45 set oat 

1282a Mrtyunjaya mantra is the Tryambaka mantra, according to 
Vidyakara quoted in Jyotistattva (p 707) The Tryambaka mantra is 
•Tryambakam yajamahe' (Eg. VII. 59 12, Tai. S I 8 6 2, Vaj. S. HI, 60) 

1282b. It is somewhat remarkable that Vasantaraja is entirely silent 
about the fall of the house lizard on a person's body and devotes thirty-two 
verses merely to the interpretation of the sounds of the lizard in differ 
directions and at different times of the day and to the prognostications deri- 
ved from us movements on the walls It is not unlikely that prognostication 
from the fall of the lizard on a man's limb was a later development

the substances to be added to the water for each naksatrasn&na 
and the benefit to be derived from so doing. Sections 47-50 
contain special rules in relation to each naksatra from Krttika 
to Bharani, about the distribution of food to brahmanas and 
gifts to be made on each naksatra together with the rewards to 
be expected therefrom. But the Brhatsamhita chap. 47 (1-87 ), 
-the Atharvana-pariiista V pp. 66-88, Visnudharmottara II. 103, 
Yogayatra (VII. 13-21), the Kalikapurana chap. 89, and 
Hemadri ( on Vrata vol. II. pp. 600-628 ) speak of a santi called 
Pusyasnana or Pusyabhiseka. It is said that Brhaspati per- 
formed this santi for Indra, then Vrddha-GaTga got it and he 
imparted it to Bhaguri. Most of the above works confine it to 
the king, since the king is the very root of the tree — the 
-subjects — and since any hama to or welfare of that root ( the king) 
results in misfortune or welfare of the people; therefore care 
must be taken for the increase of the king's welfare. 1283 As the 
treatment in the Brhatsamhita is the fullest and is among the 
most ancient descriptions, it is briefly set out here. The royal 
astrologer and family priest should perform the rite of Pusya- 
snana for the king, than which there is nothing more holy and 
nothing more destructive of all evil portents. This may be per- 
formed on pusya-naksatra every time, but the Santi on this day 
when theJBull Moon is in Pusya-naksatra is the highest and if 
such a snana is performed without there being Pusya naksatra on 
that day, then it yields only half the fruit. There is no utpata 
which is not averted or mitigated by this santi and there is 
no other auspicious rite which surpasses this. About Pusya

all quadrupeds, so is Pusya the most; powerful among naksatras ; 
undertakings begun on Pusya succeed even if the Moon be un- 
favourable oi be gocara. Then Varahamihira states in very 
poetic verses (47. 4-15) that the Pusyasnana of the king should 
be perfoimed in a sylvan spot abounding in young and beautiful 
trees emitting fragrance and free from trees having thorns or 
trees like marking nut or from owls, vultures and the like or 
on rivers or on lakes or near lotus pools or near a cow-house 
or seashore or hermitages of sages, grand mansions resounding 
with the sweet cries of cuckoos and the like or near a holy 
Bhrine or tlrtha or a spot beautified by parks Then the astro- 
loger, the councillors and officiating priests should go out from 
the capital at night and make an offering (bah) in the East, 
North or North-east and the royal family priest, being himself 
pure and bowing down, should invoke with fried grains, aksata, 
barley, curds and flowers and with a mantra 1285 the gods, the 
(guardians of) quarters, the nagas and brahmanas to be present 
at the spot and then say ' tomorrow you will receive worship and 
depart after conferring welfare on the king'. The family priest 
and the others should stay in order to find the auspicious nature 
or otherwise of the dreams (of the king). On the next day in 
the morning they should collect materials (for the Pusyasnana) 
on the spot chosen the previous day* He should draw a mandala 
(a diagram) there and should place thereon various jewels and 
should assign places to nagas, yaksas, gods, pitrs, gandharvas, 
apsarases, sages, siddhas, planets, naksatras, Kudras, the matrs, 
Skanda, Visnu, Visakha, Lokapalas, goddesses (such as LaksmI, 
Gaurl, Indranl), which should all be drawn with charming 
coloured powders or chalk &c , should offer them worship with 
sandal wood paste, flowers &c, with various edibles, fruits and 
meat, with drinks viz. wine, milk and decoctions, he should 
follow the procedure of Grahayajna and worship the various 
deities invited with appropriate foods, incense, clarified butter, 
flowers, with lauds and salutations &c (verses 30-33). Then he 
should set up Agni on an altar to the west or south of the 
mandala drawn by him, should kindle it into flames and bring 
near it the materials and darbhas He should offer worship on 
the altar to the west with fried grams, ghee, curds, honey, white 
mustard, fragrant substances, floweis, incense, fruits, and should 
donate plates full of putjasa and ghee Then in the four inter-

necks of which ate surrounded with white thread and that are 
covered with leaves, twigs and fruits of trees having milky sap 
and filled with water mixed with herbs and materials for pusya- 
snSna and jewels. In verses 39-42 Varakamihira names about 
15 plants the leaves 1286 of which are to be oast in the jars and 
also seeds and sanausadhis, sarvagandhas, bilva fruit &c. He 
should spread an old bull's hide with its neck to the east on the 
altar and thereon be should spread the reddish hide of a bull 
trained for fighting, the hides of a lion and a tiger one over the 
other, when the Moon is in Pusya-naksatra and there is an 
auspicious muhurla Over the hides a throne made of gold, 
silver, copper or of a tree with a milky sap should be placed. The 
king should occupy the throne after placing thereon a piece of 
gold, surrounded by his ministers, men of his confidence, the 
family priest, the astrologer, the citizens that have auspicious 
names (such or JayarSja, SimharSja &c. ). 

There should be loud noises (for drowning inauspicious 
sounds) made by the bards and citizens and of the tabors and 
drams and of Vedic recitations. The king should wear linen and 
the piirohita should cover the king with a blanket, drops should 
be sprinkled over the king from jaTs, 3, 28 or 108 in number, 
containing clarified butter, with two mantras 1287 praising its 
power to remove evil and then the priest removes the blanket

Atharvakalpa, 1289 the Rudragana mantras, Eusmanda mantras,

the king should take a bath and wear two cotton garments over 
whioh the three verses 'Apohistha' (Eg. X 9 1-3, Tai. S. IV.

decorations that lead to victory, that confer long life and vigour 
and over which the ESyasposa 1290 ( bestowing increase of wealth)

declare the prognostications derived 1290a from the flames of the 
sacred Agni as laid down in the chapter on the festival of 
Indra's banner (Br. S. 42. 31-36). Then the purohita with 
folded hands should pray 1291 'May all the groups of gods 
receive the worship from the king and depart after conferring 
(on him) abundant prosperity and returning ( when again in- 
voked)'. Then the king should honour the astrologer and the 
purohita with plenty of wealth and ( honour ) according to their 
deserts also others, viz. men learned in the Veda and the like 
who are well worthy of receiving gifts. Then the king should 
assure safety to all subjects, (order the) release of all animals 
taken to slaughter houses and release all persons put in jail 
except those guilty of offences against the king's person or his 
harem. VaTahamihira adds ( 47. 85 ) that this procedure of 
Pusyasnana is commended for a king who aspires after imperial 
dignity or who ardently desires a son or when he is first crowned 
king. He further states that this very procedure of ceremonial 
bath should be employed in the case of the king's elephants and 
horses that then become free from diseases (verse 87 ). 

A. few remarks from other works may be added here. The 
Yoga-yatra (chap. VH. 13-14) lays down 129 * that in the 
ceremonial bath clay should be collected from a mountain top, 
ant-hill, a river mouth, the two banks of a river, the foot of the 
Indra figure ( in the Indradhvaja festival), ( clay) dug up by the 
tusk of an elephant and by a bull's horn, ( clay) from the royal 
palace-door and from the door of the house of a dancing girl 
(patronized by the king) and the king's head should be purified

clay from an ant-hill, his sides with clay from the two banks of 
a river and from its confluence with the sea, his neck with clay 
from the foot of the Indra figure, his arms with earth on the tip 
of the elephant's tusk and the bull's horns, his chest with earth 
from the door of the palace and his waist with clay from a royal 
courtezan's door. It will be noticed that there is a suggestive 
symbolism in all this. The king is to bold his head high and to 
attain eminence , therefore his head is to be rubbed with day 
from a mountain peak. 

It appears that naksatrasnana was meant for alL For 
example, the iLtharvana-parisista 1293 on naksatrakalpa (sec. 43 
p. 22 ) states that a Vaisya should undergo ceremonial bath on 
RohinI, being decked with all seeds, while verse 6 of the same 
section maintains that a brahmana who undergoes Pusyasnana 
thrice with a thousand grains of red paddy and with a thousand 
mustard grains and with (twigs and leaves) of SahasravSrys, 
AnantI plants and with MadayantX and Priyangu plants acquires 
as much fame as a king. 

From the Matsya-purana it is clear 1291 that Pusyasnana 
was an item in Laksahoma, undertaken by the king to counter- 
act the evil effects of planets. That Purana has a chapter ( 267. 
verses 3-4) on Devatasnana 1295 where also provision is made for 
casting clay into the jar, clay being collected from the tusk of 
an elephant, from a horse (stable), public road, ant-hill, (clay ) 
dug up by a boar (with its tusk), from the shed where sacred 
fire is kept, from a tlrtha (holy spot), cowpen and from the place 
where cows crowd. 

The Visnudharmottara (IT. 103. 1-10 ) provides that Barhas- 
patyasnana ( i. e. Pusyasnana, Brhaspati being the presiding 
deity of Pusya) should be performed in the bright half, in the

Proper time for Pusyasnana 799 

northern passage of the sun, on an auspicious day, naksatra and 
muhurta or when the moon is in Pusya or RohinI naksatra or 
inHastaor Sravana; two square mandalas of eight cubits on 
each of four sides should be made, one for offering bait and the 
other for an altar on which a fire is to be established, both 
being decked with various things. Four jars with waters of 
springs should be placed in each of the two mandalas, and also 
seven jars filled with seeds, corn and precious stones, one for 
being decked with leaves of trees and the other with flowers and 
fruits. It appears (verses 1&-13 ) that the YisnudharmottaTa 
contemplates Pusyasnana for the three higher varnas, 1796 since 
it provides that a brahmana should sit on the hide of a bull as 
his seat, a ksatriya may employ the hides of a lion and tiger 
and a vaisya on the hides of a tiger and leopard. It provides 
mantras other than those mentioned by VaTahamihira. It 
provides that this rite of Pusyasnana should go on for seven 
days and that the person undergoing it should give up during 
those daya wine, meat, honey and sexual intercourse (verse 29 J. 
This Pusyasnana drives away all ill-luck, destroys evil spirits, 
brightens the intellect, confers health, brilliance and fame, 
kills enemies, is auspicious, destroys sins and the evil effects of 
strife and bad dreams ( verses 30-31 ). 

^ It should be borne in mind that a rite on Pusya for pros- 
perity called Pusya-vrata is mentioned by so early a work as 
the Apastambadharma-sutra (for which p 346 above may be 
referred to ).

lave followed the Matsya. They all agree that throbbing 1197 of 
the right side of the body is auspicious and of the left inauspi- 
cious in the case of males, while the reverse is true in the case 
of women. They all set out the consequences indicated by the 
throbbing of the several parts and limbs of the body from the 
top of the head to the soles of the feet. To set out all these in 
detail would occupy much space. A few are mentioned by way 
of illustration. The fruit indicated by the throbbing of the top 
of the 1293 head is the acquisition of land (or earth), of the 
forehead, the prosperity of the position already occupied; of the 
region between the eyebrows and nose, union with persons dear 
to one; of the region of the eye, death, of the portion near the 
eye the acquisition ot wealth, of the upper arm, union with 
friends; of the hand, the acquisition of wealth; of the back, 
defeat; of the chest, success; of the upper part of the foot, the 
securing of a position; of the soles, journey with gain therein. 
The Matsya-purana 1299 prescribes that when inauspicious indica- 
tions (by throbbing) ooour, brahmanas should be placated with 
the gift of gold. 

Irom ancient times the throbbing of the limbs, particularly 
of the arm and eye, have been regarded in India as the harbin- 
gers of coming events, auspicious or inauspicious. Manu 
prohibits a sannyasm (panvrSjake) from obtaining alms by 
means of declaring prognostications from utpatas or nimittas, 
from naksatras and from Angavidya etc In the Sakuntala

Thi-cfohng of arms and eyes 801 

Kalidasa twice mentions the throbbing of the arm of the hero as 
indicative of good fortune and the throbbing of tbe right eye of 
Sakuntala as presaging 1300 misfortune. Shakespeare in " Othello " 
makes Desdemona speak about the itching of her eyes as a bad 
omen The Brhad-yogayatra (XIII. 10), Br. S. (51.10) and 
Vasantaraja declare that the throbbing of moles, boils, marks, 
eruptions (on limbs) are to be deemed to indicate consequences 
similar to tbe limbs on which they exist. 1301 

The Brhatsarhhita ( chap 93 verses 1-14 ), BrhadyogayatrS 
(chap. SI verses 1302 1-21 ) and Yogayatra ( chap. 10 verses 1-75 ) 
dwell at length on the prognostications to be drawn from the 
arrangement of the tusks of elephants, from the marks seen 
when the tusks are cut, from the tired appearance and move- 
ments of elephants, particularly when the king is to march on 
an invasion, since as the Yogayatra says the king's victory 
depends on elephants 1303 These, however, do not describe any 
santiand are hence passed over here as not relevant to the 
subject of santis. But the Agnipurana ( chap. 291 verses 1-24), 
Visnudharmottara (3X 50. 1-93), Baud, grhyasesasutra I 20 and 
Hemadri (on Vrata, vol II. pp. 1036-1051) prescribe santis for 
removing diseases of elephants and therefore a brief note is 
added here from Baud, grhyasesa-sutra, which is probably the 
earliest and simplest description of a Gajasanti 

"On the 8th or 11th or 14th tithi of the bright half of a

make them declare 'it is an auspicious day, let there he welfare, 
let there be prosperity,' should Brat (or 'towards the east') take 
out for offering havis sesame and rice grains, bring water after 
repeating the Gayatrl verse (Rg. Ill 62.10), should cover two 
jars with a new piece of cloth with the Gayatrl, should close the 
mouths of the jara with some fruit (a cocoanut or the like) and 
keep the boiled food towards the west and place (the two jars) 
on a bunch of five durvas. Then after the elephant stable is 
decked with wreathB of darbhas the elephant inhales the smell of 
the food offered in fire. He then makes ready a spoon of Asvattha 
wood and fuel and darbha grass. Then he goes through the 
items of ordinary homo. UM from drawing lines onwards and 
offers oblations of the boiled food with ghee to the accompani- 
ment of the Ghrtasukta ixs (Rg.VHI.8L 1-9). Then (the 
priest) offers 1008 additional ahuhs with clarified butter with 
the five mantras beginning with 'namas-te Rudra manyave' 
( Rudra 1 adoration to you that are fury incarnate' Tai. S. IV. 
5, 1. 1-5 ), Then the procedure from Svistakrt offering to the 
gift of the cow (should be gone through). He puts down on 
bunches of durva graSB the remaining portion of the food from 
which offerings were made in front of the sacred Agni with the 
words 'svaha to the bhutas ' (spirits). Then he (priest) makes 
(the elephant) eat what remains of the food cooked in the sthuli 
(pan or cooking vessel) and the bunch of five durvas (on which 
the jars had been placed) to the accompaniment of the .ayusya- 
sukta; 13X he sprinkles drops from the pranlts m7 water with the

Gaja&anti 803 

thiee veises beginning with 'Spo hi sths' (£tg. X. 9. 1-3, Tai. S. 
IV. 1. 3. 1-3) and the four veises beginning with 'Hiranyavarnah ' 
(Tai. S.V. 6. 1.1-4), purifies (the elephant with water) to the 
accompaniment of the anuvaka beginning with 'pavamanah 
suvarjanah' (Tai. Br. 1.4.8.1); he then leads the elephant to 
its place (stable); the elephant becomes long-lived; so says the 
adorable Baudhayana." 

The Gajasanti in Agnipurana (chap, 291) is entirely differ- 
ent from the above. One should worship on the 5 th tithi of the 
bright half Visnu, LaksmI, the Airavata 1303 elephant and the other 
elephants (in all eight) and Brahma, Sankara, Indra, Kubera, 
Yama, the Sun and the Moon, Varuna, Vayu, Agni, the Earth 
and Akasa. The elephants should be sprinkled with santyudaka 
(propitiatory water). The Agnipurana proposes an elaborate 
worship, on a lotus-shaped diagram drawn on an altar, of several 
gods, several weapons, sages, rivers and mountains &c., elephants 
&c. and provides that an astrologer should ride the principal 
elephant of the king and say into its ear 'you are made the 
chief of elephants, the king will honour you with gandha, flowers, 
best food and people at the order of the king will honour you; 
you should protect the king in battle, in his journey and in his 
palace. You should forget that you are a mere beast and revolve 
m your mind that you are divine 1 ' &c. The king should then 
nde such an elephant and armed warriors should follow and 
various gifts should be made to the elephant keeper, the astrol- 
oger, the Searya &c. 

The Visnudharmottara (II. 50. 1-S3 ) is far more elaborate 
man even the Agnipurana. Its verses about the words to be 
muttered in the ear of the elephant (II. 50. 59-64) are the same 
as those in the Agni ( 291, 15-20 ). The Visnudharmottara adds 

Oft ' tllat tMs §anti should not be Permed on the 4th, 

atn or 14th tithi nor on Tuesday nor on Saturday and the com- 
mended naksatras are Jyestha, Oitra and Sravana and that this 
santi nte for elephants destroys all danger to elephants.

those verses occur in tho Hasty&yurvoda (Snandssramaod. 
ohaptors 35 and 36. Considerations of apace and of importance 
prevent any description of that sSnti derived from tho Hasty- 
ayurveda. 

The Brhatsamhita (chap 92. 1-14 ), tho Brhadyogayatra (22. 
1-21 ) and the Yogayatra( XI. 1-14) deal with tho movoments 
neighing, prancing, striking tho ground with hoofs, postures 
of horses from which lucky or unlucky consequences aro to be 
inferred. But they do not describe any santi and thorefoTe aro 
passed over. Tho Agnipurana (chap 290, 1-8), tho Visnu- 
dharmottara (tt 47. 1-42), Baud, grhysosasutra L 19 and 
Hetnadri (on vrata, vol. IL pp 1031-36 taken from Salihotra) 
describe a santi which orerts all dangors to hoTSOs and removes 
their diseases. 

The santi from Baudhayana is as follows:-— "having 
carried out the usual details of an ordinary homa from drawing 
the lines onwards (the priest) offers into Agni oblations from 
the cooked food after reciting tho puronuvikyS (invitatory 
prayer) 'tadasvinasvayujopayatSm' (May tho Asvins that yoke 
horses come near, Tai. Br 111 1. 2. 10) and the y5jy5 (offering 
prayer) 'yaudevanSm hhisajau' ('that aro physicians of the 
gods', Tai. Br. BX 1. 2. 11). Then he makes additional offerings 
with clarified butter ' siaha to Asvins, svaha to the two that yoke 
horses, stahU to the ear, svaha to hearing' ( Tai Br. BT. 1. 6. 13) 
Then he performs all details from svistakrt offering to the gift 
of a cow. Then he put3 down on Asvattha leaves in front of 
Agni the food remaining after the offering of cooked food with 
the mantra ' yo asvatthah ... ketubhih saha ' ( Tai Br. 1. 2. 1. 8- 
9 ) He brings together in a plate tho water with whioh the 
sthall is washed, the remainder of the clarified butter and of the 
water, sprinkles drops from it with an Asvattha twig and goes 
round the horses thrice with his right towards the horses with 
the anuvaka beginning with 'yo va asvasya medhyasya lomani 
veda' (he who knows the hair of the holy horse) So Bald the 
adorable Baudhayana." 

Ssntis are connected with salcunas also. The word sakuna 
means 'a bird 'in the Bgveda (IV. 36. 6, IX 86 13,1X96.19 
and 23, IX. 107. 20, IX. 112 2, X 68. 7, X 123. 6, X 165. 2) and 
is a synonym of tiakum (Eg II. 42. 1, II 43. 2 and 3) and 
iakwiti (Rg IL 42. 3, H. 43. 1) In Bg X 16. 6 (yat te krenah 
sakuna atutoda) the crow is referred to as 'the dark bird*. « 
has been seen above that birds like Tcapola were regarded even 



iakunas 805 

in the Seveda as harbingers of impending evil and misfortune. 

Hence the word sakuna gradually came to mean premonition of 

evil conveyed by cries, movements, positions of birds and then 

any prognostioatory sign (not necessarily connected with buds). 

There is an extensive literature od sakunas. Some of it is 

mentioned here, viz. the Matsyapurana (chap. 337,241,243), 

Agnipurana (chap. 330-233 ), Visnudharmottarapurana H. 163- 

164, Padmapurana ( W. 100. 65-136 ), Brhat-sambita ( chap. 85- 

95),Brhad-yogayatra (chap. 23-27), Togayatra ( chap. 14 ), the 

tfimitta of Bhadrabahu (ms. in Bhau Daji collection of BBEAS 

So. 385 in Prof. Velankar's Catalogue pp. 126-127 ), Vasantaraja- 

sakuna, 1309 Manasollasa of king Somesvara Oalu kya ( 1126-1138 

1309. Vasantaraja's work on 'sakunas' was published by the Venkate- 

ivara Press, Bombay (1906 A D ). with the Sanskrit commentary of 

Bhanucandragani, who was patronized by Emperor Akbar (in the latter half of 

the 16th century A.D ) and aHindi translation by SridharJatasankaraBhatta. 

AsVasantaraja is quoted by Adbhuta-sagara which was begun in saka 1089 

(1167A.D.), it follows that Vasantaraja wonld have to be placed before 

1100 A. D. He is probably not much earlier than 700 A. D. as he does not 

appear to have been mentioned by Utpala in his extensive commentaries 

on Varahamihira's works Vasantaraja tells us (in the Introductory verses 

3-5) that he was the son of Vijayarajabhatta and Sarasvati and the younger 

brother of Sivaraja, that he was honoured by king Candradeva (king of 

Mithila, ace to the Com.). and composed the work on sakuna at the request 

of that king. He mentions (I 10) Cudamani, jyotisa-sastra, hora-sastra 

and Svarodaya and (in I. 27) informs us that Atri, Garga, Guru, Snkra. 

Vasistha, Vyasa, Kautsa, Bhrgu and Gautama were the principal ancient 

sages that declared the knowledge of sakunas for the benefit ( of human 

beings). Cudamani is rather an early work quoted in the Saravalt (5. 20 

and 39. 8 ) of Kalyanavarman in the same breath with Varahamihira. 

The Niraitta attributed to Bhadrabahu is an extensive work containing 26 
chapters and about 1460 verses. It is described in the colophon at the end as 
'naigranthe (nairgranthe?) Bhadrabahnke Nimitte svapnadhyayah'. The 
first chapter states that in the time of king Senajit at Rajagrha in Magadha 
pupils asked Bhadrabahu to expound to them the nimittas and he did so. 
He is styled (in chap. H 1 ) a digambara and the best of sramanas. The 
contents of chapters 2 to 26 are ; TJIka (meteors), halo, lightning, evening 
glow, clouds, winds and hurricanes, rain-fall, gandharvanagara (Fata 
Morgana), march of kings on invasion, portents affecting the king and the 
country due to the ripening of actions in former lives (chap XIV has 177 
verses on this), grahacara as declared by Jma (chap XV, 227 verses), the 
prognosticatory movements of Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, 
Rahu, Kern, the Sun and the Moon ; grahayuddha ; conjunctions of planets; 
dreams. It appears that the work is later than Varahamihira. As it is not 
within the pale of Dharmasastra Literature and hardly ever describes 
a santi in the way in which the Puranas and medieval dharmasastra works 
provide it has been referred to in this work only rarely,

work WGnld not be oat of place and is given here. It is drridea 

into twenty vsrgss^ 2 ^ (sections) and contains in different 

metres 1535 verses (as stated in pa-pa U. IS) It states: it 

WGnld declare the saknnas 1211 indicated in this world ~tsy groups 

of beings viz. bipeds (men and birds), cuadrnpefis (elephanfe, 

horses &c.), sin-footed (bees), eight-footed (the mythical animal

having no feet (snch as snakes) : that is called ialaina which is 

the means Gf arriving at definite knowledge abont auspicious

rewards. The work repeats the view of Yara'^aTnihrra ( in Brhat-

thorns and other ( dangerous ) things and that if fate alone be 
the deciding factor what is the use of the science of politics and 
government by following -which wise kings protect the world 
with great effort? Learned men declare that daiva (fate) is 
only the karma produced ( accumulated ) in past lives ; the liarma 
in past lives was acquired by human effort; how can one then 
say that daiva does not depend on human effort? The subjects

808 History of Dharmaiastra [ Sec. HI, Oh, 2X1 

A noticeable feature of Vasantaraja's work is that more 
than half of it (781 verses) is devoted to the sounds 1312 made by 
three birds viz. Syama (400 verses ), crow (187 ) Pingalika (200) 
and that 312 verses are devoted to the barking, movements and 
howling of dogs (verses 222) and female jackals (verses 90). 
It is remarkable that among the Saktas it is believed that a 
female jaokal is a messenger of Kali and is auspicious and on 
hearing its howl in the early morning a person should offer 
salutation and then success is in the hands of the sadhaka. The 
brief contents set out above will show that he extends the 
meaning of sakuna so as to include prognostications based on 
the actions of men and beasts. He himself says at the end 
that 1313 is sakuna, which in this world is remembered, heard, 
touched or seen or which is deolared in dreams, since they all 
yield results. He claims that the system of sakur/as is as 
authoritative as the Vedas, smrtis and puranas, since it never 
fails to convey correct knowledge. 1311 Some of his interesting 
statements may be briefly set out. If an owl hoot at night on 
the top of a house that portends 13 ' 5 sorrow and the death of the 
owner's son (VUL 40). This is in line with modern popular 
belief in India. The cawing of crows is at the head of all 
prognosticatory sounds ' The barking of dogs is the essence 
among all sakunas.' The Brhad-yogayatra 1316 provides that 
certain animals and birds are useless for prognostications at 
certain seasons viz. the rohi ta (red) deer, horse, goat, ass, deer, 
camel, hare, are useless in winter (sisira); crow and cuckoo are

difficult to say. Similarly, the Fingala bird is supposed to make five sounds

conoh), bull and birds like kraunca are useless; in Sravana 
month, the elephant and cataka bird ; in Hemanta 'early winter), 
tiger, bear, monkey, leopard, buffalo and all animals rssorting 
to holes (like snakes) are useless and so are all young ones 
except of human beings. Vasantaraja in IV. 47-48 pp. 56-57 
has the same provisions almost word for word. Vasantaraja's 
work appears to have been based mainly on Varahamihira's 
Brhat-samhita section on sakuna, chapters 85 to 95 ( 321 verses ) 
in which Varahamihira devotes 47 verses in chap. 85 to the 
cries of birds in general, deals with the movements and barking 
of dogs (88. 1-20) and female jackals (89. 1-15), the cries of 
crows (62 verses in chap. 94), to horses (92. 1-15 ), elephants (94. 
1-14) and cows (90. 1-3). 

Vasantaraja states 1317 that there are five excellent ones in 
the matter of sakunas vie the PodakI bird, dog, crow, pingala 
bird and the female jackal. SarasvatI is the presiding deity of 
podakI,Yaksa(Eubera)of dog, eagle of crow, Candi of pinga- 
lika and the friend of ParvatI of the female jackaL He further 
says that all animals and birds are presided over by deities , 
therefore a person who interprets sakunas should not kill them, 
as deities presiding over them might become angry. His state- 
ments about 'upasruti* (oracular voices or words) are worth, 
citing. ' A.t the time of piadosa or about the morning twilight 
when people are hardly speaking anything, a person that is 
ready to undertake any matter (business) should consider 
everywhere oracular voices. What a child says without being 
prompted to do so would not turn out to be untrue even at the 
end of a Yuga. No such easily understood and true sakuna 
exists for men other than upasruti * Both Manasollasa (H 13, 
verses 920-926 pp. 112-113) and Vasantaraja (VI pp. 78-80 
verses 5-12) describe a curious mode of divining the future 
called ' upasruti V»« ' When all people a re asleep and the public

road is empty of people three married women accompanied by a 

maiden should worship Gan esa (with gandha and flowers &&); then, 

after making an obeisance to Oandika they should fill a measure 

of corn like kudaw with aksata grains on which sacred mantras 

have been recited seven times; they should then place the image 

of Ganesa in that measure surrounded by the grass blades of a 

broom. They should take with them the kudava measure with 

Ganesa image inside and repair to the house of a washerman 

In front of that house they should cast white aksata grains after 

( silently ) revolving in their mind their thoughts (the matter 

they are intent on ). Then they should with concentrated mind 

listen When they hear any words coming from inside of the 

house talked by a man, a woman or a child or any one else 

uttered at pleasure ( or without restraint of any kind), auspicious, 

or inauspicious, they should consider the sense of the words 

heard and the conclusion drawn as to the future project from 

the words would not turn out to be untrue. The same method 

may be followed by approaching the house of a candala.

UpsiruU in Padmapwana 811 

A pBeular mode akin to 'upasruti' is described in the 
Padmapurana, Patalakhanda, chap. 100 verses 65-166. It is 
narrated in that chapter that Bibhlsana was put in chains by 
Dravidas when the former saw Siva-linga established by Kama 
at Ramesvara and when no one could explain how it happened, 
Kama questioned Sambhu himself who explained that the 
Puranas (mentioned in verses 51-53) may be employed as 
containing prognosticate^ words. The procedure is that a 
maiden more than five years of age and less than ten years or 
any girl who has not attained puberty may be honoured with 
gandka, flowers, incense and other upacaras, she should be made 
to recite the words 'speak the truth, speak what is agreeable, 
blessed Sarasvatl' salutation to you, salutation to you I* She 
should be given three pairs of durvs grass and she should be 
asked to cast them between two leaves of the book. The verse 
between two leaves would be indicative of success in the under- 
taking. The verse should tie carefully considered and its meaning 
settled and applied to the matter in hand. This is like sortes 
sanctorum or sortes Vergilianae i. e. divination by opening at 
random the Scriptures or a book of Virgil or by pricking the 
text with a pin. Then directions are given as to what should be 
done if the leaves are half burnt or indistinct &c. and it is said 
that one should look upon the verse as sent by fate like the 
words in the upasruti method. 1319 It is further stated that this 
method should not be resorted to every day, but rarely and that 
then one should worship the Puiana the previous night and in 
toe morning should consult the Purana for sakuna ( verses 114- 
116 }. The Skanda is the best among all Puranas for this purpose 
of sakuna; some hold that the Visnupurana and the Ramayana 
ateo may be consulted, but the author of the Padma says that 
visnupurana may not be used for this purpose, since if a man 
HeToid of proper conduct honours it for consultation, then 
inauspicious indications come out (verses 122-125). Sambhu 
mmself worshipped Skanda-purana, asked the question why 
Bibhisana, devotee of Siva, had fetters put on him (verses 131-

Furana says that the iLdiparva of the Mahabharata or all its 
pa) vans may be employed for this purpose of sakuna (verseB 
163-164). 

A similar method of finding out omens and of divination 
from the two works of the great Hindi poet and saint Tulasldas 
(born in samvat 1589 i e. 1532 A. D.) viz. Ramajna (orEama- 
sakunavali containing 343 doha verses ) and Ramasalaka is 
described at some length by G A, Grierson in I. A. vol XXII 
pp 204 ff and in Festgabe H. Jacobi pp. 449-455. 

It is worthy of note that even scientific works like the 
Carakasamhita ask the physician to notice the condition of the 
patient, of the messenger, and the actions of the physician and 
inauspicious omens They are described in Indriyasthana chap. 
12 A few notable verses may be cited here. ' That patient 
would only live for a month on whose head arises only powder 
( dandruff or the like ) resembling the powder of dry cowdung 
and that slides down ( from the head ); that patient will not live 
even for a fortnight whose ohest dries up when he takes a bath 
and anoints his body with sandalwood paste while all other 
limbs are yet wet' (verse 12) 'Those messengers from a 
patient who come to a physician when the latter is offering 
oblations into fire or is offering pindas to his pitrs, will kill the 
patient ( i. e. indicate the approaching death of the patient, 
verse 16 ) ; a woman who is in a pitiable state, terrified, hurried, 
troubled, dirty and unchaste, three persons ( coming together ), 
deformed persons, impotent persons -these are messengers of 
those who are about to die ' ( verses 21-22 ) ; ' a physician should 
not go ( to see a patient ) on being called by a messenger when 
the physician sees, while the messenger is describing the condi- 
tion of the patient, an inauspicious omen or a sorrowing man 
or a corpse or the decoration meant for the dead ' , verses 67-70 
dilate on the signs of an auspicious messenger and verses 7H» 
set out auspicious omens such as the sight of curds, whole grains, 
brahmanas, bulls, king, jewels, jar full of water, white horse &c. 
The physician is however advised not to declare an inauspicious 
omen even when he sees it that would give a shook or cause 
pain to the patient or even to anyone else ( verse 63 ).

called Atirudra. The Rudra may take throe forma viz. japa 
(muttering), homa( offering into Agm oblations to tho accom- 
paniment of the mantras), oiabhiselca (sprinkling a person with 
the holy water over which the mantras have been rocitod ) For

it, may employ one brShmana and also for Ekadasml j but for

employed and for Atirudra eleven or 121. Ekadasml and 
Laghurudra are very much in voguo oven now in Maharastra. 
Rudrabhiseka is described in Baud, grhyasosasutra II. 18. 
11-16. 

The mantra ' Tryambakam yajimaho ' ( Rg VII. 59. 12, Tai . 
S. I. 8. 6. 2, Vaj. S. HE. 60) is called Mrtyuujaya Japa of it is 
prescribed for relief against premature death. The Baudhsyana- 
grhyasesasutra (III. 11) presoribos a somewhat more elaborate 
rite and provides that the mantras to bo rocited are ' apaitu 
mrtyuh , (Tai.Br.IH.7.14. 4), 'param mrtyo' (Tai. Br. HI. 7. 
14. 5 ), 'ma no mahantam' ( Rg 1. 114 7 ), ' ma nas-toke ' ( Tai. S. 
HI. 4.11. 2), 'Tryambakam yajdmaho't Tai. S I 8.6.2), 'Yete 
sahasram' (Tai Br. IH 10.8 2). 

It is unnecessary for the author to say what should be done 
in these days as to santis. Host of the santis except a few, as 
pointed out above in various places, are no longer performed. 
Even the few that are yet performed may cease altogether in tho 
near future, if one is to judge from modern trends. 



SECTION IV 
THE PURANAS AND DHARMASASTRA 

* 

CHAPTER XXII 

Origin and development of Purana literature 

The History of Dharmasastra ( vol. I pp. 160-167 ) has a 
brief chapter on the Puranas. It has heen shown therein how 
the Taittirlya Aranyaka, the Chandogya and Brhadaranyaka 
Upanisads mention Itihasa and Purana ( sometimes collectively 
as • Itihagapuranam ' and sometimes separately as ' ItihSsah. 
Puranam ' ) and how some of the extant Puranas are much 
earlier than the 6th century A D. It is further pointed out there 
that the number of the principal Puranas has been traditionally 
handed down as eighteen, 1324 that some puranas such as the 
Mataya.theYisnu, the Vayu andBhavisya contain muchDharma- 
aaatra material, that the Garuda-purana and the Agnipurana 
contain several hundred verses each that are identical with verses 
of the Yajnavalkya smrti, that there is great divergence as to the 
extent of almost all Puranas, that some of the Puranas them- 
selves enumerate minor works called Upapuranas, that the 
Puranas are divided into three groups, viz. sattuika, rajasa 
and tamasa ( as done by Garuda I. 823. 17-20, and Padma 
VI 263. 81-84 ). Details were also furnished as to the chapters 
of the Puranas in which the several topics of Dharmasastra ( such 
as acara, ahnika, dana, rajadharma, staddha, tlrtha) were 
dealt with. 

In the present section it is proposed to trace the great trans- 
formation that took place in the ideas, ideals and practices of the 
ancient Indian people owing to the influence of the Puranas 
m the first few centuries of the Christian era. 

Before proceeding further several preliminary matters have 
t obe dealt with. The menti on of Puranas as a class of literature

goes back much farther than was pointed out in the H. of DH. 
vol. I p. 160. The Atharvaveda 1325 mentions Purana (in the 
singular ) in XI. 7. 24 and XV. 6. 10-11 ' The rk and saman 
verses, the ohandas, the Purana along with the Yajus formula , 
all Bprang from the remainder of sacrificial food, ( as also ) the 
gods that resort to heaven He changed his place and went over 
to great direction , and Itihasa and Purana, gathas, verses in 
praise of heroes followed in going over. ' The Satapatha 
brahmana also (XL 5. 6. 8 ) mentions ' Itihasapuranam ' ( as 
one compound word ) and states that on the 9th day of the 
Pariplava the liotr priest instructs among other matters as 
follows : ' The Purana is the Veda , this it is ; thus saying let him 
narrate some Purana ' ( XIII 4. 3 13. ). 13M The Sankhayana "» 
Srautasutra ( XVI. 2. 27 ) and the Asvalayana Srauta ( X. 7 } 
remark that on two days of the Pariplava the Itihasaveda and 
Puranaveda were to be recited. But the two sutras (though 
affiliated to the Bgveda ) differ as to the day on which they were 
to be recited. It is difficult to say whether the Atharvaveda, 
the Satapatha Brahmana and the Upanisads knew several works 
called Purana or whether there was only a single work called

Purana known to them. But from the fact that the Tai. Ax. 

(II 10 ) speaks of Itihasas and Puranas ( in the plural ) it would 

not be unreasonable to suppose that in the later Vedic period at 

least some works ( three or more ) called Puranas existed and 

were studied and recited by those that were engaged in solemn 

sacrifices like the Asvamedha. It is not unlikely that, where 

the singular * Puranam ' was employed in the Vedio tests, a 

class of works was meant. The facts that ' Itihasa-Purana ' is 

called the fifth Veda in the Upanisads and that the Satapatha 

employs ' Itihasa-Puranam * as one compound word lead to the 

inference that the two categories ' Itihasa * and ' Purana ' were 

similar in contents at least in several respects. The Apastamba- 

dharmasutra 132S quotes two verses each in two places from a 

Purana ( in the singular ), once cites the view of the Bhavisyat- 

purana and in another place gives the summary of a Purana 

passage or verse which says that, when a person attacks another

These two verses respectively say that those who lead the life of a house- 
holder performing sacrifices and desiring progeny have to nndergo deaths 
(lit. cemeteries, smasanani ) and births ( i.e. they only reach heaven and are 
born again and again), while those that do not desire progeny but remain

with the object of harming him and the person attacked kills the 
attacker, no sin is incurred. Brom these passages it is clear 
that Apastamba had before him a Purana called Bhavisyat and 
also that the Parana or Puranas -which he knew contained rules 
about the food to be accepted for eating, about the stages of 
householder and the perpetual student, about resisting an 
atatayin even unto death and about creation and re-creation 
after dissolution. These matters fall within the province of 
Smrtis and Puranas As the word ' purana " means ' ancient ', 
the word Bhavisyat-purana is a contradiction in terms. Long 
before Apaatamba the word Purana had come to mean a work 
dealing with ancient tales &o ; several such works must have 
been composed and they probably began to incorporate contem- 
porary events and wrote about such events in a prophetic vein. 
Hence arose the name Bhavisyat-purana. 1329 As Apastamba 
mentions a Bhavisyat-purana and also Purana, it follows that 
before 500 B. 0. several Puranas existed one of which was called 
the Bhavisyat and the Puranas then known contained the 
topics of sarga, prattsarga and smrti matters. 

This conclusion is strongly corroborated by other facts 
The Gautama-dharmasutra provides that a learned (baliusruta) 
brahmana is one who knows peoples' usages, the Veda, the angas 
(auxiliary lores ),Vakovakya (dialogues), Itihasa and Purana 
and that the king in administering the affairs of his kingdom 
and justice has to depend upon the Veda, Dharmasastra, the (six) 
angas of the Veda, the (four) Upavedas and Purana. 1330 

From the above discussion it appears that, though we are 
not in a position to make definite statements about the contents 
of the Purana or Puranas referred to in the Atharva, Sat. 
Br, TaL Ar. and the TTpanisads, by the time of Ap. and 
Gautama, Puranas approaching in contents to some extent at 
least some of the extant Puranas had come into existence. The

Pur ana m Kautilya 819 

Arthasastra of Kautilya states thafi 1331 ' trayl* means the three 
Yedas, viz. Samaveda, Rgveda, Yajurveda and that the Atharva- 
veda and Itihasaveda are (also) yedas*. It follows that in 
Kautilya's time Itihasa was a definite work like the three vedas. 
In another place Kautilya provides ' a minister proficient in 
Arfchasastras and bent on the good of the king should, by means 
of itivrtta (history or historical occurrences) and Puranas, 
admonish (and bring to the right path) a king led astray by 
other guides.' In laying down a time-table for the king's daily 
routine of work, l332 Kautilya provides that in the latter part of 
the day the king should listen to Itihasa and defines the latter 
as comprehending Purana, itivrtta, akhyayika (narrations), 
udaharana (heroic examples), DharmasSstra and Arthasastra 
(soience of government and statecraft). It appears that Kautilya 
meant by 'Itihasa' aMahabharata more or les3 very like the 
extant one, which describes 1333 itself as the best of itihasas, a3

820 History of Dharma&ustra [ Seo. IV, Oh. XTHT 

Manusmrti 1326 provides that in a sraddha rito the brahmanaa 
invited for dinner should recite the Vedas, the Dharmasastras, 
stories, Itihasas, Puranas and khila hymns (such as Srlsukta), 
it should be taken as referring to Purana works closely resembl- 
ing the extant ones. The Ya]5avalkya 13j7 smrti enumerates 
the fourteen Vidyasthanas (branches of knowledge) and sources 
of dharma as Purana, Nyaya (logic), Mlmamsa (rules of Vedia 
interpretation), Dharmasastras, the angaa of the Veda and the 
(four) Vedas Those fourteen are probably arranged in the 
order of importance and authoritativeness at the time of the 
Yajnavalkya-smrti. Ya], refers to sages that expounded or 
promulgated the Vedas, Puranas, the vidyas (six angas), the 
Upanisads, the slokas (ltihasa?), aphoristic works (like those of 
Jaimini or on nyaya), the bhavjas and whatover other literature 
exists. In another place Yaj. recommends that a householder 
after a bath in the morning and worship of gods and pitrs should 
engage in japa-yajna, in which he should mutter according to 
his ability parts of the Veda, of Atharvaveda, ltihasa and 
Puranas and philosophical texts. These passages from Yajfia- 
valkya establish that ltihasa and Purana went together, that 
both were works distinct from. Vedic Litoiatu.ro and that both 
had attained a status of sacredness and authoritativeness in 
matters of dharma in the time of the Yajnavalkya-smrti not 
later than 3rd century ( A. D. ). A Vartika mentioned by the 
Mahabhasya on Pan IV. 3. 59-60 provides for the formation of 
words with the affix ' thak' (Jew) in the case of akhyana (auch as 
Yavakrltika, Yayatika), akhyayika (such as Vasavadattika, 
Saumanottarika), ltihasa (aitihasika), Purana (pauranika) in 
the sense of one who studies or knows that ,33B In numerous 
passages the Mahabharata mentions Purana in the singular

13. 2, Santi 339. 106, Svargarohana 5. 48-47 ( which refers to 
Puranas as 18 ) 1339 Further, the Matsya-purana and a Purana 
proclaimed by Vayu are mentioned in the Vanaparva. J3W It is 
impossible to hold that all the numerous references to Puranas 
are later interpolations, though a few may he so. It is not 
correct to say that no Purana resembling the extant ones existed 
before the time when Purana stories were collected in the Maha- 
bharata. There 13 hardly any evidence to support any such 
view. 

Early Sanskrit authors li&a Bana (first half of 7th century 

A, D.) and commentators like Sahara (not later than between 

200-400 AD.), Kumarila (7th century A. D.), Sankaracaxya 

(between 650-800 A. D.) and Visvarupa (800-850 A. D.) leave 

us iu no doubt that in their times Puranas existed, the contents 

of which were just like those of the extant Puranas. Sahara in 

hisbhasya«« on Jaimini X. 4. 23, while discussing the question 

as to what is meant by 'devata' in relation to sacrifices, states 

feat one view was that they are Agni and others, that are 

described in the Itihasa and Puranas as dwelling in heaven. 

Bana in his Kadambarl and Harsacarita frequently refers to the 

Mahabharata and Puranas, but two passages from the 

kadambarl and one from the Harsacarita are very interesting

oription of the palace of Taraplda Bana employs a slesa (double 
extendre) comparing ifc with. Purana (the two meanings being 
' where the accumulated wealth of the world was arranged in 
appropriate groups ', ' in which there is a description of the whole 
sphere of worlds each part of which was assigned a proper 
division') In the Uttarabhaga (by the son of Bana) of the 
Kadambarl it is stated that in all agamas (saored works tradition- 
ally handed down) such as Puranas, Ramayana and Bharata there 
are many stories about curses. The placing of Puranas firat 
shows that they were probably more honoured or popular than 
the Ramayana and the Bharata. In the Harsacanta 1343 it is stated 
that the book-reader Sudrsti treated Bana and his relatives and 
friends to a musical recitation of the Purana promulgated by 
Vayu, that was sung by the sage (Vyasa), that is very exten- 
sive, that is world-wide ( i e. known everywhere ), that is holy 
and that is not different from the career of Harsa ( to whioh 
also all the adjectives applied to the Purana are applicable) Here 
it appears that the Vayu is expressly mentioned (as Paia- 
manapiokta and Pavcaia) and it is further stated that the 
Puranas contained a description of the several divisions of the 
world. This description applies to such Puranas as the Vayu, 
Matsya ( chapters 114-128 ), Brahmanda (II. 15 ff ). It may be 
argued that the Purana mentioned by Bana may be the Brah- 
manda since that Purana says ti43a in the beginning as well as 
at the end (IV. 4 58ff) that Brahma imparted it to Vayu, from 
whom it passed on to several divine and semi-divine personages 
and ultimately suta received it from Vyasa. This latter argu- 
ment is not acceptable, since there was nothing to prevent Bana 
from expressly saying that the Brahmanda was the Purana 
recited by Sudrsti

Kumarila and PurUnas 823 

Kumarilabhatta in his Tantravartika refers in several 
places to the Puranas and their contents. A few interesting 
passages are set oat here- On Jaimini 1. 3. 1 Kumarila says «« 
'Therefore the authoritativeness of all smrtis is established by 
the purpose which they serve; whatever therein (in smrtis) is 
oonneoted with dharma and moksa (is authoritative), because 
it springs from (is based on) the Veda; whatever concerns 
•wealth (artha) and pleasures is based on the usages of the 
people. In this way a distinction is to be made. This very 
reasoning applies to hortatory passages in the Itihasa and 
Puranas. The Upakhyanas may be explained by the reasoning 
applicable to aTthavadas (i. e they have a purpose and authorita- 
tiveness just like the commendatory passages of the Veda). 
Narration of the divisions of the earth serves the purpose of 
distinguishing the regions for undergoing the consequences of 
the (actions that are the) means of dharma and adharma and 
aie partly based on personal experience and partly on the Veda. 
The orderly presentation of vamsas ( dynasties) in the Puranas 
is intended to facilitate the knowledge of the biahmana and 
ksatriya castes and their gotras and is based on aotual experi- 
ence and traditional knowledge ; countries and measures of time 
.are intended to facilitate worldly transactions and astronomical 
needs and are based on actual perception, mathematics, tradition 
and inference. The narration of what will happen in the future 
is based on the Veda, since it conveys knowledge of the variety 
of the ripening of the consequences of ( complying with) dharma 
and of adharma and knowledge of the characteristics of yugas 
that have been in operation from time immemorial.* It is 
clear from this passage that the Itihasa and the Puranas that 
Kumarila knew contained stories, geography of the earth, 
dynastic lists, measures of time and description of what will 
happen in the future. These are matters dealt with in the 
extant Puranas. On Jaimini I 3. 7 Kumarila observes : 'In the 

1344 fa wt^tiH t n-fiaH^m inwpnri%i%: i ?ra ■nwiit*Jnteiy**iC'i*" *&%■ 



824 History of niwrma&astra I Sea IV, CLXXH 

PurSnas mi it is narrated that in the Kali age there will arias 
Sakya (Gautama Buddha) and others that will cause confusion 
about dharma , who would listen to their words?' This shows 
that before the 7th century A. D. the Puranas contained descrip- 
tions of the nature of Kaliyuga and that the Puranas Kumarila 
knew did not regard Buddha as an avatSra of Vismi, but rather 
condemned him. From the facts that Ksemandra composed his 
Dasavataracarita in 1066 A. D , that Apararka ( on p 338} quotes 
a long passage from the Matsya chapter 285, verse seven of 
which enumerates the ten avataras of Visnu( including Buddha), 
and that the Gltagovinda of Jayadeva regards Buddha as an 
avatara, it follows that before 1000 A. D. Buddha had come to be 
regarded as an avatara of Visnu, though before the 7th century 
some Puranas at least had condemned him. In the discussion 
of the meaning of the word ' svarga' au Kumarila asks: does it 
mean the region of the stars or does it mean the top of the Meru 
(mountain) in conformity with Itihasa and Puranas or does it 
mean only a state of happiness? This indicates that in 
Kumarila's day Puranas contained descriptions of the top of 
Meru as 'heaven.' 

Sankaracarya in his hhasya on the Vedantasotra frequently 
mentions the contents and characteristic features of Puranas 
that are the same as those of the extant ones, though he actually 
names none of them. For example, on V. S. H. 1. 36 he remarks 
that it has been established in the Purana that there is no limit 
to the number of past and future 1347 kalpas. O n V. S. I. 3.30 .

sSuftkarucarya and the Pur anas 825 

She Acarya quotas two verses that he designates as smrti, that are 
Visnupurana I. 5. 59-60, but are not found in ancient smrfcis like 
those of Manu or Yaj. On V. S. HI. 1. 15 ( api oa sapta ) the 
bhasya remarks that those who have studied or who know the 
Puranas declare that there are seven hells, Baurava and others, 
that are regarded as places reached for undergoing the con- 
sequences of evil deeds committed by sinners. The Visnupurana 
enumerates seven hells viz. Tamisra, Raurava and others, as 
the places for those who abuse the Veda, who cause obstacles to 
sacrifices and who give up their proper dharma. Even Manu 
( IV. 87-90 ), Yaj. ( HE. 322-224 ), Yisnu Dh. S. 43. 2-22 enumerate 
21 hells and almost all Puranas mention 21 or more hells. Yide 
H. of Dh vol. IV pp. 162-164. On V. S. I. 3. 26 and 33 the 
bhasya says that one can see from Vedio mantras, arthavada 
passages, Itihasa and Purana and popular belief that gods have 
bodies. On Y S. II. 1. 1. Sankaracarya quotes a verse whioh is 
the same in Yayupurana and on I. 3. 30 quotes in all five verses 
as smrti, four of which are the same as Yayu 9. 57-58 and 64-65. 
Visvarupa in his commentary on the Yajnavalkya-smrti has two 
interesting notes on Puranas. On Yaj. HI. 170 which describes 
theSankhya theory of the evolution of the world, Yisvarupa 13is

remarks that this theory concerning tho creation and dissolution 
of tho world is found ovorywhora in tho Puranas. On Yaj. 
III. 175 which states that tho path to tho world of the pitrs lies 
between tho star Agastya (Canopus) and tho Ajavlthi, Visvarupa 
remarks that in tho Purina s>QVoral uU/its ( i o. courses ) of the 
Sun in tho sky aro tound and that Ajavlthi 13 immediately 
contiguous to Agastya. 

From tho foregoing discussion about tho roforenco3 to 
Puranas contained in writers from Sahara to Visvarupa it 
follows that botwoon about tho 2nd century AD. and the 6th or 
7th century AD. tho Puranas exhibited tho same contents and 
characteristics as many of tho extant Puranas do. 

Before proceeding furthor, it is necessary to say here some- 
thing about tho Yuga-purana, a part of the Gargl-Sainhita, and 
ono of tho oarliost extant works boaring tho title Purana3. 
Kern in his Introduction to the Brhatsamhita (pp. 32-40) 
brought this rare Purana containing valuable historical data 
to the notice of scholars from a fragmentary ms Later on K. P. 
Jayaswal 1318 " published a test of tho purely historical material 
of tho Yugapurana in 115 half linos in Anustubh metro based 
on the fragment that Kern had got and two more mss. that were 
secured by him and added a translation and notes. Later on 
Jayaswal obtained a copy made by Prof Levi from a ms. ( in 
Bengali script) in the Bibliotheque Nationale of Pans and 
published in JBOES. (vol. XV pp 129-133) a table coinpanng 
tho readings of that ms. with tho text he published in JB VHt>. 
vol XIV. Prof. K H. Dhruva contributed a paper on the text 
of the Yugapurana to the JBOES vol XVI. pp 18-66, wherein 
he altered the proper names and gave free scope to his con- 
jectures and inferences with the result that succeeding scholars 
have not attached any weight to his emendations and wbb

by Jaya3wal and a fresh ms. that ha obtained in Saurastra, 
corrects some of the leadings accepted by Jayaswal and 
considerably differs from some of Jayaswal's interpretations 
and added a few notes. 

The Yugapurana is the 113fch chapter of Gargisamhits and 
is called Skandapurana in the ms. secured by Prof. Mankad, 
probably because the Purana starts with a question by Skanda 
to Siva about the characteristics of the different yugas. The 
characteristics of Krta, Treta and Dvapara are respectively 
described in lines 11-28, 29-45 and 46-74 of Prof. Mankad'a 
text; and lines 75-235 (of Prof. Mankad's text) and lines 1-115 
of Jayaswal's text (in JBORS. vol. XIV". pp. 400-408) describe 
the characteristics of the Kaliyuga, and the political, social and 
economic history of a few centuries before the work was com- 
posed. The characteristics of the Kaliyuga in the Yugapurana 
bear a very close resemblance to the description of Kaliyuga in 
the Vanaparva ( chap. 188. 30-64), one half verse being the same 
in both.*** 

The important points that emerge are briefly these : — I omit 
the discussion of different interpretations of Jayaswal, Prof. 
Mankad and Prof. ISarain. Kaliyuga started after Draupadi 
died. In the beginning of Kaliyuga Janamejaya, son of Pariksit, 
would be a famous king but will come in conflict 1348 ** with 
brahtnanas. Tn Kaliyuga, Udayi son of Sisunaga, will found 
the city of Pataliputra on the south bank of the Ganges, which 
will come to be called Puspapura and which will last for five 
thousand, five hundred and five years, five months, five days and 
five muhurtas In that Puspapura there will be a deluded and 
wicked king called Salisuka who will establish at Saketa his 
virtuous elder brother named Vijaya. Then the valiant Yavanas,

Pancalas and Mathuras will attack Saketa and will conquer 
Kuaumapura which had a mud fortification All countries will 
bo disturbed (by this onslaught of tha Yavanas) Then non- 
Aryans will follow the practico3 of tba Aryas. At the end of 
Kali age brahmanas, ksatnyas, vaisya3 will dross alika and 
have the same practices. People will join heretical sects and 
will make friends for (soduciog their) wives. Sudras willoifor 
oblations into fire with the syllablo 'om* and thoy will address 
( others) with the word 'bhoh' and brahmanas will address others 
with the words 'O aryas'. The Yavanas will establish five kings 
in the city ( of Puspapura). The Yavanas will not stay long in 
Madhyadesa. When tho Yavanas will vanish there will be 
seven powerful kings at Saketa; in Madhyadesa there would be 
bloody wais. All the Agmvosya kings will perish by war and 
so will the people. 

Thereafter the greedy Saka king will undergo destruction 
against Sata, the king of Kalinga, and the earth will be devast- 
ated and Puspapura will be a wilderness Amlata called 'red- 
eyed' will secure Puspapura The Mloccba king Amlata will 
destroy the helpless people and the four varnas Amlata with 
his relatives will perish and then there will be a king called 
Gopala who will rule one year and then die There will then 
be the just king called Pusyaka who will rulo only one year. 
After two more kings, Agmmitra will be king who will wage a 
terrible battle with brahmanas for a girl After him his son 
will rule for 20 years The condition of the people will be very 
bad because of hi3 fight with Sabaras. Then Satu king will 
rule. Then there will be depredations of Sakas who will destroy 
one-fourth of the population and make the people demoralised. 
In this way the Yugapurana ends on a dismal note. UMe 

As the Pur an a stop3 with the Sakas and doe3 not dilate on 
the dynasties of the Andhras, Abhlras and Guptas, it must be 
placed earlier than all the known Puranas which deal with these 
dynasties. Jayaswal places the Yugapurana in the latter half

Wjthical beginning of Puraaas 829 

A very recent work 'The Indo-Greeks' by Prof. A. K. tfarain 
(Oxford, 1957) has an illuminating note (pp 174-179) on 
several difficult passages of the Yugapurana 1318 '. 

Several Puranas such as Matsya 53. 3-11, Vayu 1. 60-61, 
Brahmanda 1. 1.40-41, Linga 1. 2.2, Naradlya L 92. 22-36, Padma 
V. 1. 45-53 state that Purana m » was originally only one, that 
Brahma thought of it first, that after that the Vedas proceeded 
from Brahma's lips, that originally it had the extent of one 
hundred crores of slokas and that the essence thereof to the ex- 
tent of four lakhs of verses was declared in each Dvapara age by 
Vyasa. It is impossible to say whether the writers of the extant 
Puranas had any ancient tradition about this before them or 
whether all this about the original existence of a single Purana 
was purely imaginary. The author holds that the latter view 
is more likely to be the correct one. It has been shown above 
that as early as the Taittirlya Aranyaka Puranas are mentioned 
m the plural. Therefore, the extant Puranas are only the 
successors of the ancient Puranas, about which, it must be 
admitted, we know very little. 

The number of Puranas ( in later times and by some of the 
Puranas distinguished as Mahapuranas) has been traditionally 
handed down as eighteen. They are enumerated in several 
Puranas, such as Visnu 3H. 6. 21-23, Varaha 112. 69-72 (verses 
74-77 in Venk. ed. ), Linga I. 39. 61-63, Matsya 53. 11 ff, Padma 
IV. 100. 51-54, Bhavisya I. 1. 61-64, Markandeya 134.7-11,

about the 18 namos and great difference a3 to their extent and 
contents The Matsya (53.18-19), Agni 272. 4-5. Naradlya 
I. 92 26-28 enumerate the Vayu as the 4th among the 18 
Puranas, while moat of the othora substitute Sivapurana as tbo 
4th in place of the Vayu The Skanda (in Prabhasakhanda 2. 5 and 
7 ) puts Saiva as the 1th in place of Vayu and Vayavlya as the last 
( probably meaning Brahmanda thereby). Tho Dovlbhagavata 1 ^* 
contains a verse naming the 18 Puranas by their first lotters 
in which the Sivapurana is omitted. Tho Saurapurana ( chap. 9 . 
5-12) enumerates tho 18 Puranas, places Vayu as tho 4th (and 
not Siva) and Brahmanda as the last. Tho Sutasamhitajl. 1. 
7-11 ) names the 18 Puranas omitting Vayu and putting Siva- 
purana in its place The Danasagara m its Introductory verses 
( 11-12 on pp 2-3 ) mentions both Vayavlya and Saiva separately. 
In the verses of the Kahka-purana quoted by Homadri on dana 
I. p 531, Siva, Kahka, Saura and Vahnija ( Agnoya, tho genuine 
one) are included among eighteen principal Puranas. On the 
whole I agree with Dr. A D. Pusalkar 1353 that it is the Vayu 
that is entitled to be legarded as one of the 18 prinoipal Puranas 
and not the Sivapurana Al-beruni in his work on India ( com-

posed in 1030 A. D. ) sets out one list of Puranas as read out to 
him from Visnupurana, which is the same as set out below, 
except this that the Saiva-purana is put in the 4th place 
instead of Vayu (Sachau's tr. vol I. p. 131, ed. of 1888) It is 
clear, therefore, that the list of 18 principal Puranas had been 
completed long before 1000 A. D. and was introduced in the 
Visnupurana many years before that date. Al-beruni furnishes 
(i&sdp. 130) another list of the names of 18 Puranas which he 
had heard, viz. Adi, Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, 
Vamana, Vayu, Manda, Skanda, Adltya, Soma, Samba, 
Brahmanda, Markandeya, Tarksya ( i. e. Garuda ), Visnu, 
Brahma, Bhavisya It should be noticed that in this list Vayu 
is included (and not Saiva), that some puranas described in 
other works as TJpapuranas are included ( viz Adi, Narasimha, 
Manda, Aditya, Soma and Samba ) and some works almost un- 
animously declared to be Mahapuranas ( such as Padma, Bhaga- 
vata, Narada, Agni, Linga and Brahmavaivarta ) are omitted. 
It follows that some upapuranas suoh as Adi, Narasimha, Aditya, 
Samba, Nanda (Nandi?) had been composed at least some time 
before 1000 A. D. Balambhatta (latter half of 18th century 
A. D. ) states in his commentary on the Mitaksara ( on Yaj. I. 3 ) 
that the Vayavlya-purana is also called Saiva.

It will be noticed from the table that the total numbor of 
\orsesin the 18 Puranas according to the figures furnished by 
most Puranas come3 to 100600 slokas This closely agrees with 
the total of four lakhs assigned to the eighteen Puranas in some 
ot the Puranas (vido note 1319 above) But sovoral of tho 
extant Puranas contain much smaller numbers of slokas than 
are assigned to tham For example, it appears from tho com- 
mentaries called VisnucittI U51 and Vaisnavakutacandrika on

Differing numbers of verses in Puranas 838 

Vismipuxana IH. 6. 23 that the estimates of the extent of the 
Visnaputaoa varied from 6, 8, 9, 10, 22, 23 to 24 thousand slokas 
and that both the commentaries comment on a text of the 
Yi9impurana that has only 6000 slokas. Similarly, the extent 
of the Karma is said to be 17000 or 18000 slokas by most of the 
Puranas that furnish the extent of Puranas, but the extant 
Kurmahas hardly 6000 slokas. The Brahma contains 10000 
slokas according to the Naradlya and 25000 according to the 
Agni, but the printed Brahma ( of the Anandasrama ed. ) 
contains about 14000 verses. On the other hand, the Skanda 
{ that has two recensions at present ) is said to contain 81000 
Slokas, but the Skanda printed by the Venk. Preas contains 
several thousands more. The Bhavisya ( Brahmaparva ) ass 
states that all Puranas had originally 12000 verses each, but 
their extent increased by the addition of tales, so that the 
Skanda was inflated to the extent of one lakh of slokas and the 
Bhavisya to 50000 slokas. The order in which the Puranas are 
enumerated is not quite uniform. Most Puranas put the 
Brahma in 1356 the first place and set out the order as in the table 
above, yet the Vayu ( 104. 3 ) and the Devlbhagavata ( I. 3. 3 ) 
begin the list of Puranas with Matsya. The Skanda ( Prabhasa- 
khanda 2. 8-9 ) puts the Brahmanda in the first place. The 
Bhagavata (XH. 7. 23-24 ) enumerates the eighteen Puranas in 
a ^aomewhat different order. The Yamana 1357 regards the

Matsya as the foremost among Puranas. Notices of the contents 
of all the 18 Puianag ooour in Matsya ( chap. S3 ), Agni ( chap. 
272), Skanda ( Prabhasakhanda 2. 28-76), Naradlya (which 
devotes 18 ohapters from I. 92. 30-43 to 1. 109 to the contents of 
18 Puranas from Brahma to Brahmanda). There is almost 
complete agreement among the Puranas as to the names of the 
18 principal Puranas, except as to the Vayupurana. 

The question about the Puranas is further complicated by 
the fact that some of the Puranas themselves mention the names 
of a number of Upapuranas, though others ignore them. 3?or 
example, the Matsya ( 53. 59-6,2 ) names the Narasimha, the 
Nandi, the Aditya and Samba as Upapuranas and appears to say 
that the Narasimha extended to 18000 slokas and elaborated the 
description of the Man-Lion avatara deolared in the Padma- 
purana. The Kurma ( L 1. 16-20 ), Padma ( IV. 111. 95-98 ), the 
Devlbhagavata (L 3.13-16) set out the names of eighteen 
Upapuranas. Some of the Upapuranas bear the same names as 
those of the prinoipal puranas, viz. Skanda, Vamana, Brahmanda 
and Naradlya. Prof. Hazra* 338 states that the number of Upa- 
puranas is 100. Only a few of the Upapuranas have been 
published and those published do not differ much in the matter 
of subjects from some of the principal puranas and almost all 
l>elie the definition of Purana as ' pancalaksana '. It has been 
seen above ( note 1349 ) that the number of slokas in the 18 
prinoipal Puranas is said to be four lakhs. It must be remem- 
bered that this total does not include the number of the slokas 
assigned to the Upapuranas, and no Putana includes the verses 
of the Upapuranas in the total of four lakhs. Further, no one 
should forget or ignore the significance of the remarks of the

to add only a few matters from this work, mostly in the footnotes. In note 
24 p. 13 of his * Studies • ho reiterates that ho has collected the names of 
more than one hundred Upapuranas. On pp. 4-13 ho sets out 23 sources 
f six being quotations from Kurma in different mbandhas ) of the lists of 
Upapuranas that exhibit stoat divergences and chaos Wilson in his 
Preface to tr. of the Visnu pp. LXXXVI-XCI mentions the varying lists 
of Upapuranas and offers remarks on some of them. The H of. DH vol. 
I, p. 163 gives the names of the 18 Upapuranas as contained in the Garucla 
l" 223. 17-20. Hemadri on Vrala ( part 1 p. 21 ) sets out the names of the 
,18 Upapuranas from the Kurma I. 1. 16-20 (with readings different from 
"those of the printed Kurma. some of which arc rather serious ). 



Origin of UpqpUrSyas 835 

Matsya and Kurma about the Upapuranas. The Matsya 1319 

speaks of the Upapuranas as sub-sections ( upabhedas ) of the 

principal eighteen Puranas and emphatically asserts ' know that 

whatever is deolared aa distinct from the eighteen Puranas 

came forth ( or issued from ) these ( 18 ) '. The Kurma is no less 

olear. It states that 1360 the Upapuranas are the summaries or 

abridgments of the 18 ( principal ) Puranas made by sages after 

studying them. The lists of Upapuranas given by several works, 

most of which are set out by Prof. Hazra in his paper on 

Upapuranas ( in ABORI vol. XXX at pp. 40-48 ) and in his 

Studies ( pp. 4-13 ) diverge a good deal from each other. As the 

Matsya mentions by name only four Upapuranas it is not 

unreasonable to hold that more than four were not in existence 

at the time when this passage of the Matsya was inserted in it or 

at least that more than four had not been accepted as Upapuranas 

at that time. A good many of the Upapuranas are of late date. 

Only a few of the rest such as the Narasimha, the Visnu*

that the Upapuranas were known to Yajnyavalkya. Prof. Hazra is -wrong 

here. All that this passage means is that the Vlramitrodaya in the beginning 

o{ the 17th century A.D. ( about 1500 years or more after Yaj. ) thought that 

Yaj included upapuranas in the word Parana in Yaj. I. 3. That is Mitra- 

nusra's view. We are not bound by it and should not draw any inference 

from it, Yaj. mentions only Purana as a source of dharmabut he is entirely 

silent as to how many Puranas had been composed in his time. There is 

nothing to show that they were more than three in his day and it is impossible 

for ns to hold that he included upapuranas under the word Parana, simply 

because some upapuranas were composed before 1000 A. D.

83.6 History of Dharmaiastra I See. IV, Gh. XXII 

dharmottara, the Davl, can possibly be held to be as old as the 
7th or 8th century AD. I do not accept the view of Prof. Hazra, 
who places the period of the formation of the group of eighteen 
Upapuranas between 650-800 A. D ( m ABORI. vol XXL at 
p 50 and also in ' Studies in Upapuranas ' vol. I. by Dr. Hazra ), 
where while admitting ( p 14 ) that in the Upapurana litarature 
there are works of comparatively late dates, he boldly states that 
the age of the Upapuranas began approximately from the Gupta 
period ( p. 16 ) For this last statement there is absolutely no 
evidence whatever. A detailed discussion of the dates of all the 
Upapuranas would demand a large space and would be some- 
what irrelevant in this section. We must hold fast by the 
facts that even when the 18 principal puranas assumed 
their present form, the number of Upapuranas was small, that 
they were looked upon as no more than abridgments or sum- 
maries of the principal Puranas, that the Puranas that mention 
upapuranas do not state that they were composed by the divinely 
inspired Vyasa ( but only by some sages as the Kurma says ) 
and that originally they had not the status or authority of the 
18 puranas The Saura, an Upapuiana itself, speaks of Upapu- 
ranas as khilas (9 5). It is only the late medieval digests like 
the Smrtitattva (1520-1570 A D.) or the Vlramitrodaya (first 
half of 17th century) that were separated by several centuries 
from the Mahapuranas as well as the Upapuranas and the 
writers of which had practically lost all sense of the distance in 
time between the two sets of Puranas, that say that the mention 
of Puranas 1361 as a source of dharma in Yaj must be deemed to 
include Upapuranas also This last may be the opinion of such 
late writers as Mitramisra, but no scholar is bound to accept it. 
It is doubtful whether by the word Purana, Yaj. refers to the 
Mahapuranas now extant and whether he knows that there were 
eighteen of them. If some Upapuranas glorify themselves as 
of equal authority with the Mahapuranas, that is of a piece with 
what the principal Puranas state about themselves viz. that 
Brahma first thought of the Puranas and then the Vedas issued 
from his lips Modern scholars should discount all these attempts 
at self-glorification. Upapuranas are due to sages Upapuranas 
are distinguished from Puranas in several important respects. 
Firstly, the 18 puranas are attributed to the semi-divine 
Vyasa, secondly, according to both Matsya and Kurma, 
they were summaries of the PurSnas, thirdly, the sl okas in the 

■ifiHimiMiHH (° f qtera^fcrr) p- *»- 



Upapuranas distinguished from Pura-qas 837 

Upapuranas are not included in the 4 lakhs of verses of all the 
Puranas together; fourthly, early commentators and nibandha 
writers like the Mitaksara and the Krtyakalpataru either do not 
mention any of the Upapuranas or at the most only about half a 
dozen or so and that too rather sparingly ; and lastly, as Prof. 
Hazra himself asserts ( 'Studies', vol. I. p 33 ) adherents of various 
sects such as Saktas, Sauras, Fancaratras interpolated chapters 
in. the Puranas of the established group and in some case3 wrote 
new and independent works to propagate their own ideas and 
styled them Puranas. 

Early commentaries and digests of Dharmasastra very 
rarely refer to any of the well-known Upapuranas. The Mita- 
ksara, though it names the Brahma (on Taj. I. 3 and 45), quotes 
passages from the Matsya ( profusely ), "Visnufon Taj. IIL 6), 
Skanda ( on Taj. HI. 390 ), Bhavisya (on Taj. III. 6 ), Markan- 
deya (on Taj. I. 336, 254. III. 19,287, 389 ) and Brahmanda 
(on Yaj. HI. 30), hardly refers, so far as I know, to any 
TJpapurana. The Krtyakalpataru of Laksmidhara (composed 
about 1110-1130 A. D.), twelve parts of which published in the 
G. O. S cover several thousand pages, profusely quotes many 
oftheMahapuranas, andonly six of the Upapuranas by name, 
viz. Adi (only twice onsuddhi), ITandi (profusely only on 
dana and niyatakalika), Aditya, Kalika, Devi, Harasimha (all 
four profusely on several topics) Apararka (first half of 13th 
century A, D.) who quotes profusely from Brahma, Brahmanda, 
Bhavisyat, Markandeya, "Vayu, Visnu and Matsya quotes by 
name only the following Upapuranas and only sparingly viz. 
Adi, Aditya, Kalika, Devi, Nandi, Nrsimha, Visnudharmottara 
( seven times ), "Visnurahasya ( once ), and Sivadbarmottara 
(once). The Danasagara 1 '* 2 (written in 1169) states 'Upa- 
puranas have been promulgated, which clearly set out the 
procedure of gifts' and it expressly mentions as Upapuranas

them naturally lead to the inference that these passages were 
added some time after all the eighteen Puranas assumed a 
complete form. It is not possible to hold that all the main 
puranas were composed at the same time by one individual 
author or even by several contemporary writers. Besides, most 
of the editions of Puranas are based either on a single ms. or 
on a few mss. collected at random and are not critically edited 
as is the case with the critical edition of the Mahabharata 
published in Foona by the B. O E. I. Many conclusions there- 
fore, drawn from the current printed editions of the Puranas or 
from mss of the Puranas, must be regarded as merely tentative 
and as likely to turn out to be wrong. What Winternitz said 
in his History of Indian Literature (English translation, 
Calcutta, vol.1, p 469 ) viz. ' that the date of each section, nay, 
sometimes of each single verse in the Mahabharata must be 
determined separately* applies with equal (or perhaps greater) 
force to the Puranas, particularly when one wants to use the 
section or stanza for historical or comparative purposes. 1365 

It may be conceded that the Puranas and some of the avail- 
able TJpapuranas also contain many ancient legends and tradi- 
tions , but these have been so much tampered with and inflated 
by additions intended to bolster up particular forms of worship 
and particular tenets that great caution is required before one 
can recognize them as genuine and reliable representatives for 
ascertaining the general stale of Indian society and beliefs m 
ancient and medieval times. 

In the opinion of the present writer there is no positive 
objective evidence for placing any of the upapuranas except the 
Visnudharmottara before the 8th or 9th century A.D. Even in 
the case of Puranas, there have been large interpolations such as 
verse3 about the 18 puranas, their number and contents. But 
they contain much, ancient material and are far more reliable 
than most of the TJpapuranas, having been quoted by writers 
from 8th and 9th. centuries A. D. or even earlier. 

The Amarakosa 1364 defines ' Itihasa' as ' what happened in 
the past * and ' Parana ' a3 ' what has five signs or characteristics . 
It is no doubt true that some puranas speak of Furana a3

'paficalaksana* and set out the five characteristics 13SS as sarga 
( creation ),pratisarga (re-creation after dissolution of the world), 
vamsa (dynasties of god3, the Sun and the Moon, and the 
patriarchs ), manvantara ( the vast periods of time that are so 
called), vamsanucarita or vamsyanucanta (deeds and history 
.of the descendants of the solar, lunar and other dynasties). 
The Bhagavata 1366 states that ten topics are dealt with by 
Puranas and that some say that they are only five The ten 
topics of the Bhagavata are sarga, visarga ( dissolution or crea- 
tion after destruction), vrtti ( modes of subsistence, natural or 
prescribed for all men by sastra), raksa (protection i. e. auataras 
destroying those that hate the Vedas), antaram (i e manva- 
taras), vamsa, vamsyanuoarita, samstha (four kinds of laya), 
hetu (the cause of creation viz. the soul that is subject to avidya 
and collects karma ), apairaya ( the refuge of individual souls, 
viz, brahman). The Matsyapurana also mentions other charac- 
teristics of Puranas viz. in all Puranas the four goals of man 
(purusarthas) are described, also the consequences of doing what 
is opposed to dharma, division of Puranas into sattoika, rajasa, 
tamasa, the sattvika and rajasa puranas respectively extolling 
the v greatness of Hari and Brahma, tamasa Puranas extolling 
Agni and Siva, the mixed one3 extolling the greatness of 
SarasvatI and pitrs. The questions addressed by Manu to Kesava 
(inMatsya 3. 32-24) indicate the subjects that would be dealt 
with by that Purana viz creation and dissolution, the zatnsas.

manvantaras, va?nsyacarila, tho expanse of the world, rules 
about danas, sraddha, varnas and asramas, iqta and purla, 
establishment of images of gods, and ovorything else. 

It is not quite clear why the Amarakosa soizod upon tho 
above mentioned five topics aa oharaotoristics of Puranas, 
Amarakosa 1367 cannot bo placed later than the 5th century A. D. 
It is likely that before that timo tho number of Puranas was not 
large, that they had not become vory inflated, and that, as 
Itihasa and Purana were often lumped together as tho 5th Veda 
in the TJpanisads, they both had certain matterB in common. 
Itihasa did not probably deal with creation, dissolution and 
manvantaras, but contented itself with tho dynasties of kings and 
with tho deeds and legends about the heroes of tho past. Barely, 
ItihaBa (Mahabharata) is called Purana and some extant 
Puranas describe themselves as Itihasa. For example, the 
Vayu 33M calls itself m the sumo context both itihasa and purana. 
The Brahmapurana calls itself Purina as well as akhyana 
( 245. 37 and 30 ). The Mahabharata 1M », though gonorally called 
itihasa by itself (as in Adi. 1. 19, 26, 54) or the best of itlhasas, 
still applies to itself tho words. ' akhyana 13M ( as m Adi 2. 388- 
89), Kavya (Adi 2. 390), Karsnaveda ( Adi 1. 264) and Purana 
(Adi 1.17). FromthiB it appears that originally tho line of 
demarcation between tho two was rather thin. In defining 
Purana as ' pancalaksana ' the Amarakosa and some of the 
Puranas seized upon such topics aa distinguished Puranas from 
Itihasa and other branches of Sanskrit literature. It has been

it to the 4th century A D and Hoernle ( in J R A S for 1006 pp 910-941 )

Wliat Puravas contained in Apastamba's day 841 

shown above that the Purana and Bhavisyatpurana that existed 
before Apastamba contained not only sarga and pratisarga but 
also some smrti materials as well. From the definition given in 
the Puranas and the Amarakosa it does not at all follow that 
those five topics alone were the constituent parts of the very 
ancient Pura.rj.as, as Kirfel holds; 1371 What could be said at the 
moat is that five were the distinctive topics that differentiated 
the Purana class of works from other branches of literature and 
probably cognate works called Itihasa or it may be that the five 
are generalized as an ideal for Puranas and that the very early 
representatives of this class ( that existed before Ap. Dh. S. ) 
had not these five as characteristics 

The extant Puranas contain far more subjects than the five. 
Some Puranas barely touch these five and deal at great length 
with altogether different topics Only a few of the extant 
Puranas can be said to deal with all the five topics at some 
length. The five characteristic topics occupy less than three 
percent of the extent of the extant Mahapuranas. Of all 
Puranas the extant Visnu alone closely agrees with the definition 
of Parana as 'pancalaksana,' though it also contains a good 
many other topics. On a modest calculation the four subjects 
of vrata, sraddha, tlrtha and dana cover at least one hundred 
thousand slokas in the extant eighteen main Puranas. Several 
of them have identical chapters on several topics (e. g. Matsya 13 " 
and Padma, Vayu and Brahmanda contain long passages 
that agree v&balim with one another in many matters and 
details). It is probable, therefore, that the extant principal 
Puranas are partial and gradually inflated representatives of 
an earlier group of Puran as (not necessarily 18 in number) that

1372. For example. Matsya chapters 55 and 57-60 are the same aa 
Padma V. 24. 64-278, Matsya 62-64 = Padma V. 22 61-164. Matsya 69-70

existed before Yajnavalkya. In the present state of our know- 
ledge it is almost an insoluble problem to find out what these 
Puranas were or contained. The number 18 wa3 probably due 
to the fact that the number is prominent in several connections 
as regards the Mahahharata. The Bharata war was fought for 
18 days, the total of the vast armies engaged in the conflict 
came to 18 aksauhinls, the epic has 18 parvans, the Glfca also 
has 18 chapters 1373 

The Puranas may be classified into several categories, viz. 
( 1 ) encyclopaedic like the Agni, Garuda and Naradlya, (2) 
those mainly dealing with tlrthas such as Padma, Skanda and 
Bhavisya, (3) sectarian, such as Linga, Vamana, Markandeya, 
(4) Historical such as Vayu and Brahmanda The Vayu, 
Brahmanda, Matsya and Visnu are probably the oldest among 
extant Puranas, though they too have received substantial 
additions from time to time. 

There are seven Puranas that contain historical material, 
viz the ancient dynasties down to the time of the Bharata war 
and from the Bharata war to the downfall of the Andhras and 
the rise of the Guptas, 1374 viz Vayu 99. 250-435, Visnu IV 20. 
12 to IV. 24. 44, Brahmanda III. 74 104-248, Bhagavata IX 12. 
9-16, IX 22. 34-49 and XII. 17, Garuda 140 and 141. 1-12, 
Bhavisya IJX 3 and 4 (this account is practically worthless). 
Matsya contains the fullest list of Andhra kings and states 
(273.16-17) that 29 Andhra kings will rule for 460 years, 
while the Vayu (99 357-358) states that 30 Andhra kings will 
rule 13710 for 456 (406?) years Both Vayu (99 355) and Matsya 
(373 16) ('Pulova' in Vayu) make Puloma as the last king of the 
Andhras. Ptolemy who published his 'Geography of India' about

Date of Parana references to Andhras 843 

150 AD. states that Ptolemaio3 was king of Baithana(Paithana)in 
his days (vide J.I.H. vol 23, 1943, at p. 84 in an article on 'Apostles 
of Kalyan*. So that these historical references to Andhras must 
be a good deal later than 150 A.D. Only four Puranas viz. Vayu, 
Brahmanda, Bhagavata and Visnu mention in a general way 
that kings of the Gupta dynasty will rule along the Ganges up 
toPrayaga, Saketa(Ayodhya) and Magadha, but no names of 
Gupta kings are specified. The passages referring to the Guptas 
are rather corrupt. 13716 It is argued by Pargiter ( in ' Dynasties 
of the Kali age"' p. XII. ) and others that Samudragupta 
was a great conqueror as his Allahabad Prasasti shows 
(Sleet's * Gupta Inscriptions ' No. 1 ). Most scholars are agreed 
that the Gupta dynasty began to rule about 320 A. D. It is 
argued that, if the reviser or revisers of the Puranas had known 
the brilliant campaigns of Samudragupta they would have 
named him at least and that therefore the revision of the Vayu 
took place between 320-335 A. D.

questions relating to Puranas. For those who desire to make

is Chinese, as its peculiar total music suggests. When it is a mere matter of

a believer that he is wrong One of his astounding theories is that each 
of the kings mentioned in the Puranik texts is not a real king, but represents 
a time unit of forty years.

Some remarks on the important conclusions of Pargiter and 

Kirfel are necessary. Pargiter tries to construct history from 

the earliest times to the Bharata war which he holds to have 

taken place about 950 B. O. (AlHT, chap. 15 p 182). He 

holds that there were two traditions in ancient India, viz. the 

Ksatriya tradition and the Brahmana tradition ( AlHT, chap. 5 

pp. 58-77). He harps dozens of times on the utter lack of the 

historic sense among the brahmanas in his work (AlHT), holds 

that the Puranas represent the ksatriya tradition, that there 

were three racial stocks, viz. the Manavas (orManvas as he 

styles them), the Ailas and the Saudyumnas, that respectively 

represent the Dravidian, the Aryan and Munda ( AIBT chap. 25 

PP. 289-302), that the Puranas are Sanskritizations of works 

in Prakrit ( pp. X-XI ) of ' Dynasties of the Kali age ". His 

date for the Mahabharata war has not been accepted by later 

scholars, since his handling of that subject is not judicial, 

objective or straightforward, but relies too much on his own 

prejudices and on averages. In his 'Purana texts of the 

dynasties of the Kali age (pp. 58, 74) he appears to favour the 

view that the Bharata war was fought 1050 years before the 

Nandas i. e. about 1475 B. C. The mss. and the printed Puranas

mon experience that the total number of yoara botwoea ono well- 
known ovent and another can bo easily remembered and handed 
down even orally for hundrods of years, while handing down 
hundreds of royal names is a difficult matter and some names 
may easily drop out. Moreover, the Matsya, Brahnianda and 
Vayu themselves say that they 13 ' 7 mention only the prominent 
kings of the Iksvaku lino and the Brhadratha lino 1373 and even 
as to the Paurava 1379 line it is oloar that that dynasty had many 
names not all of whioh aro onumorated. There is therefore 
every possibility that soma kings dropped out oven in later 
genealogies also (as for example Matsya 213.16, saying that 
Sndhras were 29 and Vayu 99 357 saying they were 30 J. 
Merely counting the total of the kings actually named in the 
PurSnas would not convoy a quite accurate idea of the total length 
of years during which that dynasty ruled. Bearing in mind 
the two matters (viz. trustworthiness of tradition and Pauranika 
genealogies and the ease of remembering the time distance 
between too well-known events ) he should have endeavoured to 
find out the age of the Bharata War. Ho brushes aside the 
statement of the period between Parlksit and Nanda as unreli- 

( Continued from last page) 
states that in the 9th Skandha the Bhagavata assigns 1000 years to 20 
kings from Marjan of the Magadha line ( a contemporary of Fariksit ). then 
S Fradyotana kings ruled for 138 years, then the Sisunagas ruled for 360 
years , thus 1498 years passed between Pariksit and the crowning- of Nanda 
and therefore he supports the reading of the interval as 1500 years

Pargiter's method criticized 847 

able simply on the ground ( which appears to me flimsy ) that 
the figures (1015, 1050 ) are discrepant ( A. I. H. T. p. 180 ). In 
almost all passages of the Puranas there is some discrepancy or 
other. Therefore, he should have made an endeavour to find out 
which one of the three periods ( 1015, 1050, 1500 ) is supported 
by the best and oldest mss. and should have stuck to them, parfc- 
oularly when the Sanskrit equivalents of the three periods 
(pancadasa, pancasat and paiicasala) are so much alike that 
scribes might easily have been confused and made their own 
readings. Even taking the least period of ( 1015 ) years, the 
MahabhSrata War would have to be placed at about 1440 B. O. 
(adding 1015 to the date of Nanda*s enthronement, viz. about 
425 B. 0. ). Most Western writers and Prof. S. N. Pradhan ( in 
'Chronology of ancient India", Calcutta 1927, pp. 249ff ) find fault 
with Pauranika statements and brush them aside as practically 
worthless. Prof. Pradhan takes the kings actually named in the 
three lines, holds that 28 years are the average reign period of 
each and multiplying the number of kings hy 28 arrives at the 
conclusion that the Mahabharata war was fought about 1150 B.C. 
It is not possible to deal at length with his arguments. 
But he ignores the express words of the Puranas that they enu- 
merate only the principal or important kings. Besides, there are 
scholars like Pargiter who regard 17 or 18 years a3 the average^ 
reign of a king in other countries ( and in India also ). The 
author cannot accept Prof. Pradhan's reasoning. Most Western 
writers are loth to assign old dates to matters Indian. Pargiter 
is no exception. Instead of straightforwardly accepting one of 
the three periods that was strongly supported by mas, he in- 
dulges in some devices that appear like tricks of jugglery ( A. 
I. H. T. pp 180-183 ). His method requires some explanation 
and examination. 

Vyasa is said to have been alive when the Bharata battle 
was fought at the end of the Dvapara age and he is also held to be 
the author of the 18PuraDas. The kings before the Bharata war, 
the Pandava heroes and a few descendants of them and of some 
contemporaries of them are treated by the Matsya, Vayu, 

^v^ manda and otlier3 as P asfc (citita). Adhisomakrsna or

( excluding Arjuna) is said to have boon alivo when the Puranas 
were narrated to the sages at the saltta. Both Vayu (99. 282) 
and Matsya (271. 5) state that in the Iksvaku line king Divakarai 
6th Cor 5th in Matsya) in descent from Brhadbala, was alive at 
the time when the Puranas wero narrated. Then the same 
Puranas (Vayu 99. 30, Matsya 271. 33 and Brahmanda HI. 74. 
113 ) state that in the lino of Jarasandha (ruler of Magadha), 
who was a contemporary of the Pandavas and whose son 
Sahadera was killed in tho Bharata war, there was Senajit who 
was a contemporary of Adhislma krsna and Divakara and who 
was 7th in descent from Sahadeva Those three are desonbed as 
vartamana kings in the Puranas and all those that came after 
these three are described as bhamsya. Pargiter first (AEHT 
p. 180) takes the total of the kings of the three dynasties. 
Aiksvaka, Paurava and Magadha that are actually named 
( ignoring what the Puranas say viz. that only the principal or 
important kings are named and not all) and the total of the re- 
igns of all these ( 1408 years), finds that tho average of the reign 
of each king in the three lines works out at such large figures as 
47, 50, 31, which he regards as impossible when tested by real 
historical averages But he forgets that the Puranas say that in 
the Aiksvaka, Magadha and Paurava lines and also generally 
only the prominent kings are mentioned and also that the 
extant Puranas are only fragments left of the originals, since in 
the Brahmanda (1IL 74) all Paurava and Aiksvaka kings are 
altogether lost. Then he takes the total number of kings in ten 
kingdoms up to Mahapadma and arrives at the average of 26 
kings for each kingdom ( AIHT p 181 ). Then he says that the 
average of fourteen series of kings in Eastern and Western 
countries which he examined comes to 19 years for each reign 
and, holding that the average in eastern countries is less than 
in western countries, he arrives at the average of 18 years for 
each reign (pp. 181-182), which he regards as fair and rather 
liberal. He then multiplies the average 18 ( of length of reigns ) 
by 26 ( the average number of kings in ten countries which he 
supposes to be the only kings in those ten ) and arrives at the 
figure 468 years. He adds these to the date which he assigns 
to Mahapadma Nanda 382 B. O. and thus arrives at 850 B. 0. as 
the mean date of the beginning of the reign of Adhislmakrsna, 
Divakara and Senajit, who were lartamana kings. Thanhs 
takes five as the average of the kings between the vartamana 
kings and Yudhisthira and assigning about 100 years to these 
5 kings, arrives at the date 950 B. O. for the Bharata war. n» 



Fargiter and the Bharuta war 849 

discards ( AIHT p. 180 n 3 } the astronomical evidence contained 
in the Puranas ( and the Mahabharata ) about Bharata war in 
a single sentence viz. that astronomical statements can have no 
scientific precision and can only have been formed by estimate 
at the close. The probable date of the Mahabharata war has 
been discussed by the author at some length on materials 
supplied by the Mahabharata, the Puranas, Varahamihira, 
Aryabhata and Inscriptions in vol III. pp. 895-923 and there- 
fore he does not go into that question here. But he strongly 
disapproves of the methods of Pargiter and the date he deduces. 
Later scholars like Kirfel have not accepted the conclusions of 
Pargiter about two separate traditions and about the Puranas 
being Sanskritizations of originals written in Prakrit and 
Kharosthi script ( p. XVI. of Intro to ' Purana Texts &c. ' }. The 
importance of another independent source has not been taken 
proper notice of by Pargiter and even by Kirfel. It appears 
that about 300 B. C. Megasthenes was supplied with a list of 
kings from Bacchus to Alexander's time (153 or 154 in number ) 
covering by their reigns a period of 6451 years and three 
months. Vide 'Ancient India as described by Megasthenes and 
Arrian' by MoCrindle (1877) p. 115 and Cambridge History 
of Ancient India, vol. I. (1923, p. 409). Even supposing for 
argument that the account of kings is not trustworthy the fact 
remains that about 300 B. G Indiana claimed that they had 
luts of kings that reigned before that date for thousands of 
years ( and not for a few hundred years as Pargiter would have 
us believe). 

It has been shown above that Apastamba mentions a Bhavi- 
iq9^T r§,m and quotes four verses from a Purana (p. 817, note 

«8). That Bhavisyat-purana was probably so called because 
"contained in a prophetic vein the names and other details of 
«ngs that flourished after the Bharata heroes and after a few 
generations of descendants of them and their contemporaries 
and probably purported to have been composed by some sage or 

7 Vytsa. As the Kali age is said to have started after the 
bharata war, as Parasara, his son Vyasa and Vyasa's son Suka 
were regarded as more or less contemporaries of the Pandavas 
mat lived i n the Dvapara age and as all the 18 Puranas are 
aeemsd to have been composed by Vyasa 1381 in the Dvapara age,

of Adhislmakrsna and his contemporaries downwards has 
been furnished by the Puranas in the form of a prophetic 
style It has not been oleaily noticed by both Pargiterand 
Kirfel that the so-called future kings are divided into two groups, 
viz. the kings of the Aila, Aiksvaka and Magadha lines from 
Adhislmakrsna, Divakara and Senajit to the last scions of these 
lines (such 1382 aa Sumitra in the Aiksvaka line, Ksemaka in 
the Aila line) form one group and later kings in the lines of 
Pradyotas, Sungas, Andhras, Sakas and others form another 
group and further that the first group was most probably dealt 
with in the ancient Bhavisya-purana or some other Purana 
if we rely on Apastamba, but the other group not having 
been in existence when the Bhavisyat was composed (before 
500-400 B C ) was dealt with by the extant Puranas from 
information received by them apart from the ancient Bhavisyat. 
This is clear from the passages of the Matsya and Vayu 
quoted 1333 below. The Matsya says ' After this I shall proclaim, 
those future kings in the Aida (Alia), Aiksvaka and Paurava 
line3 and those with whom those three benign (or virtuous) 
families will come to an end and I shall enumerate all of these 
kings that are narrated in the Bhavisya Other Jungs different

PurUnas divide futui e kings in two groups 851 

Ksatriya class), Parasavas (the Parsi tribe or parsons born of a 
sudra father and brahmana mother ? ), Sudras ( as kings ) and 
others that are foreigners, the Andhras, Sakas, Pulindas, Culikas, 
Yavanas, fishermen, Abhlras and Sabaras and others born of 
Mleoeha ( tribes ) — these kings I shall proclaim one after another 
in order and by name. Ont of these (two groups) the first is 
Adhislmakrsna who is now alive and I shall speak of the kings 
of his line that are narrated in the Bhavisya '. This passage 
"makes it perfectly clear that in the ancient Bhavisyat kings of 
the three lines of Alia, Aiksvaka and Paurava to the last of 
them were enumerated (vide note 1382), but that the later kings 
like the Andhras and Sakas were not enumerated therein I 
agree with PaTgiter (p. VUL in Intro to 'Purana Texts' &o. ) that 
the words ' Bhavisye kathitan' in Matsya ( 50. 77 ) or ' Bhavisye 
pathitan ' in Vayu (in 99.292) refer to the descendants mentioned 
in the Bhavisya and that they do not 3imply mean 'mentioned 
in future.' I fail to understand, however, why he regards 
'Bhavisyat' as a perversion of 'Bhavisya'. Bhavisyat is as 
good a word as Bhavisya, being employed in several passages 
such as Varaha ( 177. 34 ), Matsya ( 53. 62 ). 

Pargiter probably wants to identify the Bhavisyat of Apa- 
stamba with the Bhavisya of later times. There is no evidence 
except the name to identify the two It, therefore, appears that the 
extant Puranas base their narrative as to the three lines of 
Aila, Aiksvaka and Paurava kings on the materials contained 
in the ancient Bhavisya and as to other lines and compara- 
tively later kings they relied on other materials or oral traditions 
that they could collect. This inference receives support from 
otner circumstances. The extant Puranas quote verses called 
anuvamsa slokas or gathas about ancient kings, such as Karta- 
vlrya (wjayu 94.20, Matsya 43, 24, Brahmanda HI 68-20, 

SSt T } ? nd ***> about tha last acions <* the Aila and 
Aitavaka hues, vi z . Sumitra and Ksemaka. But so far as kings 
of comparatively later dynasties such as those of the Andhras,

downfall of the Andhras. Therefore, the Matsya should be regard- 
ed as composed or revised about the middle for end) of the 3rd 
century A. D., though the possibilities of some chapters or verses 
being added after that date cannot be ruled out. When the Vayu 
(99.383), Brahmanda (HI. 74.195), Visnu (IV. 24. 18) and 
BhSgavata (XII. 1 37) mentioned the Guptas as rulers the first 
two probably added these passages just about the time when 
Gupta rule began and the Vianu and Bhagavata ( which present 
a corrupt text) might have borrowed the information from mss. 
of Vayu or Brahmanda. It is clear, however, that the first two 
( out of the four ) Puranas were composed or revised about 
330-335 A. D. and the other two later still. 

Kirfel's work 'Purana Pancalaksana ' is one of fundamental 
importance so far as the Puranas are concerned, since it adopts 
a new method for the treatment of Pauranika material The 
German Introduction of this work has been reproduced in 
English in the Journal of the Shri Venkatesa Institute at 
Tirupati, in vol. VH. pp. 81-121 and vol VEX pp. 9-33. Kirfel 
disagrees with many of the views of Fargiter. His main con- 
clusions are: Apart from the abridgement in Agni and Garuda 
as well as the prose paraphrase in Visnu, there are only three 
complete groups of Purana texts viz. Brahma and Harivamsa, 
Brahmanda and Vayu, and that of Matsya, all other Puranas 
containing only smaller or larger parts of the same. Of the three 
groups, Brahmanda and Harivamsa are the oldest ( and not Brah- 
manda and Vayu as Pargiter in A.I.H.T. p 78 says). Kirfel holds 
that the Brahmanda and Vayu must have originally been a single 
Purana, particularly because the largest parts of both agree with 
each other, that Pargiter is not right in thinking that the 
additions in Vayu and Brahmanda were borrowed from the 
ancient Bhavisya ( Kirfel p 18, vol VII. of J. V. O. I. p 92), but 
that the borrowed material goes back to an independent text. 
Kirfel does not accept Pargiter's theory that the Puranas were 
Sanskritizations of Prakrit texts, that the Visnu in its existing 
form is a younger Purana than the Vayu or Brahmanda in spite 
of the fact that it most faithfully observes the basio arrangement 
of the five characteristics of Puranas. The division of Puranas 
into 18 and the distribution of Puranas into sattuka, rajasa and 
tamasa are not original items but are applicable only to the last 
definitive texts of the Puranas Pargiter thought that there 
existed an Ur-Puxana which had treated of the five topics ( of 
sarga &c ) in ideal completeness and clear disposition. Kirfel 



Kirfel and Pargiter 853 

says that this is saarcely mora than an arbitrary assumption 
(p. XLVHI of Kirfal's Intro, and J. V. O. I: vol. VIII. p. 31 ). 

The present author may tentatively accept most of the con- 
clusions of Kirfel, but he differs as stated above from Kirfel's 
view that the five characteristic topics ( sarga &c. ) are the oldest 
constituent parts of the whole Purana Literature. 

A lengthy discussion of the age of the Puranas is not very 
relevant to the subject of this section. But it would not be 
entirely out of place if the author said a few words thereon. 

The author's position about the Puranas is as follows: We 
know hardly anything about the Purana mentioned in Atharva- 
veda, the Satapatha and the ancient Upanisads ; but this much 
is clear that Purana had attained a status of sacredness like 
the Vedas and was closely associated with Itihasa even in "Vedic 
times. This is the first stage in the evolution of Purana Litera- 
ture, but we know nothing about the contents of the Purana in 
those ancient times. The Tai. K. mentions Pura^ani ; therefore 
in its time there must have been three Puranas at least. As 
Ap. Dh. S. quotes four verses from a Purana and expressly names 
Bhavisyatpurana, it follows that by the 5th or 4th century B. C. 
at the latest there wa3 in existence a Bhavisyat-purana and 
other Puranas or a Purana, that contained sarga and pratisarga 
and some Smrti material This we may regard as the 2nd 
definite stage of Purana Literature, of the contents of which we 
have some traces at least. 

The Mahabharata quotes hundreds of verses ( called slokas, 
gathas, anuvaihsa slokas ), some of which have a bearing upon 
Pauranika subjects and have a Pauranika ring. Some examples 
may be cited. The Vanaparva 1381 quotes two verses about the 
spiritual prowess of Visvamitra and about his assertion that he 
was a brahmana. The Anusasanaparva 1385 quotes certain

g&thaB said to have been sung by the pitra about the importance 

of a son or sons, which agree in letter and spirit with verses 

on the same subject in the Puranas. In the Udyoga-parva 1386 

Bhlsma is said to have addressed a verse to Parasurama that 

was sung by Marutta and declared in a Purana. In the Puranas 

also there are frequent quotations of slokas, 1387 gathas and 

anuvamsaslokas sung by people described as PaurWmka (in 

Vayu 70. 76, 88. 114-116, 88. 168-169, BrahmSnda III 63. 69-70) 

or as purUeidah or purUvajiiah in Vayu, 83. 171 and 95. 19, 

Brahmanda HI. 63. 171). Vayu (93. 94-101) mentions several 

gathas as sung by Yayati, most of which occur in the Adiparva 

75. 50-53 and 85. 12-15, Brahmanda III. 68. 96-103 and in other 

purSnas also. It is quite possible that these gathas and slokas 

said to hare been declared by those who knew Puranas were 

taken from the Purana or Puranas known to Apastamba. As 

Yaj. I. 3 regards Purana as one of the sources of dharraa, it 

follows that some Puranas containing smrti material must have 

been composed a good deal before that smrti i e. before the 2nd 

or 3rd century A D. at the latest. This is the third stage in the 

evolution of Puranas. It is difficult to say when the extant 

Matsya was originally composed but it was revised about the 

middle ( or close ) of the 3rd century A D., since it speaks of the 

downfall of the Andhra dynasty, but does not refer to the Guptas. 

But it is possible that the original kernel of the Matsya may be 

earlier than this by a few centuries. The same applies to Vayu 

and Brahmanda. The Vayu and Brahmanda also were compiled 

or added to about 320-335 A. D., since they refer to the Guptas 

but do not name any Gupta king. These two in their present 

form may also be referred to this third stage. Most of the Maha- 

purSnas were composed or completed in the period from the 5th

Stages m the growth of Puratias 855 

or 6th century A. D. to the 9th century A. D. This represents 
the 4th stage in the evolution of Purana literature. The TTpa- 
puranas began to be compiled from about the 7 th or 8th century 
A D. and their numbers went on increasing till about the 13th 
century A. D or even later. This is the last phase. Thus there 
is enough evidence to hold that the Puranas began to influence 
Hindu society a few centuries before Christ, that their influence 
continued in full force till the 17 th or 18th century A. D. and 
that it continues to some extent even now. After the 9th 
century no further Mahapuranas appear, but additional matter 
appears to have been unscrupulously inserted in several Puranas, 
the worst example of the kind being the third part of the 
Bhavisya, which contains stories of Adam and Eve, of Prthvira j 
and Jaicandra, Taimur, Akbar, Caitanya, Bhattoji, Nadirshah 
and so on. 

The word 'purana' occurs over a dozen times in the Bgveda, 

is an adjective and means 'ancient, old*. The Nighantu { III. 

27) mentions six Vedic words as having the sense of 'purana' 

viz. pratnam, praduah, piaiayah, sanemt, pui oyam, ahnaya. 

Yaska (Nirukta in. 19) derives the word 'purana' as 'pura 

navam bhavati * ( what was new in former times ). The Rgveda 

does not contain the word 'puratana' (ancient). Purana may 

be a very old form of 'puTatana' through the intermediate form 

puiaana' From meaning ancient the word ' purana ' came to 

mean a work dealing with ancient tales , it became a noun and 

was applied in the times of the Atharvaveda, the Satapatha and 

ths i TTpamsads to a class of works containing ancient tales 

When purana came to mean a work dealing with ancient tales, 

to speak of a Bhavisyat-purana was apparently a contradiction 

in terms That contradiction was probably not minded or was 

ignored by the thought that works that narrated old tales 

gradually came to include comparatively recent ones and had

856 History of Dliarmaiaslra [Sea IV, Oh, XXR 

The Padmapurana propounds a slightly different etymology, 
viz. "it is called Purana because it desires or likes the past" 
from * pura ' and the root * vas * ( to de3ire or to like ). 

The question why the extant Puranas do not narrate the 

traditions about the dynasties of the Guptas and their successors 

cannot be satisfactorily answered. One reason may he that the 

original kernel of some Puranas like the extant Matsya were 

compiled before the Guptas rose to power, while others like the 

Vayu and Brahmanda were compiled while the Gupta rule was 

in it3 infancy. Another reason may have been that in the 5th 

and following centuries when many of the extant Puranas were 

compiled northern India was vexy much disturbed by the 

invasions of foreigners like the Hunas, rm Toramana and 

Mihirakula, numerous sects and schisms had arisen, Buddhism 

had become powerful and therefore the first task of the intelligent 

and devout followers of the Yeda wa3 held to be to wean the 

common people away from schisms like that of Buddha, to lay 

down the foundations of a new ideology among the masses and 

to emphasize and assimilate as many of the doctrines of the 

Eect3 and schisms as possible with their ancient traditions 

and practices. The intelligent classes, therefore, emphasized 

the importance of 3uch virtues as ahimsa, satya, bhakti and of 

vrata3, pilgrimages, sraddhas and danas and were probably not 

in a mood to record the names of foreign conquerors or of small 

chieftains fighting with each other and unable to repel the 

cruel invaders. For the absence of references to the dynasties 

of the Guptas and their successors, Pargiter blames the 

brahmanas in the following characteristic passage (AIHT 

chap, i p. 57) 'the absolute dearth of traditional history after 

that stage is quite intelligible, both because the compilation of 

the Purana had set a seal of tradition and because the Purana 

soon passed into the hands of brahmanas who preserved what 

they had received, but with the brahmanic lack of the historic 

sense, added nothing about the later kings'. Supposing for 

argument that brahmanas lacked the historic sense, Pargiter"s 

opinion appears to be entirely one-sided. He assigns no reason 

why the sufias, whose business was to record and preserve historic 

tradition (as he himself Bays onp 58 of AIHT), did not stick to 

their business and did not continue to compose genealogies of 

1339. For the history of the ruthless Hcna invader Mihirakula, vide

Pargiter's theory criticized 857 

later kings and to add further items of history to already existing 
tecorded tradition, nor does he explain how the sutas could 
' ie ousted or allowed themselves to be ousted from their age-old 

vocation by the brahmanas. It is probable that foreign dynas- 
ties like that of Kaniska and the HQnas did not encourage the 

utas who had sunk low in the social scale and the sutas 
irobably became Buddhists, as Buddhism with its Jataka stories 
jave to all persons following a bardic profession sufficient scope 
for earning their livelihood. 

The legends about Vyasa and Suta may be briefly considered. 
The Puranas declare that Vyasa was the son of Parasara, was 
also called Ersna Dvaipayana and was an incarnation of Visnu 
( of Brahma also in Vayu 77. 74-75 and of Siva in the Kurma 
H. 11. 136 ). He was called Dvaipayana 1390 because he was 
born on an island ( dvlpa) in the Yamuna river and Krsna be- 
cause he was of dark complexion. His mother was Satyavatl 
and son was Suka. He was called Vyasa because he is supposed 
to have divided or arranged the one Veda into four parts ( from 
the root 'as' 4th conjugation 'to throw' with the upasarga * vi ' ). 
He instructed four disciples in the four Vedas, viz. Paila, 
Vaisampayana, Jaimini and Sumantu respectively in B.gveda, 
Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda. His 5th disciple was 
Suta Bomaharsana to whom was imparted Itihasa-Purana. 
Ihe son of Suta was Sauti who narrated the Mahabharata to 
Saunaka and other sages in the Naimisa forest. It was believed 
that whenever dharma and Veda declined Vyasas were born 
tor the benefit of men (Brahma 158. 34). The Kurma (I 52

enumerate the names of the 28 Vyasas of the 28 Dvapara ages 
of the Vaivasvata Manvantara (which is the current one). How 
Vyasa put together the Purana3 is described in several Puranas 
* He who wa3 an adept in the meaning of Purana composed a 
Purana-samhita from ( the material supplied by) tales, episodes, 
gathas { stanzas ) and correct ascertainment or descriptions of 
Ealpas ". U92 This shows that, while the Vedio text3 were pres- 
erved with unparalleled care by the brahamana3, the very 
ancient Itihasa-purana, though called the 5th Veda, was not 
kept intact with care similar to that bestowed on the four Vedas 
and that this fifth Veda was allowed to be inflated by fresh addi- 
tions from time to time. 

In connection with Vyasa's legendary role a3 an arranger 
of the Veda, Pargiter has a theory of his own which must be 
briefly noticed and examined. He develops that theory on 
pp. 9-10 of A. I. H T. He refers to the Rgveda as the greatest 
brahmanical book, says that it is a compilation of hymns com- 
posed by many authors and is arranged according to certain 
principles. His words are ' It ( Rgveda ) must manifestly have 
been compiled and arranged by some one or more persons, yet 
Vedio Literature says absolutely nothing about this. The 
brahmanas cannot have been ignorant about it, for they pres- 
erved it and it3 text with unparalleled care. "'Vedic Literature 
professes to know and declares the name3 of the authors of near- 
ly all the hymns and even of single verse3, yet it ignores all 
knowledge of the person or persons who afterwards compiled and 
arranged these hymns To suppose that when it preserved the 
earlier information it wa3 ignorant of the later work in so vital 
a matter i3 ridiculous. ' Prom this silence in the Vedic Litera- 
ture about the persons that compiled and arranged the ifrgvedaj 
Pargiter at once jumps to the positive and emphatic conclusion, 
as 13 usual with many western writers on Sanskrit Literature 
and Indology to aTgue from Bilence, that ' Vedic Literature has 
deliberately suppressed all information on these matters' (AIHT 
p. 9 ). He Tefera to the fact that the Mahabharata and Puranas 
are full of Vyasa and repeatedly declare that the Veda was 
arranged by Vyasa and points out that Vedic Literature is

Pargiter k s theory criticized 859 

remarkably reticent about Vyasa Parasarya ( who is mentioned 
as a pupil of Visvaksena in the Vamsa list at _the end of the 
Samavidhana Brahmana and in the Taittirlya Aranyaka ) and 
then he reiterates his charge of the conspirary of silence about 
Vyasa ( AIHT. p. 10 ). Pargiter is ready with, a reason for the 
supposed conspiracy of silence viz. ' the brahmanas put forward 
the doctrine that the Veda existed from everlasting ; henoe to 
admit that any one had compiled or even arranged it struck at 
the root of their doctrine and was in common parlance to give 
their whole case away ' ( ibid. p. 10 ). 

Several objections can be raised against the positive asser- 
tion of deliberate and fraudulent suppression inferred from mere 
silence. In the first place, Pargiter ia very loose in his statement 
of facts. Pargiter totally ignores that even in the Rgveda itself, 
rk verses, yajus texts and saman chants are differentiated. To 
give only a few references, vide for Rks ( Rg. II. 35. 12, V. 6. 5, 
V. 27. 4, V. 44. 14-15 ), in both verses of the last rk and samans 
being separately mentioned ; for yajus tide P»g. V. 62. 5, X 181. 3 ) ; 
for saman chants vide Rg. IX 43. 2 ( udgateva sakune sama 
gayasi), VIII. 81. 5 (sravat sama giyamanam), VIII. 95. 7 
( suddhena samna). 

The epic and puranio texts indicate that Veda was thought 
to be originally one, but was arranged into four groups, that 
the four groups of texts were entrusted for preservation and 
propagation to four different disciples of Vyasa. The Rgvedahas 
two arrangements, one into maqdalas and suktas and the other 
into astakas, adhyauas and vargas. The Taittirlyasamhita and 
Aiharvaveda are arranged into kandas. Not a word is said in 
any of these accounts to which Pargiter refers about picking up 
hymns already existing or their being arranged in mandates or 
adhyayas or kandas by Vyasa. Further, the reason assigned for 
the supposed deliberate suppression of the name of the arranger 
of the Veda is quite flimsy, not to say ridiculous. Every hymn 
of theggvedaor every mantra has a rsi who by the ancient 
indian tradition was not the author (as Pargiter puts it) but only 
the s&r. ft is clear from Brahmana texts, Upanisads and smrtis

that no one should teach or repeat in japa or employ a mantra 
in a sacrifice without knowing the rsi, the metre, the deity and 
the use ( viniyoga) of it and dire consequences were declared to 
follow for him who was remiss in these matters. Hymns and 
mantras were arranged in different groups for different religi- 
ous rites and solemn sacrifices or for other purposes (such as 
santis). It is not necessary to remember who arranged the 
required mantras for rite3, sacrifices and other purposes. The 
Brahmana texts and srauta sutxas prescribe the manner of the 
employment of the same mantras for various purposes and the 
Anukramanls contain the names of the seers, metres and the 
deities of hymns and individual mantras also As every mantra 
of the Veda was supposed to be only seen by a sage and as 
eternal, the mere compilation of them in one or more series or the 
mere arrangement of mantras or hymns in different groups for 
different purposes did not at all affect or interfere with the 
eternality of mantras or hymns. Pargiter's so-called reason for 
suppressing the name of the arranger of the Veda is simply no 
reason at all. 

Pargiter did not stop to consider possible explanations. One 
of the most plausible is now put forth. The Mahabharata and the 
Puranas ( a very extensive literature ) were attributed to Vyasa, 
who, as shown above in n. 1390, had come to be looked upon as 
Visnu or as an avataia at Visnu. The four Vedas and the 
several different sakhas (recensions) of each Veda were well 
known. By a sort of post facto explanation, the distribution of 
the Veda into four mam groups was claimed to have been 
brought about by the divinely inspired Vyasa, whose Puranas 
are, as will be apparent from note 1349 above and as will be 
shown in more detail later, glorified as even anterior and 
superior to the Veda The eternality of the Veda had to be 
maintained and at the same time Vyasa was to be glorified.

Sow Vyasa was proclaimed as Veda-arranger 861 

The easiest way was to proclaim that Vyasa, the author of the 
great Epio and of the distribution of Puranas into eighteen, was 
also responsible for the division or arrangement of the Veda. 
If all this glorification of Vyasa occurred in the centurieB 
immediately preceding and following Christ, how could the 
supposed arranger of the Veda be mentioned in the early Vedic 
Literature, which, most scholars agree, was closed some centuries 
before Buddha ( i e before the 6th century B. O.)? No body 
claims that the arrangement into mandalas or astakas or kandas 
is eternal It is only the hymns or mantras that are claimed 
to be eternal. Even the padapatha of the Bgveda is declared 
to be non-eternal and is ascribed to Sakalya whom the Nirukfca 
criticises in VL 28. Visvarupa on Ystj III 243 expressly states 
that the pada and ki ama arrangements of the Veda are due to 
human authors. 1394 This theory explains all matters and has 
faT better claims to be accepted than Pargiter's bold ascription 
of fraudulent suppression inferred from (a supposed) silence. 

The Puranas do not speak with one voice about their own 

origin and transmission. After declaring that Vyasa entrusted 

the preservation and propagation of the Puranas to Suta, the 

Vayu and other Puranas contain a somewhat different version. 

The Vayu narrates (61. 55-61 ) : Suta had six disciples, viz. 

Sunlti Atreya, Akrtavxana Kasyapa, Agnivarcas Bhardvaja, 

Mitrayu Vasistha, Savarni Saumadatti, Susarman Samsapayana. 

Three of these, viz. Kasyapa, Savarni and Samsapayana prepared 

new Purana-samhitas and Suta's own was the 4th and the 

original one. All were divided into four kandas, contained the 

same sense (matter), but differed in their readings as the iakhas 

of the Veda differ. All had four thousand verses except the 

samhita of Samsapayana. These four are said to be the basic 

samhitas (in Brahmanda H. 35 66) or original samhitas(in 

Vayu 61. 58purvasamhitas). The Brahmanda (II. 35 63-J70) 

/m^/^t aC0ouni! in almost in the same words. Visnu 
(HI. 6. 16-17), Agni 271 (11-13) are briefer but agree in the 
mam with Vayu. The Bhagavata ( XE. 7. 4-7 ) differs from all 
these to some extent That there is some substance in this story 
appears from stray passages in several chapters of the VSyu 
{56. 1, 60. 33-34, 62. 1, 89. 16 ) and the Brahmanda (II 34 34,

II. 36. 1 &o. ), where Samsampayana is the inquirer and Suta 
replies. 

The personality of Suta is somewhat of an enigma in the 
Mahabharata and the Puranas. Suta is called Komaharsana 1395 
or Lomaharsana because he made the hair (roman or loman) 
of his audience bristle or stand erect by his touching and eloquent 
speech. In the Skanda it is stated that he was so called because 
his own hair stood on end when he was being instructed by 
Dvaipayana One meaning of the word suta is 'chrioteer' and 
another meaning is ' a person of a mixed pr&iloma caste born 
of the union of a brahmana woman with a ksatriya male' and 
the cognate word 'Magadha' means 'one who is born of a 
pratiloma union between a vaisya male and a ksatriya female ' 
(vide Manu X. 71. Yaj I 93-94). The Arthasastra of Kautilya 
says 1396 the same thing about suta and magadha, but adds that 
'the suta and magadha mentioned in the Furanas are diffe- 
rent from these, because he ( the suta ) is distinguished from 
(ordinary) brahmanas and ksatriyas '. Kautilya means that in 
his days suta and magadha were pratiloma oaates, but the suta 
and magadha mentioned as the first reciters of the Furanas are 
a category apart, that they do not belong to the pratiloma castes 
and are both distinguished from brahmanas and ksatriyas (i.e. 
suta of the Furanas is treated more or less as a great sage or semi- 
divine person). The Yayu (1 26-33 and 62-147 ff), Padma (II 27. 
65-87, V. 1.29-32), Brahmanda (II 36 158-173), the Skanda 
(Prabhasakhanda 1. 8) say 1397 that in the sacrifice of Pitamaha 
( i. e Brahma) Suta sprang up as a partial avatara of "Visnu on

The origin of suta and Magadha 863 

the day when soma juice was extracted and magadha also thus 

arose It is further stated in the same Puranas that the haus 

(offering) meant for Indra (symbol of the ksatriya class ) got 

mixed with that meant for Brhaspati ( symbol of hrahmana class 

and learning) and that the suta was born just at the time when 

the mixed-up offering was presented to the gods. From this the 

suta (in later times) had duties similar to those of the original 

suta and it was said that the suta is offspring of the mixed 

union of brahmana (woman) with ksatriya (male) Then 

another story is grafted on to this ( in Vayu 62. 147 ff, Brahmanda 

IL 36. 170-173 and in others) that the original 1393 Suta and 

Magadha sang the praises of king Prthu, son of Vena, who 

being pleased, made a present of the country of Anupa to Suta 

and the country of Magadha to Magadha and since that time 

sutas and magadhas sing the praises of kings and awaken them 

in the morning with blessings. The Vayu itself, 1399 however, 

says (1. 33-34 ) that suta was born at the time of the extracting 

of soma juice in the sacrifice of Prthu Yainya. 

The authors of the extant Vayu and other Puranas are 
conscious that the suta and magadha in their times had no 
adhikara for Veda, that the business of the suta was to note the 
dynasties of god3, sage3 and kings that are found in the Itihasa 
and Puranas. They felt scandalized by the fact that great sages 
like Saunaka were said to have learnt Puranas from the suta 
who in their times belonged to a pratiloma caste, about which 
Gautama, Visnudharmasutra and Kautilya himself lay down 
that pratilomas are like sudras, are condemned by aryas and are

beyond the pale of the usual duties of brahmanas and ksatriyaB 
( such as upanayana, "Veda study, teaching &c. ) Learning by 
a brahmana from a ksatriya was considered even in TTpanisad 
times a3 contrary to the natural order of things. Vide the 
words of king Ajatasatru to Gargya Balaki 11M quoted below. 
Therefore, to account for the position of Suta as instructor in 
Itiha3a and Purana of great sages like Saunaka, the story of 
Sata's birth v/as invented and he was placed m a separate 
category by himself. This must have occurred some centuries 
before Kautilya who was aware of the low position of suta and 
magadha and differentiates the PaurSnika suta from the prati- 
loma suta and magadha. One need not accept the divine 
character of Suta, one has only to understand that in very 
ancient times brahmanas could, without any qualms and with- 
out loss of prestige, learn about legends from a suta, but that 
in the times when the extant puranas were compiled the 
position had entirely changed. 

Next to Pargiter and Eirfel, one must mention the name 
of Prof. R. O. Hazra who has bestowed much labour and thought 
on the puranas in general and on individual puranas One 
cannot but feel high admiration for Prof. Hazra's industry, 
patience and enthusiasm One regrets, however, to find that he 
has developed a tendency to assign rather more ancient dates 
to the extant Puranas and TJpapuranas than the available 
evidence would warrant. Besides, he has been so much engrossed 
m the study of Puranas that he sometimes scents a reference to

records on Hindu rites and customs' (p. 6 ) Prof Hazra observes 
that Vijfianesvara tells us of Harlta's reference to the opinion 
of Puranas in prescribing penance in normal circumstances 
to those who eat the food dedicated to the patriarchs. The 
words of the Mitaksara 1101 of Vijnanesvara are quoted in the note

Prof. Hazra on Puranas criticized 865 

below and clearly show that there the word 'puranesu' means 
'Sraddhas called purana' and has nothing to do with Purana 
works. Another defect noticed in Prof. Hazra's writings is that 
he sees too much meaning in simple words and phrases and is 
not cautious in his conclusions as a scholar of his standing and 
experience should be. In a recent paper on « the Asvamedha, the 
common source of origin of the Purana PaScalaksana and the 
Mahabharata' in ABOPJ.vol. 36 (1956)pp. 190-203, he cites the 
Atharvaveda Terse quoted above (p. 816, n 1325) in which rk 
and sama verses are mentioned separately and ' purana '( pura- 
nam yajusa saha) is associated with yajus, and says this colloca- 
tion seemed to him highly significant and that he felt fully 
convinced that the Purana pancalaksana and the Mahabharata 
owe their origin to the Asvamedha sacrifice and especially to 
its Pariplava akhyanas. Reasons of available space preclude 
a detailed examination of this paper. But a few fundamental 
objections and matters must be mentioned. The words ' puranam 
yajusa saha' should ordinarily mean ( as in passages like 
Devadattah saputra agatah ) no more than * Purana and 
Yajus'. Ta] 1. 101 provides 1402 that after the daily bath, 
a vedio householder should undertake every day the japa of 
portions of the (three) Vedas, the Atharvaveda, Puranas together 
with Rihasa and of adhyatmlki-vidya ( TJpanisads ). There is 
no special meaning here in the association ' puranani setihasani' 
beyond 'Puranas and Itihasa'. One, therefore, fails to under- 
stand how the words 'puranam yajusa saha' are highly signi- 
ficant for arriving at the conuclion that Asvamedha is the 
origin of Purana and Mahabharata. Then on p. 202 of the paper

866 History of DhurmuiVtalra \ Soo. IV, Ch. XXH 

in question Prof. Hazra quotes a passage from 1401 Sankara- 
carya's bhasya on Chandogya HL 4. 1-2 and completely misun- 
derstands the great acarya when ho obsorvos "Sankara's 
use of the word ' ratri ' in tho plural (in 'ratrisu') shows that 
in his opinion the Ililuha and Puiunaweia employed eieiy nirjkt 
during the Pariplava and not met ely on lha nth and Oth myitis 
respectively, as the Satapatha Br. and Sunkhayanasrautasutra 
say" (Italics author's). Tho Asvamodha sacrifice lasted for 
a year and listening to the Pariplava wont on for a year, 
eaoh Pariplava heing a oyclo of ton days ( or rathor nights, as 
the recitation by the hotr priest was to take placo after tho 
morning, mid-day and evening istis to Savifcr woro finished). 
The texts to be recited and the nature of tho legends to bo 
narrated on each of tho oyclo of ton days aro fixed and Itihasa 
and Purana are to be recited only on tho Sth and 9th nights. 
Ab eaoh cycle was of ten days, thoro would bo 36 oyoles of 
Pariplava in a year and Itihasa would bo recited on 36 nights 
in the year and Purana also would bo recited on 36 nights in 
the year. It is for this reason that Sankaraclrya speaks of 
•PariplavaBU ratrisu' in tho plural, but ha does not say that 
Itihasa and Purana were to be reoited on ' all ' nights (saivasu 
ratrisu ), while Prof. Hazra represents him as so saying. There 
is absolutely no warrant in the ancient texts for saying that 
on eaoh day ( or night ) of tho Pariplava Itihasa or Purana was 
to be recited or that Sankaraoarya said anything of the kind. 
The testimony of the Vedantaaiitra 1101 is completely against this 
view of Prof Hazra. Vedantasutra HI 4 23 rofers to certain 
stories mentioned in the TJpamsads suoh as ' Yajfiavalkya had 
two wives, Maitreyl and Katyayanl' (Br. Up IV. 5. 1), 
'Pratardana, son of Divodasa, went to Indra's abode '( Eausl- 
taki Up. HI. 1 ), ' Janasruti Pautrayana was a pious donor 
giving much wealth to the people and keeping an open house for 
distributing food' (Chan. Up IV. 1.1), and remarks that suoh 
stories were not to be recited in Pariplava, since the stories to be 
recited therein are expressly specified beginning with the story

Prof. Hazra and Prof. DiJcshitar on Purams 867 

ofkingManuVaivasvata (which was to be recited on the first 
night of the Pariplava ). 

Prof Hazra has recently published ( in 1958 ) ' Studies in the 
Upapuranas' vol. I pp. 1-400 on Saura and Vaisnava Upa- 
puranas (in the Calcutta Sanskrit College Research Series 1958 ). 
This would be briefly dealt with a little later. 

Prof Eamchandra Dikshitar also has written a good deal on 
the Puranas. His writings are beset by the same infirmity that 
attaches to Prof. Hazia's work to some extent. Eor example, m 
a paper published in the Proceedings of the 13th Indian History 
Congress (pp. 46-50 ) on the VisnupuTana he first states ( p. 46 ) 
that he is mote concerned with the extant Visnupurana and 
after pointing out that the topics of vratas, of fasts, of tlrtha, 
are absent from the extant Visnupurana he concludes that the 
extant Visnupurana can safely be placed m the 6th or 7th 
century B. G. Hardly any modern and critical scholar would 
accept such a date for the extant Visnupurana. Instead of relying 
on the absence of certain topics he should rather have relied on 
what it actually contains to find out the probable date of the 
extant Visnupurana. 

In connection with the Puranas the author must refer at 
some length to the Introductory remarks of Ballalasena, king 
of Bengal, in his Danasagara, edited in the B. I. series 
(1953-1956) by Mr. Bhabatosh Bhattacarya (three paTts of 
text pp. 1-7 22 and 4th part an Introduction in English with 
Indices ). Those remarks evince a bold critical faculty rare in 
our medieval Sanskrit ■writers. He mentions, besides the 
Gopathabrahmana, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the smrtis 
and dharmasastras of Gautama, Manu, Yajfiavalkya, ( count- 
ing Sankha Likhita as two ), Dana-Brhaspati and Brhaspati 
(as separate), Vasistha and others (in all 28), the Chandoga-pari- 
sista of Katyayana, thirteen principal Puranas viz. Brahma, 
VaTaha, Agneya, Bhavisya, Matsya, Vamana, Vayavtya, 
Markandeya, Vaianava, Sawa, Skanda, Padma and Kaurma and 
the Upapuranas named in Kurma and £.di Puranas as contain- 
ing the procedure of ( various ) danas, viz. Adya, Samba, Kalika, 
Nanda ( v. L Nandin ), Aditya, NaTasimha, Visnudharmottara 
( declared by Markandeya ) and the Sastra called Visnudharma 
( eight in all ). He mentions that he drew upon all these for the 
production of his work on danas, 1375 in number (verses 11-20 



868 History of Dharma&ustia [ Seo. IV, Ch. XXII 

pp. 2-3 ). Then he mentions certain Puranaa and UpapurSnas 
which he discarded in his work on danas for various reasons. 

Some of these remarks are very important and the original 
verses are set out in the note below. 1105 He states that he did- 
not draw upon the Bhagavata, the Brahmanda and the Maradlya 
as danas are absent therefrom. He did not rely in his work 
upon the Lingapurana, though it is a large work, because its 
essence, he decides, is the same as the treatment of Maha- 
danas declared in the Matsyapurana , the Bhavisyapurana has 
been assiduously utilised by him only up to the ( vratavidhia 
of ) 7th tithi, but he discards the procedures of the 8th and 9th 
tithis ( of the Bhavisyapurana ), since they are overwhelmed 
( tainted ) with ( the doctrines of ) 11M heretical sects ( Tantrikas,

Bauddfaaa, &o. ); both the Visnurahasya and Sivarahaaya , 
bhough well-known among people, have not been accepted in 
this work, since they are considered to be mere compilations ; the 
Bhavisyottara ( Purana ) which is followed in peoples* practices 
and is not in conflict ( with orthodox views ) has been excluded 
from this work, since no indications ( evidence ) of its autho- 
ritativeness could be found ; the following are ignored in the 
Danasagara for reasons stated : three khandas, viz. those con- 
cerned with the tales of Paundra, Reva and Avanti of the 
Skanda apart from a part of it that is prevalent ( among people ), 
the Tarksya ( i e. Garuda ) purana, another Brahmapurana, 
another Agneya ( i. e. Agnipurana ), a Visnupurana containing 
23000 verses, another Lingapurana containing six thousand 
verses ; all these have been discarded for various reasons such 
as the procedure of dlksS ( initiation of a disciple by a guru in a 
cult like the Tantrika or Pancaratra or Pasupata ) or of the 
establishment of an image, heretical reasoning, testing of jewels, 
atories of the doings of (persons of) false genealogies, treating of 
such matters as dictionaries and grammar, containing incohe- 
rent tales and contradictions, because they lead to the misleading 
of people by the description of or reference to Love affairs, to 
those who are buffoons, or are heretics or make their livelihood 
by displaying some sign ( such as matted hair ) , the Devlpurana 
has not been utilized in this work, because it is not included 
in the enumeration of the number of Puranas and Upapuranas

because it approves of heretic sastras.

The Danasagara on PurSyas 871 

kanda p. 25 ) wherein it is said that the appellation Jaya is 
applied to 18 Puranas, Ramayana, Visnudharmadisastras, Siva- 
dhaxma, Mahabharata, Sauradharmaa and Manavadharmas 
(Manusmrti?). I shall discuss the question of Yisnudharma- 
purana later. But I have serious objections against the antiquity 
and authenticity of this passage. Being quoted in the Kalpataru 
it may be earlier than 1050 A. D. That is all. In order to glorify 
the 18 Puranas the meaning of Jaya is extended. Jaya is 
applied only to the Mahabharata in the latter e. g. Udyogaparva 
136. 18-19 and Svargarohanika 5. 49 and 51 quoted in note 1369 
above. Hence this passage was inserted very late after all 18 
Puranas had been composed i e. after the 9th century A. D. 
Besides the plural 'Visnudharmadisastrani" shows that many 
works are meant and not one, i. e. the meaning is that all sastras 
dealing with Yisnudharmas and the like. If a single work were 
meant, one expects ' Visnudharmadisastiram ca' and that would 
have not spoilt the metre. Besides, the Kalpataru itself indicates 
that this verse about *Jaya' was cited by some authorities as 
' Smrti '. Therefore, it is doubtful if it is a genuine Bhavisya 
passage. Ballalasena mentions only eight Upapuranas on danas 
by name ( including the four mentioned by the Matsya). 

In spite of the very admirable and praiseworthy efforts of 
Dr Hazra in the matter of the place of the Upapuranas, their 
contents, the search among numerous mss to find out what the 
text of the several upapuranas has been, the present writer must 
say here once for all that he does not at all agree with most of 
fee dates that he assign to the Samba, the Visnudharma, the 
Visnudharmottara, the Marasimhapurana, which are the 
principal Upapuranas he has dealt with in the first volume of 
Studies in Upapuranas \ His dates for the four Upapuranas are ;

872 History of Dharmasastra [ See. IV, Gh. XXII 

Samba between 500 and 800 A, D. (p. 91), the Visnudharma- 
purana between 200-300 A. D. (p. 143), the Visnudharmottara- 
purana between 400 to 500 A. D. (p. 212) and the present 
Narasimha-purana between 400 to 500 A. D. To examine all 
his leasona the present writer would have to write another book. 
Therefore, he proposes to give only a few illustrations of the 
way in which Dr. Hazra arrives at his dates. But beforo this is 
done it is better to mention some of his own findings on the 
Puranas and the four Upapuranas mentioned above. On p. 27 
he observes that the text of the extant Mahapuranas which aie 
the results of innumerable changes, modifications and interpola- 
tions made at different times and by different sects is scarcely 
reliable and can be used with great caution and careful 
discrimination. I agree with him. But the same or perhaps worse 
is the case with the Upapuranas. Prof. Hazra himself says 
( ' Studies ' vol I. p. 23 ) that after the group of 18 principal 
Puranas had been compiled many sub systems and sects like the 
Saktas and Sauras came into prominence and their adherents 
interpolated chapters in the 18 established Puranas and wrote 
new and independent works styled Puranas in order to propagate 
their own ideas and that some of these latter came to be called 
Upapuranas. The result is that, unless wo have critical editions of 
the Puranas and the principal Upapuranas on the model of the 
critical edition of the Mahabharata at the BOB! in Poona, all 
chapters and often single verses are suspect. But the task of 
preparing critical editions of even the principal Puranas and 
some of the Upapuranas based upon ancient and medieval mss. 
collected from all parts of India would be far more colossal and 
costly than even the critical edition of the Mahabharata. 
Therefore, most chronological conclusions about the dates of 
Puranas and Upapuranas and about the borrowings of one 
Furana from another are 3ust tentative at the most and likely 
to be set aside by new evidence as long as critical editions of 
Puranas and Upapuranas are not available. 

Let us now turn to the four Upapuranas dealt with at 
length by Prof. Hazra About the Samba ( which is one of the 
four Upapuranas expressly named m the Matsyapurana 53 
60-63) Prof. Hazra observes ('Studies' vol. I p 68) that the 
present Samba-purSna consists of different units mostly belong- 
ing to different countries and ages and after analysing in his 
own way the several chapters of the Samba he arrives at the 
conclusion ( on p. 93 ) that chapters 17, 22 and 23 of the printed 



Late of the Samba Purana 873 

edition were added later than 950 A. D , that chap. 44-45 were 
inserted between 950 and 1050 A D and chap 39-43 and 47-83 
were added between 1350 and 1500 A. D. There is at present 
only one printed ed. of the Samba viz that of the Venk. Press in 
84 chapters based probably only on one ma Out of these 84 
chapters Prof Hazra himself finds that 47 chapters are later than 
950 A D., of which 43 were added between 1250-1500. A.,D. 
Prof. , Hazra has himself examined several mss of the Samba, 
but they do not come from all over India, many .being from 
Bengal and almost all seem to be late ones (p 33 last line), 
being copied in saka 1764 i e 1842 A D When more than half 
of this Purana ranges between 950 to 1500 A D according to 
Prof Hazra, how can it be usefully employed for chronologioal 
purposes? Nobody can say when the verses about the four 
Upapuranas were inserted in the Matsya, but one can affirm that 
it was done about the 9th century A. D or even later. Two dates 
about Upapuranas are certain, viz that Samba is mentioned 
by Alberuni (Sachau.I. p 130) who wrote in 1030 A. D. and 
that the Danasagara (verses 13-15 on p. 3), composed in 1069 AD. 
mentions eight Upapuranas on danas of which four viz. Samba, 
Narashnha, Handi and Aditya are the same as are mentioned in 
the Matsya. Therefore, an Upapurana called Samba must have 
been composed a century or two earlier than 1000 A. D. On 
p. 91 he holds that the Samba cannot be dated later than 800 
A. D. It is difficult to fall in line with all the assumptions 
on pp. 90-91 for arriving at this date. What the Samba named 
by Matsya contained beyond the words * story of Samba ' is not

ed below from Visnudharmottara 1MSfl that the Visnudharmottara 
18 only the latter part of Visnudharma and that, as he holds 
that the former was composed between 400-500 A D , the date 
of the Visnudharma falls between 200 and 300 A D ( p 143 ). 
The other arguments that he advances are practically worthless 
In the present author's opinion those verses can be interpreted 
in two other but different ways, viz. that the first section of the 
•present Visnudharmottara is called Visnudharma or that the 
•Visnudharmottara is so called because it was composed after 
the Visnupurana, which contains the greatness of Visnu and the 
dharmas of Vaisnavas He often trot3 out the theory that, if a 
work is free from Tantric elements, it must be an early work be- 
longing to the 3rd or 4th century A D ("see p. 142), The Sarvada- 
isanasangraha of Madhavacarya (which was composed in the 14th 
century ) make3 no reference to the cult of Sakti or the system of 
Tantra, though it devotes a good deal of space to the views of even 
Carvaka ( a thorough-going atheist), Bauddhas and Jainas. The 
Sarvasiddhantasangraha also does not refer to the Saktas or the 
'Tantfas But no one can argue that Madhava is earlier than 
4th or 5th century A D. There may be various reasons for silence. 
One may abhor a thing and may not refer to it or use it at all 
as the Danasagara says about the Devlpurana. The argument 
from silence is a slippery one I challenge the whole basis of 
Prof. Hazra's date for Visnudharma, viz the date of the Visnu- 
dharmottara. This last is a vast work in three sections It 
would be proved later that portions of the latter Purana dealing

These verses are not clear enough for holding that the present racgjtrHfrrc is 
only the latter part of another work called f^corEpr That verse uses the word

Albernni mentions Visnudharma as a short form of Rcoprsfftrt and nothing 
more. Similarly, in the 2nd passage it is expressly stated that in the first 
section the essence of Vaisnava duties is given along with the following two 
sections The Matsya (53 16 ) speaks of the Visnupurana as one in which

The Vtsniidharmottara 875 

with prognostications from dreams cannot be placed esrlier 
than about 600 to 650 A D. For the Visnudharma we have to 
rely on what Prof. Hazra quotes. Chap. 66 quotes the famous 
word3 of the Glta ' whenever there is decline of dharma &c. ' 
( p. 143 n 94 ) and then the same chap, mentions the incarna- 
tions of Visnu including Buddha ( p. 125 ). Therefore, the 
mention of the ten avataras in the context of the words of, the 
Glta is natural and should not be regarded as spurious 9imply 
because it comes in the way of one's pet theories. On p. 144 he 
quotes ten verses from chapter 66 in which Buddha 13 described 
as son of Suddhodana and his doctrines are stated. Prof. Hazra 
(onpp 145-146) gives four reasons which are quite unconvincing. 
The Puranas mention the avataras of Visnu in several places.' 
The Bhagavata in I. 3 names 22 avataras On p. 150 Prof. Hazra 
himself quotes a long passage about the evils of the Kali age 
from the Visnudharma in which occurs a significant half verse 
' utkocah saugatas-oaiva Mahayanaratas-tatha. '. Here not only 
are the followers of Buddha mentioned but also those who are 
of the Mahayana persuasion. On p. 124 Prof. Hazra states that 
the Visnudharma (p 1-24 n 45) mentions by name 33 authors 
of Dharmasastras, besides the Saptarsis and others. Yaj. (I. 4-5 ) 
mentions only 19 promulgators of Dharmasastra (including 
himself and holding Sankha-likMta as one ). Both the Visnu- 
dharma and the Visnudharmottara are not mentioned by the 
Matsya. Therefore, it must be held that they were not reco- 
gnized as TTpapuranas at the time when the verses about Upa- 
puranas were interpolated in the Matsya and were not so recog- 
nized till at least the 8th or 9th century A D The Visnudharma 
is opposed to what is stated hy all writers from the Grhya and 
Dharmasutras, by Mann ( HL 128-186 ), by Matsya, Kurma and 
otHer Puranas about the qualifications of the brahmanas to be 
invited at a sraddha dinner ( vide H. of Dh. vol IV pp. 384-387 )

Visnudharma was an hotch-potch bringing together passages 
from several sources ( vide note ). uw Prof. Hazra himself holds 
that the original Visnudharma was appropriated and recast by 
Bhagavatas and that many verses quoted from Visnudharma 
by Raghunandana, Govindananda and the MadanapErijftta do 
not ooour in the present work ( pp. 154-155 ). 

Then we come to the Visnudharmottara. The only printed 
edition is that of the Venk Press. It is a vast work divided into 
three sections. The firBt deals with geography, solar and lunar 
dynasties, astronomy and astrology, gotra and pravara, sraddhas, 
Manvantaras, Bharata's fight with Gandharvas and Satrughua'a 
with Lavana. The 2nd section deals with various aspects of Raja- 
dharmaandthe third seotion of the Purana deals with Citrasutra- 
vidhana and contains several topics such as painting, dancing, 
music, song, rasas, riddles, dramaturgy, metrics, figures of speech, 
construction of images, building of temples, symptoms of 
approaching death, gifts of various kinds, law and justice, hermits 
and sannyasins. On p. 212 Dr. Hazra places this Purana bet- 
ween 400-500 A. D. Reasons of limitations of space preclude 
any detailed criticism of Prof Hazra's treatment. In III. 351.54 
Buddha is mentioned as an avatara which Prof Hazra says is 
' most probably spurious' (p. 212) and advances no reasons for this 
summary judgment. He puts in his usual argument of its non- 
Tantric lm character and frequent use of the word pradurbhava 

' 1410. 3tn<|jj on pp 368-370 quotes about 20 verses from fltroj^i

1411 I fail to understand what Prof. Hazra definitely means by non- 
Tantrik character He admits ( on p 218 ) that bijas and kavaaas are 
found in Visnudharmottara of which section I chap. 226 names over 100

some of which quoted as specimens are : ' aff 335ft iit*idlc*i f3«n^" 
( Continued on next page) 



The Visnudharmottara &77 

and not 'avatara* which latter, heaay3, occurs in two places only. 
Prof. Hazra often attaches undue importance to insignificant 
details Whether the word ' pradurhhava ' is used or ' avatara '• is 
used matters little. The same Purana uses both words promisc- 
uously e. g. Narasimha ( 36. 1, ' avataranaham vaksye ') begins 
with the word ' avatara ' and in 39. 1 employs the word ' pradur- 
hhava' ( atah param Hareh puny am pradurbhavam ) and in the 
colophons of all chapters from 36 to 53 the word ' pradurhhava ' 
is used. The Matsya 247 1 starts with ' pradurbhavan pura- 
nesu Visnoramitatejasah '. In 247. 19-21 the Matsya employs 
the word ' avatlrnah ' with regard to Vamana and Nrsimha and 

in 246.4 ' avatirno jagadyonih Varaaneneha rupena &c. '. 

Padma V. 13. 182 speaks of twelve avataras ; Visnu V. 16 also 
uses the word. ' avatara '. On p. 199 he gives a table of passages 
that are common to Manu, Yaj , Narada and Visnudharmottara, 
on p. 200 another table of passages common to Bharata's Natya- 
sastra and Visnudharmottara, and on page 202 a table of 
passages common to Matsya and Visnudharmottara and holds 
that the Matsya borrows. This is a most astounding proposition. 
The Matsya does not even mention the Visnudharmottara as an 
Upapurana; the only sure and earliest date is that the latter is 
mentioned by Albeiuni. That does not carry the matter beyond 
900-1000 A. D. The Matsyapurana might have been tampered 
with. The reasons assigned for his opinion by Prof. Hazra are, 
to say the least, flimsy and unconvincing. It is further to be noted 
that there are twelve verses that state that some phenomena 
are not to be held to be utpatas, that are common to Matsya 229. 
/ « 25, Visnadharmott aia ( II. 134. 15-26 ) and the Brhatsamhita 
(45. 83-94), which are quoted by the Adbhutasagara pp. 743-744 
as occurring in all these three and in Barhaspatya. I have dealt 
with this matter above on p. 768 n 1240. Varaha states that these

verses axe the summaries ( rsiputrakrtaih slokair-vidyad-etat 
samasoktaih ) of the slokas of Rsiputra Therefore, the view that 
they are borrowed by Varaha from the Matsya or Visnudharmo- 
ttara would ba out of question The two Puranas do not say 
whence they have taken them Therefore, it would not be 
unjustifiable to hold that in both Puranas the verses of the 
Brhat-samhita were inserted. There is another circumstance 
that strengthens this last view. The Adbhutasagara on 
pp. 493-494 quotes seven verses from the Brhad-yatra of Varaha 
alone. These verses are quoted by Utpala on Br. S 47. 22 
(where Varaha says ' sadasat - svapnanimittam yatrayam 
svapnavidhir-uktah ) from ' Yatra * These verses ( 8 in all) are 
Varaba's own (as he says) and not taken from any other source. 
Three of these verses on dreams occur in the Visnudharmottara 
( II 176 9-11 ). They are quoted above on p 776 note 1254. 
Prof. Hazra does not appear to have carefully gone into the 
several works of Varahamihira and is not right when he says 
( on pp. 201 and 211 ) that ' the Visnudharmottara does not refer 
to or utilize the works of Varahamihira'. The Visnu- 
dharmottara is an encyclopaedia, while Varahamihira was a 
great astronomer and astrologer He would turn to his 
predecessors in his own subject if he wanted to borrow and he 
expressly mentions numerous predecessors (vide pp 591-594 
above) and not to an Upapurana (which in my view did not 
exist or at least was not recognised as an authority when Varaha 
wrote in the first half of the 6th century AD.) Besides, the 
presumption to be drawn from the nature of the Upapurana is in 
favour of holding that it borrows. 

Prof Hazra deals with the XTarasimha-purana on pp 219-266 
of his 'Studies' vol I The only printed edition is that published 
in 1911 by Gopal Narayan and Co. (Bombay) in 68 chapters based 
on three mss about which no information is given. This Purana 
appears to have been composed solely for the glorification of Mara- 
simha identified with Narayaria. Prof Hazra has used several mss., 
two, the oldest, being dated m saka 1567 ( i e 1645 A. D ), some 
of the others are not dated and a few are dated so late as 1798 
A. D. and 1810 A D ; and some are written in Bengali script 
On p 322 Prof. Hazra says about one ms. in Eggeling's cat of 
India Office mss that it was copied about lpOO-1600 A D and its 
last five folios were supplied m 1789 A D. No reasons are given 
why this ms. should be regarded as being copied between 1500- 
^ 1600. This is probably a guess, so all the msB consulted are not 
'earlier than the 17th and following centuries Moat mss. do not 



The Vi&nudharmattaia 879 

agree with the printed edition, in the number of chapters and 
also lack certain chapters of the printed edition. Prof. Hazra holds 
(p. 243) on -various grounds, all of which cannot be examined 
here, that the ' present Narasimbapurana is to be placed between 
400-500 A D. ' One or two of his characteristic arguments will 
be noticed here In chap 36. 9 ( kalau prapte yatha Buddho 
bhaven-Farayanah prabhuh ) Buddha is mentioned ; Markan- 
deya promises in chap 36 to narrate stories about eleven avataras 
(among whom Balarama, Kisna and Buddha are included) 
and in chapters 37-54, the stories of all avataras except Buddha 
aTe given and it is added l412 in chap. 54 that ' I have spoken 
of the ten incarnations of Visnu. The devotee of Nrsimha who 
always listens to these attains Visnu'. It may be noted that 
Balabhadra is mentioned in a half verse (36. 8) which is found 
only in ms. 'ga' of the three mss. of the printed edition. In 
ohap. 53 a few exploits of Balarama and Krsna are narrated in 
.the same chapter and so the half line was inserted later. A3 the 
story of Buddha is not given Prof Hazra holds that the verse in 
.36 9 is undoubtedly spurious (pp 230 and 249). It never occurred 
to Prof Hazra that the sectarian zeal of a bigoted Vaisnava 
might have never cared to give the life of Buddha who was not 
concerned with ( but was antagonistic to ) the varna system and 
the Vedas or might have omitted the story of the life of Buddha 
even if it occurred in the ms from which he copied The present 
author thinks that 36.9 is a genuine verse and enumerates 
Buddha as an avatara following the universal belief held in 
•lnd la at least from the 9th or 10th century A.D. that Buddha 
was an avatara, but probably bigotry led to the omission of the 
details of Buddha's Me. Besides, the verse is capable of another 
mterpretation. It is only the stories of ten avataras ( excluding 
Buddha) that lead a devotee to Visnu. A devotee may worship any 
one of Nrsrrnha, Eama or Krsna, and Teach Visnu, but hardly any 
orthodox work has ever stated that worship of Buddha alone (an 
avatara) will lead to attainment of Visnu. Therefore, it is 
proper to hold that the story of Buddha's life might not have been 
given at all or was purposely omitted. On. p. 239 Prof. Hazra puts 
lorwardapeouliar argument. Accordingto theNarasimha-parana 
™ap.53 31, says Prof. Hazra, Krsna embodies only a part of 
Visnu s sakti m» and therefore 'the IJTarasimha is to be dated

earlier than the present Bhagavata in which Krsna is called 
bhagavan himself (Bhagavata I. 3 28). As the present Bhaga- 
vata is to he dated in the 6th century A. D the Naraaimha is 
to be placed not later than £.00 A D.' Great controversies have 
raged over the date of the Bhagavata. The present author 
holds that the Bhagavata-purana does not belong to the 6th 
century A. D. It will be shown below that while Ramanuja 
quotes more than a hundred verses from tho Visnupurana, which 
he regarded as one of supreme authority over other Puranas 
(in Vedarthasangraha pp. 111-142 of D G. edition) ho does not 
quote the Bhagavata at all in his bhasya on tho VedantasUtra. 
A bigoted devotee of Narasimha may say that Narasimha 
avatara is the perfect avatara of Visnu, while Kcsna is only a 
partial one. But surely that cannot determine tho dates of the 
respective puranas. What bigoted devotees are capable of 
saying may be seen from Brahmanda III 36. 18-20 quoted 
later in this section, where it is asserted that the reward of 
repeating thrice the thousand names of Visnu is yielded by 
repeating one name of Krsna once. Tho strongest argument 
against the authenticity and early date of the present Nara- 
simhapurana has not been properly and adequately emphasized 
or appreciated by Prof. Hazra The Matsya ( 53. 60-63 ) gives 
meagre details about the four Upapuranas expressly named by 
it, but about the Narasimha it makes one definite statement 
*vlhat it contained 18000 verses (53 60) The present Narasimha 
contains only about 3400 verses im Therefore, the old Nara- 
simhapurana exists no more and in its place a new one has 
been substituted, probably containing some of the topics and 
chapters contained in the old one. We do not know the extent 
of the Narasimha mentioned by Alberuni For ought we know 
he might have referred to the old extensive purana or the new 
stripling substituted in its place. Even some of the mss copied 
in comparatively recent times drop several chapters of the 
printed purana; on p. 249 Prof Hazra holds that chapters 
34 verses 43-55, and chapters 61, 65 (on 68 holy places 
for Vaisnavas), 66,67 are genuine parts, though dropped m 

1414 Even a late writer like ^HrHtRrsi^PpJ. patronized by the Gajapati

purana, those that say that by the word Bhagavata the Kalika is meant are 
wrong and then enumerates the 18 y4U<iu|s 



The Nardstmhapuraya 881 

some msa. Frof. Hazra's judgments on various matters are 
most liable to be challenged; tut considerations of space 
prevent any detailed treatment. On p. 252 he holds that 
in chap. 6 the story of the birth of Vasistha and Agastya 
aB the son3 of Mitra and Varuna, the story of Yam a 
and YamI are comparatively late additions. The story of 
the birth of Vasistha from Urvasi and Mitra and Varuna is 
alluded to even in the Bgveda ( VII 33. 11 ) ' and in the 
previous verse ( 10 ) of the same hymn Vasistha, Agastya and 
Mitravarunau are brought together. The story of Yama and 
YamI occurs in Eg. X. 10. The Narasimha itself states ( in 
chap. 14 1 ) that the story of Yama and YamI is Vaidikl. The 
Purana may have added some fringes and embellishments, but 
the main theme is the same in both. On p. 254-255 and note 
330 Prof. Hazra was constrained to admit that the Narasimha- 
purana had been revised more than once, remarks that HemSdri 
bad a more extensive purana before him than the printed one 
and that a comparison of the verses quoted from the Narasimha- 
puranaby the Madanaparijata pp. 301-302, Smrtitattva on 
Shnika ( vol. I. p. 411 ) and Nityacarapradlpa (vol. I p. 617) show 
that the text of the Narasimha used by Eaghunandana and 
Narasimha-vajapeyin agrees more with the printed text than 
the text used by Madanapala ( about 1375 A. D. ), less than 200 
years before Eaghunandana. 

The extant Naiasimhapurana is an insignificant one as 
compared with the principal Puranas like Vayu, Matsya, Visnu • 
the Samba is not quoted at all by Apararka, the Visnudharma 
only twice and even the Visnudharmottara is quoted by 
Apararka only 7 times for about 25 verses in all The very ex- 
tensive digest Kalpataru ( first half of 12th century A D )

882 History of Dharmaiastra [Sec. IV, Ch. XXII 

31. 87 ( in a prose passage ) and 34 ( 19 and 23 ) of the printed 
Narasimhapurana. As usual Prof Hazra holds these references 
are due to later revisions and should not be held to suggest a 
late date for the extant Narasimhapurana ( p. 255 ). Tulasi- 
ma.h3.tmya is very much in evidence in the Fadma e. g. in IV. 
94. 4-10, V 58 109ff and V. 59, VI 24 2-43. The very late part 
of Padma VI ( ohap 98-107 ) contains the story of Jalandhara, 
whose wife Vrnda is said to have become TulasI Frof . Hazra 
fails to realize the full force of his own admission that the 
Narasimha was revised several times and that writers of the 
16th century had a version before them different from that before 
the writers of the 13th or 14th century In the author's opinion 
the whole Furana becomes suspect and that by mere diplomatic 
criticism one would not be able to support beyond doubt any 
chronological conclusion derived from the present truncated 
and garbled version of the original Narasimha. 

So much space had to be devoted to an examination of Prof. 
Hazra's work on the Upapuranas for cogent reasons. His is 
the latest and most elaborate treatment of Puranas and parti- 
cularly of Upapuranas, on which he has bestowed immense 
labour. His opinions, particularly about the dates of the 
Upapuranas, are likely to be taken as the last word on the 
subject and even his unfounded surmises are likely to be taken 
as well-established conclusions. Modern Sanskrit scholars have 
sad experience about such matters. Max Muller, working back 
from the date of Buddha and assigning arbitrarily two hundred 
years each for three periods viz. the Upanisad period, the 
Brahmana period and the Samhita period, inferred that the 
composition of the Vedas was to be assigned to a period about 
1200 B C. He no doubt said that his periods were the 
minimum and that his was a- pure surmise. Yet most writers 
who have not themselves made a deep study of the Veda assign 
the Vedas to about 1200 to 1400 B G. even after the lapse of 
about one hundred years from the time when Max Muller 
launched his surmises. For example, Prof. Toynbee in the table 
of the time spans of the growth phases of civilizations on p. 758 
of volume IX (1954) gives the dates of Epiphany and of 
breakdown of the Indie civilization as 1375 B. G. and 725 B. O. 
respectively. The present author does not at all agree with the 
dates assigned to the Upapuranas by Prof Hazra and with the 
methods and reasoning adopted for arriving at those dates. He 
had to perform this painful duty even in spite of his regard 
for Prof. Hazra. 



Works and papers on Puranas 883 

There are numerous works, translations and papers on 
Furanas. A few alone are mentioned here. Eugene Burnouf 
translated the Bhagavata Parana in French m five volumes in 
1840 and later years. The translates of Visnu and 
Markandeya were made respectively by H. H. Wilson and 
Pargiter; Prof. Kirfel's Introduction to ' Parana pancalaksana 
(1927, Bonn) was translated in the Journal of the Shri VenkateSa

Bamayana and Puranas; 1414 " the Penukonda plates of the early 
Ganga king Madhava H, ( E. I. vol. 14 p 338 ) speaks of him as 
knowing ' the essence of many sastras, Itihasa and Puranas ' 
(probably in 6th century A. D. ); Puranas ara mentioned as 
studied in 578 A. D. ( in E. I. vol. 28 p 59 ) 

In the following notes on individual Puranas and Upapurauas 
the author adds a few notes based on his own study of the Puranas 
and ( printed) digests ( nibandhas ) of an early age He desires 
to emphasize that the earliest works that can be called digests 
and are available in print cannot be placed earlier than about 
1100 A. D. Though there is difference of views among scholars 
about the exact dates of composition, the Mitaksara, the Ertya- 
kalpataru (which is a regular Digest of various kinds of 
materials on Dharmasastra) and Apararka's work (though in

and composed between about 1100 to 1140 A. D. T ho Krtya-

Dh. S. I. 17. 26 ) by the Smrtimafijarl ( of Govindaraja ) 

and also on sraddha ( pp. 4G and 259 ). It has boon shown 

in H. of Dh. vol. I that Prakasa ( pp. 306-308 ), Parijita 

(pp. 308-309), Smrtimaiijarl (pp. 312-314 ) woro works 

of the digest genre. Tho Kamadhenu of Gopala also appoars to 

have been a digest (H ofDh. vol. I. pp. 293 ffj. Tho author 

Gopala was a friond of Laksmldbara ( vido Introd. to Danaka- 

nda p. 49 ), but, since the latter employs tho past tense (athre) 

with reference to Gopala's work and tho presont tonso ( lanyale 

kalpavrksuh) as regards his own work it follows that the 

Kamadhenu was composed at least a few years boforo tho Kalpa- 

taru. As no mas. of the Prakasa, Parijlta and Kamadhonu are 

available it is impossible to say anything about thoir oxhaus- 

tiveness or otherwise But from tho summary at tho ond of tho 

ms. on the Prayasoitta seotion of tho Smrtimafijarl ( H of Dh. 

vol I. p. 312 note 71 i) it appears that it must havo boon fairly 

large and was composed on tho same lines as the later Kitya- 

kalpataru, since it began with Panbhasakanda and Brahmacari- 

section, then dealt with Grhasthadharmas, Dana, Suddhi and 

Asauca, Sraddha, then with Vanaprastha and Fravrajya 

(corresponding to the moksakanda of Kalpataru) and onded 

with Prayascittas. These predecessors of the Kalpataru wero 

superseded by the extensive work of Laksmldbara, who himself 

receded into the background when the works of Hemadri, 

Candesvara, Madanaratna, tho Vlramitrodaya, the Mayukhos 

of Nllakantha became popular. Even before the Kamadhenu 

and probably the Smrtimafijarl also, Bhoja ( about 2nd quarter 

of 11th century A. D ) composed ( or patronised tho composition 

of) several works such as the Bhujabala and Rajamartanda 

which exhaustively dealt with the astrological requirements of 

samskaras from pumsavana to marriage and also of vratas, 

yatra, santis, pratistha (vide the author's paper on 'King Bhoja 

and his works on Dharmasastra and astrology ' in JOB, (Madras), 

vol. XX7TI for 1953-54 pp 94-127 for five works of Bhoja). 

So there was nothing very novel m the Krtyakalpataru except 

its exhaustive and logical treatment of all topics and profuse 

quotations from the Epics and Puranas. The Mitaksara does 



Works and papers on Puravas 885 

not quote much from the Furana3, but Apararka and Kalpataru 
luote them profusely. The Kalpataru quotes about 600 verse3 
from Devlpurana, over 200 verse3 each from. Kalika, Aditya- 
ourana, iTandipurana and !Narasiriihapurana ( all Upapuranas ) 
while it quotes none at all from Visnudharmottara. The 
Kalpataru did not prohably regard it as authoritative, 
though Apararka and the Danasagara utilized it to some extent. 
The learned editor of the extensive Kalpataru, Prof. Aiyangar, 
has made great efforts to identify the quotations therein from the 
Puranas, and laid all workers and scholars under great obliga- 
tions. But many quotations have eluded him as will be shown 
later on. He has been assiduous in pointing out how Hemadri, 
Candesvara and Mitramisra have copied wholesale from the 
Kalpataru. It is not impossible that even the Kalpataru might 
have done the same to some extent as regards its predecessors 
such as the Parijata, Prakasa, Smrtimanjarl, and Kamadhenu. 
But as those works are not yet available, no positive conclusion 
can be drawn about its borrowing for the present 

The present author edited 286 verses from the Eajamartanda 
(containing 1462 verses) on tithis, vratas and utsavas in 
ABOEItoL36, parts m-IV, 1956, pp. 306-339 J. It describes 
several vratas and utsavas like Indradhvajotthapana and the 
work is about 75 years older than the Kalpataru. The Kalpataru 
is studiously silent as regards Bhoja, though it mentions Kama- 
dhenu, Govindaraja, Prakasa and Halayudha and it hardly any- 
where mentions the vratas described by the Eajamartanda. 
JLne Mitaksara does mention Dharesvara Bhoja. Probably 
Laksmldhara did not like that a comparison should be instituted 
between his treatment of vratas and Bhoja's. 

Alberuni's work on India translated by Sachau furnishes 
us witnsome data about the chronology of Puranas. Onp 130 fof

that Puranas having the names oitod by him oxistod somo time

pal Puranas and on somo of tho Upapuranas are brought together

CHAPTER XXIII 

Brief Notes on individual Puranas and Upapuranas 

Agnipurava — ' Present Agni ' ( by H. ) in I. H. Q. vol XII 
pp. 683-691: 'Studies in genuine Agneya alias Vahnipurana' 
by H. in « Our Heritage * voL I part 2 pp. 209-245 and vol. II 
part 1 pp. 76-109 ; ' Discovery of genuine Agneyapurana ' by H. 
in J O.L (Baroda)vol V (1956) pp. 411-416 (shows that 
present Agni published by Anan. Press is not the original 
Purana, that this was compiled late, while the original Agneya or 
Vabni is not yet printed ) ; the Danasagara p 7. verse 63 speaks 
of an Agneya which it has discarded apart from one which it 
has utilized ( p. 2 verse 11 ). As usual with most Puranas, the 
printed Agneya glorifies itself by saying ( in chap. 272. 13 and 
17 ) that in that Mahapurana Hari resides in the form of diffe- 
rent lores and the Agneya is a great purana full of Veda and 
all vidyas. 

Adipurava ( U. )— B. V. vol VI ( 1945 ) pp. 60-73 ( H. postu- 
lates an earlier and a later version ). Vayu 104.7 mentions an 
Adika among the 18 principal puranas ( including the Brahma ). 
Alberuni's list_( which mixes up Puranas and Upapuranas) 
mentions an Adipurana; an Adipurana is published by' the 
Venk. Press in 29 chapters. H. in « Studies &c. ' vol I. pp. 
2<9-303 deals at length with this and tries to establish that there 
was an earlier Adi Purana of which no mss. are yet available 
(P. 211) and holds that it is to be dated between 1203 to 1525 AJ>. 
( Studies • p. 288 ). Adi and Adya mean the same thing. But 
Kulluka on Manu H. 54 quotes some verses from Adi which are 
ascribed to Brahma by G. B. p. 314. The digests make a con- 
fusion between Adi and Adityapurana. Vide H. in 'Studies* vol 
i. pp. ,$02-303. The printed one is a late compilation and none 
of the verses quoted by Laksmldhara and Apararka occur therein 
( vide Studies vol I pp. 286-289 ).

226, 377 (15 verses on marriage and house settlements for 
brahmanas), 924; the Sm. O II, p. 442 quotes one verse from it

but was altered to make it a Pasupata one. In several passages 
the Kurma speaks of God as one (IE. 11. 112-115), but divided 
into two, Naray ana and Brahma ( in I 9. 40 ) or as Visnu and 
Siva (in I 2. 95) or in three (as in 1. 10. 77). The Sm. O. I. p. 199 
quotes verses from I 2 94, 95, 97-99 whioh allow a parson to 
worship either "Visnu with the mantra ( Rg I. 22, 20 or X. 90 ) 
or Siva with Rudragayatrl, Rudras ( Tai. S. IV. 5. 1-11 ) or 
'Tryambakam' (Rg VII 59 12, Tai S. I 8. 6. 2.) or with 'Om 
namabSivaya'. The Sm C quotes from Kurma about 94 verses 
on ahnika and 19 on sraddha In I 1. 21-22 it states that there 
were four samhitas of the Purana viz Brahmi, BhagavatI, Saurl 
and Vaisnavl and that the present one is the Brahmi in 6000 
verses, the Naradiya (1.106 1-22) furnishes a summary of 
the other three samhitas. Padma f Patalakhanda 102. 41-42 ) llu ° 
expressly names the Kurma and quotes a veTse from it. 
Kalpataru (on sraddha p. 119) quotes two verses from it!

Kalpataru on dana quotes over 200 verses from it on dana ( of 
which 140 are on Vidyadana pp. 207-222, 12 verses on .Srogya- 
dana, which provide for the establishment of an hospital with 
a physician knowing the eight angas of ayurveda and provided 
with drugs &c), Apararka (pp. 396-403) quotes about 100 verses 
on vidyadana agreeing with those in Kalpataru and also quotes 
(pp 365-366) the same verses on Arogyadana; Kalpataru on 
Niyatakala quotes 13 verses from thi3 purana advocating total 
abstention from flesh-eating (p. 323) and abstaining from flesh 
at least on the 4th, 8th, 12th 14th and 15th tithis, on Sadaslti and 
sun's passage from one rasi to another &c. (pp. 353-360). As this 
is one of the four upapuranas expressly named by the Matsya, as 
Alberuni mentions a Handa-purana which ( appears to be the 
same asNandi) and as it is largely quoted by Laksmldhara, 
Apararka and Danasagara it is one of the earliest TJpapuranaB

tekadasl. The above ciroumstances lead to the conclusion that 
the present Naradiya was compiled between 700 and 1000 A. D. 

Padtnapuiaiia-- H. in I G. vol. IV. pp 73-95, Mr. M. V. 
Vaidya in Kane presentation vol. pp. 530-537 ( holds that the 
tlrthayatra section of Padma is older than the tlrthayatra section 
in the Mahabharata), Dr. Belvalkar in ¥. W. Thomas Festschrift 
(pp. 19-28) holds that Padma is baaed on the Mahabharata; 
Prof. Ludars tried to prove that the Rsyasrnga legend in Padma 
is older than the same legend in the Mahabharata ( vide LHQ, 
vol. XX. p. 209 for Luder's view); H. in PRHR. (pp. 107- 
129 ) states that there are two recensions of the Padma the 
North Indian and the South Indian, that the former is in five 
kandas and the latter in six, that the South Indian recension 
alone is published in the Anandasrama and Venk. Press editions, 
though the arrangement differs in the two editions. H. in PRHR 
( p. 126 ) states that the UttaTa-kanda ( of the Padma ) is later 
than 900 A. D. and earlier than 1500 A. D. One remarkable fact 
is that hundreds of verses are common to Matsya and Padma and 
some writers like Hemadri quote long extracts from the Padma, 
which others quote from the Matsya. In view of the vast smrti 
material in the Matsya and the fact that thousands of verses 
therefrom are quoted in the medieval nibandhas the present 
writer is inclined to hold that it is the Padma that is the 
borrower. There are no materials to assign a definite date for 
the borrowing, but it is likely that it was before 1000 A D 
Padma ( IV. 102. 40-41 and rv. 110. 483 ) mentions the Kurma 
( and a verse is quoted from it ) and IV. 5. 32-43 contain suoh 
alankaras as Slesa and Parisankhya The Kalpatara quotes 
from Padma about 55 verses on vrata, 50 on niyatakala, 50 on 
dana, 12 on tirtha, only a verse here and there on other kandas 
Apararka quotes only about 12 verses from it, the Smrticandriks 
only about 25. In the Anandasrama edition of Padma there are 

BodhjsattvaCSrshkhandaSS. 16) and mentions a place called 
Vanasthala in Gurjaradesa ( II. 51. 36-37 ).

was composed between 10th century and 12th century A. D. 
H. Otto Sohrader states that chapters 236-244 of the present 
Brahma dealing with SSnkhya and Yoga are borrowed from the 
Mahabharata (I C vol. II pp 592-93). The Danasagara refers to 
two Brahmapuranas one of which it did not utilize (p 7 verse 63) 
The Kalpataru quotes at least about 1500 verses from the 
Brahmapurana ( 600 in ruyalakala section, 66 on tirtha, 60 on 
moksa, 78 on rajadharma, 21 on grhastha, 20 on vyavahara, verses 
15 on vrata, 15 on brahmacarm of which the editor has traced only 
9 in the printed text) The Kalpataru on sraddha quotes several 
hundred verses from the Brahma, the number of quotations 
being laTger than the quotations from any other Purana, the 
next being Vayu and Matsya On p 388 of the sraddha section 
the Kalpataru quotes from Brahma-purana a few verses about 
showing honour to Buddha and Bauddha monks on a certain 
tithi The printed Brahma contains 245 chapters and 13783 
verses Chapters 70-175 deal with various tlrthas in 4640 verses, 
chapters 28 to 69 dilate upon several tirthas such as Konaditya, 
Ekamra, Avanti, Purusottama-tlrtha. The whole purana or at 
least a section seems to come to an end with chapter 175 and 
from chapter 176 it is Vasudevamahatmya that is set forth up 
to chap 213 and the narrator is Vyasa and not Brahma as in 
the chapters up to 175 Many of the verses from chapters 42 
onwards are quoted by the Tlrthacintamani ( e. g. chap. 43. 1-13 
in T. C. p 58-59, chap 45. 52-89 in T. O. pp. 61-64, chap 49 in 
T. O pp 65-72) As Vacaspati flourished in the latter half of 
the 15th century A. D. (vide H of Dh. vol. I. p 405), the first 
part of the present Brahmapurana cannot be placed later than 
the 13th century A. D The present Brahma has several verses 
in common with Brahmanda and Vayu (vide H. of Dh. vol IV. 
p 388 n 870 ) It is not unlikely that the other Brahmapurana 
which Ballalasena discarded is the present Brahmapurana and 
that both Kalpataru and Ballalasena had an older work of the 
same name before them The present Brahma was probably 
compiled in some part through which the Godavarl ( GautamI ) 
flows in Dandakaranya; chap 88 18 123 117 and 129. 55 state 
that Dandakaranya is the holiest country and that the river 
Godavarl flows through it (ohap 129 62,66); chap 88 32-24 
derive Janasthana on the GautamI as the sacrificial ground of 
the kings of the Janaka race

Ganapati and Krsnajanma. It has some chapters on Dharma- 
sastra topics, such as on castes, gifts, vratas, hells, duties of 
vamas and asramas, women. Many of the verses quoted from 
this Purana in the Sin. C. , Hemadri and other writers are not 
found in the current Purana Wilson, in the Introduction to the 
Visnu says (pp. LXV-LXVH) that it has not the slightest title 
to be called a Purana. Vide H. in ABORI vol. XIX pp 75-76 
and PEHE pp. 166-167. 

Biahmanda ( pub. by Venk. Press ). It is divided into four 
padas ( I. 1. 3S-39 ) viz. Prakriya. ( 5 chapters ), Anusanga 
(33 chap.), Upodghata (74 chap.), TJpasamhara (4 chap) 
followed by Lalitopakhyana in 40 chapters. The Eurma 
expressly 1420 states that the Brahmanda was narrated to the 
sages engaged in a sattra in the Naimisa forest and the Skanda 
( Prabhasa-khanda 2. 8-9 ) states there was formerly only one 
Purana called Brahmanda containing one hundred crores of 
verses and that later it was distributed into 18 parts. It was 
probably composed near the rise of the Godavari, since it says 
that that part of the country towards the northern ranges of the 
Sahya mountain where the Godavari rises is the most charming in 
the whole world and that there a city called Govardhana was foun- 
ded by Kama. 1421 In the first two parts it deals with the subjects 
of creation, the geography of the earth and of Bharatavarsa, and 
the manvantaras, pupils of Vyasa, the distribution of the Veda 
Sakhas &c. The third section is the longest and after mentioning 
Vaiv<jsvata Manvantara and, after dilating upon the creation of 
gods, asuras, gandharvas, sages and their progeny, it deals at 
length with all aspects of sraddha ( in chap. 9-20 and 879 verses ), 
desoribes Parasurama's austerities, his securing of weapons, his 
slaughter of Kartavlrya and ksatriyas, filling five lakes with their 
blood (in chap. 21-47 and over 1550 verses); then follow in 
chapters 48-57 the story of Sagara and the bringing down of the 
Ganges by Bhaglratha, the protection of Gokarna from the sea, 
and the story of Surparaka (chap. 57 and 58), the dynasties of the 
solar and lunar race ( chap. 59ff ) ; then it speaks of Dhanvantari 
receiving from Bharadvaja Ayurveda in eight angas; in part JV. 
it refers to Manus, jfiana, karma, moksa &c.

The Brahmanda is one of the oldest of the 18 Puranas and haa 
hundreds of versea in common with the Vayu. Vide above p. 852. 
The Mit on Yaj quotes a verse from the Brahmanda 1122 stating 
that a person, on touching Saivas, Pasupatas, Lokayatikas and 
atheists, persons of the three varnas following forbidden paths 
and sudras, should bathe with the clothes on. Apararka quotes 
about 75 verses from it of which 43 are concerned with sraddha. 
The Sm. quotes about 50 verses on Ahnika and Sraddha, of 
which ten occur also in Apararka The Kalpataru does not quote 
a single verse from it m the sections on vrata, grhastha, tirtha, 
rajadharma, but quotes 16 verses from it on sraddha, and 16 on 
moksa, none from Niyata and from Vyavahara If we may judge 
from some of the matters noted here it cannot be placed as early 
as the Matsya. In III 48 8 and 20 it employs long com- 
pounds, 1423 mentions Bhlma3ena and Narada 1431 as writers on 
music (III 61. 42-43 ), contains a chapter ( HI, 62 ) on Gandharva, 
refers to the opinions of former acaryas, to 30 alankaras of natya 
and four purposes of such alankaras ( chap. 62, verse 22 ). It 
may be placed between the 4th and 6th century A D. 2?or 
discussion on Brahmanda, vide Pargiter in AIHT pp. 23, 77 and 
H. in PRHR (pp 17-19). The Brahmanda is very fond of 
etymologies, vide for example, those of vaisya and sudra 
(II 7 157-158), of deva, manusya-praja, raksas and yaksa 
(II. 8 9-10, 20, 34), of Tryambaka and Budra (II. 9 3-4 and 78), 
of ra;jan(inll 29 64 ), of Vasudha, MedinI and PrtbivI(II 37.

Kubera(HL8 44-45).

Nityananda, Raidas, Madhvacarya, Bhatfcoji &o The Bhavisyo- 
ttara is discarded by Ballalasena as unauthoritative, though it 
was popular in his day (vide, p 869 above). Apararka quotes 
160 verses from Bhavisyottara on danas of various kinds The 
Sm. 0. (I p. 203 ) quotes a single varse from the same. Hence 
the Bhavisyottara cannot be later than 1000 A D The Kalpataru 
quotes hundreds of verses from Bhavisya on vratas and many 
verses in other kandas, e. g. 55 in brahmacari, 110 on niyata- 
kala, 101 on grhastha, 100 on rajadharma, 15 on sraddha. The 
Mit. quotes 1425 a single verse from Bhavisya about donating a 
golden image of a snake when a man is bitten by a snake. 
Apararka quotes about 125 verses from Bhavisya, of which about 
90 relate to prayaseittas. 

One remarkable feature of the extracts from Bhavisya in 

Apararka is that they quote the views of Angiras, Gautama, Para- 

saTa, Manu, Vasistha and Sankha. There are several passages 

quoted by Apararka from the Bhavisya which approximately 

indicate the age of the current Bhavisya. 1426 It also refers to 

eight Vyakaranas in I. 1. 59-61 viz. Brahma, Aindra, Yamya, 

Raudra, Vayavya, Varuna, Savitra and Vaisnava. But these 

are different from the well-known eight grammars (except 

Aindra ). It mentions the foreign words Ara ( Mars ) and Kona 

(Saturn) 1427 and states these planets are to be worshipped along 

with Siva, ParvatI, Ganesa, the San &c. In prescribing a praya- 

scitta for killing a person who is merely a brahmana by caste the 

Bhavisya prescribes ( as one of the alternatives ) the prayascitta 

prescribed by Parasara. 1428 Therefore, the extant Bhavisya

cannot be placed earlier than about the 6th or 7th century A. D. 
Vide H. in I O. vol. III. pp 233-229 and PRHR pp. 167-173 for 
Bhavisya and JOI (Baroda) vol III. pp 8-27 for Bhavisyottara. 
The Bhavisya mentioned m Vayu ( 99. 267 tan sarvan klrta- 
yisyami- Bhavisye pathitan nrpan | tebhyah pare oa ye oanye 
utpatsyante mahlksitah u ) is not the present one but the ancient 
Bhavisyat mentioned by 3p Dh. S. ( vide p. 817 and n 1328 above ). 
The Varahapurana expressly mentions Bhavisyat purSna twice 
(177. 34 and 51) 14Z9 The second reference is quite interesting. 
It appears to say 1429 " that the Purana well-known as Bhavisya 
was revised by Samba who then established an image of the Sun. 

Bhagavatapurana. None of the early works such as the 
Mit., Apararka, Kalpataru, the Srmticandrika draw upon this- 
The Danasagara knew it, but, as the Bhagavata did not contain 
a disquisition on danas, the author passed it over. Its date is very 
controversial, ranging from the 5th century A.D. to the 10th. Dr. 
Pusalkar (in 'Studies in Epics and Puranas* 1953, pp. 214-216) 
brings together most of the papers on this subject ; Shri S. S. Sastri 
in ABOPJ vol 14 pp. 241-249 on * the two Bhagavatas ' claims 
that the Devlbhagavatapurana is earlier than the Bhagavata, 
while H in JOB ( Madras) vol. 21 (pp. 48-79 ) takes the opposite 
view, viz. that the Devibhagavata is much younger than the 
Bh5gavata. In ' Date of the Bhagavata-purana ' by B. M". Krishna- 
murtl Sharma in ABORI. vol 14 pp 182-218 it is argued that the 
Bhagavata is as old as the 5 th century A. D. and he cites in 
support certain passages from the Moksadharma of the Maha- 
bharata ( Kumbhakonam edition ), but the critioal edition from 
Poona treats those passages as apocryphal. Prof. Das-Gupta 
in the 4th volume of his 'Indian Philosophy' deals with this 
Purana, but his views are criticized in JBRS vol. 36 pp. 9-50. 
Vide H. in NIA vol. I pp. 522-528. The Padma part VI. ( chapter 
189-194) contains a Maliatmya of Bhagavatapurana in 518

one to the south of the Yamuna, the 2nd in the middle called Kalapnya and 
the third to the west at Mulastbana (modern Multan ). The Bhavisya men- 
tions three important places of sun-worship ( via Mundira, Kalapnya and 
Mitravana ), I agree with Mr. Dilipkumar Bisvas that Mnndira is modern 
Modhera in North Gujerat (vide p. 30 of summary of Proceedings of 15th 
Indian History Congress) where there has been a sun temple for about a 
thousand years. 



Bhagavatapurana 899 

veraas. The author of the Parana is said to be a native of the 
Tamil country by Mr. M. R. Majumdar in IHQ vol. 8. pp. 49-53. 
The present writer thinks that it is a late Purana, since even in 
the Moksakanda (of Kalpataru) it is not cited, while about 300 
verses are cited from the "Visnupurana in that kanda alone. 
Vide note 1604 below. No reliable and cogent evidence has been 
adduced to prove that the current Bhagavata can be placed 
earlier than the 9th century A. D. 

Mat syapm ana ( Anandasrama ed. ) It has 291 chapters and 
14062 verses. It is one of the ancient Puranas and has perhaps 
the largest number of smrti chapters among Puranas. Many 
verses of the Manusmrti and the Mahabharata occur in it Some 
verses of Yaj. also occur in Matsya e g Yaj. I 295 is Matsya 
93. 2, Yaj H 279. 295-6 and 303 are the same as Matsya 227 200, 
202-203 and 204 It appears that the Matsya holds the balance 
between Siva and Yisnu. It glorifies not only Visnu in the 
Matsya avatara but devotes 1570 verses to the slaughter of 
Tarakasura and 623 to the destruction of Tripura, both by Siva. 
The Vamanapurana (12 48) speaks of it as the principal among 
PurSnas 

The Mit on Yaj. I. 297 expressly quotes all the nine verses 
ofohap 94 of the Matsya (about the form of the images of the 
planets) and two verses from chap 93 (11-12) about the position 
to be assigned to each with white grains of rice in a mandala 
The Kalpataru quotes hundreds of verses from Matsya on vrata, 
quotas about 750 on dana from Matsya (all of which except 20 
are identified in the present Matsya by the editor ) ; about 410 
on Bajadharmakanda, 157 verses on tlrfcha ( of which 100 are 
identified by the editor in the Matsya), 115 verses in Grhastha- 
tomda, 112 verses on sraddha, about 67 on niyatakala (all 
except 12 identified), 18 in vyavaharakanda, 6 in brahmacari 
and 2 m moksa, in all about 2000 verses Apararka quotes 
about 400 verses from Matsya ( about 250 being on dana ). It is 
not necessary after the preceding statement to go into the large 
number of verses quoted in Danasagara, Smrti-candrika and 
•ttemadri. It may be said without fear of contradiction that 
long before 1000 A D the Matsya-purana had the same arrange-

Sankaracarya quotes a verne from Pauranika3 which is 
Matsya lla Among the sag£3 to whom water is offered in 
tarpaya are included (by Matsya) Kapila, A3Uri, Vodhu and 
Pancalikha. The first two and the last are mentioned in the 
Sankhyaksrika a3 the three great foundera of theSankhya system, 
"vararuei is said to be a profound scholar of Nltya-veda. In chap. 
24 the Purana refsre to the fact that the Apsaras UrvasI and her 
friend Citralekha were kidnapped by a demon called Kesin, who 
v/33 vanquished by Pururavas and IJrva3l was released and v/as 
given by Indra to Pururavas. While she was acting the part 
of Laksinl in a drama called Laksml-svayamvara composed by 
Bharata, 3he, being engrossed in her passion for Pururavas, 
forgot the proper abhiruiya taught by Bharata and wa3 cursed 
by Bharata to be a creeper It fa difficult to say whether the 
Mafsya got it3 inspiration for thi3 story from the Vikramor- 
vaslya or whether the great poet XalidSsa was influenced by 
the story in the Matsya. The story in Matsya and in Kalid3sa'3 
drama agree very closely as regards name3 and incidents The 
Mafcsya says (24,24) that for vanquishing Kesin Pururava3 
employed Vayavya^astra The drama also mentions it (X).

The only points of difference are : in the drama Laksmi-svayam- 
vara is said to have been composed by SarasvatI, while Matsya 
doe3 not say so. Besides, the Purana says that UrvasI was cursed 
by Bharata to be a creeper, while Kalidasa says nothing of the 
kind and shows that her being reduced to the condition of a 
creeper was due to Kumara ( Kartikeya ). The decision depends 
on the exaot dating of the Matsya from other evidence I am in- 
clined to believe that Kalidasa was familiar with the episode rela- 
ted in the Matsya There are scholars who believe that Kalidasa 
flourished under Vikramaditya about 57 B G The present 
writer does not subscribe to this belief. There is hardly any 
reliable or positive evidence to show that a powerful ruler called 
Vikramaditya ruled Northern and Central India about 57 B 0. 
The tradition of the nine jewels is of no use and if relied upon 
would make Vikramaditya rule about the 5th or 6th century A.D., 
since Amarasimha, Varahamihira and Kalidasa would be con- 
temporaries. A coin of the Gupta Emperor Candragupta II 
(Allen's Catalogue of coins, pp. 35 ff ) has %Rnrai%cT S^R^f^ sfgrff 
f^anf^cT". The present writer believes that the most probable 
date for Kalidasa is between 350 to 450 A. D. 

Markandeya-purana — There are two editions, viz B J 
edition ( of 1862 ) and the Venk. Press ed. The present author 
has mainly used the latter for quotations. The two differ slightly 
as to the number of verses in almost each chapter e g. there are 
270 verses in chap 8 of B J edition and 287 in Venk. ed , chapter 
16 of the Venk edition corresponds to chapters 16-18 of the other 
edition. There a T e 134 chapters in the Venk edition and 137 in 
B J edition Pargiter translated into English the Markandeya 
in the first 42 chapters ( B J ed ) Markandeya takes hardly any 
part, but in the remaining chapters he is the principal speaker. 
Ihis is a peculiar Purana The first chapter opens with four 
questions put by Jaimini to Markandeya about Mahabharata 
saga viz. ( i ) why nirguna Vasudeva assumed a human form

Devlmahatmya or Saptasatl 1431 (chapters 78-90 of Yenk. ed. 
and 81-93 of B J. edition ) and is deemed by modern Sanskrit 
scholars to be an interpolation But even if it is an inter- 
polation it must have been made before the 10th century, as the 
oldest known ms. of it is dated 998 A.D. and probably before 600 
A D The Markandeya has practically no verae3 on vrata, 
pilgrimages or santi, but dilates on the duties of asramas, on 
rajadharma, sraddha, hells, karmavipaka, sadacara, yoga, 
( explained by Dattatreya to Alarka ), stories of .Kartavirya, his 
grandson Kuvalayasva and of Madalasa, creation, manvantaras, 
geography &c. It has hardly any sectarian bias; prayers and 
invocations are few except in the Devlmahatmya. The present 
Purana has, as indicated above, three different and disconnected 
sections viz. chapters 1-42 ( Venk. ed, ), where the wise birds 
figure as speakers, chapters 43 to end where Markandeya and 
Krostuki, a disciple, carry on the discourse, except in Devl- 
mahatmya, which is the third and an independent section. 

The Kalpataru on moksa quotes about 120 verses from 
Markandeya on yoga, ahno3fc all of which are found in the 
printed text. It quotes on brahmacarikanda 9 verses, 12 on 
sraddha, 17 on niyatakala, 19 on grhastha, 3 on rajadharma 
and one on vyavahara. Apararka quotes about 85 verses from 
the Markandeya of which 42 are on yoga and the rest on sraddha, 
giving alms, hospitality, suddhi &o. The Sm. O. quotes 15 verses 
from Markandeya on ahmka, 40 verses on sraddha Markandeya 
quotes several verses from Manu and Mahabharata. Markandeya 
contains some long drawn out rupakas as in 3.59-70 (where prajna 
is said to be a fort-wall and the soul as king therein) and 35. 8-13 
(ahamityankurotpannah &c.) It contains the popular idea that for 
married women long stay with their relatives (in the family of 
birth) does not conduce to good reputation and that the desire of 
her relatives (by blood) is that a married woman should stay in her 
husband's house. 1432 The MaTkandeya says that the root of all

of the Devlmahatmya, which has only 589 verses ( and not 700 as the nama 
implies )in Venk ed. and 573 in B I ed. The verse «Sn^t4W|^<-')r at f&_ 
above on p 176 n 454a (from %sTrJrt?n**T) is quoted in the Dadhimatl-mat* 
inscription (found in the Jodbpur State) dated 289 of the Gupta era 
(E. 1. vol. XI p. 299 at 303 ) The inscription being of 608 A D., it follows 
that the verse taken from the Devlmahatmya, is earlier than 600 A.D

unhappmess is the idea that one is the owner. ( of this and that ) 
and that bliss comes with the idea ' nothing is mine *. 1433 In 
chap. 160. 39 it refers to lagna and hora. It puts forward the 
doctrine of the Glta, that actions done without any desire for 
their reward do not tend to become chains binding down a man 
to samsara. On the other hand, this Parana narrates the story of 
Datta 143 * or Dattatreye who imparted instruction on yoga to 
Alarka ( from chap. 16 ff ), but who is represented as an avatara 
of Visnu given to drinking intoxicants, as fond of the company 
of women, as staying near a water reservoir constructed with 
wood and stones on the Sahya ( 16. 132 ) and is called Avadhuta 
( 17. 3 ). In chap. 54 it is said ( just as in Brahmanda cited 
above p. 895 ) that the country in the north ranges of Sahya and 
near the Godavari is the most charming in the world. 

On the whole this is one of the early puranas and may be 
assigned to a date between the 4th to 6th century A. D. 

Lingapurana (Venk. ed.). It has 11000 verses as stated in 
chap. II. 5. The Kalpataru on tlrtha quotes about one thousand 
verses from it on Avimuktaka (Banaras) and the sub-tirthas 
therein. Apararka quotes six verses from it on SivapQja on the 
8th and 14th tithis and bath and sraddha in eclipses. The Sm. 
quotes a few verses from it on bath in eclipses, Veda study &c. 
According to the Danasagara (p. 7 verse 64) there was another 
Lingapurana of 6000 verses which it had not utilized. Vide H. 
in I. O. vol. IV. pp. 415-431 and in PRHR pp. 92-96. 

Varahapurana (B. I. edition }. It has 217 chapters and 9654 
verses, besides a few chapters entirely in prose ( such as 81-83, 
86-87 and 74 on bhuianakosa) and a few in mixed prose and 
verse (such as 80, 84, 85, 88, 89 ). It is a Yaisnava Purana and 
begum with the well-known verse ' Narayanan* namaskrtya ' and 
is supposed to have been narrated to the Earth by Yisnu in the

Boar incarnation. It ib remarkable that Vyasa does not appear 
in the Purana, though the Suta figures at the beginning of 
several chapters (e. g chap. 1, 2, 39, 50, 137, 137-138, 148, 151, 
181, 213 ). It deals with most of the general topics of Dharma- 
sastra such as vrata, tlrtha, dana, images and their worship, 
asauca, sraddha, karmavipaka, narakas, cosmology and geo- 
graphy, prayascitta &c. The Kalpataru quotes 150 verses from 
it on vrata (most of which are traced by the editor), 40 verses on 
sraddha ( none of which is traced), 250 verses on tlrtha ( many 
of which are traced), 17 on niyatakala (half traced), five on 
dana (all traced), 4 in grhasthakanda (not traced). One 
peculiarity is that it mentions some tlrthas like Lohargala and 
StutasvamI which are not described in other Puranas Apararka 
quotes about 55 verses from it on several topics. 

The Brahmapurana 1433 refers to a Varaha text laying down 
a sraddha for pitrs on the Pull Moon when the sun is in Virgo. 
The Bhavisyottara also (32 12) refers to Varahavacana. Por the 
priority of the Bhavisya to Varaha vide above p. 898 Varaha 
refers to a saka prince called Nandavardhana (in chap. 122 34) 
and verse 56 refers to a Saka king. 

Vide H. in ABORI vol 18 pp 321-337. It is difficult to 
assign a date to the Varahapurana It is not one of the early 
Puranas In any event iis is earlier than the 10th century A.D. 

Vamanapurana (Venk. ed.) It is a short purana as com- 
pared with Matsya, Vayu, Varaha &c It has 5451 verses in 
the Venk ed. There is prose in chapters 26, 44 and 93. For its 
size it contains many legends, such as Sankara cutting off a 
head of Brahma, the story of Prahlada and his grandson Bali 
and the latter's downfall, the greatness of Devi and her exploits, 
marriage of Siva and TJma at the request of gods, the birth of 
Kartikeya and explanation of his various names, the story of 
Danda who was cursed by Sukra for rape, enmity between 
Vasistha and Visvamitra, Gajendramoksa &c It briefly deals 
with many of the usual dharmasasfcra subjects viz. tlrtha, 
sadacara, asramadharma, samanyadharma, vrata, karmavipaka 
&c The KalpaWru quotes from Vamana about 88 verses on 
tlrtha ( only some of which have been traced), about SO verses

on vrafca, 14 verses on dana (which ara also quoted by Apararka 
p. 364) and 11 verses on niyatakala. 1436 

The Vsmana-purana mentions Kamasastras in 91. 73 and 
Mangalavara (Tuesday) in 41.24. It has bean stated above 
p. 899 that it expressly mentions Matsya as the best among 
Purauas. The story of king Danda (in 63. 19 ff. ) who perished 
along with the kingdom because he tried to violate Sukra's 
daughter appears to be an echo from Kautilya's Arthasastra (I. 
6 p 11 ' Dandakyonama Bhojah kamat brahmanakanyarn abhi- 
manyamanah sabandhurastro vinanSsa.'). It states that the 
king is called rajan because he keeps the subjects contented, 
just as Ealidasa says. 14g7 It says that Urna was so called 
because t43a she was forbidden to practise 'tapas' in the words 
'u ma' and that Siva assumed the forca of a Vadic student carry- 
ing a staff of Asadha (Palasa) and wearing a girdle of Mufija 
grass. This also appears like an echo of KumSrasamhhava V. 

The Sm.O. I. p. 168 quotes the two verses in which the Vamana 
prescribes that a man after a bath and homa should leave his 
house (for business &c.) after touching certain objects deemed 
to be auspicious ( noted below ). 

Taking all these matters into consideration the Vamana 
purana would have to be placed between 600 to 900 A. D. Vide 
H, in IHQ XI. pp. 115-130 and PRHR pp 76-92. 



1436. Ott p 358 of the Kalpatatu on Niyatakala three verses are quoted 
as from Vamana-purana -which the editor was not able to trace. They are 
three verses from Vamana 14. 48-51 quoted above on p. 71 note 178. The 
first of those three verses is quoted from the Vamana-purana fay Bhujabala- 
mbandha p 343 . The la3t two of the three verses are quoted from Vamana 
by Sm C. p. 125

906 History of Dharmaiastra [ Seo. IV, Ch. XXUI 

Vayupurana (Anandasrama ed.). This has 112 chapters 
and 10991 verses. It appears to have been divided like the 
Brahmanda into four padas, Prakriya ( ohap. 1-6 ), Anusanga 
( chap. 7-64 ), Upodghata (65-99) and Upasamhara (100-112). 
In the first ohap , the first versa is the famous one ' Narayanam 
namaskrtya* and the 2nd eulogises Vyasa (both these are not 
found in several mss ). The third verse refers to bhakti for 
Siva. Chap 104 is not found in many mss and the ohapters at 
the end on Gayamahatmya are deemed to be later additions by 
some scholars. There is Saiva bias in several chapters such as 
chap 20. 31-35 (with a prose passage containing Vedio texts), 
24. 91-165 (called Sarvastotra), chap. 55 (Sivastuti put in the 
mouth of Visnu), chap. 101. 215-330. Probably to counter- 
balance this the chapters on Gaya were added and also the 
praise of Visnu in chap. 98 where Dattatreya, Vyasa, Kalkin are 
said to be avataras of Visnu, but Buddha is not mentioned. 
Chapter 99 is the longest one in the Purana, contains 464 verses 
and is full of legendary material and historical references. 
There are several verBes in the Purana that appear also in the 
Mahabharata, Manu and Matsya. For its relation to Brahmanda 
vide pp. 852, 896 above. This Purana, like the Matsya, contains 
much Dharmasastra material. It is one of the oldest and most 
authoritative Puianaa, though it contains some later additions. 

The Vayu is not quoted in the vrata and niyatakala sec- 
tions of the Kalpataru, but it is largely quoted in several other 
sections From the Vayupurana Kalpataru quotes about 160 
verses on sraddha 1439 (of which the editor identified only about 
21), about 35 on moksa (most traced), 22 on tlrtha, 7 on dana, 
5 in brahmacari and 5 in grhastha. Apararka quotes about 
75 verses from Vayu out of which 60 concern sraddha and 
the rest deal with fast, dravyasuddhi, dana, sannyasa and yoga. 
The Sm. O quoteB only about 24 verses from Vayu" on sraddha, 
on atithi, on Agnihotra and fuel-sticks. 

' The Vayu makes a passing reference to the Gupta dynasty 
(vide p. 852 above), it knows the yuga of five years (50. 183), 

1439. In spite of great efforts the learned editor of Kalpataru has failed 
to notice in the Kalpataru several verses on sraddha, tlrtha and moiia. 
I have succeeded Jn identifying a few more, viz Vayu 15 24-25 and 43-46 
.occur in Kalpataru on sraddha ( pp 216-217). In Kalpataru on sraddha ( p. 
168 on Gaya) there are eleven verses quoted from Vayu left untraced by 
the editor, which are found in Vayu 77. 98-103 and 105-109. On p. 300 
of grhasthakanda two verses not traced are Vayu 62..161-162. 



Vayupurapa 907 

and Mesa, Tula ( 50. 196 ), Makara and Simha ( Jupiter therein ) 
in 82. 41-43. Chapter 87 describes Gltalankaras basing its treat- 
ment on the doctrines of purvacaryas. Brahmanda III. 62 is a 
similar chapter on the same subject and has almost the same 
verses. 

As it refers to the kings of the Gupta dynasty and as Bana 
refers to it in the Kadambari and the Harsacarita, it must be 
placed between 350 A. D. and 550 A. D. This date is corro- 
borated in several ways. Sankaracarya in his Bhasya on 
Vedantasutra H. 1. 1 quotes a verse as from a Purana, which is 
Vayu except 1140 for one word. In another place Sankara quotes 
a verse as smrti which is found in Vayu with slight variations. 
Another verse which is cited as smrti by Sankaracarya occurs 
in Vayu. The TattvavaisSradl of Vacaspati on Yogasutra I. 25 
expressly quotes from Vayu 12. 33 and 10. 65-66. 

Vide Prof. Dikshitar on ' Some aspects of the Vayupurana' 
(1933,53 pages, University of Madras); H in IHQ. voL 14

by Messrs. Gopal Narayan and Co. in saka 1824 with two com- 
mentaries, one called Vaisnavakataoandrika of Eatnagarbha 
Bhaftacarya and the other called VisnucittI). The present text 
is divided into six amsas^ 126 chapters and about 6000 verses. 
TheTe are many chapters in prose alone such as in 4th amsa 
chapters 7, 8, 9 and many in mixed prose and verse as in amsa 
4 chap. 1, 2, 6, 11, 12 &o. As stated above this purana agrees

are the same as Visnu IV. 10. 23-27 (about what Yayati said

is likely that all borrow from the Mahabharata, 'Adiparva 75. 
44 f£, 85. 9 ff. and Anusasana 7. 21 ff. The Mit. on Yajnavalkya 
HX 6 quotes on Narayanabali about 14 verses of the Visnu- 
purana. The Kalpataru on Moksa quotes 250 verses from the 
Visnu (most of which have been identified), 70 on niyatakala 
(almost all traced), 21 on brahmacari, 28 on sraddha (only one 
not traced), 21 on tlrtha (all traced), about 45 on grhastha- 
kanda. 1141 Apararka cites about 75 verses from the Visnupurana 
and the Smrticandrika about 100. The Kavyaprakasa 1441 " (IV.) 
quotes two verses from this (V. 13. 21-22 about a gopakanya 
attaining final release by her thorough unswerving devotion 
to LordKrsna) The Visnupurana teaches in some places the 
sublime philosophy of adiatta ; 1113 for example, it says ' He who 
seakB moksa should strive for treating all as equal, gods, men, 
beasts, birds, trees and oreeping life are all the form of the 
Infinite Visnu, though appearing as distinct from eaoh other; 
one who realizes this should look upon the world as his own self 
&o.' In another place the Visnupurana 1143 states 'The mind 
alone is the cause of the bondage of men and their release; mind 
that is attached to the objects of the senses tends to bondage, 
but when it is beyond attachment to them, it tends to moksa'. 
It teaches the central dootrine of the Glta that aotions done 
without an eye to the reward or fruit thereof do not lead to 
bondage, 1411 

1441. The editor has traced several verses from ^J5?qqTr I 3, but he did 
not notice that the three verses on pp 372-373 ( about brahmanas having to

Visnupurana 909 

The date of the Visnupurana is a difficult question. There 
is no doubt that it is one of the early Puranas and that its text 
is not very much inflated. Hundreds of verses quoted in the 
three early digests viz. Kalpataru, Apararka and Snirticandrika 
can be traced in the current text and this leads to the inference 
that the text has remained fixed for at least a thousand years. 
One important fact is that in this Purana Vyasa and the Suta 
do not play a prominent part as in many other Puranas. It 
states as some other Puranas do, that Vyasa had four pupils to 
whom he imparted the four Vedas and a fifth pupil the Suta 
Romaharsana (HI. chapters 3-7). But the suta does not appear 
anywhere as the narrator of this Purana. In the 4th amsa one 
remarkable matter is the mention of Sakya, Suddhodana and 
Bahula and it is stated that Suddhodana was 23rd in descent 
from Brhad-bala of the Iksvaku line (chap. 32 ). The possibility 
of interpolations, particularly in the prose passages, would have 
to be admitted. Basis are referred to in III. 14. 5 (rasisvarke ca 
gacchati) and the words lagna and hora also appear ( in a prose 
passage). Vaoaspati in his commentary on the Ybgabhasya 
2. 32 quotes it by name on yamas and myamas ( Visnu VI. 7. 
36-38 ) and a half verse 'evam bhadrasanadlnam' etc , Visnu 
Vt. 7. 49 in com. on Yogabhasya TH. 49. Vacaspati wrote his 
Uyayasucinibandha in vatsara 888 which should be taken as 
Vikrama year as he was a northerner and as the word 'vatsara' 
is used ( and not saka) i. e. 841 A. D. 

The following may be read on this question. Wilson's Intro, 
to the translation of the Visnu, vol. I. pp. LIX-LXXHI ; H. 
' date of Visnupurana' in ABORI voL 18 pp. 265-275 and PRHB, 
pp. 19-26 (puts if between 100-350 A.D.); Prof. Dikshitar in 
Pro. of the 13th Indian History Congress pp. 46-50 ; Jos. Abs in 
Festgabe Jacobi pp. 386-396 ( on heterodox systems mentioned 
in different Puranas including the Visnu). Vide above p. 869 
for a Visnupurana of 23000 verses not utilized by the Danasagara. 
It would not be far from the truth to hold that the present Visnu 
was composed between 300 to 500 A. D.

size it is not quoted by the Kalpataru on viata, tlrtha, brahmaoari, 
grhastha, rajadharma, moksa and other kandas. Apararka 
quotes only 30 verses from it, of which 24 are on dana: the 
Smrticandrika quotes about 30 in all and that Danasagara quotes 
profusely from it on dana. It cannot be earlier tban 600 A. D„ 
and cannot be placed later than the 10th century, though parts 
of it may be later additions. Chapters 52-65 of the first section 
are called SankaragltS. The Kalika Purana expressly refers (in 
chap. 91 70 and 92. 2 ) to the Visnudharmottara as having been 
concerned with Eajanlti and SadSoSra.

pp. 62-84 and * Studies &o.' vol. I. pp. 32-108. This purana is 
hardly ever quoted by early digests such as the Kalpataru,, 
Apararka or SmTtioandrika. Only four verses from it are quoted 
by the Danasagara. Prof. Hazra's propositions that the Bhavisya 
(pp. 68-82) and Brahmapurana (present) borrow from the 
Samba are not at all acceptable to the present author, parti- 
cularly in view of his own admission ( in 'Studies &o.' vol. I. 
p 68 ) that the present Sambapurana consists of different units 
belonging to different climes and ages. All that can be said 
positively is that a purana called Samba is mentioned by 
Alberuni in 1030 A. D. (Saohau I p. 130).

into six samhitas, viz. Sanatkumara, Suta, Sankarl, Vaisnavl, 
Brahml and Saura. The Skanda in seven khandas ha3 been 
published by the Venk. Press and the Sutasamhita with the

panaka eva driyante maladharinah' (verse 21) or 'vibhramoyatra

sastras are mentioned in Kaslkhanda (Purvardha 7. 4-5), Chan- 
vantari and Oaraka on medicine are mentioned in Kaslkhanda 
(Purvardha 1.71 ); the word Jhotinga occurs in Kaslkhanda 73 74 
(Jhotinga raksasah krurah). Skanda is quoted on topics of 
Dharmasastra in early commentaries and digests. The Mit. on 
Taj. H. 290 mentions it in connection with thB status of vesyas 
(courtezans). Kalpataru on vrata quotes only 15 verses from 
lt.Kalpataru on tlrtha (pp. 36-39, 32, 46, 130-135 ) quotes 92 
verses from it, on dana only 44, on niyatakala 63 verses, 18 
verses on Eajadharma (on Kaumudlmahotsava ), only 4 in 
sraddhakanda and 3 in grhasthakanda. Apararka 1 " 6 quotes 
only 19 verses from it; one quotation indicates Tantrik 
influence (vide note). The Danasagara cites 48 verses on dana 
from it and the Sm. C. only 23 in all Considering the colosBal 
figure of slokas in the Skanda it must be said that it is rather 
sparingly quoted in the Dharmasastra works A verse in it 
seems to echo the very words of Kalidasa and quotes the view of 
Devala."*- In such a huge work interpolations could easily be 
made. So it is difficult to assign a definite date to it. A ms. 
of the Skanda in the Nepal Durbar Library is written in charac- 
ters which belong to the 7th century A D. according to 
Haraprasad Shastri (vide Cat. of Nepal Palm-leaf mss. p. LU. ) 

It would be not far from the truth to say that the Skanda 
cannot be placed earlier than the 7th century A. D. and not later 
than 9th century A. D. on the evidence so far available.

SECTION V 

CHAPTER XXIV 
Influence of Puranas on Dharmasasira 

Literary works and society act and re-act on each other. 
The state of Indian society a few centuries before and after 
Christ, riven as it was by the growing strength and onslaught of 
Buddhism, Jainism and other dissenting seots and disturbed by 
invasions of the Greeks, Sakas, Pahlavas, Hunas and other 
foreign tribes, gave much food for thought to those who were 
devoted to the Vedic religion and induced them to write works 
setting forth new ideologies and practices and effecting are- 
statement of the ancient Vedic and Smrti Teligion. "When these 
woTks attained a position of authority and eminence, the endea- 
vour of the followers of the Veda was to follow them as far as 
possible and to adapt their practices and religious rites to the 
requirements of the Puranas. We have to see how the Puranas 
3et about their task of re-orientation. We must note that current 
Hindu religious practices, judging from the sankalpa made at 
the beginning of every rite, are meant to confer upon the per- 
former the rewards declared by Sruti (Veda), Smrti and Puranas 
( Sruti-smrti-puranokta-phalapraptyartham ). The task was two- 
fold, viz. (1) to undermine the power and prestige of Buddhism 
and Jainism and the influence of the numerous philosophical 1447 
schools that had sprung up and (2) to wean away large sections 
of the masses from the attractive features of Buddhism and to 
convince them that they could secure in the re-orientated Hindu 
faith the same benefits, social and spiritual, as Buddhism 
promised and that the religious principles of the followers of 
Veda coincided with many of the teachings of Buddhism and 
were borrowed by Buddhism from Vedic practices. Ultimately 
Buddhism vanished from the land of its origin. The main 
causes of this disappearance of Buddhism from Bharata will be 
stated at the end of this section, but this much may be said 
here at once th at the Puranas played a substantial role in bring-

ing about the decline and disappearance of Buddhism by 
emphasizing and assimilating some of the principles and 
doctrines of Buddha 1448 such as ahimsa, by accepting Buddha 
himself as an avatara of Visnu, hy adopting vegetarianism as 
a high form of austerity, by making use of monasteries and 
asceticism as stated in such smrtis as those of Manu and Yaj. 

The Puranas set about their task by saying that for the 

proper understanding of the Veda, knowledge of Itihasa and 

Purana was essential. A famous verse says 14w ' one should 

strengthen the Veda by ( the study and application of) Itihasa 

and Purana ; the Veda is afraid of the person of little learning 

(with the thought) that he (the man of small learning) may 

harm it'. Manu states 1150 that those brahmanas that have 

learnt according to the rules ( of Veda study ) the Veda together 

with the works that strengthen it are to be understood as status 

and are instrumental in making (the meaning of) the Veda 

clearly perceptible. The Vayu 1451 emphasizes in this connection 

that that brahmana who knows the four Vedas together with 

(the six) ancillary lores and the Upanisads would not be a wise 

man if he did not know Puranas. The Upanisads drop brief 

hints about the oreation of akasa from the one brahma (in Tai. 

Up. IL 1 ), of tejas ( Chan. Up. VI. 3 3 ), of waters ( Ohan. Up. VI, 

2. 4 ). The Puranas explain at great length the creation and 

dissolution of the elements ( in the order reverse of that of 

creation) e g. Vayu 4. 17 ff, Brahma 1-3, Agni 17, Brahmanda 

II. 3 ff, Kurma I. 2, 4, 7, 8 &c. The stories of Hariscandra and 



1448. Fargiter ( in ' PuarSna texts of the Dynasties of the Kali ago 1

ture that Hinduism secured its revival and the downfall of Buddhism.

Legends of Vedic times m Puranas 915 

Naciketas that occur in the Ait. Br. and the Kathopanisad are 
explained at length in Brahmapurana (chap. 104 and 150 about 
Hariscandra), in Sabhaparva chap. 12 (for Hariscandra) and 
inAnusasana chap. 91 ( for Naciketas ). The famous dialogue 
of Yama and YamI (Rg. X. 10 ) is expanded in the Narasimha- 
purana (chap. 13. 6-36). The Visnupurana 1 * 52 (IV. 6.34 ff) 
sets out the story of Pururavas and Urvasi, refers to the hymn 
in the Bg. X 95 for that story and quotes the first verse of the 
hymn in a somewhat corrupt form. 

But the claims of the extant Puranas go far beyond the 
above viz. as strengtheners of the Veda. The Kurma 145J states : 
'(put) on one side all the Puranas together with Itihasa (Maha- 
bharata) and on another the highest Veda; it is this (Puranas) 
that surpasses ( the other viz Veda)'. The Mahabharata also 
makes a similar claim. The PuraDas appear to claim priority 
( and even equality ) with the Veda. In note 1349 passages from 
the Matsya and other Puranas have been cited, stating that 
BrahmS first thought of the Puranas before all other sastras and 
then the Vedas sprang forth from his lips. Several Puranas are 
spoken of as equal to the Veda (Vedasammita) as in 1454 Vayu 
1. 11, 4. 12, Brahma 1. 29, 245. 4 and 21, Visnu 1. 1. 13, VI. 8. 12, 
Padma VI. 282. 116. Further, several Puranas claim to have 
been delivered by some God such as Brahma (Brahmapurana I. 
30 ) or by the Wind-god (Vayu I. 196 ) 14SS or by the avataras of 
Visnu as in the case of Matsya-purana (I. 26 ) or Varaha ( 2. 1- 
3 ). The japa of Vedic texts was deemed to destroy all sins as 
shown in H. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 45-50. The Puranas also say 
that reading the Puranas or listening to a recitation of them

90, Matsyi 890 20, 291. 29 and 31, Visnu VI. 8. 3, 12. Some of 
the PurSnas indulge in extravagant praise of themselves, e. g. 
the Varaha-purana ( 217. 12-13, 217.15-16) state3 that reading 
ten chapters of that Purana confers the merit secured by the 
performance of Agnistoma and Atiratra sacrifices. Vide Brahma 
254. 34-35, Agni 384. 13-30, Devl-Bhagavata XII. 13. 11-17 in 
a similar strain Moreover, the Puranas dwell upon the superior 
value and efficacy, as compared with the Vedio sacrifices, of 
some of the institutions on which they lay emphasis, such as 
pilgrimages, 1457 vratas, bhaktt. The Padma states ( I. 38. 2 and 
18 ) that by merely going to Gaya or by taking a bath in the 
Phalgu river one secures the reward that the performance of 
Asvamedha confers. The Skanda proclaims 1158 'I have no use 
for sacrificial rites that are declared by the Veda, that have no 
life in them, that are within the domain of ignorance and that 
entail injury ( to animals ). If { a sacrifice ) is performed with 
such inanimate things as fuel-sticks, flowers and kusa grass, the 
result must be similar (inanimate), since the effect is like the 
cause'. Vide Santiparva 337 for a story on the discussion 
between sages and gods about offering in sacrifices merely pro- 
ducts of grains or goat-flesh. Offerings of flesh in sacrifices to 
gods were made in the Jtgvedic period. But even m the Rgveda 
there are a few verses that indicate that offerings of ghee and 
fuel-sticks were declared to be able to win the favour of gods as 
much as animal sacrifices might do. 'Whoever 115 ' offers to for 
worships) Agni with a fuel-stick or with an oblation of ghee or

In Rgveda offerings of ghee and flesh equal 917 

with (the study of) tha Veda or who performs a good sacrifice 
with prostrations, for him alone run fleet horses and his is most 
brilliant fame , and no evil whether brought about by gods or 
by men might reach him from any side'. Another mantra 1460 
says'OAgni! we bring to you an offering accompanied by a 
rkmantra fashioned ( or produced ) by our heart. May those 
mantras be oxen, bulls and cows from you'. 

The Puranas only pursue an attitude to Veda and sacrifices 
that is found in some of the CTpanisads. The Mundakopanisad 1 * 61 
says: 'one should know two vidyas (lores), para (the higher) 
and apai a (the lower); the latter comprehends the four Vedag 
and Phonetics, aphorisms about solemn sacrifices, grammar, 
Nirukta (derivation of words), metres, astronomy; while the 
highest lore is that whereby the Imperishable (Eeality) is 
known'. The same Upanisad condemns apara-vidya when it 
says 'Those sacrifices are infirm (leaky) boats constituted by 
eighteen (persons) depending on which are declared actions that 
are inferior, those foolish people who welcome these actions as 
the highest good become subject again to old age and death'. 
The Kathopanisad 1 * 2 states that what are known as avidya and 
vidua are far apart from each other, are contradictory and lead 
to different results. When Narada approached Sanatkumara 
and requested the latter to teach him, the latter said to him 'tell 
me what you know and then I shall tell you what is beyond 
that.* Then Narada stated that he knew all the four Vedas 
Itihasa-purana the fifth Veda and several other lores, whereupon 
Sanat-kumara told him that the four Vedas and the other lores 
he had learned were merely a name and then he led Narada 
gradually to the understanding of the Highest Self. The Br 
Up. I. 4. 10 condemns him, who worships a deity thinking he 
is different from the deiata, that he does not know the truth 
that he ls like a (sacrificial) animal to the gods. Similarly, in 

rne 18 are the 16 priests, the sacnBcer and his wife, in his wr™ on

several passages of the Upanisads austerities, liberality, straight- 
forwardness, ahimsa and truthfulness are put forward as equal 
to or superior to the actual performance of the ceremonial of 
sacrifice (yajna), vide Chandogya III. 17. 4, Prasna I. 15, 
Mundaka I. 2. 11. 

Though in a few passages of the Upanisads the knowledge 
of the Highest Self is put higher than the four Vedas, the Upa- 
nisads generally treat the Vedas as authoritative and quote 
Vedic verses in support of their statements. For example, the 
Ait. Up. II. 5 quotes Rgveda IV. 27. 1 ( taduktam-rsina-Garbhe 
nu &o. ), Frasnop. 1. 11 quotes Rg. I. 164. 12 ( paficapadam 
pitaram), Br, Up. II. 5. 15, 17 and 19 quote respectively 5g. I. 
116.12,1. 117.22, VI. 47 18 (rupam riipam pratirupo). The 
Upanisads further emphasize 1463 that brahmavidya is to he 
imparted only to those who are irotnya ( who have studied the 
Veda), who engage in their duties and who have properly per- 
formed Sirovrata. The Br. 1164 Up. shows that Veda study, 
sacrifices, charity &o. are preparations for the knowledge of 
brahma: ' Brahmanas (and others) desire to know this ( great 
Self) by study of the Veda, by sacrifices, gifts, tapas, fasting'. 
These passages make it clear that study of the Veda and per- 
formance of sacrifices enjoined by it are accepted by the Upa- 
nisads as preparatory and as cleansing the mind of its lower 
passions and as making a person worthy of receiving the know- 
ledge of the highest truth about the One Supreme Spirit and 
that the Upanisads do not altogether condemn and give up the 
Vedas and sacrifices. 

The Puranas adopt, in spite of the claims made by them 
here and there about their priority to the Vedas, about their own 
value and efficacy, the same attitude towards the Veda as the 
Upanisads do. They treat the Vedas as authoritative and enjoin

the employment of Vedio mantras in many rite3. The author 
contributed a paper to the Dr. Kunhan Raja Presentation volume 
pp. 5-8 on the 'Vedic mantras and legends employed inPuranas* 
citing illustrations from the Brahmapurana. A few illustrations 
from other Puranas may be set out here. The Matsyapurana 
(chap. 93) when describing the procedure of the homo, to the 
nine planets prescribes nine Vedic mantras, five of which are 
different from those provided by Yaj. ( I. 300-301 ). Vide p. 750 
above for a comparative table of the two sets of mantras. In 
the Udvahatattva 1465 Eaghunandana remarks that the mantras 
' a krsnena ' and others aTe common to persons following the four 
Vedas and that Bhavadevabhatta held the same view. Matsya 
prescribes that when inauspicious birds (like an owl) or animals 
cry near a house or enter it, a homa should be performed, or five 
biahmanas should engage in a japa li66 of the hymn beginning 
with ' Devah kapota * ( Rg. X. 165. 1-5 ). In describing the whole 
procedure of the establishment of images of gods or the hhga 
(of Siva), the Matsya (chapter 265) prescribes numerous Vedic 
verses and hymns for the different parts of the ceremony. For 
example, for bringing about the purification of the image four 
mantras are prescribed viz. Rg. VII. 49. 1-3 and X. 9. 1 ; in 
providing for the placing of a jar full of water near the head of 
the bed on which the image is to be placed, two mantras ' Apo 
devl' (Vaj S. 12. 35, Tai. S. IV. % 32) and « apo asman matarah* 
(Rg. X 17. 10 ) are to be recited. Matsya ( 265. 24-29 ) prescribes 
for the japa of several suktas (hymns) by four door-keepers 
learned m the Vedas that are to stand in the four main direc- 
?v S ; Fj? Agnipurana ( 4l. 6-8 ) providing for the laying down 
of baked bricks or stones in building a temple prescribes the 
recital of many Vedic mantras, viz. Rg. X. 9.1-3, Rg.X.9.4, 
•Kg. IX 58. 1-4, Pavamani verses (either Rg. IX 1. 1-10 or

beginning with ' Hiranyavarnam harinlm*). Th^ Maradlya- 
pur&na (II. 73. 83-90 ) contains at end of eaoh of the verses parts 
of vedic prayer, whioh occur in Rg. VII. 66. 16, Tai. At. IV. 4. 
2-5 and Vaj. S. 36.24; Bhagavata I. 3. 21 ( bhdyate &o.) is 
taken from Mundaka Up. II. 2. 8. 

The Puranas not only prescribe Vedic mantras for various 
purposes, but suggest the employment of numerous Pauranika 
mantras. It appears that Pauranika mantras oame to be 
employed along with Vedic mantras in religious rites even of 
Brahmanas at the beginning of the Christian era or within a 
few centuries after Christ Yaj. I. 229 prescribes that the Visve 
Devas should be invited to come to a sraddha with the rk, 'O 
Visve-Devasl Come, listen to this my call, sit down on these 
kuias' (Bg. II. 41.13). On this the Mitaksara (about 1100 
A. D. ) remarks that along with the Vedic mantra mentioned by 
Yaj. a smarta mantra should also be employed viz. the mantra" 67 
' agacohantu mahabhaga,' whioh occurs in Skanda and Garuda- 
purana. Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 440 note 984 for the ascrip- 
tion of this verse to various authorities. The Vayupurana" 68 
prescribes that the mantra * adoration to the devatUs, to pitrs, to 
the great Yogins, to svadha and svaha ; they are always present' 
should be recited thrice at the beginning and at the end of 
sraddha and at the time of offering ptndus; the pitrs quickly 
come when the mantra is repeated and goblins run away ; this 
mantra protects the pitrs in all three worlds'. This mantra is 
styled 'Saptarcis' (having seven flames) in Vayu 74. 20, Brah- 
manda III. 11. 30 and in Visnudharmottara L 140. 68 and by 
Hemadri on sraddha pp. 1079 and 1208, who notes that it occurs 
in seven Puranas. In chap. 206 of the Agni in the procedure of 
offering arghya to the star Agastya (Canopus) ftg. I 179. 6 has 
been adopted as verse 13.

Up'anisad-passages taken in Puranas 921 

Not only are mantras from Vedio Samhitas prescribed by 
the Puranas for certain rites, but Upanisad passages also some- 
times with slight variance aTe bodily transferred into some of 
the Puranas. For example, Kurma II. 9. 12, 13 and 18 embody 
Tai. Up. II. 4 (yato vaco nivartante ), Svetasvataropa. III. 8 
( vedaham-etam purusam ) and VI. 11 ' eko devah '. The Visnu- 
purSna VI. 5. 65 is * dve vidye veditavye iti catharvanl srutih' 
and contains a passage of the Mundaka Up. 1.1.4 (vide note 1461 
above). The Vayu 20.5 (pranavo dhanuh) and 20.28 (Ajam- 
ekam) are respectively Mundakopa. II, 2. 4 and Svetasvatara-up. 
IV. 5. Vayu 14. 13 (sarvatah panipadantam ) is almost the same 
as Svetasvatara Up. HI. 16 and Vamana 47. 64-65 has the same 
verse. Vamana 47. 67 is almost the same as "Bg. 1. 10. 1. 

This gives rise to interesting questions. The sudras had no 
right to study the Veda. But as a matter of fact the Puranas 
contain as exemplified above a good many Vedic mantras. It 
is stated in the Bhagavata 1468 " 'women, sudras and brahmanas 
in name only are beyond the pale of the three Vedas; therefore 
the sage (Vyasa) composed through compassion for them the 
Bharata tale'. The Devibhagavata states 'study of the Veda

922 History of Dharmaiaslra r Sec. V,Ch. XXIV 

ia not accepted for women, sudras and brahmanas in name only 
and Puranas are compiled for the purpose of benefitting them'. 
From this it follows that in the case of sudras the listening to 
the Bharata was deemed to bring about the same results that 
the Veda does for dvijas and that even the sudra may acquire 
the knowledge of the Self (and moksa) from the Bharata. 

Though the brahman as in the Sth and following centuries 
A. D wanted to placate the sudras who were probably a majority 
of the whole people and to wean them away from Buddhism, they 
still kept a distinction between dutjas and sudras and the only 
concessions made were that the sudras could worship in the 
same way as dvijas did and that they could have mantras 
(Pauranika) in their rites and ceremonies. For example, in 
allowing bha^masnana (smeanng ashes on the body) the Padma 
( IV. 110. 386-289 ) provides Vedio mantras for men of the three 
varnas but Pauranika mantras only (Padma IV. 110. 290-293) 
for sudraB. The Padma 1169 further provides that sudras could 
not perform pranayama or utter the sacred syllable W butthat 
they should substitute dhyUna in place of pranayama and 'Siva' 
in place of 'om'. 

Gradually in some matters the procedure provided in the 
Puranas came to supersede the ancient Vedio procedure pre- 
scribed for them Apararka states (onp 14) that inDevapfija 
one should follow the procedure prescribed in the !Narasimha- 
puraua 1170 and the like and not the procedure of the Pasupatas 
or Pancaratras and (on p 15) he says the same about the con- 
secration of temples, 1471 images and the like 

The Narasimhapurana (chap. 63 5-6) says that the mantra 
'om namo Narayanaya' enables one to secure all objects and jqpa 
of it frees a man from all sins and leads him to absorption into 
Visnu 1472

v Procedure of king's coi emotion m Fu> anas 923 

The Agnipurana (ohap. 218) describes the procedure of the 
king's coronation, and (chapter 219) sets out the Pauranika 
mantras (about 70) employed at the coronation. Similarly, trie 
VisnudbaTmottara (II. 21) describes the procedure of coronation 
with Vedic mantras and ( in II. 22 ) with 184 Pauranika verses 
invoking various gods, minor deities, sages, rivers &c. Medieval 
digests like the Eajanltiprakasa (pp 49-83), Nitimayukha 
(pp. 1-4), Rajadharmakaustubha (pp 318-363) describe the 
combined coronation procedure of Vedic and Pauranika mantras 
from the Visnu-dharmottara (vide pp. 78-79 of the H. ofDh. 
voLIII. for details). The Eajanltiprakasa (pp. 430-433) 
prescribes numerous mantras derived from the Visnudharmottara 
as prayers and as blessings. 

The Padmapurana 1473 narrates the interesting story of a 
person called Dhanasarma whose father followed only the Vedic 
path(srauta-marga), who did not engage in such Pauranika 
prescriptions as Vaisakhasnana and who therefore became a 
horrible and distressed pi eta. Some of the verses are very inter- 
esting. 'I performed in my ignorance only Vedic rites and I 
never observed Vaisakhasriana in honour of God Madhava 
( Visnu ), nor observed a single Vaisakha Full Moon vrata which 
is like an axe for cutting the tree of sins that afflicts one like a 
conflagration fed by the fuel of sinful deeds &c.; to one who 
studies many sastras and several Vedas with their extensive 
ancillary Literature, learning does not come, if he has not 
studied Puranas'. This shows what importance catne to be 
attached to Puranas not only for sudras but even for brahmanas 
who performed the Vedic rites prescribed for them. 

The influence of the Puranas went on increasing gradually 
At first it was said"** that the dharma understood from the 
Veda was the highest, while the dharma declared in the Puranas

and the like was mfencn. This gradually changed and dharma 
was said to be of three kinds, Vaidika, Tsntrika and Misra and 
it was said in the Bhagavata M7S and the Padma that one may 
worship god Visnu in any one of the three ways that one desired. 
The Padma adds that the Vaidika and Misraka methods are 
declared to he proper for brahmanas and the like, while the 
Tantrika method of worship is meant for a devotee of Visnu and 
also for sudras. The Devibhagavata (XI. 1.21-23) stateBthat 
Sruti (Veda) and Smrti are the eyes of dharma and Purana its 
heart, and that that is dharma which is declared by these three 
and that dharma can be found nowhere else than in these, that 
in Furanas sometimes what is found in Tantras is put forward 
as dharma, but one should not accept that. 

The Bhavisya ( Brahmaparva 1.43-47 ) in a dialogue between 
Satanlka and Sumantu) first enumerates the 18 dharma-sastras 
from Manu to Atri, states that the Vedas, the sastras of Manu 
and others and the angas are promulgated for the three varnas 
and not for the benefit of sudras, that sudras appear to be very 
much helpless; how can they be able to secure the four 
puiusarlhas? They are devoid of agama (traditional lore); 
what traditional lore was declared for them by the wise among 
the brahmanas for enabling them to secure the three viz. dharma, 
aitha andkama? Sumantu replies: 1476 listen to the Dharma- 
sastras that were declared by wise men for the benefit of all four 
varnas and specially for sudras viz. the 18 Puranas, the life of 
Rama of the Baghu race ( i. e. the Ramayana) and the Bharata

Vijasa composed Bharata for all varnas 925 

declared by Parasara's son (Vyasa), the compassionate Vyaea 
composed a sastra for the benefit of all four varnas in which he 
comprehended the entire meaning of the Veda and the Dharma- 
sastras; it is an unparalleled boat for all that are engulfed in 
sams&ra. This makes it olear that the Puranas, the Mahabha. 
rata and the Ramayana embody pristine traditions and thoughts 
and were deemed to have been composed as the instruments of 
the education and enlightenment of the common people. As a 
matter of fact we find that some Puranas like Agni, Matsya, 
Visnudharmottara are encyclopaedic and include treatises on 
politics and government, on law, medicine, astronomy, astro- 
logy, poetry, music, sculpture &c. They illustrate India's life and 
character as a country and exemplify Bharata's achievements, 
weaknesses and shortcomings. Two questions that arise are : 
(1) could the Puranas including the Vedio mantras quoted 
therein be read by the sudras themselves; (2) supposing that 
Vedic mantras could not be read by the sudras, could they, if 
they were able to do so, by themselves read the puranas without 
abrahmana's help. All writers of digests and commentaries 
were agreed that sudras could not read or listen to the Vedio 
mantras contained in the Puranas (which being meant for the 
benefit of all varnas contained Vedic mantras also), but only 
those that belonged to the three upper classes. Some writers, 
however, were agreeable to Sudras reciting Pauranika mantras in 
religious rites, relying on a passage of the Padmapurana. But 
others like Kamalakarabhatta, author of the Nirnayasindhu and 
Sudrakamalakara, held relying on verses of the Bhavisya that 
Pauranika mantras alone were to be used by a brahmana in a 
religious rite for a sudra, that the sudra was only to listen to the 
reading of a purana by a brahmana reader. There was a third 
view held by Srldatta and others that a sudra could recite a 
pauranika mantra, but he should not himself read the Puranas 
and should only listen to the reading of Puranas by a brahmana. 
in the times of the Dharmasutras the only mantras employed 
were mostly Vedic and therefore in the case of sudras 
Orautama"" provided that the sudras were allowed the alter- 
native rf saying 'namah' in place of a Vedic mantra. In the 
centuries preceding Christ the sudras would naturally have been 
attracted to Buddha's teaching as it was addressed to all 
including sadras Comparative ly early orthodox writers like 



926 History of Dharmasasli a [ Sec. V, Oh. XXIV 

Kumarila knew that the sudras formed the largest number of 
professed Buddhists when he says 1 * 78 'the dicta of Sakya and 
others wore all opposed, except a few relating to self-restraint, 
charity and the like, to all the fourteen Bources of learning, 
were promulgated by Buddha and others that had strayed from 
the path of the three Vedas and did acts contrary (to the Veda) 
and that those dicta were presented by them to those who were 
deluded, who were outside the pale of the three Vedaa, who 
mostly comprised the 4th varna (i, e. sudra) and those that had 
lost caste'. Therefore, the learned brahmanas who wanted to 
wean sections of the masses (including sudras) away from 
Buddhist teachings composed new Fauranika mantras by the 
thousand and employed them in all religious rites like sraddhas, 
yratas &o. It was, therefore, that earlier mbandha writers like 
Srldatta were prepared to allow sudras to recite Pauranika 1 *" 9 
mantras. But when centuries had elapsed after Buddhism had 
disappeared from India, orthodox brahmana writers like 
Kamalakara 1480 (who wrote his K S. in 1613 A. D. ) showed a 
staffer attitude by confining sudras merely to the listening to. 
Puranas read by a brahmana and by not allowing them even to 
recite a Fauranika mantra. It may be noted that the Nara- 
simhapurana in laying down the duties of sudras provides that 
they should listen to the reading of puranas by a brahmana

Relation, of Sruti, Smrti and Purayas 9£? 

(reader) and should worship Narasimha {avabara ofVisnu). 
The relation of Sruti, Smrti and Puranas and their spheres of 
application are summed up in the Naradiyapurana as follows : — 
" The Veda exists in different forms ; there is the Veda which 
has the performance of sacrificial rites (as its sphere) ; smrtis are 
the Veda for the householder's stage ; hoth those are centered in 
( or supported hy ) the Puranas. Just as this wonderful world 
sprang from the ancient Being (God), there is no doubt that all 
this literature arose from the Puranas. I hold that the meaning 
(or purpose) of the Puranas is more extensive (or superior to) 
than the meaning (or purpose) of the Veda. All the Vedas 
always rest on the Puranas; the Veda is afraid of the man of 
little learning (with the thought that) that man may harm it. 
The Veda does not deal with the movements of the planets, nor 
does it contain correct calculations about the proper times ( for 
religious acts), nor does it deal with the iithivrddhi or tithiksaya, 
nor with the determination of the panans ( amavasya, purnima 
&c.) or eclipses. Determinations about these were formerly 
made in Itihasa and Puranas. What is not seen in the Vedas 
is all noticed in the Smrtis; what is not seen in both is declared 
in the Puranas. What is declared by the Vedas and what is 
declared by the auxiliary lores— it is Veda that is declared by 
Smrtis and Puranas. The person who looks upon Puranas in 
any other light would be born as a lower animal'. 1481 The 
Naradiyapurana 1482 further states 'the merit acquired by those 
wicked men who speak about Puranas as mtha%adas (mere 
laudatory 1483 or condemnatory statements) are destroyed and

the wicked man who regards as arthavadas the Puranas that axe 
the means of uprooting ( the evil effects of ) all acts, reaches 
Hell'. 

The Puranas introduced several striking changes in the 

religious rites, practices and ideals of the people. The most 

characteristic thought and the keynote of the Puranas is to 

declare how great rewards and results could be secured with 

little effort The Visnupurana (VI. 2) narrates how sages 

approached Vyasa with the question ' in what age does a little 

dhartna yield very great rewards'? Vyasa was bathing in the 

Ganges; he came out, uttered 'sudra is good and Kali is good' 

and then again plunged into the river ; then he again came out 

and said 'well done, O sudra I you are blessed'; he again 

plunged into the river, came out and said ' women are good and 

blessed; who is more blessed than they'. When he finished his 

bath and performed his morning rites, the sages asked him to 

explain what he meant'by calling Kali, sudras and women good 

and blessed. He replied: 'a man secures in a single day and 

night in Kali age as much reward of tapas, celibacy and japa as 

is obtained in ten years in Krta age, in one year in Treta and 

in amonthinDvapara; therefore, I spoke of Kali as good ; in 

Kali age a man secures merely by the glorification or incessant 

repetition of the name of Kesava what he would secure by deep 

meditation in Krta, by sacrifices in Treta, and by worship in 

Dvapara; I am pleased with Kali because a man secures great 

eminence of dharma with a little effort Persons of the three 

higher varnas have to study the Vedas after observing many 

strict rules, then they have to peiform sacrifices which require 

wealth,, they incur sin if they do not perform their dutieB 

properly; they cannot eat and drink as they please, but are 

dependent on the observance of many rules as to food &o. ; 

dvijas secure higher worlds after great trouble; the sudra 

secures his worlds by serving the three varnas, he has the right 

to offer the pakayajfias (without mantras) and therefore he is 

more blessed than a dvija He has not to observe striot rules 

about proper and disallowed food or drink and therefore he was

declared' good 'by me. A woman by serving her husband in 
thought, word, and deed aeoures with less trouble the same 
worlds that her husband secures with great effort and trouble 
and therefore I said a third time about women that they were 
blessed. The acquistion of dha> ma is secured with small trouble 
in Kali age by men who wash off all their sins by the water in 
the form of the qualities of their soul ; sudras do the same by 
being intent on service to dvijas and women also secure the 
same without trouble by service to their husbands. Therefore 
all these three are regarded by me as most blessed.' 1181 The 
Brahmapurana chapter 229 verses 62-80 are identical with Vismi- 
purana VI, 2. 15-30 and 34-36. The Yisnupurana emphasizes 
that each one must do one's duty in the society in which one is 
born or one's duty which one has undertaken, that, if a person 
does this, he reaches the same higher worlds, whether he be a 
brShmana or a sudra. This doctrine is the same as taught in 
the Bhagavadglta 1485 18. 45 and 46 * a person secures the highest 
perfection (final emancipation) by being intent on carrying 
out the duties appropriate to him ; man secures perfection ( or 
bliss) by worshipping with the performance of his peculiar 
duties ( not with flowers and the like or bywords) Him from 
whom all beings proceed and by whom all this (world) is 
enveloped'. Ancient works like the Vedas, Jaimini's sutras on 
Mlmamsa and the Vedantasutras did not consider or discuss 
how women or sudras were to secure higher spiritual life and 
final Beatitude. The Vedantasutra (I. 3.34-38) denies to the 
siidra the right to study the Veda and the Upanisads. Buddha's 
teaching held out the same promise of liberation from suffering

to all men irrespective of class or caste and was therefore most 
attractive to sudras. The Bhagavadglta, and the Puranas 
changed the whole outlook of Indian society, high or low, and 
promised the same higher spiritual life or worlds to all who did 
their work under a sense of social duty, did not hanker after 
mundane rewards and hrought all their actions, in whatever 
avocation they might be engaged, as an offering to God. In the 
Padmapurana 1486 Vyasa is made to say to Yudhisthira: "It is 
not possible to observe in the Kali age the rules of Dharma laid 
down by Manu and by the Vedas; the one thing which one 
should do is to observe a fast on Ekadasl in both fortnights (of 
a month), which is an easy means (that) requires little wealth, 
that entails little trouble, but yields great rewards, that is the 
very essence (of the teachings) of all Puranas; he should be 
pure and on DvadasI after worshipping Keaava with flowers he 
should first feed brahmanas and then himself take his meal; 
those who desire to secure heaven should perform thisvrata 
throughout their lives; even persons of evil conduct, the greatest 
sinners devoid of dharma, do not go to Tama ( do not fall into 
hell) if they fast on Ekadasl." The Sutasamhita states 'effort 
for acquiring true knowledge ( of the Self) is meant for all (for 
persons even lower than sudras ), that effort made by explaining 
in a different language (than Sanskrit) and by the lapse of 
enough time will tend to the good ( of the lowest )'. This clearly 
shows how the Puranas put before all people easy ways whereby 
they could attain blis3 in the Hereafter. 

The Baud 1487 Dh. S., Manu and Vasistha emphasize that 
one should not invite a large company of brahmanas at a 
sraddha, because a large company destroys these five (advan- 
tages ) viz showing proper respect to invitees, propriety of place 
and time, cleanliness and the securing of worthy brahmanas and

Purayas discarded certain rules of Bharata 931 

it wa9 further provided by the Anusasana-parva 1483 and others 
that one should not go deep into examining the learning, family 
and oharaoter of brahmanas in a rite for the gods, but in rites 
for the Manes close examination as to these matters is proper 
(or justified). The Pur anas went against both these prescrip- 
tions. They are not tired of recommending again and again 
profuse expense in sraddhas and condemning stinginess (lit. 
roguishness in spending money ) in sraddhas and also in such 
other matters as the observances of Ekadasi. For example, the 
Visnupurana 1489 quotes nine verses (III. 14 22-30) as uttered 
by the pitrs, two of which may be translated here ' Would that 
a wise and blessed person be born in our family who not indulg- 
ing in stinginess in spending wealth will offer pindas to us and 
who would donate to brahmanas for our sake jewels, clothes, a 
large conveyance, wealth and all enjoyments if he has riches' ! 
Padma 1490 recommends that avoiding stinginess brings pleasure 
to theirs. The Matsya (56.11) prescribes that one should 
not show stinginess in the Krsnastamlvrata. The Padma says 
that that bad man who being possessed of wealth celebrates the 
jagara on EkadasI in a close-fisted way loses his soul. The 
Brahmapurana" 91 says in a general way that whoever does a 
religious act with stinginess is a sinner. 

Mann (m. 149) provides that 'in rites in honour of gods 
one who knows dharma should not critically examine the 
brahmanas to be invited for dinner, but in a rite for ancestors 
one should carefully investigate (the fitness of) brahmanas' 
ims does not mean that in rites for gods any one may be 
invited. We have to observe the general rule of Manu (HI 128) 
that donors should give only to a man who has studied the Veda

dinner in rites for goda or pitra So what Manu III. 149 moans 
is that deep investigation of ancestry &c. ia not necessary in 
ritea for gods. 

It ia provided by the Vayu 1153 that thore is to be no exami- 
nation of the qualities and character of the brahmanas at Gaya 
and the Varahapurana providea that all brahmanas of Mathura 
are like goda and that a brahmana of Mathura not knowing 
even a rk verso is superior to a brahmana of another plaeo that 
ha3 studied the four Vedas. Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 579, 670 
for detaib of Gaya and Mathura brahmanaa. The Padraapurana 
and the Skanda ( Ka3Jkhanda 6. 56-57 ) recommend that at tlrthas 
(sacrodplace3) one should not engage in investigation (of the 
worth) of brahmanaa, and that Manu declares that brahmanaa 
appearing (at a tlrtha) and desiring food should be fed, 149 * 

It is not unlikely that the abovo passages from the Vsyu, 
Varaha and Padma are later interpolations. When Buddhism 
was flourishing largo companies of Buddhist monks wore fed by 
the people. When Buddhism declined and disappeared from 
India after the 12th or 13th century A. D, people came to believe 
that there was great merit in feeding poor brahmanaa just as in 
former times people fed monks and the Puranaa might have only 
echoed and emphasized the general sentiments of the people. If 
the people in general had not come to believe in this, the author 
feels that no amount of interpolations or insistence by the so- 
called crafty brahmanas would have been effective. Writers, 
Western or Indian, that, relying on the notions current in the 
19th and 20th centuries, pass severe and unmeasured strictures 
on the provisions for brahmanaa in the Puranaa do great 
injustice to the authors of Puranaa that flourished about a 
thousand years ago or moxo. Such writers should compare 
Indian medioval conditions, ideas and doing3 of brahmanas 
with the claims of the Popes, Christian priests, Inquisitions and 
the state of monastic Orders in Europe from about the 10th 
century A. D. to the 15th century. In comparison it would bo

found that the conditions in Europe were terribly worse than in 
India in those centuries. 1 * 91 

As a consequence of the abovementioned dominating 
principle the Puranas strongly recommend dana ( gifts, parti- 
cularly of food ), pilgrimages and baths in sacred waters, vratas, 
ahimsa, bhakti, repetition of the name of god, sraddhas &o. 
These will be briefly illustrated below. 

The Puranas institute a comparison between solemn Vedio 
sacrifices on the one hand and pilgrimages and baths at saored 
plaoes on the other. The Vanaparva 1 * 95 contrasts the two as 
follows, " the solemn sacrifices promulgated by the sages cannot 
be accomplished by a poor man ; sacrifices require many imple- 
ments and a collection of various materials, which are secured 
by kings or sometimes by rioh men, but not by poor men who 
have to rely on themselves alone, who have no helpers and who 
do not possess means. Going to holy places confers merit and 
surpasses sacrifices. One does not secure that reward by such 
sacrifices as Agnistoma, in whioh profuse fees are distributed, 
which is secured by repairing to sacred places. '' Vide H. of Dh. 
vol. IV pp. 561-564 for further encomiums of sacred places and 
the virtues to be cultivated' for reaping the full merit of 
pilgrimages. 

In pursuance of the same dominant principle the Anusa- 
sana-parva and Puranas extol fasts and vratas. The Anusasana-

paTva 1496 (107 5-6 ) remarks that fasts are equal to sacrifices in 

the matter of rewards They are put forward as superior to 

sacrifices in Padma. 1497 It says : VisnuvTata is super-eminent ;

First dana. High eulogies of gifts have been sung from 
the Rgveda downwards. The subject of dana ( gifts ) in all its 
aspects has been dealt with in the H of Dh. vol. IL pp. 837-888. 
The Mahabharata in numerous places (particularly in the whole 
of Anusasana-parva) and the Puranas such as Matsya chap 82- 
92 and 274-289, Agni chap. 208-213, Varaha 99-111, Padma V. 
21. 81-213 (which agree almost verbatim with Matsya 83-92), 
Padma II. 39-40 and 94, III 24, Kurma II. 26 devote a great 
deal of space to the subject of danas. But here only two topics 
in relation to gifts will be dealt with, viz. gifts of food and gifts 
to brahmanas The Rgveda condemns the person as merely a 
sinful one who does not offer food to the gods nor to his friendB 
and uses it only to fill his own belly. W93 The Ait. Br and the 
Tai 14 » Br. speak of * food ' as * prana ' ( life ) The Baud 1SM Dh. 
S states " all beings depend on food, the Veda saya 'food is life,' 
therefore food should be given (to others), food is the highest 
offering". Manu 1501 and Visnu Dh. S. state 'the man who 
cooks food only for his own sake ( and not for offering to gods 
and men) eats merely sin', The Bhagavadglta carries the same 
message ' those who eat food left after offering in sacrifice are 
freed from all sins, but those who cook food for their sake alone 
eat sin '. The Padma has a fine passage 'those who always feed 
the cripple, the blind, children, old men, persons that are dis-

eased, helpless and pinched by penury, always enjoy bliss in 
heaven; there is no end to the merit (accumulated) by con- 
structing wells and tanks, where aquatic animals and others 
moving on land drink water when they desire, for water is the 
life of living beings and life is centred in water". The distribu- 
tion of food particularly to learned brahmanas is highly praised 
in Brahma-purana ls02 318. 10-32, Padma V. 19. 289-307m, Agni 
211. 44-46. ' The gift of food is superior to all gift3 ; food is the 
life of men, from food spring all beings; the worlds are depen- 
dent on food, therefore food is praised; man secures heaven by 
the gift of food; a person who joyfully gives food acquired by 
just means to brahmanas deeply learned in the Veda is released 
from all sins ' says Brahma. Tha Agnipurana says * The gifts of 
elephants, horses, chariots, male and female slaves and houses 
do not come up even to a sixteenth part of the gift of food ( in 
merit), a person who committing a great sin afterwards 
distributes food becomes free from all sins and secures everlast- 
ing worlds' (211. 44-46). The Kuima 1503 prescribes « a man 
should give to a brahmacarin (Vedic student) food every day 
( i. e. when he comes begging) , thereby he becomes free from all 
sins and reaches the abode of Brahma'. Similarly, Padma calls 
upon house-holders to give as much cooked food to ascetics as 
would fill the begging bowl. From very ancient times a house- 
holder was called upon to perform five Yajiias (sacrifices) daily, 
two of which were Sahharana and honouring a guest (Manu 
ni 70) and he was to place food on the ground for persons who 
bad lost caste, who suffered from loathsome diseases, to candalas 
dogs, crows and even insects 1504 ( Ap. Dh S H. 4 9. 5, Manu m 
92). Vide H. of Dh. voL H. pp. 745-747 on Vaisvadeva and 
sannarana. Underlying these provisions was the noble senti- 
ment of universal kindliness and charity, the persistent idea 
that, in spite of social gradations, rules and prejudices dividing

men from eaoh other, one Supreme Light pervades and illumi- 
nates the meanest of creatures and makes the whole world kin. 
This spirit of a householder to regard it as his duty to offer food' 
to all needy persons and particularly to poor and deserving 
students and brahmanas has prevailed almost to the present day, 
though during the last few yeara shortage of food, high prices 
and rationing have undermined it a great deal. 

Then as to gifts to brahmanas. In the first place, it must 
be remembered that all brahmanas were not priests and are not 
priests in modern times. Similarly, all priests in all Indian 
temples and shrines are not brahmanas Temple prieBts are 
comparatively a later institution and in olden times they were 
looked down upon and are regarded as inferior brahmanas even 
in modern times. Manu (III. 152) states that a devalaka (a 
brahmana who performed for remuneration service before the 
image in a temple) was unfit to be invited at a sraddha or to 
officiate in a sacrifice to gods, if he continuously served for three 
years in that capacity. The ideal set before brahmanas from 
very ancient times was of poverty, of plain living and high 
thinking, of abandoning the active pursuit of riches, of devotion 
to the study of the Veda and sastras, of cherishing a high 
culture and of handing down literature and cultural outlook. 
Smrtis like Yaj I. 213 recommend that even if a brahmana be 
fit for receiving a religious gift he should refuse gifts and 
thereby he secures the same worlds that habitual donors secure. 
It was for preserving such high ideals among brahmanas that 
Yaj I 333 prescribes that a king should make gifts of cows, 
gold and land and should bestow on learned brahmanas houses 
and requisites for marriage (maidens, expenses of marriages 
&o ). Vide H. of Dh. vol II. pp. 856-858 where references are 
given to inscriptions containing donations to brahmanas of 
houses and marriage expenses. In these days every body talks 
of the high culture and literary traditions of ancient India. But 
who cultivated the vast Vedio and other Sanskrit literature, 
preserved it and propagated it for several millenia? The answer 
would have to be that it was mostly due to some of the 
brahmanas who stuck to the ancient ideal for thousands of yearB. 
If the Jtgveda can be put forward in these days as the moBt 
ancient of the literary monuments in any Aryan language, who 
preserved its more than ten thousand verses with unparallelled 
care by oral transmission without hardly any variant readings. 
The reply will again have to be that the brahmanas did it by a 



Self-denied bij many brahmanas 93ff 

self-denying ordinance. The Brahmanas had to study the Veda 
with auxiliary lores without* 05 an eye to any ulterior motive, 
but simply as a duty and to understand the meaning thereof, 
they weie to teach the Veda and other lorea without demanding 
beforehand a fee, they had to bring up their own families, per- 
form sacrifices and make gifts themselves. The only substantial 
sources of income were officiating at sacrifices and religious 
rites and receiving gifts. These sources must always have been 
variable, fitful and precarious The brahmanas had no power to 
tax people as in the case of tithes in the West. Nor had they 
a regularly paid hierarchy of deacons, priests, bishops and 
archbishops aa in the Anglican Church Therefore, the 
brahmanas are advised to approach the king or a rich person for 
their livelihood (vide Gautama IX 63 'Yogaksemartham-lsvaram 
adhigaccet). It should be noted that before Buddhism spread 
far and wide the sutras and smrfcis emphasized that religious 
gifts should be made only to a worthy brahmana, learned and 
well-conducted. For example, Apastamba 1506 prescribes 'one 
should invite for dinner in all religious acts brahmanas that are 
pure, that have studied the Veda and that one should distribute 
gifts at a proper time and place, on occasions of purificatory 
rites and when there is a worthy recipient.' To the same effect 
are Vas. Dh. S HI. 8, VI. 30, Manu (HI. 138, 133, IV. 31), Yaj. 
(1. 301), Daksa (III. 36 and 31). Kot every brahmana was in 
those ancient times a proper recipient for a gift, but he had to 
possess qualities of what is called 'pUtra. A few definitions of 
patra may with advantage be cited here. The Anusasana-parva 1507 
has a long passage emphasizing the qualities of a deserving 
brahmana : 'gifts made to good brahmanas that are free from 
anger, tbat are intent on dharma, are devoted to truth and self-

control yield great rewards ; the sages regard that brahmana as 
patra who studies the four Vedas with their angas (auxiliary 
lores like phonetics, grammar &c }, who is active in doing six 
acts (viz abstaining from wine and meat, observing the bounds 
of morality, purity, study of the Veda, sacrifices, making gifts ). 
■ Even a single eminent brahmana endowed with intellect, Vedio 
learning, good conduct and character saves the whole family; 
one should bring from afar a brahmana on hearing that he is 
possessed of good qualities and is approved by good men and 
Bhould welcome him and honour him in all ways' Yaj. furni- 
shes 1588 a brief but striking definition of a worthy brahmana 
'not by Vedio learning alone nor by tapas (austere life) alone 
worthiness arises ; that person is declared to be patra (worthy 
recipient for a religious gift) where both these (i. e Vedic 
learning and tapas ) and good conduct exiBt* Manu provides 
that religious gifts given to a brahmana who has not studied 
the Veda or who is avaricious or deceitful are fruitless and lead 
the donor to hell ( IV. 192-194 ). The BhagavadgltS also ( 17 %% ) 
condemns a gift given to an unworthy person as tamasa ( affected 
by tamas, arising from ignorance or delusion). 

As Buddhism grew in popularity and secured also royal 
support, the brahmanas had to tackle several tasks. They had 
to keep the number of brahmanas at a high level, they had to 
find maintenance for those devoted to the deep study of the 
Veda and they had to make accommodation with prevalent 
Buddhist thoughts by assimilating as many of them as possible 
in their own writings. Every brahmana could not possess the 
memory, the intelligence and the persistent endeavour for long 
years required for memorizing and mastering even his own Veda 
and its subsidiary Literature. If one hundred brahmana families 
were patronized, hardly ten percent of them could have been 
masters of their own Veda, but there was always the possibility 
that those who were not themselves good Vedic scholars might 
have sons, some of whom might turn out to be profound students 
of the Veda, Therefore, the number of brahmanas was to be 
increased and they had to be fed and not to be allowed to fritter 
away energy and time in working for their bread It is mainly 
due to these factors that some of the Puranas contain incessant 
and frantic appeals for gifts to brahmanas.

Difficulties of brahmavas when Buddhism flourished 939 

At the time when most of the Puranas were composed, the 
brahmanas were hemmed in by great difficulties and hostile 
forces. I"rom about the 3rd century B. O. to the 7th century 
AD. Buddhism enjoyed royal patronage under such great 
kings as Asoka, Kaniska and Harsa. Buddhism was not really 
a revolt against caste, but against the sacrificial system, against 
the Veda and its authority to show the way to salvation. 
Buddha did not found a new religion, but he was a great re- 
former of Hinduism. He laid sole stress on moral effort, ahimsa, 
satya &c. which had already been integrated into Hinduism 
and were part of it and which continue to this day to be part of 
Hinduism. Buddha in his first sermon in the deer-park near 
Banaras preached that one who renounced the world should shun 
two extremes 1509 viz. the pursuit of pleasures and the practice of 
useless austerities, that it is the course discovered by him that 
led to wisdom and ninana. He expounded the four noble 
Axioms or Truths (Aryasatyani) viz. suffering (duhkha), the 
cause of suffering 1510 viz. tanha i. e. trsna ( duhkha-samuday a ), 
the suppression of suffering (duhkha-nirodha), and the way that 
leads to the suppression of Buffering ( duhkha-nirodhagamini 
patipada ). This last is the Noble Eight-fold path ( astangiko lsl0a 

1509. For the two extremes to be shunned, vide Dhammacakka-ppava-

margah ) viz. light views, right thoughts or aspirations, right 
speech, right actions, right living, right exertion, right recollec- 
tion ( or mindfulness ), right meditation ( i. e. briefly leading a 
virtuous life) These doctrines preached to all by the noble Buddha 
and his disciples were attractivo as remarked by Ehys Davids, 1511 
particularly to the sudras whose social position was low in the 
Vedic times and also in the days of the smrtis. No one could 
study the Veda m the presence of a sudra, a sudra could not 
perform sacrifices and had to serve the three higher varnaB m very 
anoient times. Almost the same position was assigned to him 
by,Manu ( VJII. 413) viz. that he was created by God for serving 
the brahmana,. though it is doubtful whether this could be or 
was enforced. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 33-36 and pp 154-164 
for the position and disabilities of sudras from the Vedic times 
up to the days of the Smrtis. It should not, however, be supposed 
that all India had become BuddhJBt. Millions still remained 
Hindus. There was the danger and fear that with royal patron- 
age and the attractive features of Buddha's teachings large 
masses might forsake their anoient faith. 

The brahmanas of the times when Buddhism was at its peak 
baJ to strive to keep the banner of the Vedic religion flying, to 
deprive Buddhism of its hold on the masses of the people and 
even on the intelligentsia and to make them stick to the old 
fold. Buddhism itself had changed a great deal m its ideals, 
doctrines, sometime before the beginning of the Christian 
era and for centuries thereafter. Buddha's original doctrines 
were aimed at individual effort and salvation of the individual 
by his own effort and self-culture. Early Buddhist textB deny 
the existence of anything like a soul 1512 and find no place for 

t 1511. Vide his eloquent Intro to S. B. E. vol. XI p. 142 ' Never in 
the history of the world bad a scheme of salvation been put forth so 
simple in its nature, so free from any superhuman agency, so independent 
of, so even antagonistic to the belief in a soul, the belief in God, the hope 
for a future life. Buddha put forth deliberately the doctrine of a salva- 
tion to be ' found here in this life in an inward change of heart to be 
brought about by perseverance in a mere system of self-culture and of self- 
control. That system is called the Noble Eight-fold Path ' 

1312 Vide ' Questions of Milinda ' (II. 3. 6) in S. B. E. vol., XXXV 
pp. 88-89 for a discussion of the doctrine that there is no aoul and pp. 520, 
71-77 for the Buddhist theory alhamma (karma) and for the theory that 
what is reborn is natlta-ritpa { name and form ) and not the soul.^ The 
SaundarSnanda ( B I. ed 16 28-29) says 'gt<ft VW Pljfciltresfrft smnra

Earhj Buddhist texts find no place for God 941 

the idea of God. Though Buddha spoke of Nirvana he did I not 
clearly define it nor does he specify the condition of the indivi- 
dual when he enters nirvana. Asvaghosa compares ™**» *° 
the extinction of a flame ( Saundarananda, ohap. XVI. &&-&)). 
Because the doctrine of karma was deeply rooted in the popular 
mind at the time of Buddha, Buddhism took over that doctrine, 
which, to men who are not Buddhists, appears to he contradic- 
tory of the denial of the existence of a souL The word ' Dhamma 
is used in three senses in the Pali ' Dhammapada' ( which hemg 
mentioned in the questions of Milinda is earlier than the 3nd 
century B. O. ) viz. (1) the truth or law preached hy Buddha, 
( 2 ) thing or form, ( 3 ) way or mode of life. 
' As stated above, the original Buddhism preached hy the 
Buddha and his followers in the first century or two after his 
partmi vana was more or less a strict ethical code for individuals 
who sought salvation from the misery of the world. The three 
central conceptions of very early Buddhism were the three 
refuges ( or ratnas ) Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, the Four 
Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. Gradually a new doctrine 
was evolved 1513 It came to be thought that to care for one's 
own deliverance and spend all efforts thereon was rather selfish, 
that as the Buddha himself out of compassion for suffering 
humanity worked for forty-five years to lead men to salvation 
by his exhortations and sermons, so a Buddhist should prefer to 
put off his own deliverance, should work for the deliverance of 
his fellowmen out of compassion ( karuipi ) for their miserable 
lot and in doing so should be ready to be born again and again, 
should not care for his own salvation and should not be afraid 
of sa7/isara Those holding these latter views deified Buddha, 
taught that Buddhahood was attained by Siddhartha after under- 1 
going numerous births in doing service and rendering help to 
others and that this was a superior code of conduct (Mahayana, 
- the Great Vehicle or Way ) to the selfish code of salvation for an 
individual himself ( which came to be called Hlnayana, the lesser 
Vehiole or Way ) This extra-regarding gospel of Mahayana was 
very attractive and won great support in most countries of Asia. 1514 

1513. H. Kern in his ' Manual of Buddhism * (in the Grundriss p. 122 
holds that Mahayanism is much indebted to the Bhagavad-glta. Compare 
' HVftl fctglpHJuigcpT." 'g&afrigg ^ Tt: II ' V. 25 with the Mahayana view. 

1514. The number of Books on Buddhism is legion. For Mahayana 
Buddhism, vide ' An Introduction to. Mahayana Buddhism' by W. M Mc-

This doctrine of Bodhisattvas (meaning 'beingB destined to 
be enlightened') is not consistent with the gospel of Buddha as 
preached by him in his first sermon at Banaras. There is a 
difference of ideals between HfaaySna and Mahayana. The 
original gospel relies on self-effort and moral regeneration and on 
the elimination of suffering and misery by the extinction of 
all passions and of hankerings or desires and of the desire of

Prof. Kenneth W Morgan (New York, 1936 ) written by several scholars from 
different countries (for both Hinayanaand Mahayana). 

A few books for those who want to know more of Buddhism in general 
and of HInayana and Mahayana are recommended here 'The central 
conception of Buddhism' (London, 1923), 'the conception of Nirvana'

Tantrik Buddhism' by Dr Shashi Bhushan Das-Gupta ( Cat. University,

New York, 1958), 'the Buddha and his Dhamma' by Dr. B. E. 
Ambedkar (1957) in which he refrains from considering Buddhist Texts 
except those in Pali ; * Comparative study of Buddhism and Christianity 
by Prof. F. MasutanI (Tokyo, 1957), The Mahayana-sutralankara of 
Asanga ( ed. by Prof S. Levi) summarises In two verses (I. 9-10) the points 
( five) on which the two schools are In conflict. It-slng's ' Records of the 
Buddhist religion' translated byDr J. Takakusu (Oxford, 1896) surprisingly 
enough states (p. 15) 'These two systems are perfectly in accord with the 
noble doctrine. Both equally conform to truth and lead us to Nirvana '. 
Buddha at least ignored (if he did not positively deny) God, ho denied the 
individual soul and Eternity, he did not emphasize the most vital Upa- 
nisad teaching viz. ' anando brahmeti vyajanat '. He imagined salvation as 
a state of absolute quiescence and therefore regarded ordinary life as misery 
and asserted that salvation may be attained even in this very life He did not 
claim to be God, but a human being There are various kinds of Mahayana 
doctrines and great diversity of definitions It may generally be said that 
works professing to teach Mahayana practically forsake the ideal of a human 
Buddha, preach the worship of Buddha and future Buddhas, and assert that 
Nirvana cannot be attained by the ancient method, that salvation cannot 
come in this very life but after centuries and aeons of the practice of virtue 
and helping others. 

Mantrayana and Vajrayana are said by some to be branches of Maha- 
yana, about the latter of which a goad deal will bo said in the next section. 
According to Bhiksu Rahula Sankrtyayana, Vajrayana ( 700-1200 A.D ) la 
a synonym of Mahayana (400-700 A D. ) and merely the ulterior develop- 
ment of it (vide p. 211 of the paper 'L' Origine du Vajrayana otLes84 
Siddbas' in J. A. vol. 225 (1934) pp. 209-230. 



Original doctrines of Buddha 9*3 

Hfc«» itself Buddha's original teaching regarded it as a waste 
of time to ponder over such questions as « Have I existed during 
Se ages that are past or have I not? Shall I exist during the 
ages of the future? Do I after all exist or am I not? _ The 
Sabbasavasutta (9-13) says that a wise man walking in the 
noble eightfold path understands what things ought to be con- 
sidered and what things ought not to be considered Vide S.B.B. 
vol SI pp 398-300. Buddhism brought half of Asia under its 
influence not only by its promise of salvation to all by self-help, 
but more so by its teachings of profound tenderness, of active 
charity, of goodness and gentleness. Mahayana laid great stress 
on doing good to all and on bhakti. Both the original teaching 
of Hlnayana and the Mahayana teaching are attractive in their 
own way. 

Buddhism insisted on the five silas™ 6 that were binding on 

all Buddhists viz. prohibition of injury to and destruction of 

life, of theft, of sexual impurity, of lying and of intoxicating 

liquors. Five more precepts ( which together with the preceding 

five were called Dasasiksapadas) were added for Buddhist priests, 

via. prohibition of eating at forbidden hours, of attending 

wordly amusements such as dancing, song, music and shows, of 

the use of unguents and ornaments, of the use of a large or 

ornamented couch and of the receiving of gold and silver. 

About the site it is clear that they were adopted from the 

ancient Upanisadic and Dharmasutra teachings. The Cfhandogya 

narrates how Asvapati, king of Kekaya, boasted before five 

great householders and theologians ' in my 1517 kingdom there is 

no thief, no miser, no drunkard, no man without a fire-altar in 

his house, no ignorant person, no adulterer, much less an 

adulteress'. The same Upanisad 1518 quotes an ancient verse ' a 

man who steals gold, who drinks liquor, who dishonours his 

guru's bed, who kills a brabmaua — 'these four fall and a fifth 

also that associates with any one of these four." It will be shown 

1515. That destruction of desires Is nirvana is stated in Ratanasutta 
14 and the simita mentioned is that of a lamp being extinguished (by lack 
of oil) ,

a little later how ahimsa was emphasized even in the TJpanisads. 
Thus ahwisa, non-stealing, sexual purity, truthfulness had 
already been emphasized in the oldest TJpanisads That an 
ascetic 1519 had to give up all property and beg for keeping body 
and soul together is made clear by Br. TJp. HI. 5 1 and IV. 4. 22, 
Jabalopanisad 5, Gautama III. 10-13, Vasistha X The other 
five precepts for priests such as not receiving gold or Bilver or 
giving up unguents, flowers, dancing, singing and musio are 
laid down by Gautama 1520 II 19 and III. 4, Vasistha X. 6 &o. 
for Vedic students and ascetics Vide H. Kern (in 'Manual of 
Indian Buddhism, Grundriss p. 70) who remarks that the 
superior morality for monks is nothing else but the rule of life 
for the diAja in the 4th asrama, when he is a yait and all the 
details were taken from the Dhaima-sutras and Dharmasastras. 

Ahimsa — The Mahabharata and the Puranas lay great 
emphasis on ahimsa ( not harming or giving pain to a living 
creature). The TJpanisads too emphasized ahimsa The 
Ghandogya 1521 does so in several passages. In III, 17 4 it sayB 
'tapaa, charity, straight-forwardness, ahimsa, speaking the 
truth — these are the fees of this ( sacrifioe without ceremonial ) '■ 
While describing how the person who has attained true know- 
ledge of the Self does not return ( to this samsara), the Ghandogya 
says that ' he causes no pain to any creature except at tirthas '. 
The Br. TJp. ( V. 2. ) says how Prajapati told the gods, the asuras

fulness, absence of stealing, charity, forbearance, self-control, 

quiescence of senses, absence of poor spirit or weakness, purity, 

tapas — this is the tenfold dharma applicable to all varnas. The 

Padma Bays : not by ( the study of ) the Veoas, nor by gifts nor 

by tapas, nor by sacrifices do men who kill creatures reach the 

goal of heaven ; ahimsa is the highest dharma, the highest tapas 

and the highest charity — this is what the sages always say; men 

that axe compassionate treat flies, reptiles, stinging inseots, 

lice and the like and human beings as themselves. Matsya goes 

so far as to state ; great sages do not commend sacrifice in which 

there is killing; by donating grains of corn gathered in a field, 

roots, fruits, vegetables, vessel for carrying water according to 

their ability, Bages practising austerities became established in 

heaven; absence of hatred and greed, self-restraint, compassion 

towards all beings, control of senses, oelibaoy, tapas, tenderness, 

forbearance and firmness— this is the root of the ancient dharma, 

which is difficult to accomplish. The Brahmanda ( n. 31. 35 

' tasmad-ahimsa" dharmasya dvaram-uktam maharsibhih ' ) 

says that great sages have declared that ahimsa is the door of 

dharma. The Padma ( V. 43. 38 ) says ' there is no d&na nor 

tapas equal to ahimsa '. It is interesting to note that the Matsya 

and Brahmanda regard ahimsa as ' sanatana dharma * and 

condemn animal sacrifices. The Xurma 1525 provides ' ahimsa, 

truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy and non-possession of wealth- 

these are briefly declared yamas that produce purity of mind 

among men. The great sages declare that ahimsa consists in 

oauBing no pain to all beings at all times by thought, word or

deed. There is no dharma superior to ahimsa, no happiness 
higher than ( the practice of ) ahimsa; the -in jury ( to life } that 
is caused according to ( Vedio ) precepts i3 declared to be ahimsa.' 
The Upanisads commended a qualified ahimsa, while the original 
Pali hooks like the Samanna-phala-sutta forbad injury to all 
living beings. Most of the Puranas, in order to convince the 
masses that they did not lag behind the Buddhist preachings, 
generally insist upon unqualified ahimsa. Time brings about 
strange changes. Professing Buddhists in Ceylon, China Japan 
and many other countries have no objection to partaking of fish 
and meat, while following the insistent advice of the Puranas, 
millions of Indian people ( not only brahmanas but also others 
like vaisyas and sudras if Vaisnavas ) have been strict vege- 
tarians for centuries, though Buddhism vanished from India 
centuries ago. 

It may be noted, however, that some of the Puranas are 
against carrying the doctrine of ahimsa' to extremes. The 
Brahmanda and Vayu both say that there is no sin, great or 
small, in killing a person ( e. g. a tyrant or a desperado ), when 
many will live in happiness by his death. 1526 

Purta — The Puranas lay the greatest emphasis on what is 
called puriadharma, works of public utility, charity, social 
service and the relief of the poor and distressed. The word 
Istapurta occurs in the Bgveda once lsS7 * May you be united in 
the highest heaven with your pitas ( ancestors ), with Yama and 
with istapurta * ( merit acquired by sacrifices and works of public 
utility ). The word i$a occurs several times in Bg- ( 1. 162. 15, 
1. 164. 15, X. 11. 2, X. 82. 2 ), but the meaning is not certain 
except in Bg. X. 11. 2 where it appears to mean ' sacrifice *. 
Purta also occurs in Bg. "VX 16. 18 and VUL 48. 21, but the 
meaning is not certain. ' Istapurta ' occurs in several Upanisads,

The Ohandogya states 108 'But they who, living in a village, 
practise ( a life of ) sacrifices, works of public utility and alms- 
giving reach toward smoke &o. '. Similarly, the Prasna-upanisad 
asserts ' those, who practise the ( mode of ) sacrifices and works 
of public utility as activities to be engaged in, reaoh only the 
world of the Moon, and it is these that again return to this 
world '. The Mundaka says ' deluded people regarding sacrifices 
and works of public utility as the best do not know ( recognize ) 
any other higher good; having enjoyed ( their reward) on the top 
of heaven, they again enter this world or even a lower one '. 1SM 
Manu speaks of ' ista ' and * purta ' and recommends that one 
should always practise with a pleased heart sacrificial gifts and 
gifts of the purta kind according to one's ability on securing a 
deserving brahmana. The Amarakosa defines 'ista' as sacrifices 
and 'purta' as works Buoh as digging a well or tank. The 
MSrkandeya 1S3 ° defines them as follows ' Maintaining the saored 
fires, tapas, truthfulness, study of the Veda, hospitality and 
Vaisvadeva-these are called ista ; digging wells and tanks and 
building temples and distribution of food to those that need it— 1 
these are declared to be purta. The Agnipurana has similar 
versea The Padma (VI 243. 10-14) cites the following as 
dharmakarya (religious works); temples of Visnu and Siva, 
tanks, weUs, lotus ponds, forest of vata, pippala, mango, kakkola, 
jambu and nimba trees, flower garden, distribution of food from 
morning to sunset, water distribution outside towns &o. The 
Skanda 1331 says : the term 'purta' is applied in the dharma- 
sastras to the erection of temples, construction of tanks, ponds 
and wells, laying out parks. Padma ( VI, 344. 34-35 ) says that 
those who build monasteries, cow stables, houses of rest on roads,

dwellings for ascetics, cottages for the poor and helpless, 
extensive house for Veda study, houses for brahmanas, enter the 
world of Indra ( i. e. heaven ). Atri says 1532 that Ista and FSrta 
are dharma common to all dvijas; a sudra is entitled to perform 
purta-dharmas but not Vaidika rites ( i. e. sacrifices ). The 
Anusasana-parva ( chap. 58 ) describes how parks should be laid 
out and tanks constructed with trees on their banks. But the 
Varahapurana and some smrtis went so far as to declare that 
a man secures only heaven by ista, but he secures moksa ( final 
release from samsara ) by purta * 533 . 

Sometimes the Puranas express ideas that might strike us 

as rather modern, when they put forward social • service and 

removal of suffering and distress as the highest dharma- In the 

Markandeya 153 * a king solemnly states 'men do not obtain that 

happiness in heaven or in the world of BrahmS, which springs 

from giving relief to distressed beings. Sacrifices, gifts, tapas 

do not conduce to the relief here and in the next world of that 

man whose heart is not set on relieving the distressed'. The 

Visnu recommends ' a wise man should say (and do) that alone 

by thought, word and deed which would be for the benefit of 

creatures here and hereafter'. The Skanda-purana (Kaslkhanda) 

avers 'adversities of those good men in whose heart doing good 

to others is awake (i. e. aotive) vanish and prosperity comes to 

them at every step. That purity is not secured by baths at holy 

places, that reward is not obtained by numerous gifts, that 

(result) is not obtained by severe austerities, that is obtained 

by doing good to others. After churning all extensive dicta the 

conclusion reached is this viz. there is no dharma higher than 

doing good to others and there is no sin greater than harming

strives for the good of others is fruitful (blessed); fire, water, 
the Sun, the earth and various kinds of crops exist for the 
benefit of others, and particularly the good (exist for others' 
benefit)'. 

It is surprising that the Bhagavata avers what is in advance 
of modern socialistic dootrines ' men have ownership over only 
that much as would fill their belly; he who thinks as his own 
what is more than tbat is a thief and deserves punishment 
(assuch). 1 * 35 

Bhakti — The Puranas lay very great emphasis on bhakti 
(religion of loving faith in God). Tbis is not the place to dilate on 
the history of the cult of Bhakti from the earliest times to modern 
days. For that purpose there are special treatises ( some of which 
are noted below) that maybe consulted. But a few words on 
bhakti in general may be said here before going into the ques- 
tion as to what the Puranas have to say thereon. Traoes of the 
doctrine of bhakti may be discovered even in the Bgvedio hymns 
and mantraB, some of which are full of loving faith in God, 
particularly in some of the hymns and verses addressed to 
Varuna and also to Indra. A few examples may be cited. ' All 
my thoughts 1536 (or hymns) praise Indra in unison, seeking 
light, longing for him, as wives embrace their husband, their 
fair young lover, they (thoughts) embrace him (Indra), the 
divine giver of gifts'; 'your friendship 1537 (with your devotee) 
is indestructible (everlasting); to him who desires a cow, you 
become a cow, to him who longs for a horse, may you be a horse;' 
'O Indra, you are far better (or richer) than my father or my 
brother who does not feed me; (you) and my mother, O Vasu, 
are equal and protect (me) for (conferring) richeB and favours'; 
' You gave to Kakslvat, who offered a hymn and Soma libation 
to you and who had grown old, Vrcaya, who was a young

woman; you became the wife of Vrsanasva; all these (favours) 
of yours deserve to be loudly proclaimed during the offerings of 
soma libations'; 'you who, shining brilliantly, come to each 
house assuming the form of a small man, (OIndral) drink this 
Soma juice (produced) by being crushed with my teeth and 
mixed with fried grains, gruel, cake and laud'. Compare Eg. 
HL 43. 4, X. 42. 11, X 112. 10 (in all of which Indra is called 
*sakha'friend)andI.104.9, VII. 32.26 (in both Indra is said 
to be like a father). ItwiU be clear from these passages that 
the Vedic sages had reached the stage of sakhya-bhakti, that the 
sages believed that Indra was like a mother, that he assumed the 
form of a wife for the sake of a devotee, that Indra partook soma 
juice from a devotee who, in the absence of the proper imple- 
ments for crushing soma stalks, extracted soma juice from soma 
stalks crushed with the devotee's own teeth. These stories in 
the far-off ages of the Rgveda remind us of the stories in the 
works of the medieval ages about Rama having accepted badarq 
fruit from a Sabarl (Bhil woman) devotee who first tasted them 
with her teeth to see whether they were sweet or sour and the story 
of the God Vithoba of Pandharpur, having assumed the form of 
a mahUr (an untouchable) and paid up to the Moslem king of 
Btjapur the money equivalent to the price of corn which, DamSji 
(a great devotee), who was in charge of the royal granary, 
allowed people distressed by famine to take away. Some mantras 
addressed to Varuna show the same kind of sakhya-bhakti. 
Vasislha^te pra ys «0 Varuna ! what is that great offence ( com- 
mitted by me ) on account of which you desire to harm me, your 
friend and bard; declare that to me, O invincible and self-willed 
God, so that ( after propitiating you ) I shall be free from sin and 
may be able quickly to approach you with adoration'; 'where 
are those friendships of ours ( of you and me ) which we safely 
enjoyed in former times, O self-wffled Varuna ? ; I ( then ) went to 
your big dwelling house that has a thousand doors ; whatever 
oaence we mortals commit against the divine hosts, O Varuna, 
whatever laws of yours we may have violated in our ignorance 
(or Heedlessness), do not, O God, harm us on account of that sin'. 
it is remarkable that in t he Bgveda there is a verse in whioh

there is an apotheosis 1538 of ? namas ' ( namaskara, adoration or 
homage ) ; ' Adoration itself is mighty, I offer service with adora- 
tion; adoration upholds the heaven and the earth; adoration to 
the gods, adoration rules these godB, whatever sin is committed 
( hy me ) I worship it away with adoration'. 

Though the word * hhakti * does not occur in the principal 
ancient TJpanisads, the doctrine of the bhakti schools that it is 
God's grace alone that saves the devotee is found in the Katha 
and Mundaka TJpanisads, viz. ' this Supreme Soul is not to be 
attained by expositions ( of a teacher ) nor by intelligence, nor 
by much learning; He is to be attained by him alone whom the 
Supreme Soul favours, to him this Supreme Soul discloses His 
form. ,1539 This emphasizes the doctrine that God's Grace alone 
brings salvation to the devotee. The SvetfEsvataropanisad employs 
the word bhaktt in the same sense in which it is used in the Glta 
and 1640 other works on bhakti. 'These matters declared (here) 
reveal themselves to that high-souled person who has the highest 
faith in God and the same faith in his guru as in God '. The 
same XTpanisad emphasizes a doctrine of the bhakti school in 
' I, desirous of moksa (liberation from samsara ), surrender myself 
as my refuge to that God who in former times created (established) 
BrahmS, who transmitted to him ( BrahmS ) the Vedas, and wHo 
illuminates the intellect of the individual soul '. 

The word ' prapadye * in the Svetasvatara serves as the basis 
of the doctrine of 'prapatti* jn the Vaisnavite system such as 
that of Ramanuja. 

But among the original sources of the Bhakti cult are the 
Narayanlya section ( chapters 335-351 of Cltrasala ed. = or. ed. 
322-339) of the Santiparva and the BhagavadgltS. For the

Megasthenes and references to Krsya 953 

antiquity of Krsna worship (vide pp. 129-131 above). Megasthenea 
states that Heracles ( Harikrsna? ) was worshipped by Soursenoi 
( Saurasenas ) on the banks of Jobarea ( Yamuna ) and had two 
cities Methora ( MathurS, ) and Oleisbora ( Krsnapura ? ). In the 
Narayanlya it is stated ( in chap. 335. 17-24 ) that king TTparicara 
Tasu was a devotee ( hhakta ) of Narayana, that he worshipped 
the Lord of Gods according to the sattvata rules that were 
proclaimed by the Sun, that he (Vasu) consecrated his kingdom, 
wealth, wife and horses to God, thinking that they all belonged 
to the Bhagavat ( the Adorable One ) and performed sacrificial 
rites according to the Sattvata rules. 

In the Santiparva, Satvata and Pancaratra are identified 1541 
and it is said that the seven sages called ' citrasikhandin ' ( lit. 
whose top-knots on the head were bright or wonderful) viz. 
Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Eratu and Vasistha, 
proclaimed the (Pancaratra) sastra and God Narayana told them 
that the sastra would be authoritative in the world and that king 
Vasu would learn the sastra from Brhaspati to whom it would 
come by degrees from the seven sages. Chapter 336 of Santi 
declares that to the north of the Milky Sea there was territory 
called Svetadvlpa, where dwelt devotees of Farayana who were 
called«« 'Ekantin* and Pancaratra is called ' Ekanta-dharma '. 
A peculiar doctrine of the Pancaratra school is that of the four 
Wuhas (murhs or forms) via. that the Supreme Person is 
Vasudeva, the individual soul is Sankarsana, Pradyuma is mind 
and springs from Sankarsana and Aniruddha is ahankara and 
originates from Pradyumna. « a It is this doctrine of the four 
forms of Vasudeva, each springing from the preceding, that is 
refuted according to Sankara in the Brahmasutra II. 2 42-45 
The Santi 348. 8 expressly refers to the Glta as already declared

1546. Why the cult of Vasudeva was called PaSoaratra has not boon 
Satisfactorily explained anywhere in the English Histories of Indian Philo- 
sophy so far as I know. The name leads to the inference that the cult has 
something to do with five matters. But why is the word riitra or kala 
used? That is the difficulty. In Santi 336. 46 (cr ed. 323. 42) Panca- 
ratra is referred to as ' Pancakala ' (8Ra irenira^RSwPaRr^. > Several

Narayana taught Ananta, Gaiuda, Viivaksena, Brahma and Rudra; ( 2 ) 
The Parama-samhita (31. 19) states that God imparted this doctrine in five 
nights to four sages, Sanatkumara, Sanaka, Sanandana and Sanatana, (3) 
this cult blackened [fain is dark) five teachings, vU. *rre*r, l"JT, TJgTO,

Vaisnavas viz. tapa ( branding on tho arm and other limbs), pundra (up- 
right lines made on the forehead with some colouring substance), nama 
( names of Vasudeva ), mantra ( like ■ On namo NarSyanaya ), yaga ( worship 
of images of Vasudeva ). The Alwar literature mentions fivefold nature viz. 
Para and the others. Vide K. C. Varadachari's paper on ' Somo contri- 
butions of Slwars to tho philosophy of bhakti ' m Silver Jubilee vol. of 
BOEI p, 621*, The Paramasamblta (I. 3S-40 G. O. S. ed ) states that tho 
five great Elements, the five Tanmatras, Abamkara, Buddhi and avyakla, 
( five categories or Tattvas of the Sankhya ) are the night ( as it wore ) of the 
Purusa and therefore this sastra ( which propounds how to bo free from the 
meshes of these five ) is called Pancaratra

authority, while others like Apararka p. 13 and ^ribhaaaprakaia 
( p 23 ) do not-aocept it as thoroughly Vedio hut only partially. 

In the Vedantasutra*« there are four sutras dealing with' 
the Bhagavata or Paficaratra system.. The great Acaryas are 
not agreed upon their interpretation, Sankara saying that all 
the four sutras refute some tenets of the Bhagavatas, Eamanuja 
saying that the first two sutras ( out of four ) contain refutation 
of the Bhagavata doctrine and the other two do not. Sankara- 
carya makes it clear that the doctrines of the Bhagavatas that 
the Supreme God Vasudeva is the Highest Truth, that He 
assumes four forms, that the worship of Vasudeva consists m 
continuous single-minded contemplation of Vasudeva are not the 
targets for attack, that what is refuted is the doctrine of the 
Bhagavatas that the individual soul called Sankarsana by them 
springs from Vasudeva, that Pradyumna ( mind ) arises from 
Sankarasana and that Aniraddha (ahamkara) arises from 
Pradyumna. It appears from Sankara's remarks B4B on H. 2. 45 
that in his day Sandilya was supposed to have promulgated the 
Bhagavata or Pancaratra sastra, because he did not find the

hell-residence.

highest bliss in all the four Yedaa In the Dronaparva ( 29. 
26-29 ) there is another and different reference to the four murtis 
of the Supreme for the benefit of the worlds viz one performs 
tapaa ( asuterities ) on the earth, the 2nd has an eye on the 
world's good and evil deeds ; the third comes to the world in a 
human form and does such acts as men perform; the 4th slumbers 
for a thousand years and when it arises from slumber confer* 
the highest boons on tho39 who deserve them. 

It may be noted that even in the Mahabharata Narada's 
name is connected with Paficaratra It i3 said ' this very secret 
doctrine, connected with the four Vedas, having the benefit of 
SSnkhya and Yoga and spoken of as Paficaratra, was (originally} 
uttered by the lip3 of ITarayana and was again communicated 
by^arada. 1349 

Other great sources of the cult of bhakfci are the Bhagavad- 
glta, which is expressly mentioned in the Narayanlya section 
( 348. 8 = cr. ed. 336. 8 ), the BhagavatapurSna and the Tisnu- 
purSna. The Gits contains the words bhakti and bhakla several 
dozens of time3. It may be stated here that the so-called Marada- 
bhaktisutras, ISTarada-paficaratra, the Sandilya-bhakti-sutra and 
the several extant Pancaratra-samhitas so far published are all 
later than the Gita. 1553 The Agnipuraria gives the names of 25 
works on Paficaratra quoted in the note below. l5S1 The Mahesvara-

tantra names 25 Paficaratra tantras promulgated by Visnu, 
which are condemned therein as having no truth ( 26. 16 s ff. ). 

There is an extensive Literature on the Bhakti cult. Only 
a few of the important works in Sanskrit, their translations and 
works in English are noted here. Barth, Hopkins, Keith, Dr. 
R. G Bhandarkar and others have propounded different theories 
as to what Krsna represented, how he was identified with Visnu 
who appears to be another name of the Sun in the Rgveda and 
oame to be regarded as the highest God in Brahmana times ( as 
in Ait Br. 'Agnir-vai devanSm avamah, Visnuh paramab. ) and 
came to be identified with sacrifice ( Tajfio vai Visnuh ). When 
Krsna, the friend of the Pandavas was identified with the 
Supreme Spirit, the full-fledged doctrine of Avataras appeared 
as in the Glta. The important works on bhakti are : The 
2fsrayanlya seotion of the Santiparva ( chapters 332-351 
in the Citrasala edition and chap. 322-339 of the critical 
edition); the Bhagavadglta, ; several Puranas, the most important 
being Visnu and Bhagavata; J* 52 the Bhaktisutra of Sandilya 
with the bhasija of Svapnesvara (ed. by Jivananda, Calcutta 1876) 
and translati on of both these ( in B. I. series ) by E. B. Cowell 

1532 It is remarkable that the Bhagavata, which is practically the most 
important or sole authority for all great medieval Vaisnava teachers like 
Vallabha and Caitanya and their disciples, is not quoted anywhere by Rama- 
nuja (who was born in &ke 1049 i e 1127 A. D.) in his bhasya on the 
Brahmasutras, when he quotes over a hundred verses from the Visnupurana 
in the same. In fact, in the Vedarthsangraha Ramanuja states that in the 
same way as the section ( auuvaka ) on Narayana among all sruti texts serves 
to expound the special aspect of highest Brahma so the Visnupurana also 
defines a spedal aspect of the highest Brahma and that all 'other Puranas 
should be so interpreted as not to be in confUct with it Sot wafe ht?Ht

paranuTaktirlsvare'. This may be interpreted in two ways 'the 
highest form of bhakti is affection fixed on God* or 'bhakti is 
the highest affection fixed on God'. Svapnesvaia, the author 
of a bhasya on Sandilya, prefers the first and Narada-bhakti- 
autra, Tilak and others favour the second. Svapnesvara explains 
that in general 'bhakti' means 'affection fixed on a being that 
is to be won over or worshipped', but that in this sastra it means 
'a particular state of the mind having the Supreme Lord as its 
object' and quotes a verse from the Visnupurana uttered by the 
great devotee Prahlada ' May that fixed (or unwavering) love, 
which the ignorant (or unreflecting) people feel for worldly 
objects, never depart from my heart, ever remembering you '. 
The Glta employs the word' prtti' (affection) and conveys that 
the word 'bhakti' is derived from the root 'bhaj' to resort to. 
'Those whose minds are on me, whose lives are offered to me, 
who instruct each other, who speak of me, are always contented 
and happy. On these who are continuously devoted to me and 
serve me with affection, I bestow that knowledge by which they 
reach me*. Svapnesvara explains that the word 'anurakti' 
(with prefix 'anu') is employed to convey that the affection for 
God arises after the devotee secures knowledge of the greatness 
and other attributes of the Bhagavat (Adorable One). In the 
Visnupurana the word 'anuraga' is used for 'bhakti", where, 
after describing the ascent of Rama and his brothers to heaven, 
it says that the people of the capital of Kosala who had deep 
affection for those incarnate parts of the Bhagavat (Visnu), 
having their minds fixed on them, reached the position of 
residence in the same world with them. Sandilya further ,ss3 
says that there is the teaching that theie is immortality for 
nun who abides in Him. In the Chandogya Up. it is said 'He 
wHo abides in brahman reaches immortality'. The idea is that 
immortality being the promise of abiding in God, there will be 
no indifference in the effort to know God or in the effort to

cultivate highest affeotion for God. It may be noticed that the 
autras of Narada appear to be a mere paraphrase of Sandilya's 
aphorisms 1K * Sandilya further (sutra 7 ) provides that bhakti, 
like knowledge, is not an action because it does not follow an 
effort of the will and that ( sutra 9 ) it is different from jftana, as 
the Glta refers to self-surrender being attained by one having 
knowledge after many births (Glta VH. 19). 

Our ancestors had a great penchant for classifications, 
divisions and sub-divisions. Bhakti is divided into laufaki (of 
the common people), Vatdiki (laid down by the Veda) and 
adhyStmiki (philosophical), as in Padma V. 15. 164 ; or manasi 
(mental), vaciki (verbal) and kayiki (done with the body, such 
aB fasts, vratas &c ) in Padma V. 15. 165-168; into Sattvikl, 
EajasI and TamasI (as in BhSgavata HX 29. 7-10 and Padma 
VX 126. 4-11), into best, middling and inferior as in 
Brahmanda m.» 555 34. 38-41 ). 

JPrapattt (self-surrender) is distinguished from bhakti in 
works of the Ramanuja and of other Vaisnava schools. It consists 
of five points 1556 viz. resolution to yield (to God's will), the 
abandoning of opposition, faith that God will protect (the 
devotee), praying to God to save the devotee, and a feeling of 
helplessness shown by casting one's soul on Him. Bhakti has 
as synonyms the words' dhyana', 'upasana' &c. and is subsidiary 
to prapath. The Glta explicitly makes no such distinction. In 
Glta n. 7 Arjuna speaks of himself as 'prapanna' (who has 
approached or surrendered himself for salvation). The final 
advice at the end of the Glta enjoins what is called prapattt in 
later works 'On me fix your mind, become my devotee, sacrifice

to you truly, you are dear to me. Giving up all (dharmas) duties, 

come to me as your ( only ) refuge ; I shall release you from ali 

sins; do not grieve'."^ Vide also Gita VEI. 14,15 and XV. 4 

for other instances of the use of the root 'pra-pad '. The theory 

propounded in the Gita and other works on hhakti was that 

bhaktiled on to 'prasada* (favour or grace) of God "which 

enables the devotee to attain moksa. 153s The Gita (18. 56, 58, 

62) -says 'a man, though always performing all actions,' but 

-solely depending- on me,- obtains an imperishable and eternal 

place through myfavour; if you fix your mind on me, you will 

get over all difficulties through my favour; go to Him as the 

refuge with all your heart, O Arjuna, through His grace you will 

attain the highest peace and an everlasting abode.' In the 

Visnupurana Prahlada 1559 is told by the Adorable One 'as your 

mind is firmly and devotedly fixed on me you will by my favour 

attain the highest bliss'. The idea of God's grace occurs both 

in the Hatha and Svetasvatara TTpanisada : 1S50 ' The Self, smaller 

than the small and greater than the great, is hidden in the heart 

of the creatures , a man who is free from willing anything and 

free from grief sees the greatness of the Self through the favour 

of the Creator \ •*>• •* ' 

There is a great difference between the Gtta and the

characteristic of the Narayaniya seotion, is totally absent and 
further even the names of Sankarsana, Pradyumna and Ani- 
ruddha do not occur in the Glta. In my opinion the Glta is the 
older of the two, as it propounds the general dootrine of bhakti, 
while the Panoaratra dootrine in the Narayaniya is only one of 
the several bhakti sohools. Moreover, the Narayaniya section 
represents that Glta had already been proclaimed and that the 
knowledge brought from Svetadvlpa by Harada is the same as 
that declared in the Hariglta ( chap. 346. 10-11, 348. 53-54 ). 
Santi ( 348. 55-57 ) mentions that there was only one vyuha or 
there were two, three or four and that the Ekantins attached 
great importance to ahimsa. Besides, the worship of Vasudeva 
is older than Panini, since 1562 Panini teaches the formation of 
the word Vasudevaka as meaning ' one whose object of worship 
is Vasudeva '. Vide Dr Bhandarkar's ' Vaisnavism, Saivism &c. ' 
paragraphs 2-10 (pp. 3-19 of vol IV of the collected works) for 
the antiquity of Vasudeva worship. The general view of most 
medieval writers on Dharmasastra about Panoaratra is 
represented by the Parijata quoted in the K. R. that the Panoa- 
ratra 1563 and Pfisupata sastras are authoritative only so far as 
they are not opposed to the Vedas. This was the view of the 
Sutasamhita also, on which a commentary was composed by the 
famous Madhavacarya. 

In some Puranas the word Vasudeva is not derived 1561 from 
Vasudeva ( as the son of Vasudeva ) but from the root ' vas ' to 
dwelL ' Vasudeva is so called because all beings dwell in the 
Highest Self and Vasudeva dwells in beings as the soul of all '. 
Compare Glta 9. 29 ' I am alike to all beings ; none is odious to 
me nor dear, but those who worship me with faith dwell in me

Meaning of 'bhagavat' and 'bhagataia" 96$ 

The word bhagaiat calls for a brief notice. It waa generally 
applied to Vasudeva. The Visnupurana says ' The word bhaga 
is applied to the six qualities collectively viz. fulness of sway, 
manliness ( or energy ), glory, auspioiousness, knowledge and 
indifference to wordly objects. This noble word bhagavan applies 
to Vasudeva who is the Highest Brahma and to no one else '. 156s 
The VisnupuraDa 1566 further states that the word ' bhagavat ' 
may be applied secondarily to others on the ground of possessing 
special qualities " that person may be oalled ' bhagavan ', who 
knows about the creation and dissolution ( of the world ), about 
the origin and final destiny of beings, and knows what is vidya 
and andya (nescience). Knowledge, strength, power, swayt 
manliness, splendour — all these in their entirety, excluding the 
three gunas ( and their effects ) that are to be avoided, are 
expressed by the word bhagavat". Bhagavata is one who 
worships * Bhagavat ' ( i, e. Vasudeva ). This is an ancient word. 
It occurs in the Besnagai column inscription ( of the 2nd century 
B O. ) of Heliodora, a Greek of Taksasila and ambassador of 
Antalikita, who calls himself a bhagavata (adevotee of Vasudeva); 
vide above p. 516 n. 742 and ' Indo-Qreeks ' by Prof. A. K. Uarain 
( 1957 ), where at end he gives the full Besnagara Ins. of nine 
lines and its reading ( Plate VI ). It appears that 'bhagavat' waa 
rarely applied to Siva also. The Svetasvatara Upanisad speaks 1567 
of Siva as 'bhagavan*. Patau jali in his bhSsya on Panini 
V. 2. 76 speaks of Sivabhagavata. 1568 In the GhosQndl stone

Inscription 1569 in Sanskrit (near Nagarl in the Chitorgadh 
District of Bajputana } there is a reference to both Sankarsana 
and Vasudeva as bhaqauit and it calls them Sarvesvara ( about 
200 B. 0. ), while the Besnagara inscription speaks of Vasudeva 
alone and Heliodora calls himself bhagavata In some'early 
records such as the Pikira grant of Simhavarman ( E. I. vol VII. 
p. 161 ) and m Gupta Inscription No. 4 (at p 27 ) Simhavarman 
and Candragupta ( II ) son of Samudragupta are called

Three mar gas ( paths ) are spoken of in ancient works viz. 
karmamarga, bhaktimarga and jnanamarga It is necessary to 
say here something about the path of bhalth and that of jvava. 
Both these paths are deemed to lead to the same goal, viz. 
moksa. The mode of approach in the two is, however, different. 
In the path of knowledge ( or avyaktopasana ) it is not bare book 
knowledge of brahman as the Supreme Soul and as mi guna that 
will lead to moksa, for that purpose what is required is the 
brahmi-sthiti (state of identifying oneself with fcrcftma) men- 
tioned in Glta II. 72. This condition can be secured only by 
great efforts and long practice as described in Glta II. 55 and 
the,following Verses. In the path of knowledge whatever actions 
the person concerned may do are brahmarpana, as described in 
Glta IV. 18-21 In the path of bhakti the bhakta resigns him- 
self to God's grace and whatever he does he consigns to the God 
worshipped by. him such as Vasudeva (saguva and vyakta). 
Arjuna.asks the Lorda question in Glta XII. 1 'of the worship-

best know devotion'. The reply given in XIL 2-7 ia ' those who, 
being constantly devoted and possessed of the highest devotion, 
worship me with a mind fixed on me are regarded by me as the 
most "devoted. But those who, restraining the group of the 
senses, and with a mind equable to all, meditate on the indes- 
cribable, indestructible, unperceived (Principle), which is all- 
pervading, inconceivable, unconcerned, immoveable, and 
constant, they, devoted to the good of all beings, certainly 
attain to me. In the case of those whose minds are attached to 
the unperceived ( Principle or Spirit) the trouble is much greater, 
since the unperceived goal is attained by embodied beings with 
difficulty. In the case of those, however, who dedicating all 
their actions to me and regarding me as their highest goal 
worship me, meditating on me with a devotion towards none 
beside me and whose minds are placed on me, I, without delay, 
become their deliverer from the ocean of sathsara and. death'. 
In ohapter 9 the path of bhakti is spoken of in these terms * it is 
the chief among vidyas (lores), chief among mysteries; it is the 
best means of sanotification; it can be directly apprehended, it 
is in accordance with dharma, imperishable and easy to practise*. 
According to the Glta, therefore, the path of bhakti is easier' 
than the path of knowledge. 

The Bhagavata says that bhakti is ninefold 1571 viz. hearing 
about Visnu, repeating his name, remembering him, worshipping 
Hie feet (of the image of Visnu), offering puja, bowing '(or 
homage), treating oneself as the slave of Visnu, treating -Him 
as a friend and surrendering one's soul to"Hini. According 15 " 
to^arada-bhakti-sutra it is elevenfold (as noted below); 'Bis

not to be supposed that all these nine methods have to be pra- 
ctised at the same time. A devotee practising any one of these, 
viz. remembering or reciting His name, may thereby become a 
true bhakta, and may win God's favour and secure liberation 
(Sandilyas&tra 73). The Glta (VII. 16-17 ) states 'four dosses 
of men, who are ( all ) fortunate, worship me viz. one who is in 
distress, the seeker after knowledge, one who seeks Bome desired 
object ( or seeks wealth ), one who is possessed of knowledge ; of 
these he who is possessed of knowledge, who is always devoted 
and who worships One (Being) only is distinguished (above 
others), for to the man of knowledge lam extremely dear and 
he is dear to me'. Sandilya provides that the four aspects ( out of 
nine) viz. remembering God, reciting His name, narrating 
stories about Him and bowing to Him ( His image ), find thoir 
place in the bhakti of those who are distressed, for these are said 
to be the means of expiation of sins, as the Visnupurana says 
(II. 6. 39) that remembering Krsna is superior to all praya- 
soittas. Sandilya further says that those guilty of mortal 
(grave) sins are only entitled to the bhakti of the distressed; 
but when their sins have been wiped off they would be entitled 
to the other forms of bhakti. 

Glta does not expressly enumerate all these nine modes of 
bhakti, but most of them can be gathered from various passages 
of the Glta such as IX. 14, 36, 27 and from passages in othor 
Puranas. For example, the Visnupurana 1573 says ' whatever be tho 
expiatory rites, consisting of austerities, deeds of charity &o., to 
remember Krsna is superior to them all' and 'that repetition of 
His name with bhakti is the best solvent of all sins, as fire is of 
metals'. In the Bhagavata 15n it is said ' whatever the devotee 
does by his body, speech, mind, organs of sense, by his intellect 
or by his soul or by the force of temperament that he follows— 
all that he should offer to Narayana who is highest '. This 
is entirely in line with Glta IX. 27 and may be called 
'daBya-bhakti', while Arjuna's bhakti is 'sakhya-bhalcli, as Lord 
Krsna himself speaks of him as 'my devotee and a friend' ( GlU

The position of the Gila as to worship and one's duties 967 

IV. 3). It appears that the Gita regards the performance 1S7S of 
the duties of his station in life by&bhakta as worship (arcana 
orpuja) of God ' worshipping by the performance of one's duties 
(without an eye to the fruit or rewards of them ) God from whom 
the world springs and by whom all this world is permeated, a 
man obtains perfection (and not only by offering flowers or by 
reciting the name of God ). 

This central doctrine of the Gita, of what is called ' niskama- 
karma ' was accepted by the Puranas. The Visnu I J. 3. 25 adopts 
it. The Agnipurana in ohapter 381 gives a summary of the 
Gita in 58 verses which are mostly made up of passages from 
the Gita. It winds up the summary with the verse quoted in 
note 1575 and emphasizes bhakti in the last verse. 1576 The 
Garuda-purana summarises the Gita in 28 verses (1.237-238). 
The Padma( in VI. 171-188) contains the mahatmya of each of 
the 18 chapters of the Gita interspersed with legends about the 
fruit of reading each Gita chapter (1005 verses in all). A few 
further examples may be oited. The Kurma says 1577 'therefore 
even a man not possessed of (high) wisdom should perform all 
his duties (or actions) abandoning with all efforts the fruit (or 
reward) of aotions, he obtains (high) abode after sometime*; 
'actions done after offering them to me do not tend to bind 
down the doer but tend to mukti ( liberation )'. The Markandeya 
also refers to « niskama-karma '. The Bhagavata-purana provides 
a man performing (the rites) prescribed by the Veda but with- 
out attachment (not oaring for the reward) and surrendering 
them to God secures freedom from the bondage of karma and the 
declaration of the reward (in the Veda) is only meant for 
stimulating effort. * 

The doctrine of adiatla in the Upanisads ( such as in Isal6, 
lai. Up. III. 4 and 8, Br. Up. II. 4. 14, IV. 3. 30-31, IV 5 15)

about God or the ultimate destiny of man or the way to God and 
did not solve the common man's problems. The Glfca took up 
the problems of the common man , it shows to the lowliest of the 
lowly that there is hope for him, that the One and the True Being 
can enter into his life, if he consecrates all the daily duties and 
actions of his station in life to God and that salvation will come 
to every one if one has loving faith in God and surrenders him- 
self entirely to his Grace. The Gita proclaims (IX. 30-33) 'If 
even a man that has been very badly conduoted worships me 
without worshipping any one else he should be regarded as a 
good man, since he has resolved upon the right course; he 
quiokly becomes a righteous soul and reaches everlasting peace: 
O Arjuna! you may affirm that my devotee is never ruined. 
By taking refuge with me even those that are born m despised 
castes, also women, vaisyas and sfidras reach the highest goal*. 
The Sandilya-bhakti-sutra provides 1578 that all down to persons 
of the despised castes are entitled (to follow the path of bhakti) 
as they are oapable of learning bhakti at second hand just as 
they can learn the common rules (of ahimsa, truthfulness &o.). 
The-PuranaB speak in the same strain as the Gita and are some- 
times even more explicit and emphatic. The Brahma-purana 
paraphrases Gita IX. 32 and proceeds 'my devotee even if he be 
a candala attains the desired beatitude, if he be endowed with 
the right faith; what need be said about others?' The Padma 1579 
states ' A Pulkasa or even a svapaka and other persons belong- 
ing to Mleccha tribes become eminent and worthy of being 
honoured, if they are solely devoted to the worship of the feet of 
Hari '; ' Even a svapaka is a Vaisnava if on his lips there is the 
name of Hari, in whose heart there is Visnu and in whose 
Btomach goes food offered to Visnu* The Bhagavata contains' 560

the following remarkable statement : ' Homage to that Supreme 
Lord, by resorting to whom as refuge Kiratas 1531 (mountain- 
dwellers like Bhils), the Hunas, Andhras, Fulindas, 
Pulkasas, Abhiias, Kankas, Yavanas, Khasas and the like and 
other degraded men are purified.' These sentiments were not 
mere platitudes, but had been very largely acted upon. Even in 
the medieval ages in India we have women saints like Mirabai 
and Andal ( in South India), untouchables as saints like Nanda, 
Cokhamela (in Maharastra), Rai Das (a cliamai disciple of 
Bamananda ), sinners like Ajamila honoured as saints. Saints 
like Kabir ^ (a Moslem weaver) and Tukaram had probably 
not muoh book learning, but their hymns are recited by Hindus 
including orthodox brahmanas. 

The invasions and gradual conquest of India by Moslem in- 
vaders from the Northwest threw down a challenge to Hindus from 
11th century A.D. onwards. It was met in various ways. The first 
was the composition of comprehensive digests of smrtis of which 
the earliest extant one is the Kityakalpataru of Laksmtdhara 
( about 1110-1130 A.D. ) in the North and Hemadri in the Decoan 
(third quarter of 13th century). The second and the most important 
way was on the spiritual front. B"rom the 13th to the 17 th century 
there was a great revival of spirituality on an unprecedented 
scale which produced saints and mystics in all parts of India such 
as Jnanesvara, Namadeva, Eamananda, Kabir, issi Oaitanya, 

1581. Pulkasas and Svapakas were degraded and untouchable castes 
Vide H. of Bh. vol. II pp. 88-89 for Pulfcasa and p. 97 for Svapaka ( lit. 
who subsists on dog-meat). Pulkasa occurs in Vaj. S. 30. 17. Kiratas are 
assigned to caves in Vaj. S. 30. 16 The Abhiras are described as dasyus 
and mlecchas in Mausala-parva 7. 46-63, they are said to have attacked 
Arjuna in paficanada when he was taking -women with htm after Krsna's 
passing away and to have carried away Vrsni women (Mansala 8. 16-17) 
Vide also the jame account in Visnupurana V. 38 12-28 Matsya 273 18 
speaks of ten Abhira kings. The Khasa tribe had the custom of a brother mar- 
rying his deceased brother's widow. Vide H of Dh vol. III. p 861 n 1671. 

1582. Vide G H. Weslcott on ' Kabir and Kabir-panth • (Cawnpore, 
1907) and 'Kabir and his followers ' by F. E Keay (1931 ). Kabir's teach- 
ing was an amalgam of both Hindu and Moslem ideas He preached a 
doctrme of theism that did not tolerate polytheism, incarnations and idols. 
Kabir is said to have been a diiciple of Raminanda ( who lived about 
1400-1470 A. D ), an ascetic who preached at Benares that God should be 
worshiped under the name of Rama. Kabir held to the doctrines of Karma 
and Transmigration. He believed in the unity of God. but makes use of many 
names such as Rama, Khuda. Allah. Sakti m speaking of Him.

Dadu (in Rajasthan), Nanak, Vallabhacarya, Ekanatha.Tukaram, 
Ramadasa ( and many others of lesser fame ) who all agreed on 
fundamentals vis. unity of God, the need of self- purification, com- 
demnation of the pride of caste and of formalities of worship, and 
surrender to the Deity for salvation. The third was the creation 
of such independent kingdoms as that of Yijayanagara ( 1330- 
1565 A. D.), of Maharastra (under Shivaji and the Peshwas) and 
of the Sikhs in Punjab. This last cannot be dealt with way in 
this work The doctrine of bhakti had a great appeal to all 
sections of the Hindu community and its propagation by the 
Puranas went a long away in weaning away Hindus from 
Buddhism. Hot only so, Mahayana Buddhism took over the 
doctrine of bhakti and works like the ' Questions of Milinda ' 
and the Saddharmapundarlka 1583 contain passages which agree 
closely with the Gita. The Gita exhibits a wonderful spirit of 
tolerance and accommodation, not found in the scriptures 
of other religions which were founded by great prophets. 
It says 1584 ' even those, who are devotees of other deities and 
worship them with faith, ( indirectly ) worship me only but with 
a non-sastric ( or irregular ) procedure.' The Bhagavata-purana 
elaborates the same idea ; ' O Adorable One ! others worship you 
alone in the form of Siva while following the path promulgated 
by Siva and propounded in different ways by several acaryas, all 
worship you who are Lord and who comprehend in yourself all 
gods ; those also who are devotees of other deities and appear to 
have different ideas do in the end reach you, just as all rivers 
rising in mountains and flooded by rains enter the ocean from 
all sides'. The Santiparva 1585 also contains a similar idea 'Those 
who worship Brahma, Siva or other deities and whose conduct 
( or practice ) is intelligent will ( ultimately ) come to me, who 
am the Highest*. This doctrine has its germs in the Rgveda 1586

itself where it is said ' the One Reality the sage3 speak of under 
various names ; they call it Agni, Tama, Matarisvan (wind-god )'. 
Thi3 work cannot afford, for reasons of space, to go into the several 
hhakti schools such as those of Ramanuja, Madhva (who postulated 
five eternal bhedas), Caitanya and Yallahha ( that gave rise to an 
erotico-mystical brand of bhakti ) and others. 

In their zeal for the spread of the cult of bhakti the Puranas 
are sometimes guilty of gross exaggeration. The Brahuia- 
purana 1587 says ' men even after having committed many sins 
under the influence of error ( or delusion ), do not go to Hell, if 
they worship Hari who removes all sins ; those men also who 
always remember Janardana, though they may be guilty of 
roguery, reach, after they die, the happy world of Yisnu. Even 
a man who is habituated to flying into extreme rage, if he recites 
the name of Hari, has his faults destroyed and attains mukti 
(liberation) as the king of Cedi country did'. The Vamana- 
pmana 1588 observes " what has that person got to do with many 
mantras (i. e. he has no use for those), who is a bhakta of Yisnu ? 
The mantra ' namo Narayanaya ' is able to accomplish all objects. 
Success is for those who have bhakti for Yisnu ; how can there be 
failure for them in whose heart is enthroned Janardana dark like 
a blue lotus?" The Vamana and Padma Puranas say that a 
man secures the same results by repeating the names of Visnu 
that he would secure by visiting all the tfrthas ( sacred places ) 
and holy shrines US9 in the world. 

Many Puranas, particularly the Yisnu and the Bhagavata, 
are replete with the eulogies, the theory and p ractice of bhakti

possible to go into this matter at any length. A few noteworthy 
points alone will be touched. A few verses eulogising the 
Bhagavatapurana may be cited as samples of extreme exaggera- 
tion. ' Thousands 1590 of Asvamedhas and hundreds of Vajapeya 
sacrifices are not equal to even the 16th part of the story narrated 
by Suka ; he who always recites a half or a quarter verse of the 
Bhagavata secures the merit of Kajasuya and Asvamedha; he 
who listens to the words of the saatra of Suka ( i.e. Bhagavata ) at 
the time of death, Govinda being pleased with him confers on him 
Vaikuntha ; this is a good expiation for all sinners viz. uttering 
the name of Visnu, since ( at that time ) their mind has Visnu 
as the only object of thought '. 1SM Another point is the story of 
Ajamila in the Bhagavata ( VI. 1. 20 ff and VI. 2 ), Padma( I. 31. 
109 and VI. 87. 7 ) and other Pur anas. Ajamila 1552 ( who aban- 
doned his brahmana wife and kept a mistress ) was a moral 
wreck addicted to gambling and thieving. When on his death- 
bed at the age of 80 he loudly called upon his youngest son 
named Narayana ( out of ten sons born of the mistress ) with 
affection and recited that name and thought of that alone, he 
became free from his sins and attained a high position difficult 
to attain '. Such stories have given rise to the common belief 
that the last thought at one's death leads to a new birth appro- 
priate to that thought ( ante matih su gahh ). The TJpanisads 
contain the germ of the idea of the last thought; vide. Oban. Up. 
III. 14. 1, VIII. 2. 10, Br. Up. IV. 4. 5. In the ' Questions of 
Milinda ' ( SBE vol 35 pp. 123-124 ) this idea of the importance 
of the last thought is taken up. It may be that a single heart-felt 
invocation of the name of God, a single act of faith after

The idea of the l last thought ' 973 

repentance and complete surrender to God's will, cancels the result 
of a whole life of crime and sin. This is the moral of Ajamila's 
story, but it is liable to be grossly misapprehended and might 
create a complacent belief that a man may commit as many sins 
in his life as possible, but if he remembers God at his death and 
repeats His name then, all sins of his are cleared away and wiped 
out. Thi3 is a rather dangerous doctrine. The Glta ( VIII. 5-7 ) 
puts the matteT in a clear light. 'That person, who remembers me 
at the time of death and passes from the world leaving the body, 
attains my essence, there is no doubt about that "Whatever 
foTin a man remembers when he leaves the body, to that he goes, 
because he was alivays engrossed m that form. Therefore remem- 
ber me at all times and engage in battle ; there is no doubt that 
having fixed your mind and intellect on me you will attain to me '. 
This passage of the Glta suggests that a person will remember 
the name of God at the time of his death only if he had been so 
doing all his life, while engaged in actively performing all his 
duties and not caring for the rewards thereof and that it is 
extremely rare or almost impossible for a man to remember 
God at the last moment when throughout his life he had been 
ungodly and a great sinner. The above idea is agam emphasized 
in verses 10-13 of chap VIII ( of the Glta ) and in chap. XKL 3 
(yo yac-chraddhah sa eva sah ) 

In spite of the doctrine that God is one"" 3 and the doctrine 
that whatever form of the deity one may worship, the worship 
reaches tiie Supreme Being, Vaisnavas and Saivas have been 
wrangling and abusing one another For example, the Varaha- 



1593. The proposition that God is only one. that He is worshipped 
under vanous perceptible forms for concentrating the mind on Him, 
worship or contemplation of a formless object being difficult, are doctrines' 
taught in the Puranas in spite of the fact that they preach worship of Yisnu, 
Krsna. Siva, Devi and others. Vide H of Dh. vol. II pp 714-715 and' pp

purana makes Rudra declare the supremacy of Visnu (chap. UM 
70. 14 Narayanan parodevah), denounce Saiva-siddhantas that 
are outside the pale of the Vedas and put forward the outstanding 
view 'that such non-Vedic views were promulgated by Siva 
himself at the request of Visnu in order to delude people*. Some 
Puranas started by saying that the Bauddhas and Jainas 15 ' 5 
were asuras and enemies of gods that were purposely deluded by 
god. For example, the Matsya ( 24. 43-49 ) says that the sons 
of Raji deprived Indra of his kingdom and share in sacrifices, 
that Brhaspati, at Indra's request, deluded the sons of Ban by 
composing a treatise of Jina-dharma which was opposed to the 
Veda and then Indra killed them. Vayu 96. 230-32, Matsya 
47. 11-12, Bhagavata I. 3 24 appear to suggest that Visnu 
himself deluded the people The Agni(16. 1-4) also says with 
reference to the Bauddhas that Visnu deluded them. The Visnu- 
purana 1556 (III 17-18) narrates that when the gods were

Asuras in the form of heretics purposely misled by Visnu 975 

defeated by the asuras (who also practised tapas and studied 
the Veda) they approached Visnu and prayed to him to help 
them and to destroy the asuras and that then Visnu produced 
from bis body Maya-moha (lit. who causes delusion by wiles) 
and made him over to the gods. Mayamoha, who was naked, 
had shaved his head and held a bunch of peacock feathers in 
hia hand, went to the asuras that were practising tapas on 
the banks of the Narmada (HE. 18. 1-3) and told them that 
if they followed his words they would secure muktt, led them 
away from the path of the Veda, taught them formulas of 
sceptical reasoning and weaned them away from their dharma. 
Then he approached other asuras and taught them that sacri- 
ficing animals was sinful, taught them nirvana and the doctrines 
of vijnanavada. Some of the passages are very striking ' In a 
short time the asuras were deluded by Mayamoha and abandoned 
all concern with the path depending on the three Vedas. Some 
condemned the Vedas, some condemned the god3, while others 
condemned the body of sacrificial rites and brahmanas. (They 
thought or said) The statement that killing an animal (in 
sacrifices) is desirable for the sake of Dhajma (for accumulating 
merit) does not stand to reason; to say that offerings burnt by 
fire would conduce to reward (in the next world) is childish 
talk; (if it be said that ) Indra attained the position of God by 
means of many sacrifices and enjoys the fuel-sticks of the sami 
tree, then an animal ( that subsists on leaves) is superior to Indra 
(who enjoys hard and thorny sami samidhs) If it is desired 
(by the Veda) that tbe animal killed in a sacrifice attains 
heaven, then why does not the sacrificer kill his own father in 
a sacrifice ( and send him to heaven) ? If one ( the son) performs 
sraddha (with the thought) that what is eaten by one (brahmana 
diner at sraddha) tends to give satisfaction to another ( i. e. the 
deceased father of the offerer of sraddha), then travellers would 
not carry food ( on their backs ) which causes weariness to them.' 
These are the arguments used by atheists (carvakas). It is 
remarkable that even tantrtk works like the Kularnavatantra 
make Siva say that he declared certain sastras purely for 
deluding certain had peonle who did not know the Zaula 
dharma. 1597

proceeded so far as to say 1593 that a brahmana who is not a 
Vaisnava is a heretic, that Visnu himself assuming the form of 
Buddha proclaimed a false sastra, and that all sastras such as the 
Pasupata, Vaisesika of Xanada, iNyaya of Gautama, Sankhya of 
Xapila, Carvaka of Brhaspati are tamasa; that the mayavada 
(of Sankara) is a false sastra and is disguised Bauddha (doctrine) 
and the extensive sastra ( PurvarDlmansa ) of Jaimini is con- 
demned, since it made gods as of no U3e ( in his system ). The 
words of the Padma-purana are , ' Listen O Goddess, while I 
declare to you in order the tamasa sastras, by merely remembering 
which even wise men become sinners. First of all I promulgated 
Saiva sastras such as the Pasupata system ; then the following were 
declared by brahmanas that were possessed ( or engrossed ) by my 
sakti (power), viz Xanada proclaimed the great Vaisesika system, 
the Nyaya and Sankhya systems were declared respectively by 
Gautama and Xapila . the much despised Carvaka doctrine was 
declared by Brhaspati, while Visnu, assuming the form of Buddha, 
promulgated, for bringing about the destruction of daityas, the 
false doctrine of Bauddhas that go about naked or dressed in 
blue garments , I myself, O goddess, assuming the form of a 
brahmana declared in the Xali age the false sastras of the 
doctrine of Maya which is bauddha in disguise. The brahmana 
Jaimini composed the great system of PurvamlmamBa, which is 
unmeaning on account of its atheistic discourse'. Vijnana-bhiksu 
in his Sankhya-pravacanabhasya ( who flourished about 1550 
A. D. ) quotes eleven verses from the Padma VI 263 and holds the 
peculiar view that no sastra that is astilca ( admits a soul ) is 
unauthoritative nor is there any contradiction, each sastra being 
of full force and true in its own sphere. The original Sankhya 
sutra, on which he comments, tries to establish the impossible 
thesis that the teachings of the Sankhya are not in real or 
irreconcilable contradiction with the doctrine of all-pervading 
oneness of biahma or with the doctrine that biahma is bliss 
(ananda) or the system of theism (i. e. a personal God).

Secta) ian bigotry exemplified 977 

Rama in which it is said that the 108 names of Krsna ( who is 
acknowledged by all to be an incarnation of Visnu ) are so potent 
that the merit secured by repeating thrice the 1008 names of 
Visnu is secured by repeating only once one of the 108 names 
(of Krsna ). uw 

The Visnu and Padma do not stand alone in this strange 
story of Visnu himself or through Eudra teaching false doctrines 
for deluding the ungodly or those that dissented from or reviled 
the Vedas. There were other Puranas that sing the same tune ; 
for example, the Kurma-purana indulges in a tendetta against 
many sastras and systems in several places. A few passages are 
set out here. ( Devi says ) ' the various 1601 sastras that are found 
in this world and are opposed to the Vedas and smrtis are based 
on tamas ( ignorance ), viz Kapala, Bhairava, Yamala ( a class 
of Tantra works ), Vama (left-hand practices of a class of Tantras), 
jSrhata ( Jain doctrines ), these and others are meant for deluding 
(persons ); I produced these sastras in another birth for deluding 
people ' ; ' therefore in order to protect (people ) against those who 
were beyond the pate of the Vedas and for the destruction of 
sinners we shall, O Siva, compose sastras for deluding them ; 
Rudra being thus advised by Madhava ( Visnu) composed sastras 
that delude and Visnu also urged on by Eudra did the same,

following prohibited avocations and those who follow left-hand

who study the Paficaratra doctrines, Kapahkas, Pasupatas and 
other similar heretics, being bad and deluded, eat the sraddha

heretical sects, vide ' Heretical sects in the Puranas ' by Sri 
Radhakrishna Ohoudhary in ABORI vol 37 (1956 ) pp. 234-257. 

The Gita ( in chapter 16 ) speaks of two classes of people, viz. 
those born to godlike endowments and those born with demoniac 
qualities and describes the latter in verses 7-20. Some of the 
verses probably indioate that the reference is to atheists and the 
like; for verse 8 BtateB ' they say that the world is devoid of truth

vein Nakuli (Lakuli) as the founder of a Saiva sect and Kayaroliana 
( modern Karavan in Dabhoi Taluka of former Baroda Stato ) as its sacred 
placo (siddha-ksctra). The Mathura Ins. of Candragupta II dated in 
Gupta era 61 (380 A. D ) in E. I. vol. XXI pp Iff shows that Lakuli, too

( i. e. contains nothing that one can beliave ), devoid of any fixed 
principle ( such as virtue and vice ), devoid of a Ruler, and is 
produced by union brought about by lu3t and nothing else *. 
After describing their thoughts and aspirations the Glta winds 
up ' these perform sacrifices which are so in name only with 
hypocrisy and against the prescribed procedure ; they hate me in 
their own bodies and in those of others; these impure and cruel 
enemies I continually throw down in demoniac wombs ; coming 
into demoniac wombs and being deluded, in each birth they go 
to vilest states without ever coming to me '. This is entirely 
different from what the Padma and other Puranas say about 
Pasupatas, Pancaratras and about non-Vaisnavas. 

Both the Bhggavata and the Padma say that W3i (the cult of ) 
bhakti first arose in Dravida country, it progressed or prospered 
in the Kamataka, it was found in only a few places in Maha- 
rastra and deolined in the Gurjara country; it was, on account 
of the terrible Kaliyuga, broken up by heresies and remained 
weak for a long time , but having reached Vrndavana ( near 
Mathura ) it got a fresh start and assumed fine form. In book 
XI. the Bhagavata again reverts to this assertion that in Kali 
people are solely devoted to Karayana only in a few places but 
to the greatest extent in the Dravida country where flow the 
rivers TamraparnI, Krtamala, Kaverl and MahanadI flowing 
to the west and states that those who drink the waters of these 
riveTS are generally devotees of Vasudeva. 

Most great moral and spiritual upheavals have a tendency 
to reach a very low level in course of time. That appears to 
have happened in the case of bhagavatas The Atri-smrti has a 
verse containing a sarcastic reference to bhagavatas 1603 • ' Those 
who are devoid of Vedio studies learn sastras ( such as grammar

there, become bhagavatas '. Atri appears to aay that bhagavatas 
are idlers, who do not study Veda or sSstra or who cannot even 
read Puranas to others for their livelihood or do not engage in 
agriculture and who pretend to be worshippers ( or bhaldas ) of 
Vianu or Kisna and fatten on what is given by others that are 
deluded into thinking that they have forsaken everything for 
the sake of their love of God. They become what are called 
• buwas ' in Marathi and other modern Indian languages 

Another striking development of the bhakti cult is the 
Erotic Mysticism (madhura bhalcli) associated with the worship 
of Krsna and of Radha in that form of Yaisnavism established 
by Oaitanya and Vallabhacarya ]?or the Vaisnava movement 
inspired by Caitanya, vide Dr. S. K. De's work on ' the Vaisnava 
faith and movement in Bengal' (Calcutta 1942) and the 
author's 'History of Sanskrit Poetics* (1951) about Ujjvala- 
nllamani of Rupa-gosvamin pp. 298-302. In the bhakti oult 
established by Vallabhacarya great importance is attached to 
the guru, who is one of the descendants of Vallabhacarya and 
to whom almost divine honours are paid. A wonderful develop- 
ment of bhakti towards Rama, regarded in the Ramayana and 
in popular tradition as a paragon of restraint and all manly 
virtues, oulminated in an erotic mystioism about Rarna and 
Slta, also. The devotees of this mystic cult have to consider 
themselves as brides of Rama or the female friends of Slta, they 
are supposed to seek Lord Rama's favour through Slta, who 
graciously intercedes with the Lord for the devotees Among 
the followers of Vallabhacarya the guru tells the devotee to look 
upon him ( the guru ) as Krsna and upon himself or herself as 
Radhika. 

Por want of space further details about these bhakti cults 
have to be passed over 

Supreme importance is attached to Vedic mantras and also 
Fauranika mantras. They will have to be dealt with at some 
length in the sections on Tantras and on Purvamimansa. But 
some treatment of mantras, particularly vedic, may be given 
here as well. The word mantia occurs about twenty-five times 
in the Rgveda Only once does the word manti akrt ocour in 
the Rgveda 1606 (IX 114.2) 'O sage Kasyapa! offer obeisance

reference to rsis here (but to narah) and what is emphasized 
is that mantras already extant as the heait'3 outpourings enable 
the reciters of the mantras to find him ( Agni ) There is nothing 
to show that the mantras referred to in the verse are meant 
toh& impi omptu , the idea is rather that mantras that already 
existed and conveyed heartfelt devotion have to be employed 
to find Agni The very next verse makes the position clear when 
it says, ' like the unborn ( Sun ) he ( Agni ) supports the wide 
earth and fixes in its place the sky on account of the mantras 
that turn out true \ This clarifies two things, viz. that when 
this mantra (I 67. 3 ) was recited there already existed a host of 
mantras"" and secondly, that the mantras that existed long 
before were deemed to have helped in supporting the earth and 
the sky. The ancient mantras were supposed to bring Indra to 
attend thrice in the day for a short time to the sacrifices of 
devotees when invoked with mantras addressed to him ( Bg. HI. 
53 8 ) , similarly, mantras when recited by wise men bring Yama 
to receive offerings ( Rg X 14 4 ) ; Rg. X 88 14 states ' we raise 
our voices with mantras towards Vaisvanara Agni, who is wise 
and who shines brilliantly all days' The word mantra"" is

also employed in the singular several times. A few striking 
passages are set out here ' Indeed, God Brahmanaspati (Lord 
of Prayer) proclaims the mantra fit for recitation (by the mouth 
of the hotr ), in which the gods Indra, Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman 
make their abode, O Gods I ', ' We utter that very mantra ( in 
which Indra and other gods are praised together) in our sacrifices, 
the mantra being one that produces bliss and being free from all 
blemishes (oris incomparable), 'Do place among the Gods a 
mantra that is not short, that is well-arranged and that is well 
ornamented; ancient fetters do not reach him who is in ( the good 
grace of ) Indra by the sacrifice ( or praise ); 'I address the same 
mantra for you (all) and offer for y ou ( all ) one offering ( into fira )'. 
From these passages it appears that when these verses were recited 
there was a body of already existing mantras; which were 
supposed to be inspired by the Lord of prayers ( or speeoh ) and 
from which the choice of a long and well-formed one was to be 
made Apart from the above passages the word mantra occurs 
in ftg I 31 13, 1 74 1, I 147, 4, I 152 2, II. 35 2, VI 50 14, 
VII. 7 6, X 50 4 and 6, X. 106. 11, in only one of which (Bg. H. 
35. 3), apart from Bg I 67. 2 already quoted, the words 'hrda a 
sutastam mantram' (mantra well chiselled from the heart) are 
used and in another verse more simply the word * ataksan ' ( in 
VII 7. 6 mantiam ye varam naryS ataksan) alone is UBed. In two 
passages (Rg. X 95.1 and X 191, 3 first half) the word 'mantra' 
appears to mean 'consultations, holding counsel together' In 
Bg I 20 4, Bbhus are called ' satyamantrah' and are said to 
have made their parents young There are controversies about 
what the Bbhus stand for and it is difficult to say what is meant 
by ' satyamantrah" in relation to Bbhus Bg. VII 76. 4. is a 160 ' 
somewhat enigmatic verse It means 'they (Angirases) alone, 
(our) ancient pitrs, learned (or wise) and following the right 
path, enjoyed companionship among gods and they found out 
the Light ( the Sun ) concealed (by Svarbhanu, eclipse) ; they, 
whose mantras were true, brought forth Usas ' In some passages 
where other words like stoma or biahina are used, there is

Other Rgveda words for prayer like btafima, stoma 9S3 

mention of the stoma or brahma being made and polished 
by the devotee ( e. g. X. 39. 14 ' etam vain stomam-Asvinavakar- 
mataksama bhrgavo na ratham ') Vide Rg.I 63.13 for 'navyam 
ataksad biahma', Rg. V. 39.15 (Indra brahma kriyamaua jusasva 
savisthayatenavya, akaima) , brahmakrtah (composers of prayers 
or praises ) are mentioned in Rg. VII 33 3 and X. 50. 7. Other 
words like gir ( several hundred times ), dhlti ( about 1G0 times )i 
brahma ( over a hundred times ) mati ( about 100 times ), manisa 
( over 60 times ), vaoas and vacasya ( over 100 times ), stoma 
( about 200 times ), suklrti (five times), sukta (four times) are 
employed in the sense of ' thought, word or thought out hymn 
or verse of praise' and in several cases the sages of the Rgveda 
state that it is a new verse or hymn of praise that they employ. 
Vide 'navyaslbhir-glrbhih.' and 'giram bhare navyaslm jaya- 
manam' in Rg V. 43. 13 , in Rg VI 49. 1, VII. 53.3; 'Pra 
tavyaslm nauyasvn dhltimagnaye' in Rg. 1. 143 1 ; ' vaisvanaraya 
mahr-navyasi sucih soma iva pavate' ( Rg. VI 8. 1 ) and ' iyam 
te navyasi mahr agne adhayyasmada' ( Rg VIII. 74. 7 ) ; iyam te 
agne navyasl manisa' Rg. X. 4 6 ; * ta valgu I610 Dasra purusa- 
katamaprafwa navyasa vacasa. vivase' ( Rg VI. 63. 5 ) ; ' navyasl 
suklrtih' in Rg. I 60. 3 , 'sa pratnavat navyase visvavara suktaya 
pathab krnuhi' in Rg IX. 91. 5; 'nu navyase naviyase suktaya 
sadhaya pathah' in Rg. IX 9. 8. It is a remarkable fact that 
when words like 'sukirtth' and 'sukta' that occur only four or 
five times in the whole of the Rgveda are qualified by the word 
'new or fresh', the word 'mantra' occurring so many times does 
not even once bear the adjective 'new'. This emphasizes the 
conclusion stated above that in the times of many of the extant 
Rgvedic verses mantras were a large group already existing, 
from which prayers were drawn as occasion required, though 
now and then new verses were added to those already existing. 
It may here be stated that in some places the Rgveda looks upon 
prayers ( dhxli ) as divine and as on the same level with Asvins, 
Usas, and the Sun (VIII. 35. 3 ) and that ancient prayers were 
inherited from ancestors (III. 39. 3 ' seyamasme sanaia. uitrya 
dhlh'). 

Several hymns and verses of the Rgveda are purely philo- 
sophical, cosmological, mystic and speculative as 1. 164. 4, 6, 39, 

1610 Here the contrast is great The Asvins are pratna ( ancient) 
but the rsi (m VI 62 5) says that he worships the ancient Dasras (As'vins) 
with a new prayer. This rsi at least does not convey that the Asvins were 
seen by him.

(state after death), X. 190 (creation). 

About the meaning and purpose of Vedio mantras there are 
great controversies. This much may be said here that according 
to the PuTvamlmamsS system the whole Veda is concerned with 
sacrifices, that Veda is divided into two classes, Mantra and 
Brahmana, that Vidhis (hortatory passages) are the moat 
important part of the Veda, that a very large number of Vedio 
passages are mere arthavadas ( that contain either praises of 
vidhis or are to be explained metaphorically or merely repeat 
what already exists or are of a legendary character ) and that 
mantras only serve the purpose of bringing to the mind of the 
sacrificer or priests what is to be done in a sacrifice and that the\ 
words used in the mantras ordinarily bear the same meaning as 
that in popular Sanskrit. 

Long before Yaska ( several centuries before Christ ) there 
were several schools of Vedio interpretation such as the 
Aitihasikas ( who ace to Nir. II 16 said that Vitra was an Asura 
sonofTvastr, while ace to the Nairuktas Vrtra means only 
cloud' and the Veda contains metaphorical descriptions- of 
battles, that the twins that Saranyu is said in F.g. X 17. 3 to 
have given up are according to the Nairuktas Indra and the 
Madbyamika-vak, while according to the Aitihasikas they are 
Yama and YamI, as stated in Nir. XII. 10), the sohool of 
ITaidanas is mentioned about 'syala'and *sama* inNir. VI 19, 
the school of ancient yajnikas in Nir. V. 11 Rg. 1. 164. 32 ( ya 
im oakara ) is differently explained by the Panvrajakas ( ascetic 
sohool) and the Nairuktas (etymologists). The Nirukta also 
mentions the names of seventeen individual predecessors ( from 
whom it differs often and who differ among themselves ) such as 
Agrayana, Audumbarayana, Kautsa, Gargya, Galava, Sakata- 
yana, Sakapuni There are several mantras of which two different 
meanings are given m the Nirukta as in Nir V. 11 on Rg. VIII. 
77. 4, In Rg. 1. 164 there are several verses with two meanings or 
more e. g verse 21 (yatra suparna &o.) has two meanings (aco to 
Nir. Ill 13 ) one relating to the devata Surya ( adkidauata ) and 
the other spiritual ( adhyatma ); similarly, verso 32 of the same 
hymn has two meanings in the Nirukta (II. 8), the vor3o39 
( rco aksare parame vyoman ) is explained in four ways by 
Sayana, verse 41 (gaurlr-mimaya) is explained by Sayana in 
two ways, both being different from Yaska's explanation ( in Nir. 



Varying interpretations of Bgveda verses 985 

XI 40 ) ; verse 45 ( catvari vak parimita padani) is explained in 
six' ways (more oi less different from each other > by Sayana; it 
is also explained in the Mahabhasya (p. 7 of M. M. Abhyankara- 
saBtri's ed. ). The versa * catvari srnga ' ( Rg. IV. 58. 3 ) has been 
the subject of varying explanations from very early times. Kir. 
(XTTT. 7) explains it as referring to Yajna. The Mahabhasya 
(p 6 of the Mahabhasya ibid. ) also does the same. Sayana 
explains it as referring to Agni ( identified with yajna ) and 
Sarya. This verse is a riddle. Sahara 1611 in his bhasya on P. M. S. 
1.2.38. ('abhidhane arthavadah') explains it but Kumarila 
differs from him. Sayana and others explain it (e.g. the word 
'tridha') with reference to Mantra, Brahmana and Kalpa, but 
when this verse was first proclaimed there must bave been no 
Brabmanas and Kalpasutras. In several cases the Nirukta gives 
the adhidaivata (physical) and adhyatma ( metaphysical or 
spiritual ) or adhiyajfia and adhyatma as in Hir. X. 26 ( on 
$g. X. 82. 2 ' Visvakamia vimana ), Nir. XI. 4 ( on Kg. X. 85. 3, 
adhiyajna and adhidaivata meanings ), Eve. XII. 37 ( on Vaj. S. 
34.55 'saptarsayah', both adhidaivata and adhyatma), Nir. 
XII. 38 (on Atharva X 8. 9 ' Tiryag-bilas-camasa &c.' both 
adhidaivata and adhyatma ). In Bg. (1. 164) verses 11-13 and 
48 contain a very imaginative and poetic description of the year, 
the seasons, months and total days and nights. 

In recent years Sri Aurobindo in ' Hymns to the mystic 
Fire ' ( translated in the esoteric sense, 1946 ) and his ardent 
and devout disciple Sri. T. V. Kapali Sastry ( in c Rgbhasya- 
bhumika in Sanskrit and its English translation, Pondioherry 
1952 ) have started a theory about the Hgveda mantras which 
must be briefly stated and examined. Sri Aurobindo first 
intended, to publish an edition of the Rgveda with a word by word 
construction and an English translation. But he gave up that 
idea on account of other pre-occupations and rests content in the 
above book with the text and translation of about 230 verses in 
all from the 1st, 2nd and 6th mandalas of the Ilgveda and a 
foreword of 48 pages in which he propounds his theory. While 

X611. 5PR ( on ^. ifr. % 1.2.38) explains : ' ^gjRJj ffc=n: ^|ufi^n<l l

this was being written by the present writer, Sri Aurobindo's 
large work of 634 pages 'on tbe Veda' published in 1956 reached 
his hands. Over 60 hymns are dealt with in this big book and 
283 pages are devoted to the elaboration of his theory first out- 
lined in the brief work of Sri Aurobindo mentioned above and 
reiterated with greater emphasis. On page 9 of the work of 
1956 he states " the ritual system recognized by Sayana may 
stand, the naturalistic sense discovered by European scholar- 
ship may, in its general conceptions be accepted, but behind 
thereis always the true and still hidden secret oftheveda-ih* secret 
words which were spoken for the purified in soul and the awakened 
in knowledge'. In this work also he sticks to the meaning 
of rta as truth and on p 84 translates 'rtam* as 'Truth-conscious- 
ness', when in his first work he translated ' rfca-cit' as Truth»con- 
soiousness '. Instead of comparing the several hundred passages 
where the word rta occurs in the Rgveda he sticks to hia own 
rendering which is unacceptable to most scholars and makes a 
very perfunctory attempt at finding the correct meaning. One 
should like to have some clear examples of the distinction between 
Light and Consciousness in modern times and also in the Yeda. 
So far as the present writer knows, in the language of anoient 
symbolism Consciousness is identified with Light. In the recently 
published book he deals with less than T V*h of the total hymn3 
( 1017 or 1028 ) of the Bgveda. Headers are asked to subscribe 
to his views although he condescends to translate in the first 
work less than ^foth of the total number of verses in the Rgveda 
and hardly ever enters into a discussion about the meaning of 
words like rta. Sri Aurobindo ( Foreword p. HL ) concedes that 
Sayana does not reject the spiritual authority of the Veda and 
that Sayana does not deny that there is a higher truth contained 
in the rks He further says (IX) that we must take seriously 
the hint of Yaska ( Sri Aurobindo does not quote the Nirukta> 
but probably he has in mind UTir. I. 20 ' saksatkrtadharmSna 
rsayobabhuvuh"). Then he proceeds to state (XVH) thatmany 
whole hymns of the Veda bear on their face a mystic meaning 
and that the rsis (p. XIX) for the sake of seoreoy resorted to 
double meanings, a device easily manageable in the Sanskrit 
language. This is a hypothesis which cannot at all be accepted 
and is no more than mere conjecture. The Vedic mantras were 
composed thousands of years ago, when all persons among whom 
the sages moved must have spoken the same language, thougn 
generally not so polished and poetical as that of the mantras 
and they were not addressed to men like the moderns wBo=o 



§ri Aurobmdo's Vedic interpretations 98? 

every day thoughts, surroundings and languages are entirely 
different. Both the Master and the disciple (Mr. Kapali Sastry ) 
cause confusion ( or, may be, are themselves confused ) by sup- 
posing that the difficulties of the modern students of mantras did 
exist even at or near the time of the mantra3. The most sublime 
thought of the IJgveda is that there is only one Spirit behind the 
various gods, Indra, Mitra, Vairuna, Agni, Yama, Matarisvan, 
that originally there was only that One, there was no day and 
night, no death and immortality. Sri Aurobindo himself describes 
(p. XXXTT)Bg. 1. 164. 46 and X. 129. 3 as « the summit of the 
vedic teaching.' This view of the one Entity is also illustrated 
in Rg. VIII. 58. 2 ' one and the same Agni is kindled in many 
places, the one Sun enters the whole world and becomes many ; 
the one Dawn illumines all this (physical) world, One became all 
this (assumes various forms)'. No secrecy waB observed about 
this fundamental truth and it was proclaimed in mantras that 
oan be understood even by an ordinary man of to-day who knows 
* a little Sanskrit. Because we of these recent centuries cannot 
understand some mantras, that does not mean that the ancient 
seeis were guilty of a subterfuge and purposely composed 
mantras with two meanings. They might have indulged in the 
pastime of two meanings ( express and metaphorical ) in a few 
cases as poetic devices" 12 It is no fault of the sages, if we 
cannot understand their meaning, just as a blind man, who does 
not see a wooden post and comes to grief by dashing against it, 
should not blame the post, but should blame himself; we are to 
blame ourselves and should not foist upon the ancient sages 
a stratagem created by our own imagination or lack of know- 
ledge (Nir. 1. 16 )«i3

988 History of Dliamiaiastra [ Seo. V, Ch. XXIV 

Sri Aurobindo admits ( p. XXXTIT ) that there are soma key 
words in the 5gveda suoh as rta, kratu, iravas, fcetu and that elabo - 
late work would have to be done to fix the meanings of such words. 
But he does not undertake a study of the key words (each of 
which except 'ketu' occurs hundreds of times in the Bgveda) by 
comparison of Ijtgvedic passages and considering the light shed 
on these words by the other Samhitas and the Brahmanas. He 
mentions the occurrence of the word rta in 1. 164. 47 and IV. 
21.3 (sadanat-rtasya) an&'Ttasyapathya' in Rg. III. 12. 7 and 
jumps to the conclusion that the last two words mean 'the path 
of truth' and remarks that 'we have to find the path of Truth' 
(Foreword p. XXX. ). In the H. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 2-5 it has 
been shown that rta in the Bgveda has three meanings, viz. 
( 1 ) the regular and general order in the cosmos ; (2) the correct 
and ordered way of the cult of the gods , (3) 'moral conduct of 
man.' In the Rgveda rta is not the same as 'satya', but the 
two are differentiated. In Bg. V. 51. 2 the Visve-devas im are 
described as rtadhltayah (whose thoughts are fixed on rta) and v 
' satyadharmanah ' (whose ordinances are true or fixed) and the 
sage prays to them to come to his saorifice and to drink (ajya 
and soma) by the tongue of Agni. In Rg. X 190. 1 both rta 
and satya are said to have arisen from rigorous or refulgent 
tapas ( of the Creator ). In the Rgveda rta involved a very wide 
conception as stated above and ' satya* had a restricted meaning 
viz truth or static order. In Rg. IX. 113. 4 Soma ia described 
as one who proclaims rta, satya and sraddha ( faith ). Therefore, 
Sri. Aurobindo is quite inaccurate when he translates rta by 
the word 'Truth' and draws important conclusions from his 
inaccurate renderings. Similarly, Sri. Aurobindo does not give 
a correct rendering when he translates ( Foreword p XXX) the 
word ' rtaat ' as truth-conscious ( whatever that may mean aco. 
to Sri. Aurobindo). Mr. Kapali Sa3try (p. 46) goes a step further 
than his great master by stating that m the mantras taw know- 
ledge is termed 'rtacit' Truth-consciousness ( with a capital 0). 
It appears that both Master and disciple are misled by the 
meaning of *cit" in such an attribute as 'sat-ciMnanda , 
applied to brahma They appear to take «rta-oit' as meaning 
two distinct things 'rta* and 'cif The word 'rtacit occurs

five times in the Bg. , in" 15 L 145.5, IV. 3.4, V. 3. 9 (' rtacit is here 
an epithet of Agni ), in VH 85.4 (it is an adjective of hotr) 
and in IV. 16. 10 it qualifies the word nari ( in the context, Sapl, 
the wife of Indra ). The present author wonders whether Sri 
Aurobindo and his disciple cared to go into the meaning of 
'rtacit' in the several verses where it occurs. They pay no 
attention to the word ' rnacit ' that occurs in Rg. II. 23. 17 as 
an attribute of Brahmanaspati. 1616 . 

The space at the author's disposal does not allow him to 
show up the other unwarranted propositions and conclusions of 
SrL Aurobindo and Mr. Kapali Sastry. The author will set out 
the final conclusion of SrL Aurobindo ( Foreword p. XXIX ) 
"what then is the secret meaning, the esoteric sense which 

emerges by this way of understanding the Veda? The 

thought around whioh all is centred is the seeking after Truth, 
Light, Immortality. There is a truth deeper and higher than the 
truth of outward existence, a Light greater and higher than the 
light of human understanding which comes by' revelation and 
inspiration, an immortality towards whioh the soul has to rise. 
We have to find our way to that, to get into touch with this 
Truth and Immortality." This is a grand peroration, but all this is 
built on shaky and meagre foundations, such as the wrong mean- 
ings attached to the words rta and rtacit. Mr. Kapali Sastry ( on 
p. 46 ) practically reproduces this grand summing up of his guru- 

Mr. Kapali Sastry launches ( on pp. 22-26 ) a bitter diatribe 
against Sayana but ultimately he has to admit ( pp. 27-28 ) 
that Sayana is not merely useful, but indispensable to the 
students of the Veda. On p. 23 he translates a sutea from 
Jaimini's work ' the purpose of the Veda being ritualistic, words 
which do not have that significance are useless' and remarks that 
this clearly lays down that the only purpose of the Vedas is that 
of ritual, those that do not pertain to that ( ritualistic action ) 
are worthless. The author doubts whether Mr. Kapali Sastry 
has carefully read the Furvamlmansasutras or has at least

correctly stated the position; what he quotes is the Purvapaksa 
view { prima facie view ). Jaimim's position is contained in the 
7thsutra 1617 'as those passages (that do not directly concern 
themselves with ritualistic actions) form one syntaotically 
connected whole with the passages prescribing vidhis they are to 
be considered as commendatory of the vidhis '. Mr Sastry is not 
satisfied with saying ( on p. 8 ) ' the sages Madhucchandas and 
others are seers of the mantra, the Gods were pi esent to the vision of 
these seers of old ', but he adds ' this seer of the beyond is also the 
hearer of the truth, therefore that the poet-seers are truth-hearers 
kavaydh satyahutah, is famous in the Veda' (p. 64). The present 
writer workers whether Mr. Sastry carefully read the original 
passages where the words 'kavayah satyasrutah' occur in the Veda. 
The words kavih and kaoayah occur several hundred times in the

Sn Aurobmdo as a yogm, a prophet and as a World Teacher. But the search 
for truth is higher than all prophets and yogms put together Sri Aurobindo 
and his disciple claim that be has received a new revelation about the Veda 
beyond the ken of all scholars of antiquity and modern times and they have 
very severely bandied Yaska, Jaimim, Sayana and other commentators The 
devotees and admirers of Sri Aurobmdo must allow the same freedom lo the 
critics of Sri Aurobmdo's Vedic lucubrations for showing how and why thoy 
are wrong and are requested not to take umbrage at what the present «""*

Mimahsa generalisation as to Veda 991 

The Mlmansakas made a sweeping generalisation that the 

whole Veda is meant for sacrifice. They went rather too far but 

they had substantial grounds for doing so. On pp. 980-982 of 

the H. of Dh. vol. II. it has been shown how even the Egveda 

discloses that a complicated system of sacrifices with three 

savanas, numerous priests, three fires, existed in those far-off days 

and sacrifices like Atiratra ( Rg. "VII. 103. 7 ) and Trikadruka 

( Eg. I 32. 3, H. 11. 17, VIII. 13, 18, VEQ. 92. 21, X. 14. 16) 

were being performed. The Mlmansakas had a long tradition 

behind them. But the case of Sri Aurobindo's theories is entirely 

different. On flimsy grounds and mistaken meanings he builds 

up an imposing structure of an esoteric and also an esoteric 

meaning of vedic mantras, propounds that the sages wanted 

seorecy for their doctrines and all that they were concerned with 

was Truth, Light and Consciousness. It has been already shown 

that there are several philosophical and speculative hymns in 

the Egveda. But there is no motive of secrecy therein. If it is 

only Truth, Light and Consciousness with which the vedic sages 

were concerned ten thousand verses would not have been 

necessary. One should like to know what secret or higher 

or deeper esoteric Truth or Light or Consciousness to be kept 

concealed from common men is contained in hymns such as 

Eg. VH. 55 (sleeping oharm), VIL 103 (manduka-stuti), X. 34 

(gambler's song), X. 119 (exhilaration of power of Soma on 

Indra), X 166 (invoking destruction of enemies), X. 190 

(brief creation hymn ), X191 (for concord and co-operation ). 

Many more such hymns may be cited, where the theory of 

seorecy and Truth, Light and Consciousness would entirely fail. 

Besides, what is the secret (or spiritual or esoteric) element in 

such passages as those quoted above viz. 1. 164 46, X 129. 2, 

VIII. 58.2, which clearly express the most profound Truth. If the 

Mlmansakas made a too wide generalization, Sri Aurobindo 

makes a fat wider generalization with very little basis 

The mantras of the Egveda have a meaning and are not 
unmeaning letters as often in Tantrik works. There is a discus- 
sion in Nirukta 1. 15-16 where it is said that in the absence of 
the Nirukta the apprehension of the meaning of the words used 
in mantras would not follow and the view of Kautsa is cited 
that the Nirukta is useless for understanding the meaning of 
mantras, since the mantras themselves have no sense ( or are 
useless or purposeless ). Yaska^g" replies that mantras do possess

a meaning since they employ the very same words that are used 
in ordinary Sanskrit, and then quotes a passage of the Ait. Br. 
{ I. 5 ). Sahara on Jai. I. 2, 41 states that where one cannot get 
at the meaning one has to come to some meaning on a con- 
sideration of other Vedic passages and on the basis of roots 
following Nirukta and Grammar. 

One of the important topics dwelt upon at length in the 
Puranas is that of avalaias. This emphasis on the conception 
of avataras has greatly influenced the forms of religious worship, 
vratas and festivals. The subject of avataras has been dealt 
with in the H. of Dh. vol II. pp. 717-734. It has been shown 
there that the beginnings of the doctrine of avataras and of 
some of the well-known avataras may be traced to the Vedio 
Literature viz. to the Satapatha-Brahmana ( story of Manu and 
the fish in I. 8. 1. 1-6), story of Kurma (tortoise) in Satapatha 
VII, 5. 1. 5, of Varaha (Boar) in Sat. Br. XIV. 1. 2. ll, Vamana 
{ Dwarf) in Sat. Br, I. %. 5. 1 ff., Krsna, son of DevakI, in Chan- 
Up. m. 17. 6 and that the number of avataras and the names 
also varied. But the treatment was not exhaustive and hence 
some details are added here from the Puranas and from general 
considerations. 

Avatara (from root tr. with'ava') means 'descending' or 
' descent ' and the word is applied to gods, assuming the form 
of a human being or even of an animal and continuing to live 
in that form till the purpose for which that form was assumed 
was oarried out. Reincarnation is one of the fundamental 
doctrines of Christianity. But there is a vast difference between 
that doctrine and the Hindu theory. Re-incarnation in Chris- 
tianity is Bingle and unique, while in the Hindu theory as 
adumbrated in the Glta (IV. 5-8) and the Puranas there have 
been many incarnations of the Deity and there may he many 
more in future. It is a comforting belief for ordinary men to 
hold that when the affairs of the world are in a mess God comes 
down to the earth to set matters right. And this belief is held 
not only by the Hindus and Buddhists but by many peoples 
( including some in the rich and educated West) far apart from 
each other. Most Hindus, however, do not believe that great

men, saints or prophets like Sankaracarya, Nanak, Shivaji or 
Mahatma Gandhi are born again as avataraa in times of crisis. 
The Buddhists made Buddha in their Mahayana teachings go 
through many avataras as bodhtsattm before he attained Buddha- 
hood. In modern times many persons pose or are made to pose 
as avataras by their admirers or followers Recently, Mr. J. G. 
Bennett (Hodder and Stoughton, 1958) has published a book called 
'Subud' ( Sushila, Buddha, Dharma ) in which he suggests his 
firm belief that one Pak Subuh who hails from Indonesia ia an 
avatar, the messenger from above for whom mankind is waiting. 
The Indian theory of avataras is connected with the theory about 
yugas and manvantaras. When the world is in serious trouble > 
people believe that deliverance will come by the grace of God and 
they aTe often justified in their belief by the appearance of godly 
men who appear with some noble mission and masterly idea 
suited to the particular time and place when they appear. 

In medieval and modern times the avataras of Visnu have 
been regarded as ten, viz. Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, ITrsirhha or 
Narasimha (Man-lion), Vamana, Parasurama, Rama (son of 
DasarathaJ.Kisna, Buddha and Kalkin. The Yaraha-purana 
mentions these ten in that order 1619 In an inscription on the

declines and impiety grows up, I create myself. Age after 
age I am bora for tlie protection of the good, for the destruc- 
tion of evil-doers and the establishment of piety'. The 
same idea occurs in some of the paivans of the Mahabharata, as 
in Vanaparva 272. 71 and Sivamedhika-parva 54. 13. None of 
the ten avataras, except those of Krsna and probably Rama, 
( 'Raman sastrabhrtam-ahain ', GitaX. 31) are, however, men- 
tioned by name in the Bhagavad-glta. The number and names 
of the avataras are not uniform in the Mahabharata. In the 
Narayanlya section of the SSntiparva (chap. 339. verses 77-102) 
only six avataras and their exploits are expressly mentioned, 
viz Varaha (bringing up the earth submerged in the ocean), 
Narasimha (killing demon Hiranyakasipu ), Vamana (van- 
quishing Bali and making him dwell in Patala), Bhargava 
Rfima ( extirpating ksatriyas), Rama, son of Dasaratha (killing 
Havana), Krsna ( killing or vanquishing Kamsa, Harakasura, 
B5na, K&layavana, JaTSsandha, Sisupala). Then the same 
chapter 16M mentions ten avataras as follows: Hamsa, Kurma, 
Matsya, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Eama ( Bhargava ), Rama 
DSsarathi, Satvata, Ealki. Here Buddha is omitted and Krsna 
is called Satvata and Hamsa is added. In the Harivamsa ^ 3 
it is said that the past avataras have been thousands and in 
future also they would be thousands. SSntiparva says the same 
thing. The Harlvamsa (I. 41. 27 ff) names only the following 
and their exploits, viz. Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Dattatreya, 
Jamadagnya (Parasurama), Rama, Krsna and Vedavyaaa. 
But as Kesava is said to be the 9th (1. 41. 6 ) it is to be under- 
stood that Matsya and Kurma were counted, though not 
expressly named and Kalki Visnuyasas is mentioned as a

future avatara. The usual ten avataras are named in Varaha 1624 
(4. 2, 48. 17-22, 55. 36-37), Mataya 285. 6-7, Agni (ohap. 
2-16 atoriea about all ten), Narasimhapurana ( chap. 36 ), Padma 
VI 43. 13-15). In Vayu 98. 68-104 the text presents the 
avataras in a confused manner and appears to mention ten 
avataras, viz. Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Dattatreya, 
Mandhatr, Jamadagnya, Kama ( Dasarathi ), Veda-vyasa, Vasu- 
deva, Kalkin Yisnuyasas. In Brahmanda III. 73. 75 ff there 
are lists of avataras different from the present ten. In the 
Bhagavata the avataras of Visnu are mentioned in several 
places In 1. 3. 1-25 twenty-two avataras including Brahms, 
Devarsi Narada ( who promulgated the Satvata system), Nara- 
Narayana, Kapila (who taught to Asuri the Sankhya system), 
Dattatreya, Bsabha, (son of Nabhi and Merudevi ), 162s Dhanvan- 
tari, Mohinl, Yedavyasa, Balarama and Krsna, Buddha, Kalki 
are mentioned. InlL 7 twenty-three avataras are mentioned, 
many of which are the same as in I. 3, but in II. 7 Dhruva, 
Prthu son of Yena, Hayagrlva are mentioned, the first two of 
which are mentioned as avataras hardly anywhere else. In 
Bhagavata SI. 40. 17-22 the following avataTas are mentioned, 
viz. Matsya, Hayasfrsa, Kurma, Sukara, Narasimha, Yamana, 
Bhargava Sams, Rama, Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, 
Aniruddha, Buddha, Kalki. In Bhagavata XI. 4. 17-22 sixteen 
avataras are set out, viz. usual ten plus Hamsa, Datta 
(Dattatreya ), Kumara (Naiada ), Bsabha, Yyasa and Hayagrlva. 
Twelve avataras are noted in Matsya 99. 14 and Padma Y. 13. 
182-186. The Prapaficasaratantra (ascribed to the great advaita 
teacher Sankaracaiya) mentions ( in Patala 20. 59 ) Matsya, 
Kurma, Varaha, Nrsimha, Kubja (i. e. Yamana), three Eamas 



1624. The passage of Matsya (285. 6-7) is very hkely a later Inter- 
polation, because in another place in the Matsya. the names of avataras are 
different. In Matsya 47. 1.06 there is a reference to the curse on Visnu by 
Bhrgu that since Visnu killed his *»fe he would have to be born 'seven 
times as a human being and the seven avataras are Dattatreya, Mandhata 
Jamadagnya (Bhargava) Rama. Rama Dasarathi, Vedavyasa. Buddha. 
Kalkm and three more (in 47. 237-240), viz. Narayana, Narasimha and 
Vamana are added: in Matsya S4. 15 -19. Naksatrapurusa-vrata is described 
and the usnal ten avataras are named.

( i. e. Bhargavarama, Dasarathi Bama and Balarama }, Ejsna 
and Kalkin ( i. e. it omits Buddha ). The Ahirbudhnya Samhita 
( 5. 50-57 ) enumerates 39 avataras of Vasudeva, that are set out 
by Otto Sohrader in his Introduction to the Pancaratra and the 
Ahirbudhnya Samhita, pp. 42-43. The Visnupurana MM states 
that Lafcsmi follows Visnu in his avataras The Furanas are 
full of the descriptions of the exploits of Visnu in his several 
avataras. But it should not be supposed that Siva had no 
avataras The Vayu (chap. 23) mentions 28 avataras of 
Mahesvara the last of which was Nakull (Lakull) as verso 221 
says. In Varaha 15 10-19 all avataras are praised except that 
of Buddha. But Varaha (48.20-22) provides that worship of 
Narasimha frees men from the fear of sins, of Vamana leads to 
removal of delusion, of Parasurama to wealth, one should 
worship Dasarathi Bama for the destruction of cruel enemies, 
one desirous of a son should worship Balarama and Krsna, one 
who desires a handsome form should worship Buddha and one 
should worship Kalkin for the slaughter of enemies. 1627 The 
Agnipurana ( chap. 49. 1-9 ) describes what characteristics the 
imageB of the ten avataras should possess and says that the 
image of Buddha should be represented as having a quiet face, 
long ear-lobes, fair complexion, wearing an upper garment, 
seated in Padrnasana posture and his hands should have the 
tat ada and abJiaya poses, 

Krom the facts that Ksemendra in his Dasivatara-carita 1628 
(composed in 1066 A. D ), and the Gltagovmda of Jayadeva 
( court poet of Laksmanasena) mention the usual ten avatara3 
with 2?ish as the first and that the Matsya passage about ten 
avataras is quoted by Apararka (first half of 12th century), it 
follows that all the ten avataras of Visnu had become recognised 
throughout India at least about the 10th century A. D.

Avataras in Pur anas and Inscriptions &c. 997 

Kumarila (7th century A. D ) did not accept Buddha as an 
avatara, though about that century some people had come to 
recognize him as such (vide note 1629). Besides, as shown 
above, there were many views about the total number of 
avataras, their names and the order in which they appeared. 
Vide Dr. Katre's paper in Allahabad University Studies, vol. X. 
pp 37-130 for discussion on 33 avataras. The Varaha avatara is 
mentioned in the Eran stone Boar 1629 Inscription of Toramana 
(Gupta inscriptions pp 158-160) in the first quarter of the 6th 
century. The Raghuvamsa ( IV. 53 and 58 ) refers to the recovery 
of land near the Sahya mountain from the Western Sea by Rama 
(Bhargava); vide pp. 89-90 and note 224 above for references 
in the Mahahharata and Puranas to Parasurama's exploits. The 
Sarvanukramaru p 42 on Rg. X, 110 names as rsi Jamadagni or 
his son Rama The Meghaduta mentions the planting of the left 
foot of Visnu on Bali (ie, the Vamana avatara). Magha in 
Sisupala-vadha(XV. 58) regards Bodhisattva ( Buddha) as an 
avatara of Hari and as sought to be tempted by the hordes of 
Mara. Magha 1630 flourished about 725-775 A. D. The know- 
ledge of Vamana and Krsna avataras can be carried back 
centuries before the Mahabhasya of Patanjali, since it refers to 
works and dramatic representations of the imprisonment of Bali 
and the killing of Kamsa (vide pp. 130, 203 and notes 330, 531 
above ). In the Dasavatara cave at Bllora one sees the repre- 
sentations of Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana and Krsna. These 
caves are ascribed to the 8th century A. T>. ltsl Therefore, it 
appears almost certain that some at least (viz. Vamana, Parasu- 
rama and Krsna) of the usual ten avataras had been recognised 
some centuries before Christ and all ten had come to be recognised 
by some writers and other people before the 7th century A D.

998 History of Dharmaiastra I Sao. V, Ch. X22V 

The conception of avataras contributed largely to the 
increase of Dharmasastra material. They gave rise to numerous 
vratas and festivals. For example, the Varahapurana devotes 
chapters 39—48 to dvadasl-vratas in honour of the ten avataraa 
from Matsya to Kalkin. There are separate festivals called 
Jayantls of the avataraa such as Narasimha-jayantl on Vaiaakha 
su 14, Parasurama- jayanti ( on Vaisakha su 3 ) Vide pp. 262- 
263 for the tithis and months in which the different avataraa 
appeared 1631< * 

Descriptions of each of the ten well-known avataras occur 

in several Puranas ; for example, Matsya avatara is described 

in Matsya chap. 1-2, Agni 2, Warasimua 37 , KQrma in Agni 3,

Summary: Portia i«f a men to dana & other topics in Dh. 999 

best to bring together by way of illustration a few of the pages 
of the previous volumes of the History of Dharmasastra on 
these subjects. 

Vide vol IT. pp. 880-881 (for gifts of certain danaa called 
dhmus from Matsya chap. 82, Varaha, chap. 99-110, Agni, chap. 
810), p. 882 (for gifts called parvata or meru from Matsya 83-92. 
Agni 210 quoted by Apararka pp. 344-454), pp. 884-885 (for 
grahasanti from Matsya 93 and about images of planets from 
Matsya 84 ), p. 892 ( for dedication of a reservoir of water to the 
public from Matsya 58), pp. 895-896 for the planting of trees 
and the dedication of a garden to the public ( Matsya 59, Agni 
70), pp. 896-899 (for dedication of temples and consecration of 
images in Matsya 264-266, Agni 60 and 66 ) ; vol. IV. pp. 162-164 
about various hells (Agni 203, 371, Brahma 22, 214-215, 
Brahmavaivarta, Prakrtikhanda 29 and 33, Waradapurana 1. 15, 
Padma IV. 227, Bhavisya, Brahmaparva 192, Bhagavata V. 26, 
Visnu V. 6, Markandeya 12 and 14) ; vol. IV. p. 170 about heaven 
being really happiness of the mind ( Brahma 22. 44 and 47, 
Visnu IV. 6. 46); vol. IV. pp. 177-178 on the doctrine of 
Karmavipaka ( Vamana 12, Markandeya 15, Varaha 203, Vismi- 
dharmottara II. 102); vol. IV. p. 181 on the signs of approaching 
death ( Vayu 19, Linga 91, Mark. 43. 29-39 or chap. 40 of Venk. 
ed. and VisnudhaTmottara 3H. 218) ; vol. IV. p. 212 on cremation 
(Varaha 187, Garuda II. 4 ) ; vol. IV. p. 256 on the persons entitled 
to perform funeral rites ( Visnu III. 13, Mark chap. 30 of B. I. ed. 
and 27 of Venk. ed.); vol. IV. pp. 261-262 the rites after death 
being called purva or nava, madhyama ( navami&ra ) and uttara 
( or purana ) in Visnupuiana DX 13 ; vol IV. p. 265 about an 
ativahika body being assumed by the soul of a dead person 
(Brahma 214, Mark. 16, Agni 230 and 371); vol IV. p. 272 on 
asauca (impurity on birth and death) from Kurma II. 23, Linga 
1. 89, Garuda, pretakhanda 5, Agni 157-158, Vamana 14. It is 
unnecessary to refer to the pages of this volume itself for 
numerous references to Puranas as regards tithis, various vratas, 
times for religious rites, astrological matters &c. 

It should not be supposed that the Puranas are restricted to 
topics called religious in popular parlance and to the five charac- 
teristic topics of creation, re-creation ( sarga, pratisarga &c. ) 
Some of the Puranas contain an exhaustive treatment of the 
duties of kings, ministers, commander-in-chief, judge, envoy 
scribes, court physician and of coronation, invasion &c 



1000 Hmoty of Dhannasasha [ Seo. V, Ch. XXIV 

Many of these matters have already been dealt with in 

vol. III. of the H. of Dh. The most exhaustive treatment 

of what may be called political matters is found in Matsya 

chap. 215-226 and 240, Agni 218-242, Visnudharmottara II, 

chap. 2-7, 18-21, 24-26, 28, 61-63, 66-72, 145-152, 177. Among 

other Puranas Garuda I 108-115, Markandeya 24 (inVenk. 

ed, or 27 in Baner]i's ed ), Kalika 87 contain some discussion 

of matters political It should be noticed that both Matsya 

( 240. 2 ) and Agni ( 228. 1 ) employ the two technical words, 

'Akranda' and ' Parsnigraha ' that are part of the theory of 

Mandate in Kautilya { VI 2 p 260 ) explained in H. of Dh. vol. 

Ill p. 222. The Matsyapurana is profusely quoted by one of 

the earliest extant digests on Dharmasastra viz. the Krtya- 

kalpataru on Rajadharma (pp. 23,25-30,34-38,42-43,55-61, 

118-122, 123-124, 158-161 and many verses from chap 227 and 

241 of the Matsya on the administration of justice in Vyavahara- 

kanda pp. 342, 345, 348, 377, 406, 409-10, 562, 581, 594-95, 599). 

The same digest quotes many verses ( pp. 9-13, 128, 166, 178-181 ) 

from the Brahmapurana which are not found m the printed 

Brahma (Anan. ed.), but which are quoted by the Rajanlii- 

prakasa of Mitramisra (borrowing from Kityakalpataru) pp. 

138, 158, 283, 416-419 and some by the Rajadharmakaustubha 

of Anantadeva (pp. 326-330) The Visnudharmottara on 

rajadharma is not quoted m the Krtyakalpataru on rajadharma, 

but it is frequently quoted by the Rajannuprakasa e. g. Vi. Dh. 

II. 18. 1, 5-14 are quoted by R. N. P. on pp. 32-33, Vi. Dh. H. 

18. 2-4 are quoted by R N. P. p. 61, Vi. Dh. II. 22. 1-185 are 

quoted by E.N.P. pp. 66-81 (on mantras to be recited and 

the several divinities to be invoked at a king's coronation), 

Vi. Dh. II. 23. 1-13 are quoted by R. N. P. on pp. 82-83 

( describing the rewards of the mantras recited in Vi. Dh. II. 

22). Vi. Dh. is quoted 21 times by the Rajadharrna-kaustubha. 

These three Puranas alone ( Matsya, Agni, Visnudharmottara ) 

devote several thousand verses to the topic of raja-dharma 

and allied matters. The Garuda-purana (I. 108-115) devotes 

about four hundred verses to Rajaniti (political thought) 

but many of them are like subhasitas (bon mots) and are 

borrowed from Manu ( e. g. Garuda 1. 109. 1 and 52, 110. 7, li5 - 

63 are respectively Manu VII. 213, VIII. 26, IL 239, IX 3 ), the 

Mahabharata, the Naradasmrfci (e.g. 'nasa sabhi'w Garuua 

115. 52 is Narada HI. 18 ). The Garuda itself states that it wbi 

expound the essence of wti (Rajadharma) based upon Artba- 



Summary ofreferencesto dana and other topicsin EC. o/Dh. 1001 

sastra 1632 and the like; while the colophons at the end of chapters 
108-114 aver that they contain the Nltisara promulgated by 
Brhaspati. One versa is almost the same as the Introductory 
verse 5 of Bana's Kadambart 1633 and I am disposed to hold that 
it is the Garuda that is the borrower. 

Certain verses from the Markandeya-purana ( 24. 5, 23-33 
or ohap. 27 and 21-31 in Banerji's ed. ) are quoted by R. N. P. 
pp. 30-31 ( about the duties of kings and their acting in the 
peouliar ways of five gods, viz. Indra, Surya, Yama, Soma and 
Vayu). The Dayabhaga quoteB the Markandeya-purana for 
pointing out that sdpiifdya in the matter of inheritance and 
succession is different from sapindya for the periods of asauca 
(impurity on death 1 ® 4 ). The Krtyakalpataru on Rajadharma 
( pp. 182-183 } quotes a passage from Skandapurana on the 
festival of Kaumudimahotsava to be celebrated by the king. 
The same passage is quoted by R. N. P. pp. 419-421. 

The Krtyakalpataru ( on Rajadharma) quotes a long passage 
( pp. 201-212 ) from Bhavisyapurana on ' Vasordhara *, whioh is 
quoted by the R N.P. ( pp. 447-457 ) from the DevTpurana. The 
Kalikapurana in chapter 87 devotes 131 verses to RSjanlti, in 
which a summary is furnished of the course of conduct that 
should be followed by the king. This chapter expressly mentions 
the works of TJsanas and Brhaspati ( verses 99 and 130 ) and 
advises the king to honour brahmanas that are advanced in 
knowledge, learning, tapas and age, to control his senses, to 
employ the four upayas ( sama, dana, danda and bheda ), to avoid 
the vices of gambling, drinking, indulgence in sexual matters and 
hunting, to practise the six gunas ( yana, asana &o. ), to test the 
princes, councillors, the queens and other female relatives by 
upadhSs ( inv estigation of character by various tricks). 1635

It appears that Kautilya's Arthasastra was not available 
to most medieval writers and therefore they relied on the puranas 
for the treatment of Rajadharma. But the early purSnas like 
the Matsya appear to have made use of Kautilya's work. Vide 
the author's paper on 'Kautilya and the Matsya-purana' in Dr. 
B. 0. Law presentation volume H. pp. 13-15. 

In the matter of the administration of justice and the law of 
succession and inheritance also some of the Puranas have 
influenced the views of writers of mbandhas. The Krtya- 
kalpataru on Vyavahara quotes about twelve verses from the 
Kalika-purana on the marks of a truthful party or witness and 
on the appropriate ordeals in the case of the several varnas," 36 
their procedure and the different causes of action ( vide pp. 79, 
205,210, 211, 221, 231, 238). Three verses from theKahka 
( chap. 91. 35-37 ) about the twelve kinds of sons and the impro- 
priety of making a punarhhava, svayamdatta and a dasa 
successor to a kingdom are quoted in the R. IT. P. pp. 35 and 42. 
Verses 38-41 of Kahka, chapter 91, about the Bons that can ba 
adopted and the age up to which they can be adopted are quoted 
by the DattakamlmUmsa p. 60 (Snan, ed.) and by the Vyava- 
haramayukha p. 114, though the latter remarks that they were 
not found in two or three mss. of the Purana. 1637 In connection 
with the question of the seniority among twinB the Mayukha 
quotes Srldhara's comment on Bhagavata (III. 19 18) that the 
son born first is the younger one; but the Vyavaharamayukha 163 
makes the interesting remark that in the Purana3 practices 
opposed to the smrtis are frequently seen. 



1636. The throe verses on pp. 210-211 beginning tvltn ' paradarabbi-

CHAPTER XXV 
Causes of the Disappearance of Buddhism from India. 

At the beginning of Chapter XXIV (pp. 913-14, n 1448) 
above, it was stated that the Furanas had a large share in 
bringing about the final disappearance of Buddhism from 
India, the land of its birth. The disappearance of Buddhism 
from India was complete and seemed to be sudden and is a com- 
plex problem. No single cause, nor even a few causes can fully 
account for this phenomenon. A combination of causes, both 
internal and external, must have been in operation for a pretty- 
long time to bring about this remarkable event. It may be 
admitted that some of the causes are more or les3 conjectural. 
In the first quarter of the 5th century A. D. Fa-Hian found 
Buddhism in a flourishing condition in India, while in the first 
half of the 7th century A.D. Yuan Chwang appears to say that 
the decline of Buddhism had set in. It-sing found Buddhism 
very much on the decline in the beginning of the 8th century 
A.D. An attempt will be made here to discuss briefly the several 
causes that have been put forward by scholars for explaining the 
almost total disappearance of Buddhism from India. A few of 
the contributions bearing on this subject may be noted here.

1004 History of Dharaiaiastm [Sec, V.ChXXV 

Before setting out the main causes of the virtual disappear- 
ance of Buddhism from India certain general points have to bo 
emphasized. Buddha was only a great reformer of the Hindu 
religion as practised in his time. He did not feei or claim that 
he was forming a new religion, nor did he renounce the Hindu 
religion and all its practices and beliefs. The Buddha referred 
to the Vedas and Hindu sages with honour in some of his 
sermons. He recognised the importance of Yogic practices and 
meditation. His teaching took over several beliefs current 
among the Hindus in his day suoh as the doctrine of Karma and 
Rebirth and cosmological theories. A substantial portion of the 
teaching of Buddha formed part of the tenets of the Upanisadio 
period. At the time when he was born there were two main 
currents of thoughts and practices prevalent among the people, 
one being the path of sacrifices to Gods and the other being the 
path of moral endeavour, self-restraint and spiritual goal. It has 
been shown above (pp. 917-918) how the Upanisads assigned a 
lower position to the Vedas and the sacrifices enjoined therein and 
how spiritual knowledge after cultivating high ethical qualities 
was deemed greater than sacrifices. The Upanisads first 
began by symbolical interpretation of Vedic sacrifices, as for 
example in Br. Up. 1. 1. 1, where Usas, Snrya and Samvaisara 
are said to be respectively the head, the eye and the soul of 
the saorifioial horse or as in Chan. Up H. 2. 1-2, where the 
five parts of the Saman employed in a sacrifice are symbolically 
identified with earth, fire, sky, sun and heaven. Then thoy 
proceed to belittle the Veda as mere name and as much inferior 
to brahmmtdya (e. g. Br. Up, 3V. 4. 21, I. 4.10, Chan. Up. VII. 
1-4, Mundaka 1. 1. 4-5. It is generally held by all Sanskrit 
scholars that at least the oldest Upanisads like the Brhada- 
ranyaka and the Chandogya are earlier than Buddha, that thoy ' 
do not refer to Buddha or to his teachings or to tho pitakas. On 
tbe other hand, though in dozens of Suttas meetings of brahmanos 
and Buddha or his disciples and missionaries are reportod they 
almost always seem to he marked by courtesy on both sidoa. No 
meetings are recorded in the early Pali Texts or brahmanical 
Texts about Sakyans condemning tho tenets of ancient brahma- 
nism or about brahmanas censuring the Bauddba heterodoxy. 
Besides, in all these meetings and talks, tho central Upanisad 
conception of the immanence of brahma is novor attacked hy 
Buddha or by the early propagators of Buddhism. What Buddha 
says may be briefly rendered as follows. "Even so haval, 
BhikkhUB, seen an ancient path, an ancient road followodby 



Buddha proclaimed only an ancient path 1005 

lightly enlightened persons of former times. And what, O 
Bhikkhus, is that ancient path, that ancient road, followed by 
the rightly enlightened ones of former times ? Just this very 
Noble Eightfold Path, viz. right views ..&o. This, O Bhikkhus, 
is that ancient path, that ancient road, followed by the rightly 
enlightened ones of former times. Along that (path) I have 
gone and while going along that path, I have fully come to know, 
old age and death. Having come to know it fully, I have told it 
to the monks, the nuns, the lay followers, men and women ; this 
brahmacarya is prosperous, flourishing, widespread, widely known, 
has become popular and made manifest well by gods and 
men."" 39 It will be noticed that the Noble Eightfold Path which 
the Buddha put forward as the one that would put an end to 
misery and suffering is here expressly stated to be an ancient 
path trod by ancient enlightened men. Buddha does not claim 
that he was unique, but claimed that he was only one of a series 
of Enlightened men and stressed that the moral qualities which he 
urged men to cultivate belonged to antiquity. In the Dhamma- 
pada and the Suttanipata (Mahavagga, Vasettha sutta) the truly 
virtuous man is spoken of as brahmana:'. "I speak of him as 
brahmana, who causes no harm (or evil) in body, word and 
thought, who is guarded as regards these three sources " ; ' neither 
by matted hair nor by lineage, nor by caste, does one become a 
brahmana'; * that man in whom there is truth and righteousness 
is blessed and is a brahmana', 'him who does not cling to desires 
(or pleasures) as water does not stick to a lotus leaf or as 
a mustard grain (does not stick) on the top of an awl, I call a 
brahmana.'" 4 " Moreover, it does not appear that at any time

the whole of India or even large portions of it were completely 
Buddhistic The people of India as a whole were always 
Hindus. 1641 . There were many millions of people at all times 
who professed Hinduism and not Buddhism. Bssides, even 
when Buddhism secured the patronage of emperors like Asoka, 
Kaniska and Harsa Buddhism was mainly restricted to mona- 
steries and schools and great tolerance prevailed. l?or example, 
Harsa's father was a great devotee of the Sun and he himself is 
described in his Banskhera and Madhuban plates as a great 
devotee of Siva, though his elder brother Rajyavardbana is 
described as pat amasaugat a ( a great devotee of Buddha) and he 
appears to have shown favour to the Buddhist pilgrim (Yuan 
Chwang). 1612 

Some recent authors like Prof K. W. Morgan hold that the 
most important causes of the disappearance of Buddhism were 
decline of vigour in the Sangha, the Moslem invasions and the 
opposition of the Hindu community (' The Path of the Buddha" 
p. 48). 

There is a good deal of truth m A. Ooomaraswamy's con- 
tention that the more profound is one's study of Buddhism and 
Brahmanism the more difficult it becomes to distinguish between

not mention that Rajyavardhana was a great devotee of Buddha but he 
tries to paint Harsa as full of faith in Buddha from the beginning and 
narrates a fictitious story describing how Harsa was prevented from mount- 
ing the throne and induced to tako the title Kumara by a Bodbisattva wno 
miraculously appeared to him in return for his worship This shows tba

the two or to say in what respects Buddhism is really unortho- 
dox (vide his 'Hinduism and Buddhism' p. 452). Buddha and 
his successors really attacked some popular varieties of Brahma- 
nism. Mrs. Rhys Davids in her lecture on 'The relations 
between Early Buddhism and Brahmanism' (published in I. H.Q. 
vol. X pp. 274-386 ) endeavours to show that the Tripitakas do 
not refer to rupture with brahmanas and that what Buddha 
preached was in agreement with the central tenet of immanence 
in the Brahmanism of the day. Buddha agreed (or at least had 
no quarrel) with the Upanisad teaching about high moral 
endeavour being a necessary pre-requisite for brahma realization 
and moksa (as in Br. Up. IV. 4.23 ' tasmgd-evamvicchanto 
danta upratas-titiksuh samahito bhutva atmanyevatmanam 
pasyati', Katha Up. I. 2. 23, 1. 3, 8, 9, 13, 15, Prasna Up. 1. 15-16, 
Mundaka T. 2. 12-13 ). 

The main matters of controversy between Buddha and the 
Hindu religious and philosophical system current in his time 
are generally held to have been caste divisions and pride of 
caste, the absolute authoritativeness of the Vedas and the great 
importance attached to sacrifices. lftBa Buddha asserted that 
righteousness and wisdom were the best, he did not expressly 
deny the existence of God but proclaimed that it was unnecessary 
to be definite nor did he pronounce his definite views on such 
questions as whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, since 
according to him, to cogitate on suoh points would be " a thicket 
of theorizing, wilderness of theorizing, the tangle of theorizing, 

the bondage and shackles of theorizing nor would it 

conduce to aversion, passionlessness, tranquillity, peace, 
illumination and nirva,uz."™z Buddha did not think much 



1642a. Barth in 'Religions of India 1 (pp. 135-126) scouts the 
tneory that the institution of the Sahgha and primitive Buddhism were a 
reaction against the regime of caste and the spiritual yoke of the brahmanas. 
ana calls that theory ' a fiction of romance •

of worship or prayer. According to him, what mattered was 
the deliverance of man from sorrow and suffering and tho 
attainment of nirvana 1613 * ( which state he did not care to define 
clearly and precisely ). The original dootrine (called hinayana, 
' the lesser way or vehicle ' ) held that the experience of enlighten- 
ment and mrvana can be secured by human beings m this very 
life if they follow the path chalked out by Buddha. 

The causes that have been advanced from time to time by 
scholars for the total disappearance of Buddhism from India 
must now be dealt with. (1) Persecution is alleged by some 
soholars as at least one of the main causes. King Pusyamitra 
of the Sunga dynasty is charged with having proclaimed that 
whoever would bring to him the head of a siamarta would 
receive one hundred dinaras; 1&iA Mihirakula, king of Kashmir, 

1643 a. The word ' Nirvana ' literally means ' blown out, extinguished, 
or become cooled '. Taking the view most favourable to Buddha's teaching, 
it implies the blowing out or extinction of the fires of bama ( lust or desire ), 
krodha (anger or ill-will), moha (ignorance or stupidity) and transfor- 
mation of these into moral purity, goodwill { or charity ) and wisdom. It is 
not like the Biblical Heaven It is a state of perfect enlightenment, peace 
and bliss, attainable not merely after death, but m this very life and on this 
earth. It is really indescribable as stated in the Pali UdSna VIII ' nn-

in these stories, but adds that he does not go so far as to 
maintain that there is no truth at all in the legend about 
Pusyamitra (but judgment must be reserved in view of the text 
in the aoadana being corrupt and the author of it being 
grossly ignorant). As to the legend about Sudhanvan 
and Kumarila he holds that of all the cases of alleged 
persecution this is the weakest and that it is no more than 
boastful and rhetorical exaggeration 1615 Rhys Davids 
emphasizes that the adherents of both faiths so diametrically 
opposed to each other lived in continuous peace side by side 
fox a thousand years, that thiB redounds to the credit 
of the whole Indian people from the time of Asoka 



1643. In the ji^Qft-MJf of mvpir^rf It Is stated ( I 56 and 59 ) that 
king Sudhanvan was an avatars of Indra and Kumarila of Skanda ( who is 
also known as Kumara). The order of Sudbanvan ia couched in that work

This seems to be a palpably absurd legend. No king in ancient India, much 
less one called Sudhanva, ruled over the vast territory from tho Himalayas 
to Eamesvara. Further, it may be noted that tho order, supposing ono wa« 
issued, was addressed only to tho king's servants and not to ono and all. 
The Sankaradigvijaya (XV. 1 ) states that when Sanknracarya started on a 
pilgrimage to Ramesvara king Sudhanvan accompanied him. Madliavii- 
carya. being blinded by his zeal to glorify his hero to the utmost, goes on 
heaping one legend on another and casts all history and chronology to tho 
winds. For example, ho narrates that Acarya Abhinavagupta (a u" at 
Saiva and Tantrika teacher) was vanquished by Sankara in disputations 
(XV. 158) and that Abhinavagupta practised black magic against tho groat 
Acarya. From Abhtnavagupta's own works it appears that his literary 
activity lay between 980 to 1020 A D. (vide the author's 'History of 
Sanskrit Poetics'. 1951, pp 231-232), while no scholar would place 
Sankaracarya later than 800 A D Madhavacarya also says (XV. 157 ) that 
Sankara vanquished by his arguments Sriharw, author of Khanelanakhamto. 
khadya, who could not be vanquished by Guru, Bhafta and Udayana 
Sriharsa flourished about the end of tho 12th century A D. Taranath in 
his ' History of Buddhism ' says ■ It was probably about this timo that tho 
terrible enemies of the Buddhists, Sankaracarya and his disciple BbatU- 
carya appeared, the former in Bengal and tho latter in Orissa. A «MH

the cases of persecution. Barth ( in 'Religions of India p. 136 ) 
admits that everything tends to prove that Buddhism became

defects that we must seek for the causes of its disappearance. 
He prefaces this remark with the words 'the most reliable

exceptionally generous on the part of the civil powers' (p. 133) and 
illustrates this by examples. 1 " 5 " It should be noted that great 
Smrtikaras like Yajnavalkya laid down that when an Indian 
king reduoed a kingdom to subjection, it was the conquerors 
duty to honour the usages, the transactions and family tradi- 
tions of the conquered country and to protect them. Asoka,

^ISHTOBll. Nothing is gained by a total denial ol even sporadic cases of 
religious persecution and vandalism. But such cases are very few and 
their very paucity emphasizes and illuminates the great religious tolerance 
of the Indian people for more than two thousand years. One interesting 
instance is found in an inscription from Ablur published in £ I vol. V 
pp 213 ff( at p. 243), where the story is told of an intense devotee of 
Saivism named Ekantada Rama, who, in a controversy with the Jainas of 
Hungers ( Laksmesvara ) led by a village headman named Sahkagauda made 
a wager in a writing on palmyra leaf to the effect that he would cut his own 
head, place it at the feet of Somanatha in Huligere and have the head 
restored after seven days and that, if he succeeded, the Jains were to give np 
their faith and God. Ekantada Rama succeeded, but the Jainas refused to 
destroy the image of Jma, whereupon Rama routed the horses and guards 
sent by the Jainas, laid waste the Jaina shrine and built a big Siva shrine 
there. The Jainas complained to king Bijjala who sent for Rama and 
questioned him Rama produced the writing containing the terms of the 
wager, but offered to perform the same feat. The Jainas were not prepared 
to face the same test again Bijjala asked the Jainas to live peaceably with 
their neighbours, gave a jayapatra ( document of Rama's success ) and 
granted a village to the temple of Somanatha. It is clear that a Jain image 
was overthrown and a Saiva one was substituted by Rama (leaving aside 
the superhuman feat ascribed to him ) Rama is to be placed shortly 
before 1162 A. D. There is a great difference between local brawls as in 
the above case and a general policy by a community or a king of wholesale 
persecution. '

tolerance by requiring honour to be shown to all beliefs and 
sects in his 12th Bock Edict in the words 'Neither praising 
one's own sect nor blaming other sects should take place,' that 
'other sects ought to be duly honoured in every case', that 
'concord (samavaya) alone is meritorious, that is they should 
both hear and honour each other's Dhamma' 1616 In the 7th 
Pillar Edict (Delhi-Topra p 136) Asoka proclaims that he 
appointed officers called Mahamatras to look after the Sangba 
(the community or body of preaching Buddhist mendicants), 
brahmanas, Ajlvikas, Nigganthas and all other pasanfas (seots). 
India has been for thousands of years a country of nearly 
absolute tolerance, which is literally a religion, while European 
religiosity has nearly always been intolerant and, when not 
intolerant, it is tantamount to mental hostility or complete 
indifference Most Indian religious people were and are ready 
to agree that there may be alternative approaches to the mystery 
of life and the salvation of the soul Indians feel amused at the 
claims of millions of people that some prophet revered by them 
has got the monopoly of the knowledge of God and the Here- 
after. This tolerance for differing tenets and cults persisted 
in India with rare exceptions throughout the long stretch of 
time from centuries before Asoka onwards till about 1200 A. D. 
when Moslems overran India. A few striking instances (both 
early and late ) may be cited here : ( 1 ) Kharavela again, a Jain 
king of Kalinga ( 2nd or 1st century BO), granted freedom from 
taxation to brahmanas in the 9th year of his reign (E I vol 
XX p. 79 and 88 ) ; ( 2 ) The Nasik cave Ins No. 10 records that 
Usavadata, son-in-law of Ksatrapa Nahapana of the Ksaharata 
lineage made very large gifts to gods and brahmanas on the 



1646. Vide ' Inscriptions of Asoka ' ed by Dr. Hultzsch ( 1925 ) pp. 
30-21 for the text and translation of the Hock Edict from Girnar. Dr 
Minakshi in ' Administration and Social life under the Pallavas ■ ( Univer- 
sity of Madras, 1938, pp 170-172) after remarking that Paltava monarcus 
as a class were tolerant towards all religious sects, points out that king 
Pallavacnalla indulged m some harsh methods and persecution. Prof. 
Arnold Toynbee in ' East and West ' (Oxford Urn Press) points out that 
Christianity and Islam have seldom been content to follow the practice o 
•live and let live' and that both of them have been responsible for some of 1 1 « 
bitterest conflicts and cruellest atrocities that have disgraced history <p W

General tolerance for all faiths m India 1015 

The above examples show that in all parts of India in the 
North as well as in the South, the general rule among kings and 
their officers was tolerance and care for all faiths. If there was 
rarely some perseoution it was hy an individual king or officer 
or the like. On the other hand, though Asoka, as an inheritor 
of the Indian royal tradition of showing honour and respect to 
all faiths of the subjects irrespective of his own religious views, 
breathes a striking spirit of tolerance in his 7th and 12th Rock 
edicts, one cannot help a suspicion that in the later part of his 
life he seems to gloat over the fact that the gods worshipped as 
divinities in Jambudvlpa had been rendered false and he proudly 
proclaims that this result is 'not the effect of my greatness hut 
of my zeal". 

It should be noted that even Asoka's ahimsa was at first not 
thorough-going but qualified. In his first Rock Edict he himself 
states that in his royal kitchen thousands of animals were killed, 
but that he had reduced the slaughter to two peacocks a day 
and one deer (that too rarely) and that even the three animals 
would not be killed in future (vide Oil. vol. I. pp 1-2). 
Whether this last promise was really carried out is not clear. 
Besides, Asoka appears to have carried his solicitude for the 
protection of all life too far and used against human beings his 
absolute power like a dictator. In the 4th Delhi Topra Pillar edict 
( 0. 1. 1., vol. I p. 124) he mentions that his revenue settlement 
officers called Lajukas had to deal with many hundred thousands 
of men and were given the discretion to award punishments 
including the death sentence and that a respite of three days was 
allowed in which the relatives of the man condemned to death 
could persuade the lajukas to grant reprieves. In the fifth 
iJettu-Topra pillar edict (ifod. pp 125-128), after 26 years of his 
Demg anointed he declared that 23 kinds of birds and other 
ammals (such as parrots, mamas, ruddy and wild geese, doves, 
certam kmds of fish, tortoises) were not to he killed at all, that 
ewes and sowb that were with young or were in milk or the 
young of these that were less than six months old were also not 
to be killed; he also forbade the sale of fish on certain Full Moon 
days and the days previous to them and following them, the 
castration of bulls, rams, horses on 8th, 14th and 15th days of a 
month and the branding of horses and bulls on Pusya and 
funarvasn and on caturmasls These sweeping regulations must

when all discretion was left to the lajukas. Later in life Asoka 
appears to have tried to undeimine the worship of Hindu Gods. 
In a Eupnath Bock Inscription 1649 published by Buhler in I. A. 
vol. "VT pp. 154r-156 it was stated that he had been an upasaku 
(lay worshipper of Buddha) for certain years but that he was 
not zealous, that for a year or more (he had become zealous), 
that during that (last interval) those gods that were held 
to be true gods in Jambudvlpa (i e. India) had been made 
(to be regarded as) false and that was the reward of his zeal. 
This could be construed as saying that when he became a 
zealous Buddhist he tried to dissuade people from the

nath and six other places are quoted here ( there are slight variations and 
some omissions in almost all of them here and there ) ; I follow tho reading

is the result of zeal ; it cannot be attained by greatness ( by one occupying a 
merely high position ) , even for a small person it is possible to reach 
heaven by zeal. ' Mr. Ramcbandra Diksbitar in Prof Rangaswami 
Aiyangar Presentation volume pp. 25-30 argues that As'oka was a Hindu as 
he refers to ' Svarga ' This is not correct, since the edict itself recites that 
Asoka had been a lay follower of Buddha for more than 2J years before tlie 
date of the edict and that for more than a year before it be approached the 
community of monks and became a zealous Buddhist ( or probably a monk J 
Even early Pali works speak of Gods from heaven coming to pay respect to 
Buddha. So the mere mention of svarga means little. Asoka does not 
appear to have been trained in the sacred Pah books if any existed. IW 
hardly ever mentions nirvana, never mentions fundamental tcntts of ear j 
Buddhism ( in alt his numerous edicts ) like the Four Noble Truths or u> B 
Noble Eight-fold Path or Pralltya samutpzda Hi was probably attracted b) 
Buddha's teachings on moral endeavour and subscribed to them and dull" 
sacrifices. He appears to have believed in gods and desired that the people 
should strive for heaven (vide Glh Rock edict at Cirnar 'ijrj "3 H™ 
antnpng • and similar words in the 10th Rock edict J This is all <bat « 
be said positively. 



Asoka's coerabe measures 1017 

worship of gods and probably resorted to coercive measures 
in that direction. This very inscription is edited at 
0. 1 I , Vol. I. pp 166 by Dr. Hultzsch and the translation of 
the important sentence is changed and is given as 'And 
those gods who during that time had been unmingled with men 
m Jambudvlpa have now been made (by me) mingled with 
them; for this is the fruit of zeal '. This new translation cannot 
be understood as it stands and on p 168 (note 3) Hultzsch 
admits that this sentence is enigmatical and tries to show that 
it refers to religious shows at which effigies of gods were shown 
in order to convey to the subjects that they would be able to 
reach the abodes of gods by the zealous practice of Buddha's 
Dharama. This interpretation is extremely far-fetched and does 
not fit into the context How can the mere showing of exhibi- 
tions and their effect on people be regarded as the reward of 
zeal * Besides, in the very first rock edict he forbids assemblies 
orfestival meetings ( 0. 1. 1, vol. I. p. 1 ' na ca samajo kattavyo ) ' 
except such as were regarded good by Asoka and asserts that 
the king sees great evil in festival meetings. Asoka probably 
followed what Ap. Dh. S. 1. 11. 32. 19 provides for Vedic house- 
holders 'sabhah samajamsca' (varjayet), sabha meaning 
' gambling hall '. The author is not satisfied with the translation 
of Hultzsch, particularly when Buhler and Senart (pp. 168 note) 
agreed as to the meaning of the important sentence about 
gods. 1650 

About Emperor Harsa also Yuan Ohwang narrates that he 
caused the use of animal food to cease throughout the five 
indies and he prohibited the taking of life under severe penalties 
(vide Waiters' work cited above p. 344) This also must have 
oeen felt by large populations as coercive and bordering on 
persecution. It is remarkable that Haisa felt no qualms in 
reconciling his zeal for bird and animal life and keeping vast 
armies on a war footing for conquest.

A few more striking examples of tolerance of other faithi 
and spirit of accommodation may be cited here. The great 
Hindu emperor Samudragupta allowed the building of a splendid 
three-storied convent at Bodh Gaya at the request of the 
Buddhist king Meghavarna of Ceylon about 360 A. D Vide 
'Early History of India* by V. A. Smith (4th ed. of 1924 
pp. 303-304), where the historian further points out that when 
Yuan Ohwang visited Bodh Gaya, that convent wa3 a magni- 
ficent establishment occupied by a thousand monks. One 
Muhammad TTfi relates an anecdote Though Mahomed of Gazm 
plundered Kafchiawad and Gujarat several times and desecrated 
temples, the Hindus made a distinction between such invading 
and destructive marauders and peaceful Muslims residing in 
Gujarat for trade. Some Hindus at Cambay, being incited by 
some Parais, destroyed a mosque and killed some Muslima One 
Muslim that escaped approached the king Siddhawja with a 
petition. The king in disguise inquired into the matter, punished 
the offenders, gave to the Moslems one lakh of Balotras to 
rebuild the mosque and presented to the Khatib four articles of 
dress which were preserved in the mosque. Iffi declares that he 
never heard a story comparable to this. Vide Elliotts 1 History 
of India, Vol H pp 163-163. The Somanath-Fattan Inscription 
(in I. A. Vol XI p. 241) is a most remarkable document, A 
Muslim ship-owner from Hormuz acquired a piece of land in the 
sacred town of Somanath-pattan, built a mosque, a bouso and 
shop3 thereon. The purpose of the grant W33 to confirm the 
purchase and to provide for the application of the income from 
the shops for particular Moslem religious festivals to be cele- 
brated by the Shia sailors of Somanath and to provide that the 
surplus left, if any, wa3 to be made over to the sacred town3 of 
Mecca and Medina. It is dated in four eras, first inEasul 
Mahammad sanaat i e Hijra year 662, then Vikrama tamuU 
1320 (1264 AD.), Valabhl year 945 and Simha samvatlsl 
(i e. probably of Calukya Siddharija Jayasimha). S7mn 
Christians were given special privileges by gonerou3 Hindu 
rulera in South India. 

The above examples will indicate what tolerance was 
practised by Indian kings and people even in the nwdiaaw 
period when Moslem invaders were ruthlessly ^^^t

without molestation, from Hindu Pandits and people vast

How intolerant most Moslem kings were need not be dwelt 

upon at length. A few typical examples may be cited from the 

Cambridge History of India, vol. HI. Firuz Shah Tughlak burnt 

a brahmana who tried to propagate his religion ( %bid. p. 187 ) ; 

Sikander Lodi did the same ( ibid p. 246 ) to a brahmana and 

was guilty of wholesale destruction of Hindu temples ; Sultan 

Sikandar of Kashmir offered his subjects the choice between 

Islam and exile ( ibid p 380 ) ; Hussein Shah of Bengal sent an 

army to destroy Navadvipa and converted many brahmanas 

forcibly Jehangir says in his 'Memoirs' (translated by A. 

Rogers and edited by H Beveridge, 1909 pp. 72-73) that he 

killed Guru Arjun for his religious activities. Vide ' History of 

Aurangzeb' by Jadunath Sarkar vol III. chap. XXX pp. 265-279 

for firmans to demolish temples such as those of Somanatha, 

Mathura, Visvanatha in Benares, TTjjain and Appendix Y. It 

is not necessary to go into great details about the terrible 

persecution of the Jews in Europe and the horrible deeds of the 

Inquisition in Europe and particularly in Spain and Portugal. 

For the persecution and expulsion of the Jews in Europe one may 

read 'A short History of the Jewish people' by Cecil Roth 

(MacMillan and Co 1936 ) chapters XX-XXI References to 

several works have been given above on p. 933 note 1494 

about the Inquisition A few instances of the intolerance and 

barbarities of that body may be cited The Inquisition staged 

what are called acts of faith or ' autos-da-f<§ '. In the presence of 

thousands of people severe punishment would be inflicted on 

harmless individuals whose adherence to the Holy Catholic faith 

was suspected Those that professed penitence were stripped of 

their property and condemned to imprisonment, deportation or 

tne galley. The minority who refused to confess to their crime of 

heresy or gloried in their views would be burnt at once. Kings 

and nobles graced such spectacles by their presence and such 

spectacles were arranged at the marriages of high persons or on 

me birth of a son to the reigning monarch During the three 

centuries when the Inquisition was active, it is found that the 

it cond 6mned ^bout 375000 people, of whom at least one-tenth

force ' (1878) pp. 426-427 remarks 'The whole system of tho 
Inquisition was such as to render resort to torture inoyitablo. 
Its proceedings were seoret, the prisoner was carefully kept in 
ignorance of the exact charges against him and of the evidonco 
on which they were based. He was presumed to bo guilty and 
his judges bent all their energies to force him to confess. To 
accomplish this no means were too base or too cruel ' 

It would be instructive to read what the state of Hindus 
was under Portuguese rule in Goa, where the infamous Inquisi- 
tion was established in 1560 A D. and continued its intolerant 
and inhuman work for about 250 years more. Thoso interested 
may consult ' A India Portuguesa ', vol. II. published by tho 
Portuguese Government in 192-i, particularly the paper by 
Antonio de Noronha, a former judge of the High Court of Goa, 
on 'Os Indus de Goa* pp. 211-355. A brief passage from a paper 
on ' Historical essay on the Konkani Language ' by J H. do 
Cunha Rivara, who was General Secretary to tho Portuguoso 
Governor General in India from 1855 to 1870 A D., is vory 
illuminating. It runs (original in Portuguese) 'we shall now 
endeavour to investigate the causes, which under the Portuguoso 
regime, were either favourable or contrary to the culture of tho 
Konkani language. In the first ardour of conquest templos woro 
demolished, all the emblems of the Hindu cult woro destroyed 
and hooks written in the vernacular tongue, containing or 
suspected of containing idolatrous precepts and doctrines, wore 
burnt There was even the desire to exterminate all that part 
of the population which could not be quickly converted; thw 
was the desire not only during that period, but thoro was also 
at least ono person who, after a lapse of two centmies, advised 
the Government, with magisterial gravity, to mako uso of such 
a policy.' The writer further notes that tho long distanco of 
Goa from Portugal, the invincible resistance oftorod by a 
numerous population amongst whom the principal castoshad 
reached a very high degree of civilization, obliged tho conquerors 
to abstain from open violence and to prefer indirect, though not 
gentle, means to achieve tho samo end ,650a .

suffering, his subsequent mortification of the body for yeara, 
his retirement into solitude for meditation, his struggle with 
Mara and final victory, his confidence that he had discovered 
the path of deliveranoe, his. constant travels from city to 
city and village to village for about forty-five years for 
preaching the great truths he had discovered, his crusade 
against the slaughter of innocent and dumb animals in sacri- 
fices, his passing away full of years and in peace and content- 
ment - this panorama of Buddha's life had a noble grandeur and 
irresistible human appeal Edwin Arnold in his preface (p. XIII} 
to his poem 'Light of' Asia' (1884) pays a very eloquent 
tribute to Buddha's teaching in the following words 'this vener- 
able religion which has in it the eternity of an universal hope, 
the immortality of a boundless love, an indestructible element 
of faith in the final good and the proudest assertion ever made 
of human freedom'. The torch lighted by Buddha was kept 
burning brightly by a succession of able and worthy disciples 
till Buddhism reached its peak about the 6th century A. D. A 
reaction had already begun by that time. Substantial changes 
in the old Buddhist faith had been made, the ideals had changed 
(as noted above). From being a faith without a clear accep- 
tance of God, many sects arose that had become thoroughly 
theistio and Buddha himself came to be worshipped as if he were 
God and the sects were gripped by the strange doctrines and 
evil practices of Vajrayana Tantrik sects; and Buddhism 
became a medley of conflicting dogmas and was riven with dis- 
sensions and internecine rupture. Discussions as to doctrines 
arose immediately on the passing away of Buddha, when the 
first council was held at Rajagrha, a second one being held about 
one hundred years later at Vesali and a third one at Pataliputra 
under Asoka In all four councils appear to have been held to 
secure 'sanglti' (standardized scriptural recital) according to 
traditions, but no Pali book can be traced back to a time before 
one council held in the time of Asoka ( about 350 B. C ) These 
discussions and subsequent schisms very much undermined 
■Buddhism. This is mentioned as the first of the four main 
oauses of ■the decline and disappearance of Buddhism from India 
oy JN. J O Connor.

S! ■ mt ° T Mal ind8pendent but small and warring States 
iJudahjsm could not secure the favour and patronage of powerful 
and zealous monarchs and emperors like Asoka, Kaniska and 



1022 History of Dharmasasti a [Sec V,Ch.XXV 

Harsa Royal patronage on a large scale having ceased from 
the end of the 7th century A D , except under the Pala kings of 
Bengal, Buddhism began to wane 

IV Many of the ablest and most vigorous exponents of 
Buddhist thought and faith left India for propagating their faith 
in other lands Dr. Eadhakrishnan in ' India and China ' names 
24 eminent Indian scholars who went to China for propagating 
Buddha's teachings from the 3rd Century A D to 973 A. D. 
(p 27) and also mentions a few Chinese scholars who came to 
India for visiting the sacred places of Buddhism and for making 
a study of Buddhism on the spot ( ibid, pp 27-28 ) 

Y. The observance of the high moral ideals inoulcated by 
Qotama Buddha must have been found irksome by at least a 
great many of his followers, and particularly after his personal 
example ceased to exist In the Mabaparimbbanasutta ( S. B. E. 
vol XI. p 127 ) we are told that Subhadda, a barber who had 
been received in the Order in his old age, addressed the brethren, 
that deeply mourned and lamented on Buddha's nirvana, ai 
follows : " Weep not, neither lament "We are well rid of the 
Great Samana We used to be annoyed by being told 'this 
becomes you, this beseBms you not ' But now we shall be ablo 
to do whatever we like; and what we do not like that we shall 
not have to do " Ordinary people could not be fed for long on 
mere repetition of the sermon on suffering being the lot of man, 
on monasticism, aversion to speculation and on promises of 
nirvana which was hardly ever well defined By nirvana 
Buddha probably meant extinction of egoism and desires, a state 
of bliss beyond understanding and not a complete annihilation 
or extinction But this last was the sense in which many under- 
stood it Buddha had an aversion to speculation and parti- 
cularly to issues that were irrelevant to his purely moral 
approach and purpose. Several questions of a metaphysical or 
speculative character suoh as whether the world is permanent or 
not whether it is finite or not, whether the soul is the samo as tho 
body or other than the body, whether the Tathagata continued 
after death or not were left unanswered by Buddba ( vido 
Maijhima NikSya, discourse 63, Trencknor's od vol I. ) Mona- 
staries of Buddhist monks and nuns became in course of t.mu 
centres of idleness, pleasures and immorality, and of doto* 
practices like those of Vajrayana Tantricism A ■ «f ;™ n

Debased state of Buddhist monasteries 1023 

Journal Asiatiq,ue vol. 235 ( 1934 ) pp. 209-230 was constrained 
to say " The monasteries and temples were gorged with riches 
due to the pious offerings made hy the multitudes. The life of 
the monk became more comfortable than that of the layman. 
The discipline weakened and many unfit persons entered the 
community. 1651 The easy life associated with the culture of a 
sensual art under the cover of cultured paintings, meditation, 
gods and goddesses mu3t have inclined the minds towards 
sensuality. Already from the Kathavatthu 1651 * (XXTEI. 1) we 
know that the Andhaka School was disposed to permit Maithuna 
( copulation ) for a special object ; it was introduced in the mystic 
cult Coming to the south, the practice of mantras, psychical 
practices, and a certain indulgence in the pleasures of sense were 
united; the Vajrayana was complete " 

VI. Smrtis like those of Gautama ( IX 47, 68, 73 ), Manu 
( IV. 176, 206, X 63 ), Yajfiavalkya ( 1. 156, HI. 312-313 ), while 
asking the people to honour the Vedas and learned brahmanas 
laid great emphasis 1652 on Ahimsa, truthfulness, charity, self-

ing set out on p. 245 ) that lead to the conclusion that the monks had a fairly 
large number among them that brought Buddhism into disrepute In

further sorrow may arise, ' the complete passing away without clinging to 
the world is our heighest aim * , - some have left the world in terror at the 
tyranny of kings , some have joined to be safe from being robbed, some 
harassed by debts and some perhaps to gain a livelihood.

restraint, sexual purity and other virtue3 for persons of all tho 
four vama3, just as Buddha and early Buddhist works did for Ins 
followers. The sentiment in Manu V. 45 and the Visnu-dharma- 
sutra 51 68 ' he, who kilb harmless animals ( like deer ) merely 
for the sake of hi3 own pleasure, never increases nor prospers in 
happiness, whether living or after death,' find3 a parallel in 
Dhammapada 1 31. Even the Rgveda solemnly says ( X. 85 1 } 
* the earth is supported by Truth, the sky is supported by the 
Sun '. The Mundaka Up. exhorts ' Truth alone is victorious, 
not falsehood * ( HI 1. 6 ) 

VII The strong faith and the alertness of brahmanas who 
welded into a coherent whole the Veda, the philosophy of the 
Upanisad3, Yogic practices of a middle path as in Glta VI. 15-17, 
the doctrine of salvation by faith and bbakti for all preached in 
the Glta gradually held an irresistible appeal. 

VIII In re orienting their religious outlook and practices 
to stem the tide of Buddhism and make Hinduism popular, tho 
brahmana3 and other leaders of Hindu society of the centuries 
before and after the Christian era had to make compromises of a 
far-reaching character; the oldVedic gods (like Indra and 
Varuna) receded into the background though not totally 
forgotten, mo3t of the Vedic sacrifices had to be given up, doitio3 
like Devi, Ganesa and the Matrs had to be brought to tho front, 
Pauranika mantra3 came to be used along with Vodio ones as 
the mantraa even in sraddha (eg' dataro nobhivardhantam ' 
&c. which occurs in Manu HI 259, Yaj I. 246, Matsya 16. 49-50, 
Padma, Srstikhanda 9 117, Kurma II. 22. 60 and 'other workb). 
Even an early writer like Varahamihira ( first half of 6th century 
A.D.) in describing the Pusyarsnanafor the king provides ordinary 
mantras ( Br. S 47. 55-70 ) to he recited by the pui o/nta along 
with mantras m the Atharvaveda, Rudra ( Tai. S. IV. 5. 1-11 )« 
the Kusmanda mantras ( Vaj S XX. 14-16 and others, Br. S. 
47. 71 ) and winds up the whole procedure with a well-known 
Pauranika verse 1&Si Even Apararka (pp. 14-15 ) had to say 
that in Devapup the procedure to bo followed iq that in tho 
Narasimhapurana ( probably something like tho ono in chap. 2 
of the Karasimha Purana ) and in the matter of * pratis^b j ' 
{ establishment of imaged ) also Pauranika procedure was to ba 
adopted. Be3ide3, emphasis was laid on ahim=a, charity (dCna),

pilgrimages and vratas and it was said that the latter two were 
more efficacious than even Vedio sacrifices. These changes 
seriously reduced the appeal of Buddhism. The puranas con- 
tained stories of gods and avataras that vied in their appeal to 
the common man with the Buddhist Jafcaka tales. The 
Kadambarl of Bana ( first half of 7th century A. D ) states that 
the people of U)jayinl were fond of the Mahabharata, Puranas 
and Ramayana ( Mahabharata-Purana-Ramayana-nuragina 
&c ). This is put down as the last of the four causes of the 
decline of Buddhism by O'Connor. 

IX. Erom about the 7th century A. D. Buddha began to be 
recognised by Hindus as an avatara of Visnu and by the 10th 
century Buddha came to be so recognised throughout India by 
almost all Hindus 

X Moslem fanaticism and invasions of India delivered 
the coup de grace (final blow) to Buddhism about and after 
1200 A. D. by ruining famous universities like those of Nalanda 
and Vikramasila and the monks were mercilessly killed in large 
numbers. Those who escaped the carnage fled to Tibet and 
Nepal. H. M. Elliott's History of India (as told by its own 
historians) vol. lip. 306 contains a passage from Tabakat-i- 
Nasiri about Bakhtiyar Khilji that states that Bakhtiyar led 
his army to Behar and ravaged it, that great plunder fell in his 
hands, that most of the inhabitants of the place were brahmanas 
with shaven heads, that they were put to death, that large 
numbers of books were found and it was discovered that the 
whole fort and city was a place of study ( madrasa). The des- 
cription mdioatas that brahmana with shaven heads were

Ananda he yielded and prophesied that his pure Dharma, whioh 
otherwise would have flourished for a thousand years, would not 
last so long but only for 500 years Vide ' Cullavagga ' in SBE. 
vol XX p 325 

The Patimokkha for monks contains 227 articles whioh were 
to be recited twice a month in an assembly of at least four 
monks and confessions of bleaches of the rules had to be made. 
If one reads the Cullavagga (SBE XX pp 330-340), one may 
understand how the gatherings of legions of monks and nuns in 
immense monasteries led in some cases to sapping the ordinary 
observances of decency and morality. At first the Patimokkha 
could be recited to nuns by monks and the nuns could confess 
their lapses to monks but this had to be changed later and it 
was laid down that only bhikkhunls could do these things for 
them. P 333 of the same shows how nuns quarrelled among 
themselves and came to blows and p 335 narrates how some 
monks threw dirty water on nuns and how they uncovered their 
bodies and thighs before nuns. 

The author has cited the above as the main causes of the 
disappearance of Buddhism following what most have written 
Different writers attach importance to a few of them according 
to their individual leanings. While prepared to concede that 
the causes noted above went a long way in bringing about the 
downfall of Buddhism in India, he feels that the principal cause 
was that large sections of the Indian population came to realize 
that the persistent teaohing of the world being a place of suffer- 
ing, of giving up all desires and of monasticism, which were 
preached by the writers on Buddhism to all and sundry, was too 
much for ordinary men to attempt and that the Hindu ideal of 
an ordered scheme of life into four uiiama%' i6s1 with peculiar 
duties and rights, particularly the importance attached to the 
grhasthSsrama showed to vast populations that family life 
properly regulated and disciplined was capable of realizing the 
highest that man was capable of and that too much insistence 
on the giving up of all desires (including deairo for life) sapped 
the very stability and continuance of human society and

PuTanas also sing the same tune , vide H of Dh. vol. II. pp. 425- 
426 and 540-541. 

Not only Dharmasastras but also great poets like Kalidasa 
emphasized the supreme importance of the householder's stage 
to society. In the Raghuvamsa 1S5S (V. 10) king Kaghu says 
to a learned brahmana student ' it is now time for you to pass on 
to the second stage of life that is capable of being useful to ( men 
of ) other asramas '. In the Sakuntala also Kalidasa harps on the 
same idea. 

When Buddha came to be worshipped by Buddhists as God, 
when Buddhists gave up the original characteristic doctrine of 
the attainment of the peace and bliss of nn uana in this very 
life through the eradication of selfish desires by following the 
Noble Eightfold Path, when Buddhists adopted the doctrines of 
bhakti and the ideal they set up was the evolution of bodhi- 
sattvas through aeons by good deeds, the line of demarcation 
between Buddhism and popular Hinduism became very thin 
and was gradually obliterated. Buddhism disappeared from 
India because of these deviations from the original doctrine and 
because the brahmanas made Hinduism very comprehensive by 
finding a place for purely monistic idealism, for the worship of 
several gods, for the performance of vedic or other religious 
rf ™" Kaimamarga) as a P le P M ation for higher spiritual 
Uie. lie ultimate victory of Hinduism shows the strength and 
comprehensiveness of its religion and philosophy as against the 
onesidedneas of Buddhism in its various phases and its silence 
on matters of great moment to the inquiring human min d.

1028 History of Dhai maiusto a I Sec. V, Oh. XXV 

The Puranas an&Dharmasastrasput so much emphasis on 
ahimsa that millions of people in India became and are even 
now strict vegetarians not only among brahmanas, but also 
among vaisyas and sudras, while it appears that Buddhists all 
over the world are not strict vegetarians at all. To day very 
few of the ideal virtues that Buddhism set before even laymen 
are a matter of endeavour for most Buddhists in all lands. In 
spite of Buddha's crusade against animal sacrifices and Asoka's 
drastic measures to eliminate the killing and cruelty to birds 
and beasts, it is found that some Vedio sacrifices ( including 
animal sacrifices ) continued to be performed by Indian kings 
and common people during the centuries befoie and after the 
Christian era, A few examples are citBd here • ( I ) Senapati 
Pusyamitra (about 150 BO) performed two Asvamedhas (EI. 
voL XX pp 54-58, Harivamsa III. %. 35 ff 16 « (which latter 
speaks of Senani Kasyapa-dvija as performer of Asvamedha in 
Kali age ) and Xahdasa's Malavikagnimitra ( Act V ) where ho 
is spoken of as engaged m Rajaauya sacrifice ; ( 2 ) Kharavela> 
king of Kalinga and a Jain, performed in the 6 th year of his 
reign a Rajaauya ( E I. XX p. 79 ); ( 3 ) Bhavanaga of the 
Bharasiva lineage (about 300 A.D ) glorified as the performer of 
ten Asvamedhas in Vakataka plates (Chammak plate of 
Vakataka PravaraBena II in Gupta Inscriptions No. 55 pp. 236- 
337, l4H} and m Poona plates of Prabhavatlgupta, the chief 
queen of Vakataka Rudrasena II in E. I. voL XV. p. 39); 
( 4 ) Vakataka emperor Pravarasena I. ( about 250 A. D. ) J3 
described as the daughter 's son of Bhavanaga and as the per- 
former of four Asvamedhas ( in B I. vol. XV. p. 39 ) ; ( 5 ) The 
great Gupta emperor Samudragupta ( about 325-370 A. D ) is 
described in some Gupta Inscriptions as one who restored tho 
Asvamedha sacrifice that had long been in abeyance (vide 
Bilsad Stone inscription in Gupta Inscriptions No. 10 at p. 42 
and tho Bihar Stone pillar Inscription of Skandagupta, ibid,

( about 300-350 A. D. ) is praised as the performer of Agnistoma, 
Vajapeya and Asvamedha ( E. I. vol. I p. 2 at p. 5 ); ( 7 ) The 
Pallava king Simhavaiman is spoken of as the performer of 
several Asvamedhas ( Plkira grant in E. I. voL VDX p. 159 at 
p. 162 ); ( 8 ) Calukya king Pulakesi I ( about 570 A. D. ) per- 
formed Asvamedha ( Aihole Inscription of saka 536 in E. I. vol. 
VI p. 1 ); ( 9 ) Calukya king Pulakesi II performed Asvamedha 
( Aihole Ins. of saka 536 in E. I. vol. VI. p. 1 and Talamanchi 
plates of Vikramaditya I. in E. I. vol. IX p 98 in A. D. 660 ) ; 
( 10 ) the Visnukundin Madhava-varma, ( a relative of the 
Vakataka family ) is recorded ( in E.I. vol IV. p. 196 ) as having 
performed eleven Asvamedhas, one thousand Agni-stomas, 
Paundarlka, 1659 Purusamedha, Vajapeya, Sodasin and Bajasuya 
( about the 7th or 8th century A D. ). For other instances of 
Asvamedhas performed by kings, vide H. of Dh. vol. II. 
pp. 1238-39. 

It may be noted that even learned brahmanas sometimes 
performed eleborate Vedie sacrifices For example, the fifth in 
ascent from Bhavabhuti performed a Vajapeya at Padmapura 
in Daksinapatha. In the Vajapeya, seventeen was a chara- 
cteristic number and seventeen animals were to be sacrificed 
therein. Vide for description of Vajapeya, H. of Dh. vol. II. 
pp. 1206-1213. As Bhavabhuti flourished in the first half of the 
8th century A. D, the fifth in ascent from him who performed 
Vajapeya must have flourished about a hundred years before 
him i. e in the first half of the 7th century A D. 

In these days it has become a fashion to praise Buddha and 
ins doctrines to the skies and to disparage Hinduism by making 
unfair comparisons between the original doctrines of Buddha 
witn the present practices and shortcomings of Hindu society 
Ate .present author has to enter a strong protest against this 
tendency If a f alr comparison is to be made it should be made 
between the later phases of Buddhism and the present practices 
of professed Buddhists on the one hand and modern phases and 
practices of Hinduism on the other The Upanisads had a 
nobler philosophy than that of Gautama the Buddha the 
latter merely based his doctrines on the philosophy of the

bited bad tendencies, the same or worse was the case with later 
Buddhism which gave up the noble but human Buddha, made 
him a god, worshipped his images and ran wild with such 
hideous practices as those of Vajrayana. As a counterblast to 
what modern encomiasts often say about Buddhism the present 
author will quota a strongly- worded ( but not unjust ) passage 
from Swami Vivekananda's lecture on "The sages of India" 
(Complete Works, volume III p 248-268, 7th ed. of 1953 publi- 
shed at Mayavatl, Almora) " The earlier Buddhists in their rage 
against the killing of animals had denounced the sacrifices of 
the Vedas; and these sacrifices used to be held in every house ... 
... These sacrifices were obliterated and in their place came 
gorgeous temples, gorgeous ceremonies and gorgeous priests and 
all that you see in India in modern times I smile when I read 
books written by some modern people who ought to know better 
that the Buddha was the destroyer of Brahmanical idolatry. 
Little do they know that Buddhism created brahmanism and 
idolatry in India. .. Thus in spite of the preaching of mercy to 
animals, in spite of the sublime ethical religion, in spite of the 
hair-splitting discussions about the existence or non-existence 
of a permanent soul, the whc^e building of Buddhism tumbled 
down piecemeal; and the rum was simply hideous. I have 
neither the time nor the inclination to describe to you the 
hideousness that came in the wake of Buddhism. The most 
hideous ceremonies, the most horrible, the most obscene books 
that human hands ever wrote or the human brain ever conceived, 
the most bestial forms that ever passed under the name of 
religion have all been the creation of degraded Buddhism" 
(pp 264-265) 



SECTION VI 

CHAPTER XXVI 

Tantrik doctrines and Dharmasastora 

In H. of Dh. vol. H. p. 739 while dealing with the worship 
of Durga, who is also worshipped as Sakti { cosmic power or 
energy ), it was stated that the influence of Sakta worship has 
been great throughout India and a promise was given that a 
brief treatment of Saktism would follow in a later volume. It is 
now time to deal with Saktas and Tantras, which exercised some 
influence over the Puranas and directly and through the Puranas 
over Indian Teligious ritual and practices in the medieval ages. 

There is a vast literature on Tantras, published and 
unpublished There are Buddhist Tantras, Hindu Trantras and 
Jaina Tantras. There is a philosophical or spiritual side in 
some of the Tantras which has not been much studied except by 
Arthur Avalon, B Bhattacharya and a few others. In the 
popular mind Tantras have been associated with the worship of 
Sakti ( Goddess Kali ), with mudras, mantras, mandalas, the five 
makaias, the Daksinamarga and the VSma-marga, and magic 
practices for acquiring supernatural powers All that can and 
will be attempted here is to trace briefly the origin of Saktism 
and Tantra and point out some of the ways in which lanlia has 
entered into Hindu ritual directly and indirectly through the 
Puranas. 

The Arnarakosa states that tank a means ' principal matter 
or part ', ' siddhanta ' ( i. e. doctrine or ilastra ), a loom or para- 
phernalia But it does not state that tantra means a certain 
peculiar class of works. Therefore, the inference is not altogether 
unjustifiable that in its time works bearing the peculiar character 
of what are called Tantras were either not composed or had not 
at least attained great vogue. In $g. X. 71. 9 the word ' tantra ' 
occurs and appears to mean a loom ' These ignorant 1660 men 
do not move about lower down ( in this world ) nor in a higher

world, being neither (learned) brahmanas nor some-extracting 
priests , these resort to speech ( of a vile kind ) and with that vile 
speech they engage in handling ploughs and looms' The 
A.tharvaveda (X 1 42 ) ( ' tantram-eko yurati viiupe abhya- 
kramam vayatah san-mayukham') employs the word tantra in 
tho same sense and so does the Tai Br.. II 5. 5. 3 in a closely 
similar passage Panim ( V, 2 70 ) derives the word ' tantraka' 
( a cloth that is recently taken away from a loom ) from ' (antra '. 
The 5p. Sr employs the word 1661 tantra in the sense of 'procedure 
containing many paTts '. The San. Sr. applies the word tantra 
to what being once done serves the purpose of many other actions. 
The Mahabhasya on Panini IV. 2 60 and Vartika ' sarvasader- 
dvigosca lah ' cites ' saivatantrah ' and ' dvitantrah ' as examples 
meaning ' one who has studied all the tantras ' or ' one who haB 
studied two tantias", tantra probably meaning 'siddhanta'. In 
Yaj. I. 228 ('tantram va vaisva devikam') the word tantra is 
employed in tho sense m which the commentary on the San. Sr. 
takes it The 15th adhikarana of Kautilya's Arthasistra bears 
the title 'Tantrayukti' (vide J. O. E , Madras, vol. 4, 1930, 
p. 8/3 ff ) meaning the main canons or propositions or principles 
of exposition cf a sastra. Caraka (Siddhisthana, chap 12.40-45 ) 
also speaks of '36 tantra^ya yuktayah' and Susruta (Uttara- 
tantra, chap. 65 ) name3 32 tantrayuktis In Brhaspati and 
KatySyana and in the Bhagavata the word tantra is employed 
in the sense of 'doctrine' or 'sastra'. Sahara in his bkasyaon 
Jaimini XI. 1. 1 remarks that when any thing or act, once done, 
becomes useful in several 1662 matters, that is called 'tantra'. 
Sankaracarya in several passages of his bhasya on tho Vedanta- 
sutras speaks of the Sankhya system as slnkhya-tantra and of 
the Purvamlmamsa as 'prathama-tantra'. ,66i In the Kalika-

Meaning of tantra zn early works 1033 

purana (87. 130) the works of "Dianas and Brhaspati on Kajanlti 
( the science of statecraft ) are called tantras and in 92. 2 the 
Yisnudnarmottara-purana is called tantra. In all these cases 
the peculiar meaning attached to the word tantra- in medieval 
times does not occur. 

It is difficult to determine the exact 1664 time when the word 
tantra came to be employed in the sense in which it is used in the 
so-called tantra literature nor is it possible to decide what people 
first introduced tantra principles and practices or where they 
first arose M. M. Haraprasad Shastri was inclined to hold that 
the principles and practices of tantra came to India from out- 
side and he relies mainly on a verse in the Kubjikamatatantra 166S

which says 'go thou to the country of Bharata for exercising 
dominance on all sides and bring about new creation in various 
ways in pltlias, upapithas and Icsetias'. With all respect to that 
great scholar it has to be said that the passage does not affirm 
that tantra principles were then unknowe in India and were first 
introduced in Bharata after that verse was uttered. That 
passage could very well have been uttered even when tantra 
practices had already taken hold of people's minds in India and 
the referenoe to plthas and ksetras ( in the verse ) clearly indi- 
cates that what is meant is only a record of an existing fact, 
just as the Puranas speak in a prophetio vein about what is past. 
It is possible that a few mystic practices of Ktilacm a or Vamacara 
owe their origin to foreign elements or sources But the one 
verse on which M. M. H. F Shastri relied is far too inadequate 
for pi ovtng this. The Budrayamala ( ed. by Jivananda, 1892 ) 
contains a panegyric of the Atharvaveda ( 17th patala, verse 4), 
saying that all gods, all beings ( on land, in water and an- ), all 
sages, Kamavidya and Mahavidya dwell in it; verses 10-17 
dwell upon the mysterious Kundalinl, verses 31 ff dilate upon 
Yogio practices and six calaas in the body, verses 51-53 mention 
Kamarupa, Jalandhara, Purnagiri, Tfddiyana, and a few others 
as Kalika plthas. Bagchi (in 'Studies in Tantra' pp 45-55) 
adduces some evidence of foreign elements in the tantrik 
doctrines. The Rudrayamala 1666 ( 17tb Patala, verses 119-125 ) 
states that Mahavidya appeared to sage Vasistha and asked him 
to go to Cinadesa and Buddha, who is said to have taught 
Vasistha the Kaula path, Yoga practices for the attainment 
of siddhis ( extraordinary powers) and directed him to make use 
of five makaias (madya&c.) in his sadhana for becoming a 
perfect Yogin. All this shows that plthas flourished in India 
when the Budrayamala was oomposed, that Tantrik praotioes 
had grown in China or Tibet and that Buddha was deemed to 
have taught those practices, which is a libel and a vile travesty 
of Buddha's noble teaching.

Mystic words and magic spells in Veda 1035 

Magic spalls are found in plenty in the Atharvaveda and 
some mystio words or syllables are used even in the Bgveda ; 
e. g. the word 'vasat' oeeura in Bg. VII. 99. 7, VII. 100. 7 and 
other verses and the word svahs 1667 occurs over a dozen times in 
the Bgveda ( e. g. in 1. 13. 12, V. 5, 11, VII. 2. 11 ). A sleep- 
inducing spell occurs in Bg. VII. 55. 5-8, M68 which verses occur 
also in the Atharvaveda 3V. 5. 6, 5, 1, 3 and which spell was 
probably employed by a purohita to put to sleep soma noble man 
complaining of sleeplessness at night. Some Western scholars 
have held that this hymn is a lover's charm for a clandestine 
meeting with his lady-love. But the whole hymn has hardly 
any words of love in it and the author is not able to accept that 
theory as proved. Bgveda X. 145 is a hymn to be employed 
against a co-wife, the first verse of which is ' I dig up this herb, 
which is a most powerful creeper, by which ( a woman ) injures 
her co-wife and by which she secures her husband ( to herself 
alone )' 

The Hjtgveda frequently mentions magicians who appear to 
have been mostly non-Aryans described as adeva (godless), 
anriadeia ( worshipping false gods ), sisnadeva ( lecherous, Bg, 
VH. 21. 5, X. 99. 3 ). For reasons of space, it is not possible 
to go into great details. Tantrik works describe the six cruel 
acts which will be dealt with later on. In the Vedic times it was 
supposed that some wicked people could by charms and incanta- 
tions bring about the death of men and animals or make them 
ill Two long hymns ( VH. 104 and X 87 both containing 25 
verses ) are enough to show how the Bgveda people were afraid 
of black magic. Both hymns are full of the words ' Yatudhana ' 
(one who employs black magic) and 'raksas' (devil or evil 
spirit ), the word yatu being the same as ' jadu' ( employed in 
Marathi and other regional Indian languages) There were 
female evil spirits also called ' pisaci ' ( Bg. 1. 133. 5 « O Indra ! 
destroy ^ the reddish very powerful pisaci and kill all evil 
spirits)*. A few verses from the Bgveda may be translated 



1667. IntheTantrasthe word -.svaha ' in mantras is indicated by 
wehawordas'wifaof Agni'. Vide Tantrik Texts, vol 7, where ^wr is

here. ' May I ( Vasistha) die this very day if I be a practitioner 
of black magic or if I have scorched the life of any person; may 
he, who falsely called me a practitioner of black magic, lose his 
ten sons; may Indra kill with a terrible weapon him who called 
me yatudhana, though I am not so and who, being himself a 
raksas, declares himself to be pure ; may he, being most wretched, 
fall below all beings (Eg. VH. 104 15-16); O Marutslmay 
you spread in different places among the people, and wish to 
seize the devils and pound to dust the devils (raksasah) who 
assuming the form of birds fly about at night and who, when 
the sacrifice is shining, produce deadly obstacles ( ibid, verse 18 ); 
O Indra 1 kill the male practitioner of black magic and also the 
female ( magician ) that destroys with wiles ; may the { devils ) 
worshippers of foolish deities perish with their necks out off; 
and may they not be able to see the sun rising ( Bg. VIE 104. 
24 ); O Agni, split the skin of the yStudhana, may thy destruc- 
tive bolt kill him by its heat ; O Jatavedas 1 shatter his joints, 
may some carnivorous beast longing for flesh seek ( devour ) the 
broken (yatudhana), O Agni I shatter the yatudhgnas by your 
heat, and the raksas by your glow and destroy the worshippers 
of foolish gods ( muradevan ) and, shining towards those that 
feed on the lives of men ( aautrpah ), shatter them ' ( Rg. X 87. 5 
and 14 ) 

In the J.p. Gr. (III. 9. 5-8) it is said that the plant used by 
the co-wife is called Patha and the hymn (ftg. X 145) is 
employed for securing domination over the husband and^ for 
harming a co-wife Bg I 191 is a charm against various 
poisons In the Atharvaveda there are numerous hymns styled 
' satrunasana ' (destructive of enemies) e g. II. 12-34, HE. 6, 
IV. 3 and 40, V 8, VI. 6, 65-67 and 134 Atharva II. 11 is 
styled * Krtya-dusana ' ( counteracting black magio ). A few 
of the typical verses may be cited ws9 here. ' Employ magic 
spells against him, who hates us and whom we hate; attain 
( i. e. dominate ) him who is superior and surpass him who is

Atharvaveda. Atharva III. 35 and VX 130 are spells respectively 

employed by a man and a woman to soften the heart of the 

person loved; Atharva H. 30 and 31 are charms for driving 

away or destroying worms that cause diseases and V". 36 is a

in "Vaj. S. In the A\p. Sr. Sutra phat is employed in offering 

Soma stalk3 in abhicaia (employment of spells for a malevolent 

purpose ). Phat is a sound frequently emplayed in the worship 

of Devi in Tantra works. But no direct connection or line of 

evolution from the Atharvaveda to the Tantras can be traced. 

The Tattvasangraha of Santaraksita (705-762 A. D.) connects 

even Buddha with magic practices. It says 'all wise men 

declare that it is dharma from which results worldly prosperity 

and the highest beatitude. Seen results such as intelligence, 

health, rulership are produced by properly observing the rules 

about; mantras, yoga and the like declared by him ( i. e. lsn by 

Buddha)'. But one cannot place implicit reliance on any 

writer's statement made more than a thousand years after the 

event or person referred to in it. There are, however, stories in 

the Pali sacred books about the cultivation of magic powers 

among Buddha's own disciples, e. g. the story of Bharadvaja 1672

sandalwood. Further, there is a story of miraouloua powers 
possessed by all the members of the family of a layman called 
Mendaka ( viz. himself, his wife, son and daughter-in law ) in 
Mahavagga VI. 34. 1 ff. ( S. B, E. vol. XVII. pp 121 ff ) Here 
again we have to remember that there is nothing in the Tipitaka 
or any early Buddhist document to prove that Buddha or his 
first disciples had anything to do with nmdras, mantras and 
, manifalas and that neither Yuan Chwang nor I-tsing refers to 
any Tantras, though both of them.refer to the Buddhist mona- 
steries as centres of Buddhist culture ( vide Dr. De in N. I A. 
vol.1 pp. 1 ff ). In the introduction to Sadhanamala (vol.11. 
LXVIII. ) Dr. Bhattaoharya relies upon the words ' Sugato- 
padistam' and 'Sugataib' occurring on pp. 334-335 of the 
Sadhanamala for holding that Buddha himself must have pro- 
mulgated some mantras. There are two weighty objections viz. 
' Sugataih ' does not always mean Buddha, but means also 
' followers of Buddha ' and secondly, ju3t as most Hindu Tantras 
are dialogues between Siva and Parvatl, so later Buddhist 
writers might have easily said that they are quoting the Buddha ; 
the same objection applies to Kamalasila's remarks quoted by 
Dr. Bhattaoharya, as Kamalaslla and his teacher flourished 
about 1200 years after Buddha. 

The question whether Buddhist Tantras were prior to Hindu 
Tantras or vice veisa is difficult to decide It appears probable 
that both arose nearly about the same time. Vide ' The Saktas ' 
by E. A Payne pp. 72-74 for discussion of views In the 
Sadhanamala (a Vajrayana work consisting of 312 small works 
composed according to Dr. Bhattaoharya from the 3rd century 
A D to 12th century AD.) four pithas (chief centres) of 
Vajrayana 1673 are mentioned viz. Kamakhya, Sirihatta (or 
Srlhatta ), Purnagiri and Uddiyana The first two are respec- 



1673. It appears that in some Tantra works five Pithas are named 
(according to H P Sastn's Cat. of Nepal Palm-leaf and selected paper mss. 
in the Nepal Durbar Library. Calcutta, 1903, p LXXX) viz Odiyana(in 
Onssa, says H P Sastri), Jala (in Jalandar), Purna Matanga In SrTsaila 
and Kamakhya'in Assam The very fact that five pithas are named in the 
work supposed to be delivered by Siva shows beyond doubt that before the 
work Tantrism had spread in all parts of India The Sadhanamala (vol n 
pp. 453 and 455) mentions Uddiyana. Purnagiri, Kamakhya and Sirihatta, 
the Kulacudamamtantra (Tantrik texts. Vol. IV) in6thpatala verses 3-7) 
refers to five pithas viz. Uddiyana, Kamarupa. Kamakhya, Jalandhara ana 
( Cotttntned on next $a&e )

tively identified with Kamakhya or Kamarapa ( three miles from. 
GauJfctati } and modern Sylhet. The exact situation of the other 
two is a controversial matter. M M. H. P. Shastri identified 
Uddiyana ( which is moat frequently mentioned as a pltha ) with 
Orissa. His son Dr B Bhattacharya think3 it most probable 
that Vajrayana Tantricism arose in Uddiyana ( p. 46 of Intro, 
to B. E. ). Dr. Bagchi in ' Studies in the Tantras ' pp. 37-40 
furnishes good grounds for holding that Uddiyana was near 
Swat valley in N. W. India and Grousset ' In the footsteps of 
Buddha' pp. 109-110 holds the same view. The Barhaspatya- 
sutra (ed. by E. W. Thomas) names eight Saktaksetras (HI. 
123-124 ). In his Intro, to Sadhanamala ( vol. U. p. LXXVHI ) 
Dr Bhattacharya holds that the Hindu tantras were introduced 
on the model of the Buddhist tantras. But Winternitz (in 
' History of Indian Literature ', Eng. tr., vol. II. p. 401 ) states 
that this view of Dr. Bhattacharya is contrary to the facts and 
the present writer agrees with this view. 

_ Though Dr. Bhattacharya admits that Buddhism and 
Jainism exploited Hindu gods in the earlier period, he asserts 
(on p. 147 of his Intro, to B E.) that 'it is possible to declare 
without fear of contradiction that the Buddhists were the first 
to introduce the Tantras in their religion and that the Hindus 
borrowed them from the Buddhists in later times'. It is no 
honour to ancient Hindus to he called the pioneers in the practice 
of black magic. But scholars have to seek truth irrespective 
of the question of honour or dishonour. Very weighty arguments 
are advanced by Valleg Poussin ( in E. R. E. vol XII. p 193 ) 
Winternite and Payne (on ' Saktas p 73 ) for the opposite view 
ana the present author agrees with them. Hundreds of works 
were translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan and Chinese. The

1040 History of Dliarmaiaslra { Sec. VI, Oh. XXVI 

There is hardly any evidence of the translations of Chinese 
or Tibetan works into Sanskrit. Besides, the three great Chinese 
travellers never refer to the study of Buddhist Tantras in India. 
Watters on * Yuan Chwang's Travels in India ' vol. I p. 360 
narrates a story from the pilgrim's life that when he left 
Ayodhya in a boat and proceeded east down the Ganges, thugs 
that looted the boat decided to sacrifice him to Durga but that 
the Chinese pilgrim was saved by a hurricane which put the 
thugs in terror, who released him and treated him with 
reverence Vide also 'In the Footsteps of Buddha" by Rene 
Grousset pp 133-135 for this incident. We see that there is 
evidence of the prevalence of Tantrik and Sakta worship in 
India long before the 7th century A. D. There is hardly any 
evidence of any Buddhist Tantrik work before 650 A D. except 
perhaps the Guhyasamajatantra and MaSjusrimulakalpa, both 
of which contain late elements. In this way, presumption and 
chronology are both against "borrowing by Hinduism from 
Buddhist Tibetan or Chinese Tantrik works Vide ' Tibet past 
and present' by Sir Charles Ball (1924) pp 33,35, 39, Sardar 
X. M. Panikkar's work 'India and China* (1957) p. 70, 'Intro- 
duction of the alphabet in Tibet' by M M Dr Satischandra who 
holds that it was borrowed from Magadha in 7th Century A. D., 
that show that a written script ba3ed on an Indian alphabet as 
prevalent in Kashmir was first introduced about 640 A. D. , that 
the Tantrik Buddhist Padmasambbava was summoned from 
TJddiyana by a Tibetan king Ti-son De-tson ( 749-786 A. D ) on 
the recommendation of Santaraksita Bodhisattva and was 
induced to settle in Tibet Bunjiu Hanjio's 'Catalogue of 
Tripitaka' (Oxford, 1883 ), appendix II. p. 445 No 155 shows that 
Amogbavajra translated many works between 746 and 771 A. D.> 
died in 774 A D. and that it was under his influence that Tantra 
doctrines gained currency in China. It is clear from the works 
of Bana as detailed later od that worship of Candika with wine 
and flesh was prevalent in India long before 600 A. D , that 
Srlparvata was famed for its tantrik siddhis, that Sivasamhitas 
existed, that japa of mantras a orore of times in a cemetery wa3 
supposed to confer siddhts, that he 14th of the dark half of a month 
was deemed the proper tithi for japa and black magic. Therefore, 
it is most likely that Sakta or Tantrik doctrines were taken to 
China and Tibet from India and not vice versa Prof P. V" 
Bapat in' 2500 years of Buddhism' (pp. 360-376) follows (at 
p 363 ) Dr. B. Bhattaoharya and trie3 to prove that Tibetan 
Tantrism is earlier than Hindu Tantrism, but his arguments 



Time of entry of Buddhism m Tibet 1041 

like those of Dr. Bhattacharya do not carry conviction at all.. 
Dr. A. S. Alfcekar in his paper on Sanskrit Literature in Tibet 
(ABORt. vol. 35 pp. 54-66) shows how Buddhism entered into 
Tibet in the raign of Strong-Tsan-Gampo ( 637-693 A. D. ), that 
about 750 A D ;Padmasambhava from Orissa and Vairoeana 
from Kashmir were pioneers and how about 4500 works were 
translated into Tibetan. 

. Even Dr. Bhattaeharya admits that Buddhist Tantras in 
outward appearance resemble in a marked degree Hindu Tantras 
(p 47 of Intro to B E.), but he contends that in the subject 
matter, the philosophical doctrines and religious principles there 
is little similarity. As Buddhism did not believe in Hindu 
gods they do not speak about Sakti'or Saktism. But just as in 
Hindu Tantras there is the mala principle Siva and the female 
principle of Devi, the Buddhists postulate Prajjna (which is 
feminine) and TTpaya (masculine) as two principles and invest 
them with the same roles as those of Siva and Devi but reversed 
in character. They bad to graft on the idea of gtinyata. the ideas 
underlying the concepts of Siva and Devi or Sakti. The subject 
matter is very similar as regards the goal and means (Yoga &o) 
and the procedure of mantra, guru, mandala &c. i3 the same. 
The most important and early works of Buddhist Tantrio cult, 
the Frajnopaya-viniscayasiddhi and Jnanasiddhi are not 
earlier than the 8th century A. D. , when Saktism and Tantrism 
had both been long established in India. 

The word ' Sakta ' means one who is a worshipper or devotee 
of * Sakti ' ( cosmic power or energy ). It appears that long before 
the 8fch century A. D. this cult had spread in almost all parts 
of India, particularly in Bengal and Assam. Sakti under 
different names (suohas Tripura, Lohita, Sdasika, Kamesvarl) 
was conceived to be the primordial principle of all activity in 
the universe and is generally worshipped under the name of 
Devi. The Devlmabatmya is one of the chief works of the 
Saktas and has been described above on pp. 155-156. The chief 
characteristics of the Sakta cult aTe the doctrine that God or 
Deity is one and is to be conceived as the mother and also the 
destroyer*'* and that there is a special form of ceremonial

worship which sometimes assumed debased and revolting forms. 
Devi has been eulogised in other Puranas also as in Vsmana 
(18-19), Devl-bhagavata (III. 27), Brahmanda ( that contains 
the Lalitamahatmya in 44 chapters), Matsya ( 13. 24-54, where 
103 names of Devi and 108 places of her worship are set out ), 
Kurma (I. IS). In the last Purana (Kurma 1. 12) Devi is 
called MahamahisamardinI (98), Anahata, KundalinI (128), 
Durga, Katyayani, Oandl, Bhadrakali ( 143 and 148 ) and it is 
stated that the sastras opposed* 675 to the Veda and Smrti that are 
popular among people such as Kapala, Bhalrava, Yamala, 
Varna, iLrhata were propagated by Devi for deluding the world and 
were based on ignorance. Vide also Brahmapurana (181. 48-52) 
for names of Devi and for the proposition that Devi when 
worshipped with offerings of wine, flesh and other edibles 
becomes pleased and grants men's desires. Bhadrakali is com- 
paratively an anoient name. In the San. Gr. ( SBE voL XXIX 
p. 86 ) it is provided that an offering is to be made to Sri at the 
head of the bed on which the householder sleeps and at the foot 
of the bed to Bhadra-kall, while Manu provides that, in the 
daily bahharana, bah ( offering ) is to be offered to Bhadrakali 
in the south-west. 

The Tantras"and Sakta works have much in common, the 
main point of difference being that in the Sakta cult Devi ( or 
Sakti) is worshipped as the highest, while Tantras (which 
include also Buddhist and Jaina works) are not restricted to the 
worship of Devi or Sakti, but may be agnostic, Vedantio or 
Sankhya in their philosophical outlook. Dr. B. Bhattacharya 
(in Intro to Guhyasamajatantra p XXXIV and in Intro, to 
Sadhanamala voL II. p. XIX) states that, for a work to be called 
a real Tantra, there must be the element of Sakti in it. But this 
is plainly rather an over-statement. The Vayupurana enume- 
rates the Sakta among six daiianas ( philosophic points of view) 
as in note lilSa . 

Even the Bgveda speaks of the Saktis of the great gods 
of the Vedic pantheon. But the Sakti or Saktis are of the God

The word ' sakti ' in the Bgveda 1043 

aimself and not a separate creative principle and sometimes 
Sakti is meant as part of the poet, priest or sacrificer ( as in 
Rg.1.31. 18, 1.83.3, IV. 32. 8, X. 35. 5). The word 'Sakti' 
occurs in the Rgveda about a dozen times in the singular as 
well as in the plural, five times with Indra, 1S76 once with Asvins 
( Rg. H. 39. 7 ), twice with pitrs (I 109. 3, VI. 75. 9 ) and once 
with gods in general (X. 88. 10, who are said to have created 
Agni with their powers). Sometimes, the word ' Maya * i3 used 
with regard to Indra instead of the word Sakti. ' O Indra I I 
long for your great friendship and powers ( saktih )...understand 
that you are our great protector; I proclaim your ancient and 

recent deeds, O Indra endowed with powers (Saktivah)l ; 

' Indra assuming 1677 many forms by his powers ( mayabhih ) 
repairs ( to many sacrifices ), ten hundred horses are yoked to 
his chariot '. In these passages there is no question of worship- 
ping sakti or fcaktis of the god praised. The more frequent word, 
however, is 'Sad* ('saclbhih' occurring 36 times and 'sacya' 
13 times). The word ' Saclpati * (lord of Sari or power) occurs 
sixteen times in the Bgveda and has been applied in all places 
to Indra, except once in 5g.VH. 67.5 (where it is applied to 
Asvins ). It cannot be said that in the Rgveda « Sad ' is the wife 
of Indra ( as it is said in later mythology), since the plural is 
more frequent^ than Saoi in the singular and since Asvins also 
are called 'Saclpati'. once. Similarly, the word 'Sacivah' 
occurs eleven times, in nine of which it is addressed to Indra 
but it is once applied to Agni ( Rg. 1H. 21. 4) and once to Soma 
( Rg. IX. 87. 9 ). The ideas associated with the words ' Sakti ' 
and ' Saci ' are those of creation, protection, valour, and bounty. 
In Rg. I. 56. 4 India's power is called 'Devi tavist' but the word

declared to support Mitra and Varuna, Indra and Agni, the 
Asvins, Soma, Tvastr, Pusan and Bhaga. Vak is said to stretch 
the bow for Eudra in order that the destructive enemy of brahma 
(prayer or God Brahma) may be killed, that Vak stands occupy- 
ing all worlds and that her body touches heaven, that it is 
beyond heaven and the earth, that Vak stands so vast by its 
greatness'. Vak becomes the principle of all energy. According 
to the Nighantu (I. 11), mena, gnah. and sad are three of the 
57 words meaning 'Vak'. In Tai. S. V. 1. 7. a the metres are 
called 'gnas'. Bg. 1. 164. 41 is an enigmatic description of Vak 
explained in Nirukta XI. 40. It should be noticed that, just as 
Devi or Sakti is associated with Siva in later literature, so are 
IndranI, VarunanI, Agnayl, EodasI associated with Indra, 
Varuna, Agni and Maruts respectively as wives. 'I invoke 
IndranI, 1673 VarunanI and Agnayl for my welfare and for drink- 
ing Soma " , ' May the women, the wives of gods, partake of the 
offering, viz. IndranI, Agnayl, the brilliant ( wife) of the Asvins, 
Eodasi; may VarunanI listen (to our laud) ; may the goddesses 
partake ( of offerings ) at the time (appropriate) for women'. 
It must be said, however, that these goddesses ( devli ) play a 
very subordinate part in the Bgveda. Mb direct connection can 
be traced between these Vedic goddesses and the later concep- 
tion of Devi or Sakti. IndranI is invoked for protection in Eg. 
I. 22. 12, n. 32. 8, V. 46. 8, X. 86. 11-12. In Eg V. 46. 8 IndranI 
and three others are called Devapatnls and 'gnas'. In Bg. I. 
61. 8 it is said that the gnas, the wives of gods, wove, when Indra 
Btruck the demon Ahi, a song of worship. The word ' gna ' 
occurs 20 times in the Eg. m the nominative, objective, instru- 
mental and locative and is an Indo-European word for wife 
(Greek has it). Vide Nir III. 21 where ' mena ' and ' gna ' 
occur. In the Kenopanisad TJma Haimavatl (daughter of 
Himavat ) tells of Brahma to the gods Agni, Vayu and Indra 
(III. 12). In the Svetasvataropanisad it is said 'they (brahma- 
vadins) endowed with meditation and Yoga saw Sakti (power)

The same Upanisad (in VI. 8) speaks of Brahma as possessing 
the highest Sakti 1 " 9 in various forms and this text is quoted by 
Sankaracarya on Vedantasutra II. 1. 24. In the bhasifa on 
Vedantasutra II. 1. 30 and in the sutra itself Brahma is said 
to be endowed with all powers. Vide also Svetasva. IV. 1. The 
Narayanopanisad contains an invocation of Durga-devi 16s0 
'I approach as a refuge the blazing goddess Durga, brilliant like 
fire, luminous owing to tapas, that is resorted to for. (yielding) 
the rewards of religious actions ; O goddess possessed of excellent 
might! adoration to your power'. Raghavabhatta 1681 avers 
that Tantra cult is based on Sruti as can be seen from the 
Upanisads called Ramapurvottara-tapanlya and Nrsimhapur- 
vottara-tapaniya. Similarly, Bhaskararaya in hi3 commentary 
Setubandha on Vamakesvaratantra mentions several Upa- 
nisads as treating in detail of the bhakti of Mahatripura-sundari 
and interprets Bg. V. 47. 4 ' catvari Im ' as referring to Kadividya.

are mostly mentioned by late medievel writers like Raghava- 
bhatta and BhaskararSrya. There are two great hymns 
addressed to Durga in the Mahabharata, ,682 viz. in Viiataparva 
(chap. 6) by Yudhistbira and the other in Bhismaparva (chap. 
23) by Axjuna, but they are discarded as apocryphal in the 
Poona critical edition. The Gangadhara stone Inscription of 
Visvavarman of 480 of the Malava era (424 A.D.) refers to Mates 
( Mother Goddesses ) and Tantra 1S83 The Br S. 57. 56 mentions 
the groups of Matrs. The Vrddba-Harlta-smrti recommends 
that the householder should not enter places of Saiva, Bauddha, 
Skanda and Sakta 1684 cults. The Visnupurana 1685 (one of the 
earliest among extant Puranas) speaks of the whole world as 
that of Visnu, who is the highest Brahma and is endowed with 



1682. In JRAS for 1906 pp. 335-362 B. C. Majumdar endeavours to 
show that the two hymns to Durga are late interpolations in the Maha- 
bharata, probably derived from practices of non-Aryan Sudras in Oriya-

sources KahdSsa (not later than about 400 A D.) speaks of Parvatl as 
Uma, Aparna, Durga, Gauri, Bhavani and Caudi in his several works 
and also that Kahdasa refers to the Ardhanarisvara form of Siva. In the 
last verse of the Sakuntala Kahdasa speaks of Siva as • pangata-skktib ' and 
thereby suggests that at least the germs of the later Sakti worship were not 
unknown in his times Therefore, the worship of Durga m her several 
aspects is older than 300 A D. by at least a century or more; vide pp.

Sakti, enumerates some of the names of Durga as JLrya, 
Vedagarbha, Ambika, Bhadra, Bhadra-kSlI, Ksemada. Bhagyada 
and winds up by stating that when Durga is worshipped with 
offerings of wine, flesh, various kinds of foods, she, being pleased, 
would fulfil all desires of men. In the Kadambari of Banabhatta 
there is a long description of the temple of Candika at a few 
days' journey from TJjjayinI, where there was an old Dravida 
devotee, in which the following points deserve to be noted, viz. 
offerings of the heads of animals, lion as vaham, the slaughter 
of Mahisasura, the doctrines of Pasupatas written down on 
small books of palm leaves containing jugglery, tantra and 
mantras, Durga-stotra written on a piece of cloth, ruined temples 
of the Mates and description of the Dravida devotee as knowing 
thousands of wonderful stories about Srlparvata. Bana describes 
at length what queen VilasavatI, pining for a son, began doing 
to placate all Gods viz. sleeping in the shrines of Candika where 
guggulu was being incessantly burnt, taking auspicious baths 
on nights of dark 14th in public squares where magic circles 
had been drawn by great magicians, visiting temples of Mates, 
wearing amulets inside which were pieces of birch leaves on 
which mantras had been written with yellow pigment, and, 
when delivery was near, her bed was rendered holy with various 
herbs, roots and yantras (figures or diagrams). In the 
Harsaoarita (HI) there is a reference to magic circles and to 
human sacrifices in the description of the Saiva ascetic Bhairava- 
caryawhohadaUtheSaiva-samhitas by heart, who performed . 
the japa of a mahamantra called Mahakalahrdaya a crore of 
times m a cemetery and wanted the help of Puspabhuti ( an 
ancestor of Emperor Harsa ) for perfection in that mantra to be 
achieved by subduing a vetala and who ultimately attained to the 
position of Vidyadhara and rose into the starry firmament. In

and small, rich and poor. In the Malatlmudhava (Act V) 
we have a gruesome picture of human sacrifice to Camunda, 
In the same drama Saudaminl is described as observing the vows 
of a Kapalika on Srlparvata and as having secured supernatural 
powers by meanB of mantras. Srlparvata is mentioned as a holy 
place of Siva and Devi in Vanaparva 85. 19-20. The Vasava- 
datta of Subandhu (p. 87 of Hall's ed.) speaks of Srlparvata as 
' Sannihita-malhkarjunah. ' Later on a few passages from 
Sanskrit and Prakrit literature will be cited to show how the 
teaching of Tantrik practices led to great moral debasement and 
revolting orgies in the name of religion. 

The literature on Tantras was vast (vide 'Principles of 
Tantra' ed. by A. Avalon, part 1 pp. 390-392 for a long liBt of 
Tantras ). Both Hindu and Buddhist writers composed numerous 
works on Tantra and a very large number of subjects came to bo 
inoluded in Tantra works. Buddhist and Hindu Tantras are 
alike in some respects but they differ in the topics disoussed, 
philosophical doctrines and some religious principles and 
practices. Tantra works were intioduced into Tibet, Mongolia, 
China, Japan and South East Asia. Originals of many of the 
Sanskrit Tantrik works are now not available, but the trans- 
lations of some of them in Tibetan are available. 1687 It Js aid 
that even now if proper searoh is made, three hundred works on 
Tantra may be discovered ( vide Dr. B. Bhattaoharya in vol. X. 
of Sri Bamavarma Institute of Besearch at Cochin p. 81 ). 

It is diffioult to give a general definition of Tantras. The 
word ' Tantra ' is derived usually from ' Tan ' to spread and 
'trai* (to save). 'It spreads (dilates upon) many matters 
including the tattvas and mantras and affords protection; 

1687. The following works will convey some idea of Sakta doctrines 
and practices R. G. Bhandarkars's ' vaisnavism, Saivism &c. ' (In Collected

Tantrik worshippers are divided into three classes viz. Sam.

that Tantrik literature is classified into Srotas ( which are three ) 
Pitha and Jmnaya. The Saundaryalaharl, ascribed hy some 
to the great Advaita teacher Sankaraoarya, refers to sixty-four

have been published and we have now a fair idea of what the 
numerous Tantras must have been like. Some of the published 
Hindu Tantras are Kularnava, Tantraaara, ITityotsava, 
Parasuramakalpa-sutra, Paranandastitra, Prapancasara, Mantra- 
mahodadhi of Mahldhara, Mahanirvanatantra, Eudrayamala, 
Vamakesvaratantra, Saradatilaka (about 11th century A.D.). 
Besides, there are works like the Tantraloka and Malinlvijaya- 
vartika of Abhinava-gupfca of Kashmir TantriBm. They stand 
somewhat apart from the works enumerated above. Among the 
published Buddhist tantras are, Advayavajrasangraba, 
Aryamanjusrlmulakalpa, Guhayasamaja-tantra (probably 6th 
century A. D. ), Jfianasiddhi of Indrabhuti ( 717 A. D. ), Nispan- 
nayogavali of Abhayakaragupta (composed between the last 
quarter of 11th and first of 12th century A. D. >, Prajnopaya- 
viniscaya-siddhi of Anangavajra ( about 705 A. D. ), Sat-cakra- 
nirupana (1577 A, D.), SadhanamalS (containing 312 small 
works supposed to be from 3rd to 12th century A. D.). Of the 
Buddhist Tantras Aryamanjusrlmulakalpa and Guhyasamaja- 
tantra 16 ? 1 are the oldest according to Dr. B. Bhattacharya 
(Intro, p, XXXVIII. to Guhya-samajatantraJ, Most of the 
above works have been published by Arthur Avalon ( Sir. John 
Woodroffe) and in the Gaikwad Oriental Series. Some of the 
Hindu Tantras contain sublime philosophical views derived from 
the Upanisads and the Gita or from the Sinkhya and Yoga and 
the final goal according to them is Multli (liberation from the

The ft&u QteiiwU (a part of mw^ ^n^^i ) names the 64 Tantras in verses 
13-22 of the first T??IW, but it includes eight Yamalas among Tantras, while 
Dr Bhattacharya {in ' Introduction to E B. p 52) tries to distinguish 
Agamas and Yamalas from Tantra and also in his Intro, to Sadbanamala 
Vol. II pp XXI-XXII. The mte Hritl3"fa of 3Hl><j |T|R (Tanink Tests, vol. 
XIV) enumerates numerous tantras including Yamalas in I. 2-14 and names 
{I 92-93) eight gurus. 

1691. Dr. Bhattacharya in Intro, to Guhyasamxja p. XXXIV holds that 
Asanga is probably the author of the Guhyasamsja and therefore that work 
belongs to the 3rd or 4th century A, D. One has only to read the Maha - 
yanasutralahkara of Asanga ed. by Sylvam Levi and compare its refined and 
correct Sanskrit with the rather harbarou3 Sanskrit of the Guhyasamija to 
come to the conclusion that the latter is not Asanga's work. There is no 
evidence to prove that Guhyasamija belongs to the 3rd or 4tb ^entury 
A D. It is probably two or more centuries later than that ; Bagchi ( ' Studies 
in Tantras' p. 41) is against identifying Asanga, the author of Sadbana No.

oycle of births and deaths ) for all man but to ba secured by- 
following the path laid down by the Tantras. As the number of 
published Hindu Tantras is considerable, reference will be made 
mainly to a few viz, Kularnava, Paranandasutra, Frapancasara, 
Mahanirvanatantra, Vamakesvaratantra (Anan. ed.)» Sakti- 
sangamatantra, Saradatilaka and in the case of the Buddhist 
tantras to Aryamanjusrlmula-kalpa, Guhyasamajatantra, 
Prajnopayavinisoayasiddhi, Jflanasiddhi, Sadhanamala, Sekodde- 
satlka. The purpose of most Buddhist Tantras is to indicate 
a short path for attaining Buddha-hood through Toga practices 
and they introduce the element of Sakti for Yogic practices and 
for securing miraculous powers ( called siddhts). In the History 
of Dharmasastra not much need be said about Buddhist Tantras 
except for comparison and stress will have to be laid on the 
Hindu Tantras alone. The philosophical aspects of Tantrik 
culture may be studied in the Parasuramakalpasutra, the 
VSmakesvara-tantra, TantrarSja, the works on Kashmir Saivism, 
works of Bhaakararaya, Bhavanopanisad. This last is a late 
work dignified with the title of Upanisad, as it deals with 
bhaiana and summarises the Vasanapatala of Tantrarajatantra 
N ( vide Intro, to the latter p, 3 ). There are also Vaisnava Tantras 
like the Gautamlya-tantra ( D. O. ms. No. 1120 of 1886-1892 ) 
and Kramadlpika of Kesava (who was a successor of Nimbarka) 
with the commentary of Govinda Vidyavinoda (published in the 
OhowkhambaS. series), which are not referred to in this work 
from considerations of space. Vide Agnipurana 39. 1-7 for the

Five tattvas in the worship of &akti 1053 

should be devoted to the Kula practices whereby he would attain 
tothesadhana of Sakti; wine, flesh, fish, mudra and sexual 
intercourse— these are declared to be the five tattvas in the 
procedure of the worship of Sakti. In another place the 
Mahanirvana 1696 says that the individual soul, prakrti, space, 
time, akasa, 8arth, water, fire and Yayu- these are called ' Kula ' 
and that way of life whereby one looks upon all these as bi ahma 
without distinction is called Kulacara, that confers the four 
goals viz. dharma, artha, kama and moksa. The Saktisangama- 
tantra states that Kula means the upasakas (worshippers) 1697 
of Kali. The Kularnava states ' Kula means gotra and that 
springs from Sakti and Siva ; that man is called Kaulika who 
knows that moksa is secured from that (i. e. Sakti and Siva). 
Siva is -called 'Akula' and Sakti is called 'Kula', those who 
contemplate on Kula and Akula are the wise kaulikas. " Various 
other definitions are given in Guhyasamaja ( 1st patala p. 6 ), 
in the Preface p. VIII of the Saktisangama tantra, Tarakhanda 
But the same Tantra clinches the matter by declaring that 
" Sakti is known as Kula ; her worship and the like are described ; 
that should be known as ' Kulacara', which is difficult of attain- 
ment even for gods. Worship, done with these alone viz. wine, 
flesh, fish, mudra and sexual intercourse, is known as Kulacara."

that there are seven Lords ( Isvara ) viz. Brahma, Visnu, Swa 
Surya, Ganesa, Sakti and Bhairava, that individual souls are 
countless, that there are three mar gas (paths) viz. Daksina, Varna 
and Uttara, each succeeding one being superior to each preceding 
one, that Daksina-marga ie the one declared in the Veda, smrtis 
and puranas, that the Varna (way) is declared by the Veda and 
Agamas, while the third (Uttara) is the one declared by the 
words of the Veda and of the Guru and that the Guruvakya is 
that of one's guru who is himself Jloan-mukta and who gives 
instruction as to a mantra. That sutra further provides that 
the VamacSra is of two kinds, madhyama (middling) and uttama 
(best), that uttama is the one which is concerned with wine, 
sexual intercourse and handpo3es, while madhyama is one where 
all five, wine, flesh, fish, mudra and maithuna are resorted to. 
It should be noticed that the Tantras themselves designate the 
use of five makaras in worship as Yamacara and not their 
orthodox partisans of Yoga, as Heinrioh Zimmer alleges in ' The 
art of Indian Asia' vol I. p 130 Paranandasutra 1699 prescribes 
that the disciple has to undergo dlksa ( consecration ) from a 
qualified guru, who instructs the disciple as to the mantra, who 
holds a mouthful of water in his own mouth and passes it into the 
mouth of the disciple that accepts the mantra while he gulps down 
the water. This procedure applies if the guru is a brahmana, but 
if the gUTU is a ksatriya he should recite the mantra in the 
right ear of the disciple. The Tantraraja-tantra provides that 
the guru should wait for 1, %, 3, 4 or 5 years according as the 
intending disciple belongs to the four varnas or to a mixed 
caste, 3hould test his qualities and devotion and then com- 
municate to him the mantra; otherwise, both guru and disciple 
would come to grief ( Tantrik Texts, vol VHI. II. 37-38 ) Most 
works on Tantra provide that the knowledge conveyed by the 
guru and worship with five makaias must be kept secret and 
if made public falling in hell is the result. Vide Parasurama- 
kalpasutra L 12 and Saktisangama-tantra » M After undergoing 
dik«a and receiving the mantra the disciple has to follow the orders

Duty of disciple towards tantrik guru 1055 

of the guru till the former has a vision of the deity. 1701 Guru 
is higher than all other men, mantra ia higher than guru, the 
deity is higher than the mantra and the highest self is higher 
than the devata. In order to attain siddhis the guru is to be 
served by disciples with devotion iu all ways. There is only 
one way viz. bhakti (devotion) for those ( disciples ) that long 
for worldly pleasures, heaven or moksa, as the Sruti sayB * there 
is no other way '. JTvan-mukti 1702 means "to have a vision of 
the Deity worshipped' and ' one who is liberated, though living, 
is not tainted by his acts, whether meritorious or otherwise '. 
This doctrine closely follows what is said in some of the 
TJpanisads about the man who has realised bi ahma that ' he 
shakes off punya and papa and having cast aside the body he 
reaches the world of brahma ; he does not Teturn i. e. he never 
again undergoes samsara'. One should strive for that stage. 
Therefore one who has obtained correct knowledge should become 
a bhakta (devotee). All these, viz. one in distress, the seeker 
after knowledge, one who seeks some desired object and one who 
has obtained correct knowledge, are noble, but the man, who has 
knowledge about God, when he becomes a devotee, reaches the 
world of the Highest Self, as the Vedio words say ' one who 
knows brahma reaches the Highest '. With all this sublime 
philosophy as the background the Paranandasutra frankly

makaras (madya, mudra and maithuna), as regards the kaula 
practices. 1703 Then the Parananda-sutra devotes two pageB 
(16-17) to the kauladharmas taught to the neophyte, from 
which a few^ striking passages may he cited. " A young 1 ™ 
courtezan is Sakti incarnate, is brahma ; women are gods ant 
the very life-breath and are ornaments (of the world); they 
should not be censured nor angered"; 'after worshipping the 
gods and gurus in the way laid down by the Veda and the 
Tantras a man does not incur sin if he drinks wine while 
remembering god or has sexual intercourse with a courtezan. 
He who partakes of wine and the rest merely for pleasing himself 
falls into a terrible hell. He who giving up the ordinances 
of sastra acts as he pleases does not attain siddhi in this world, 
nor heaven nor the Highest goal ( moksa )■ A worshipper should 
drink wine only up till his eyes do not begin to roll and up till 
his mind does not become unsteady; to drink beyond that stage 
is bestial '. The Paranandasutra ( pp. 70-71 ) describes the 
procedure of a festival (Utsavavidhi) among Tantrikas The 
mantra is ' Isvaratman, tava dSsoham ', which may be given to 
even a candala or may be accepted from a oandala. It is further 
provided that the followers of Vama-marga may employ the 
following mantras about the three makaras, that ( the best among)

tiakla, mantras for 'makaras' W57 

Vamaoaras should resort to. They are : ' I take this holy naotar, 
which is a medicine (antidote) for samsara, which is a means 
of cutting off the snares by which the pasu ( in man ) la bound 
and which is declared by Bhairava" (this when taking the first 
i. e. wine ) ; ' I take this mudra which is ' ucchista ' of the Lord 
(i. e. which has been first offered to God), which destroys the 
torments of the heart, which produces joy and which 1705 is 
enriohed with other food materials' (this when taking^ mudra); 
* I take this divine young woman who has drunk wine, that 
always makes the heart full of bliss and that brings about my 
sadhana' (when taking one of the women that are brought 
together ). 

The Hindu Tantra works present two sides, one philosophical 

and spiritual, the other popular, practical and more or less 

magical, whioh relies on mantras, mudras, mandalas, nyasas, 

cakras and yantras as physical means to realize one's identity 

with the Supreme Power or Energy by concentration and as 

conferring extraordinary powers on the devotee. This may be 

illustrated by reference to two typical tantras, the Saradatilaka 

and the Mahanirvana-tantra. The Mahanirvana-tantra, though 

it speaks of the five makaras as means of upasana and though 

it states that when the great Tantra is understood, the Vedas, 

Puranas and sastras are hardly 1706 of any use, puts forward the 

striking conception in IV. 34-47 that Paramesvara 19 one and to 

be described as sat, at and Unanda, that He is one without a 

second, is beyond the gunas and is to be known from the Vedanta 

texts. It further on says that the best mantra is ' om sac- 

oidekam brahma' (III. 14), that those who perform the upasana 

of the Highest Brahma do not require other means of worship 

(sadhana); by sticking to this mantra man becomes brahma. 

In the 4th ohap. however, the Mahaparinirvana starts by saying 

that Durga is the highest prakrti of Paramatma, she has various 

names such as Kali, Bhuvanesvarl, Bagala, Bhairavi, Chhin- 

namastaka, that she is SarasvatI, LaksmI and Sakti, that she 

assumes various forms for securing the purpose of her devotees 

and for the destruction of demons. In the Kaliyuga perfection 

cannot be attained without following hula practices, whioh lead

to the knowledge of brahma and the man who posseases know- 
ledge of brahma is a liberated soul, though living (ho is 
Jivanmvkta). Then there is high praise (IV. 10 ff) of Devi who 
is spoken of as the primordial Sakti ( adya paramS sakti ) and 
all gods including Siva himself derive their powerB from this 
Highest Sakti. A rather astounding statement is made in im 
the words ' as there was partaking of wine and the rest in Satya, 
Treta and Dvapara yugaa, one should do the same in Kah-yuga, 
but in accordance with the Icuta way, and that Kali does not 
affect those who give to the truthful Yogin the five tattvas 
(wine &o.) sanctified according to the kula way'. Then a 
mantra of ton syllables is declared ' hrlm srlm krlm parame- 
svari 1708 svaha', by merely listening to which a man becomes 
jwanmulda. Then by various combinations of the mystic 
syllables with Paramesvarl and Ealika twelve mantras are 
produced ( V. 18 ). But the mantras do not confer siddhi unless 
the kulaeara way is followed viz. the five tattvas 'madya* &c. are 
offered (V. 32-23). Then a Gayatrl mantra is set out (V. 62-63} 
as ' adyayai vidmahe Paramosvaryai dhlmahi I tan-nah Kali 
pracodayat II *, which is to be muttered thrice daily. The Sankhya 
tattvas, Prakrti, Mahat, Ahankara &o. are welded on to the 
worship of Sakti and the Vodic mantra ' Hamsah sucisad ' ( #g 

IV. 40. 5 ) with the Tantrik blja Hrlm ( V. 197 ). The Tantra 
gives directions for the sanctification of flesh ( V. 208-208, 
where Bg. I 22. 20 ' tadvisnoh paramam padam ' is employed), 
of fisb(V. 209-210) where the mantra 'Tryambakam* ($g. 
VIH. 59. 1-2) is employed, of mudra (V. 211-212 where the 
mantras ' Tad Visnoh paramam ' and ' tad-viprSso ' #g. 1. 22. 20- 
21, are employed) to be offered to Devi. The Mahanirvanatantra

Character of Mahanirviwtanira W59 

(18th century ) being composed after Saktism had come into great 

ridicule and obloquy is rather sober. 1 ' 09 It says that women 

of good birth should simply smell wine and not drink it, while 

householder sadhakas should drink only as much as is contained 

in five cups, since by drinking too much men of good family 

incur the loss of siddfo, and should drink only so long as the 

wine quaffed does not make their eyes roll or does not make 

their mind confused. As to the last tattva (maithuna) the 

sadhaka was to confine himself to the woman he chooses as his 

Sakti (VI. 14) and if his wife is alive he is not to touch another 

woman with a vicious intent, otherwise he would go to hell. 1710 

In keeping with its desire to present respectability along with 

tantrik practices, the Mahanirvana devotes chapter VIII. to the 

duties of uirrias and asramas, the duties of the king, the duties 

of servants in general, provides 1711 that persons of all varnaB 

are to marry within the varna and dine with persons of the same 

varna, except when engaged in Bhairavi cakra and Tattva-cakra 

(VIII. 150 ), when men of all varnas are like the best brahmanas, 

and no consideration of the castes of the participants arises nor 

any question about ucehista. It prescribes that no one has the 

adhikara to engage in the performance of Tattvacakra unless 

he is a sBdhaka endowed with knowledge of bralvma. In that 

cafcra the tattva3 (wine and the others) should be collected and 

placed in front of the Devi, the mantra ' Hamsah * ( Bg. IV. 40. 5 ) 

should be recited over all tattvas and the tattvas should be 

offered to the Highest Self with the verse ' Brahmarpanam 

hrahma havir* ( Bhagvadglta IV. 24= Mahanirvana Vm. 314)

and all the sadhakas should engage in drinking and eating. 1713 
Chap. IX enumerates and describes ten samskaias from 
garbhadhana to marriage for members of the three varnas and 
nine for sudras ( omitting upanayana ), wherein Vedio mantras 
are prescribed as m the Dharmasutras and smrtis. One interest- 
ing item is what is called Saiva marriage, whioh is of two kinds, 
one entered into according to the rules of cakra and the other 
lasting for life. It is further provided that in Saiva marriage 1713 
no question of varna or age arises and that if a man has children 
from a wife married in the biahma form and also children of a 
Saiva marriage, it is only the former that take as heirs and the 
latter are entitled only to food and raiment (IX 261-264). 
Chapters X, XI, XII of the MahSnirvlna deal respectively with 
iraddJias, prayaicittas for sins and vyavahciia. 

It is necessary now to turn to the Saradatilaka whioh belongs 
to about the 11th century A. D. That work is divided into 25 
patalas and contains over 4500 verses It presents in the begin- 
ning a somewhat abstruse and involved philosophy. It says 
that Siva is both mrguna and saguna, the former being different 
from Prakrti, the latter being associated with Prakrti. Then it 
describes the order of evolution and manifestation as follows :— 
From the Saguna Paramesvara described as " Sac-eidananda- 
vibhava ' Sakti 1714 proceeds; from the latter arises nada (para) 
and from nada arises hndu (para) which is divided into three 
Viz. bindu (apara), nSda ( apara ) and bija; the first is indentiflad 
with Siva, blja being Sakti and n5da being the coming together 
of the two ( Siva and Sakti ). Sakti creates the worlds, she is 
Sabda-bhalima (L 56) and is called parasakti (I. 52) and para- 
devata (1. 57 ). She flashes like lightning in the adhSra-oakra. 1715

Sakti assumes the form of Kundalini in the human body. From 
Sambhu in the form of btndu arise in order Sadasiva, Isa. Rudra. 
Visnu, Brahma; from the avyakta bmda arise m order the 
mahat-tattva, ahankara and the other tattvas mentioned m the 
Sankhya system. Sakti is all-pervading and yet more subtle 
than the subtlest, she is the Kundalini coiled like a serpent and 
manifests herself in the form of the fifty letters of the Sanskrit 
alphabet (from* a' to 'ksa'). 

Before proceeding further some explanation of the six cakras 
which form an important constituent subject of several tantras 
is needed. There are said to be six cakras (centres) in the 
human body viz. 5-dhara or MuladhSra (at the base of the spine), 
Svadhisthana ( near the generative organ ), Manipura ( near the 
navel), Anahata (near the heart ), Visuddha ( near throat), and 
ijfia (between the brows). Besides these, there is Brahma- 
randhra figured as the pericarp of the thousand-petalled lotus 

( Continued from last £age ) 
of t ^thfiw i in which plate I shows the positions ol the six cakras also 
called lotuses ($adma), plates II to VII facing pp. 356, 365, 370, 382, 392, 
414 illustrate the six chakras from Muladhara to Ajna together with their 
colours, numbers of petals, letters, the devatas in each and other details 
These are drawings used hy the Yogis. Plate VIII facing p 430 illustrates 
' sahairara' '. Vide C, W, Leadbeater's work on 'the chakras' (Adyar, 
1927), in which the author claims that the illustrations of the cakras 
represent them as they actually appear to those who can see them and on 
p. 56 he furnishes a table of the colours of the lotus petals as observed by 
Leadbeater and his friends, and as described in q^-tichl^uui, i$H-t<f^dl and 
'U»t3",^l"| . The Rudrayamala ( 17th Patala, verse 10 ) speaks of KundalT as 
' Atharvavedacakrastha Kundali paradevata ', verses 21-24 speak of Kundalini 
passing from Muladhara-cakra and reaching the crown of the head that has 
the thousand-petalled lotus, that when united with Siva he (sadhaka) drinks 
nectar there. Rudrayamala (27 58-70) dilates on the six cakras and the 
Sahasrara together with the dalas (petals) and letters assigned to each, 
A stern warning has to be given that none should try to experiment about 
the cakras by reading books or try to rouse the Kundalini except under 
the guidance of a real Master in Yoga, as otherwise very dangerous con- 
sequences would follow. Even as regards wrong methods of Pranayama 
and Dharana, the Vayupurana (cbap XI 37-60) states that Yoga practices 
by ignorant men result in dullness of intelligence, deafness, dumbness, 
blindness, loss of memory, premature old age and disease and it specifies 
certain remedies to cure these defects. The present author knew a 
person who practised pranayama continuously for long periods becoming 
Monedeaf, though otherwise he was strong and muscular, and an expert in 
ear diseases declared on examination that there was no possibility of his 
Mcovery by the methods of modern medical science.

within the crown of the head. The cakras aie often indentified 
with the nerve plexuses of modern physiology, hut the descrip- 
tions in Sanskrit works of the KundalinI and the cakraa are 
meant to refer not to the gross hody hut rather to what is situated 
in the subtle body that vanishes when a man dies. The idea 
of the relevant Sanskrit texts is that the KundalinI Sakti 
( ' Kundalin' means a serpent } is aBleep in the Maladhara-eakra 
coiled like a serpent and has to be roused by the practices of 
Yoga and deep meditation 171 * The Saradatilaka asks in an 
eloquent stanza the sadhaka to meditate upon the KundalinI 
which when roused passes from the Muladhara-cakra by means 
of the Susumna-nadI (which is in the centre of the spinal 
column J through all the six cakras, unites with Siva in the 
Sahasrara (thousand-petalled) cakra and then returns to 
Mluladhara. Each of the six cakras is said to have a certain 
number of petals viz. 4, 6, 10, 13, 16, 2 (50 in all) in order from 
Muladhara to Ajna (vide Rudrayamala, 17th Patala, verses 
55-56 ). The letters of the alphabet also are 50 ( from ' a ' to 
'ksa') and they are assigned in groups to the six cakras as 
follows : ha and ksa to -£;jna, 16 vowels to Visuddha in the 
throat, letters ka to tha (12 m all) to Anahata, letters Da to Pha 
(10) to Manipflra, ba tola (6 in all) to SvadhiBthana, letters 
vatosa(4)to Muladhara. Some tantras state the colour of 
each of the Bix cakras and identify them with the five elements 
and the mind. These speculations of the Yoga and Tantras are

Theory of Cakras and Upanisads 1063 

developments of the ancient Upanisad theories briefly noticed 
below. 1717 

Letters form words and words form mantras, that are the 
power incarnate of Sakti. Then the Saradatilaka describes 
asana, mandapa, kunda, mandala, pithas { on which images of 
gods are to be placed), diksa (initiation), pranapratistha 
(vivifying images), production of sacrificial fire. The Sarada- 
tilaka (1.109 and V. 81-91), the Varivasyarahasya (11.80), 
the Parasuramakalpasutra ( I. 4, ' Sat-trimsat tattvani visvam ' ) 
and other Tantrik and Agamic works enumerate 36 tattvas 
(including those of the sankhya system). From chap. "VII. to 
XXTTT mantras of different deities, their formation, use and 
results, abhisekas and mudras are described. Yantras are dealt 
with in chap. XXIV and Yoga in chap. XXV. It must be said 
to the credit of the Saradatilaka that it treats of only mantras 
and mudras and hardly anywhere treats of the other makaras. 
The Saradatilaka has been profusely quoted as an authoritative 
Tantra by medieval Dharmasastra writers like Govindsnanda, 
Raghunandana, EamalakaTa, Nllakantha, Mitramisra and 
orthers. In J. G J. El vol. HI. pp 97-108 M. M. Gopinath 
Kaviiaja contributes a learned paper on nada, bindu and kala 
and takes great pains to elucidate these and hopes that his 
exposition will make the meaning of these words clear ( p. 103 ). 
But the author feels grave doubts whether most readers will find* 
the meanings clear. 

Many tankas speak of the five makaras as the means of 
worshipping Devi, as e nabling a man to possess m iraculous

powers and as leading to final liberation. The Kularnava states 
' the great Bhairava has prescribed that in the Kaula system 
Siddhi (perfection) results from those very substances by 
( resorting to ) which ( ordinarily ) men incur sin '. That means 
that the Kaula system eradicates poison by poison or, to employ 
modern terminology, its principles are like those of 
Homeopathy. 1718 

The Tantras seem to be not unaware that in prescribing the 
five makaras as leading to mukti (final liberation) they were 
playing with fire. The Kularnava itself remarks ( II. 117-119 
and 122 ) 'If by merely drinking wine a man were to attain 
siddhi (miraculous powers, perfection), then all wretched 
drunkards may attain siddhi. If, by merely eating meat a holy 
goal were to be secured then all meat-eaters in the world would 
be holy men. If by mere intercourse with a woman (called 
sdktt ) moksa was to result, then all men in the world may attain 
liberation. To follow the path (of Kula) is indeed more 
unattainable than walking on the edge of a sword, than clinging 
to a tiger's neck, than holding a serpent ( in one's hand)' The 
Kularnava prefaces the preceding dicta by the words 'Many, 
who are devoid of traditional knowledge and who profane ( the 
sastra ) by false ideas, imagine that the Kaulika doctrine is this 
and that, relying on their ( poor ) intellect ' ( II. 116 ) 

The Devlbhagavata provides (XT. 1. 25) that so much of 
tantra as is not opposed to the Veda is undoubtedly authorita- 
tive (vedavirodhi cet tantram tat pramanam na samsayah), hut 
what is opposed to Veda is not authoritative. 

There appears to have been great rivalry between the Hindu 
and Buddhist tantras The Saktisangama-tantra, one of the 
most popular and most exhaustive works on tantra, states that 
Devi manifests herself for the destruction of Bauddha and other 
heretical sects, for the removal of the confusing admixture of

different cults, fop the establishment of the (true) Quit, for the 
protection of what the brahmanas stand for and for the perfect 
attainment of mantra-sastra. 1719 The Bauddha tantras, on the 
other hand, were not slow to retaliate. 

It would not be entirely out of place if a few words were 
devoted to the Bauddha Tantras, particularly of the Vajrayana. 
It has already been shown above ( pp. 943-44 note 1516 ) that 
all Buddhists, whether of the hinayana or mahctyana type, were" 
required to observe strict rules and regulations such as those of 
pancasilas and of taking refuge with Buddha, Dharma and 
Sangha and of dasasllas (for monks). The goal of nirvana 
(particularly under Mahayana doctrines) could be reached only 
after a very long time or after several births. As luxuries viz. 
flesh, fish, wine and women had been banned, the general mass J 
of the people and probably monks also were tired of the strict 
mode of life and long waiting for the goal. Buddhist Tantras 
like the Guhyasamaja (that belongs to the Vajrayana sohool ) 
provided an easy process by which liberation and even Buddha- 
hood could be secured in a short time and even in 1720 one life 
and averred that Bodhisattvas and Buddhas attained the aeat- 
of dkarma by enjoying all objects of pleasure as they 1721 pleased. 
The word Vajra means both ' diamond' and * thunderbolt'. The 
tost meaning appears to have been principally meant in the 
babyanmBja but the 2nd meaning also must have been some- 
times intended. Vajra denotes anything which is hard like a 
aiamond.^ In the Guhyasamajatantra the word Vajra, either 
singly or m compounds, occurs hundreds of times. Kaya (body)

to the Yogacfea school, and the Mahasukha (Blis3> added by the 
Scktaa. It also means the male organ in the mysiio languagt 
of Saktas. Though the original Buddhist rules insisted on 
ahimBS, Guhyasamaja permitted several kinds of flesh, suah ai 
that of elephants, horses, dogs and even human 1723 flesh. Early 
Buddhism insisted upon truthfulness and continence ( hrahma- 
carya); vajrayana, being an innovating revolt, allowed the 
killing of all animals, speaking untruth, intercourse with women 
(including even incest with the mother, sister 1 ' 21 and daughter) 
and appropriating.'wealth not donated by any one. This was 
called vajramarga (the path of vajra), which is said to have bean 
the dootrine of all Buddhas. 

The Prajnopaya ( 1. 20 ) describes the state reaohed by the 
Vajrayana method as follows. 'It is neither duality nor non- 
duality, it is full of peace, beneficent, present everywhere, to be 
realised by one's own self, steady (unchanging), undisturbed 
and full of PrajfiS ( wisdom ) and TJpaya (activity with compas-

sion) and it further provides (V. 22-23) that 'by those who 

hanker after liberation perfection ^ wisdom mu stb e sought 

(resorted to or adored) in all ways. This perfection of wisdom 

fa everywhere present assuming the form of woman Prama 

was linked up with an intense state of emotion called Sukha or 

Mahasukha (great bliss). "It being of the nature of endless 

bliss is designated mahasukha; it is benehcent all round, most 

eminent and conduces to complete enlightenment' (Prajnopaya. 

1.27) and 'this all Buddha knowledge which is by its nature 

to be experienced by one's inmost self is oalled Mahasukha 

(great bliss) Bince it is the most eminent of all pleasures 

( Jfianasiddhi VII 3 ). The word Prajna is feminine in gender 

and therefore some Vajrayana writers identified Prajna with 

woman; by erotic symbolism and far-fetched analogies the cult 

of woman was started. 

Dr.H. V. Guenther has published a book styled 'Yuga- 
naddha' propounding the Tantrik view of life based only on 
Buddhist Tantras and endeavours to prove in that work (of 
about 190 pages) that the Buddhist Tantrikas try to Testore 
life in its entirety, whioh is neither an indulgence in passions 
nor a rejection and escape, but a complete reconciliation to the 
hard facts of life, that the sexual aspeot of the Tantras is but the 
corrective against the one-sided intellectualism and rationalism 
of mere philosophy whioh is unable to cope with the problems 
of everyday life and that the symbol of Yuganaddha points to 
the unique harmony and interpenetration of masculinity and 
feminity, of blunt truth and symbolic truth, of intellect and 
humanity. It is not possible even to summarize this work or 
criticize it here. The core of the doctrine of the Vajrayana 
tantras is found in the passages quoted in notes 1720-21, 1723-24. 
The argument is: according to these Tantras perception of 
wholeness is the most joyous of all human experiences and man's 
experience will not be full but only partial if he has no experience 
of feminity i. e. of everything female. He may experience 
feminity through all female members of his family. Therefore, 
it is not to be wondered at, says Dr. Guenther, that 'this ex- 
perienca so often has an incestuous character'. Then he offers (on 
pp 106-112) a lengthy explanation of what he means which, the 
present author has to confess, is not quite clear to his moderate 
mental abilities. Dr. Guenther appears to be steeped in all the 
latest theories of modern psychologists like those of Breud and 
tries to expound-that Buddhist authors of the Sth century A. D. 
like Anangavajra and Indrabhutihad plumbed the depths of the 



1068 Hiatoru of DharmaiVstra I See. VI, Ch. XXVI 

psychical life on the linos of modern psycho-analysis. Granting 
for a moment all that Dr. Guonthor says about bi-sexuality, 
about sexual partnership being the boat expression for the moat 
intimate relation botwoon two oppositos, about woman being 
for the malo a matorial object and a goddoss, the present writer 
feols that one question appears to have been not satisfactorily 
answered or explained, viz. why did not the Buddhist Tantrikas 
simply exhort the gadhaka to understand the emotions, view- 
points and value of woman aa a mother, sister, wife, daughter 
or as a woman in general and why did thoy frequently and 
blatantly harp upon sexual intercourse of even an incestuous 
kind as a quick method of realizing the goal ? 

The Guhyasamaja-tantra puts forward a quick and short 
method for realising Buddhahood and for the attainment of 
miraculous powers (siddhis) through the processes of Yoga. 
-The siddhis are Baid to bo of two kmd3, Samanya ( ordinary, ins 
such as becoming invisible) and Uttama (highest i. e. attaining 
Buddhahood). Four means for securing ordinary siddhis are 
mentioned and they are called Vajrwcaluska. It is further 
provided that the best siddhi is acquired by the nectar of 
knowledge duo to the six angas 17M of Yoga (and by no other 
way) viz Fratyahara, Dhyana, PrSnSyama, Dharana, Anusmrti 
and Samadhi. It is worthy of note that the first three angas of 
yoga mentioned in the Yogasutra viz. yama, myama™ 3 and asana 
are omitted and a new one, Anusmrti, is added. Yama could 
not he included because to the Guhyasamaja it did not matter 
if the sadhaka ate flesh, or indulged in sexual intercourse or told 
lies, while in Yogasutra yamas are ahunaa. satya (truthfulness), 
asleya ( not appropriating anything that doe3 not belong to one), 
brahmacarya (sexual purity) and apangrcdia (non-aceeptanoe 
of gifts ). Niyamas could not be included because among the five

niyamas are svadhyaya (Veda study) and ( Isvarapranidhana ) 
devotion to or surrender to God. Many Bauddhas reviled the 
Yeda and acknowledged no Supreme Deity. The Guhyasamaja 
introduced Yogio practices for quickly securing Buddhahood. 
The idea of allowing flesh and sexual intercourse seems to have 
been that the Togin is to be indifferent as to what he does so 
long as he ib striving for the goal of Buddhahood, for development 
of his psychic life and that he may disregard all social conven- 
tions and rules. 1728 Another innovation of the Vajrayana was 
the introduction of upasana of Sakti for liberation through Toga. 
The Guhya-aamaja provides that if even after making efforts for 
six months, the sadhaka has no realisation, he may repeat his 
efforts for three time3 more and if even after that he has no 
enlightenment he should resort to Hathayoga and then he would 
attain correct knowledge through Yoga. A further innovation 
was the theory of the five Dhyani-buddhas, 1729 emanating from 
the Bhagavan, who represent the five Skandhas or fundamental 
principles of which the whole creation is composed and each of 
whom was associated with a female Sakti. The teaching of the 
Guhyasamaja is that if psychical power and miraculous siddhis 
-are to be developed females must be associated with those who 
undertake Yogio exercises to achieve their ends. Thus the 
^prophecy of the founder of Buddhism pronounced, when yielding 
to the pressure and entreaties of his favourite disciple Ananda 
for allowing women to be members of the sangha and to be nuns, 
that on account of this innovation his system would stand fast 
only for five hundred years, though otherwise it would have lasted 
tor a thousand years, was literally fulfilled ( vide OuUavagga

X 1. 6 in Vinaya Texts, vol. in. S. B. E. XX. p. 325 ). If wa 
accept 483 B. 0. as the date of Buddha's Parinirvana (as many 
scholars hold ) or 477 B.C. (as A. Fouoher holds) 500 years 
therefrom would bring us to the first century A. D. and it is clear 
that by a century or two after that time much of Buddha's 
teaching appears to hare been almost completely swamped by 
doctrines of MahSyana and Vajrayina Tantras. By a strange 
irony of fate Buddha's ' dharma-cakra-pravartana ' came to bs 
transformed into 'adharma-cakra-pravartana' by many of his 
so-called followers of the VajraySna. In the Maha-parmibbana- 
sutta V. 23 ( S. B. E. vol XI. p. 91 ) the Buddha was very strict 
and warned bhikkhu3 not to see bhikkhunls, not to talk to them 
if they could not avoid seeing them, and to be wide awake if a 
nun talked to them. Buddha severely rebuked one of his 
disciples for showing his miraculous powers (vide p. 1037 and 
n. 1672 above), but Guhyasamaja and other Buddhi3t tantras 
make provision for endowing the sadhaka with miraculous 
powers, such as causing rainfall in case of drought ( Guhya- 
samara p. 84), killing an enemy by magical rites over an 
effigy of the enemy (ifotf.p. 96). Besides, the Guhyasamaja 
knows the six cruel or terrible magic acts (called ' satkarm&ni), 
viz. Santi (rite for averting disease or black magio), vaslkarana 
(bewitching women and men and even gods), sta?nbham (stop- 
ping the movements or aotions of others), vidoe$a»a (oreating 
enmity between two friends or two persons who love each other ), 
uccaiana (making a person or enemy flee from the country, town 
er village), murana (killing or causing permanent injury to 
living beings). The Guhyasamaja mentions these six { putting 
* akarsana ' for ' vidvesana ') respectively at pp. 168, 165, 96, 87 
(Akarsana), 81, 130. Vide Sadhanamala pp. 368-369 for 
the same and for the shape of mandalas and times for each of 
the six cruel rites. Even the rather sober Saradatilaka-tantra 
mentions these six (23. 122), defines them (23. 123-125), 
provides that Eati.VanI (speech or SarasvatI), Rama, Jyestfia 
Durga and Kali are respectively the six deities of these six cruel 
acts and must be worshipped at the commencement, that sue 
periods of ten gliatikas from sunrise are respectively appropriate 
to these six and so also are certain seasons (23. 126-139). B . « 
most astounding that the Prapancasara (23.5) ascribed to tne 
great advaita teacher Sankaracarya describes at length a mantta 
called Trailokya-mohana for accomplishing the above six 
cruel actsi 



Tantras emplwsize importance of guru 1071 

Both Hindu and Buddhist Tantras 1730 lay great emphasis on 
the importance and qualifications of the guru. The Bauddha 
Tantras have the highest praise for the guru. The Jnanasiddfci 
( 13. 9-12 ) prescribes high qualifications and the Frajfiopayavini- 
soaya-siddhi (HI. 9-16 ) contains a grand eulogy of the guru, 
identifying him with Buddha and calling him omniscient and 
soon. The Advayasiddhi of Laksmlnkara (about 729 A. D.), 
who started the astounding doctrine that one should offer worship 
to one's own body wherein all gods reside, says that in the three 
worlds there is none higher than the acarya. In the Nityotsava 
of TJmananda-natha, pupil of Bhasurananda-natha (i. e. 
Bhaskararaya as he was called before he took dlksa ) the guru 
Bhaskararaya is praised in the following hyperbolical terms 1731 
* to whom no part of the earth was unseen ( owing to his yogic 
sight), there was no king who was not his slave, to whom no 
sastra was unknown; why use more words, whose form was 
the highest Sakti herself.' But the Jnana-siddhi and KulSroava 
(XHI. 128 ) warn against gurus who falsely pretend to know the 
truth and give instruction in dharm a from greed for money. 
The Kularnava ( ullasas XH and XITT ) are devoted to the quali- 
fioations and greatness of guru. The Saradatilaka also sets out 
the qualifications of the tantrika guru (II. 142-144) and of the 
disciple (m.l45-152).«« Tte g,^ among other matters 'must 
know the essence of all Agamas and the principles and meaning 
of all sastras, he must be one whose words come out true, who 
has a quiet mind, who has profoundly studied the Veda and its 
meaning, who follows the path of Toga and whose bearing is as 
beneficent as that of a deity." Among the many requirements 
about a disciple, 1 ^ one is that he must keep secret the mantra 
and puja imparted by his guru. The disciple places the gum's 
teet on his head and surrenders his body, wealth and even life to

the guru. The necessity of a guru for the acquisition of esoteric 
philosophy is stressed by the Upanisada also. Far, example the 
Kathopanisad 173 * says 'this knowledge cannot be obtained by 
ratiocination, it can be understood well only when expounded, 
by another'; the Chandogya (IV. 9. 3 ) says 'Sir, I have heard 
from men like you that only knowledge that is learnt from a 
teacher leads to real good'. The Lingapurana 1735 and others 
say that guru is identioal with Siva and the rewards of devotion 
to Siva and to the guru are the same. The Kularnava (XI. 46 ) 
emphasizes that the order of the succession of gurus, the Agamas, 
Smnaya, mantra and practices -all these when learnt from the 
lips of a guru become fruitful and not otherwise. The Frapafioa- 
sara provides 'the disoiple should consider in his mind that 
guru, devata and mantra are one and should repeat a hundred' 
times the mantra that he received by the favour of the guru.' 

The Vedanta system requires for its understanding high 
intellectual and moral attainments and could be followed by 
only a few gifted souIb. It is olaimed that Tantras provide a 
method which assists men of ordinary intellect and which 
utilizes visual and physical processes for the attainment of 
spiritual experience, for the development of psychio forces and 
for the quick attainment of liberation by such practices as the 
repetition of mantras, mudras, nyasa, mandalas, cakras and 
yantras. The respect for the guru sometimes reached amongst 
Tantrik writers to extreme and disgusting lengths as the note

Perverse Tantrik practices and Sanskrit Literature 1073 

The teaching of Tantrika texts about the five makaras must 
have created a very unhealthy and dehased state among all 
classes, particularly the lower orders of Society. The centuries 
from the 7th to the 12th A. D. were the peak period of Tantrifc 
works and cults, both Hindu and Buddhist. In a certain cult of 
the Vajrayana the gurus wore a blue vesture. A story is narrated 
of a guru ( a monk) of the sammitiya sect who went dressed id a 
blue dress to a courtezan. He did not return to the monastery 
at night. When asked in the morning by his disciples why he 
put on a blue dress, he explained the great spiritual merit of the 
blue-coloured dress Since then his followers began to wear 
blue dress and in their book called "Nflapatadarsana' it is 
written 'the god Kamadeva (Eros) is a jewel, a courtezan is a 
jewel, wine is a jewel, I bow to these three jewels; other so-called 
jewels are three glass beads'. It should be remembered that for 
devout Buddhists, Buddha, Dharma and Sangha are three 
Ratnas ( jewels). The followers of the Nilapatadarsana deemed 
these last three to be as worthless as glass beads. Vide Bhiksu 
Rahula Sankrtyayana's paper ' On Vajrayana or Mantrayana ' in 
J. A. vol 225 (1934) p. 216 where this is narrated. False gurus 
must have gone about deluding people with rosy prospects of 
blisB and liberation by the easy method of drinking wine, 
eating flesh and free association with all sorts of women. The 
Indian literature of those centuries is full of condemnation and 
caricatures of the methods of Tantrik worship by means of wine, 
flesh and sexual laxity. A few instances may be cited here. In

(while representing that he was somewhat tipsy) 'owing to the 
favour of our guru we know nothing ahout mantras or tantras 
or meditation. We drink wine, dally with women and yet, 
heing devoted to the Kula path, we reaoh moksa. A fierce 
strumpet is given diksa and made a lawful wife, wine is drunk 
and flesh is consumed, our food is got by begging for alms, our 
bed is a piece of hide. To whom would the Kauladharma not 
appear attractive ? Even gods headed by Visnu and Brahma 
declare that liberation is attained by meditation, Veda study 
and performance of Vodic sacrifices ; only one God, the husband 
of TJma, perceived that moksa (can be attained) by dalliance 
with women and by wine '. The Yasastilaka-campu ( composed 
in 959 A. D.) after referring to the Daksina and Vama paths of 
Saivagama quotes a verse of the great poet 1738 BhSsa " a person 
should drink wine, look at the face of the woman dear to him, 
wear a dress naturally charming and free from being odd; may 
the adorable Siva be long-lived, who (first) discovered such a 
path to moksa!" The Dasavatara-oarita of Ksemendra (3rd 
quarter of 11th century A. D. ) states in one verse what the 
Tantrik gurus and their followers did 'Gurus declare that 
liberation follows by the drinking of wine from the same goblet 
by various craftsmen such as washermen, weavers, workers in 
hides, kapahlcas, in the procedure of cakrapuja, and by dalliance 
with women without the least scruple and by always leading a 
life of festivities." m9 The Eaja-taranginI (middle of 12th

in Kashmir there were Tsntrik gurus that literally carried out 
what the Guhyasamajatantra quoted in note 1724 apparently 
recommended to Buddhist Yogis In the drama called Mofca- 
parajaya hy Yasahpala under king Ajayadeva, successor of 
Kumarapala, among the dramatis personae is a Icaula who declares 
his doctrine to he eating flesh every day, drinking wjub without 
any qualms and allowing the mind free scope. 1743 Apararka 
quotes a verse which shows that, in the midst of numerous cults, 
it was difficult to he consistent: "A person may be at heart 
a Kaula (follower of the Kula doctrine), in outward appearance 
he may look a Saiva, and he may follow Vaidika rites in his 
usual practices. One should live grasping what is essential like 
the cocoanut nii fruit". It appears that great scholars and 
poets had a sneaking admiration for Tantrika worship. The 
great writer Vidyapati of Mithila appears to he aVaisnava 
from his devotional songs, hut wrote the Saivasarvasvasara (so 
he may he called a Saiva), and wrote also DurgabhaktitarangiDl 
(and thus appears to hare been a Sskta) and composed also a 
Tantrik 1745 work. The very first verse of Vidyapati's 'Purusa- 
parlksS* contains an invocation of Adi-Sakti.' Bengal and 
Assam were the strongholds of Sakta doctrines and even now 
Kali worship is still in vogue there, hut it was the great Bengal

Possible motives for debased Tantra practices 1077 

king Ballalasena who discarded Devfpurana as an authority in 
his encyclopaedic work on gifts called Danasagara. 17 * 6 

It is possible that the founders of the Tantrik or Sakta cult" 
of the five maJcaras threw defiance at the terrible aspect of God 
or the Highest Spirit, that rules the destinies of men and things 
and that made men sometimes suffer terribly even if they led 
lives of virtue, to do the worst for their disregard of conven- 
tional morality and social practices and hoped by their Yoga 
exercises to attain to high psychical powers and bliss. 1747 There 
is another possible motive also. Masses of common people were 
being drawn towards Buddhism. The founders of Hindu Tantrik 
cults wanted to retain them within the Hindu fold. As common 
people drank wine and ate meat, they were told that they would 
attain higher spiritual levels even while indulging in meat and 
drink provided they followed .Tantrik gurus and practices. 
The idea was that Sakti was all and was for all; bhoga (enjoy- 
ment) need not be given up, as man is part of Devi or Siva. 
Bhoga should be sublimated, that is all that is required in Kaula- 
sastra. The Tantrikas 5 » s substitute a yoga of enjoyment 
(bhoga) for the yoga of abstinence and asceticism. When 
indulging in the left-hand path practices the sadhaka is supposed 
or held to be destroying the egoistic elements of the soul. 

The Mahanirvanatantra and a few others endeavour to stem 
the tide of sexual immorality and promiscuity. For example, 
Kamesvara, the commentator of Parasuramakalpasutra, says 
that one that has not conquered his senses has no adhkat a for ' 
Kaulamarga (p.153). This is in direct conflict with what 
even the Mahanirvanatantra says that all men from brahmanas 
to the untouchables have adhikara for Kula practices. Modern 
apologists for Tantrism emphasize that the instructions embodied 
MW« hyaS8m ?a, the directions for the mode of life to be 

attatea r CTS f V ^T Da ' apply 0nly t0 tha Y °S fe who have

reply is ' who is to decido that a particular person had attained 
the minimum spiritual level except the man himself and, 
supposing that all the directions were meant for Yogis, why was 
it necessary to say In a blatant manner and language that a 
Yogi practising Vajrayana may engage in what common and 
less sophisticated people deem to be incest ? This is not the 
place to reply to all apologists for ancient and modieval Tantrik 
works. But a few must be dealt with because they are liable to 
create misunderstandings, if allowed to go uncritioized. In his 
Preface to 'Principles of Tantra' Part 2, Sir John Woodroffe 
states (p. IX. ) that the use of flesh, fish and wino was common 
in the Vedic age and that the MabSbhSrata and some PurSnas 
like the Kalika, Msrkandeya and Kurma refer to consumption 
of wine, meat and fish. This looks liko special pleading and is 
misleading. The question is: was sw« offered to tho gods in 
every day or periodic sacrifices as an offering in the Rgveda or 
any other Veda. In the Vodic ago wino may have been known 
and even drunk, hut what is matorial to recognize is that there 
is a difference made between Soma and sura. Vide Sat. l7W Br. 
" Soma is truth, prosperity, light and sura is untruth, misory 
and darkness " ( V. 1. 5. 38 ). While Soma is mentioned hundreds 
of times in the Rgveda, has the 9th mandala of the Rgveda 
specially reserved for its praises and was offered to gods, tho 
word sura occurs only six times in the Rgveda and it is nowhoro 
expressly stated that it was offered to any god as a religious 
offering; on the contrary, in a hymn to Varuna, sur3 is put for- 
ward aB leading to tho commission of sin just as anger and 
gambling do (Rg. VII. 86. 6 'nasa svo dakso Varuna dhrutih 
sa sura manyur-vibhldako acittih ). In his zeal for tho vindica- 
tion of Tantrism Arthur Avalon is injudicious onough to 
misinterpret simple words. In the Intro, to 'Principles of 
Tantra' p. VII he quotes flg. 1. 166, 7 "arcantyarkam madirasya 
pltaye " and translates " worshipping tho Sun before drinking 
madira (wine)." The word here is jiwhia (and not 'madira'), 
it is an adjective and means "oxhilarating". Tho word 
"Madira" novor occurs in the #g while "madira" as on adjec- 
tive, occurs at least sixteen times and qualifies Soma, Jndo, 
Amsu, Rasa orMadhu, generally expressed (andiaroly implied). 
There is no word for " before." Thai quartor meanB * tlioy ( Uio 
worshippers or Maruts) worship (Indra) who h worthy of praipo

MadirU and Sura in ancient times 1079 

drinking the exhilarating ( Soma ) ' The word madiia ( for wine ) 
hardly ever occurs in any genuine work of Yedic times. Its 
earliest occurrence is probably in the Mahabharata. Beference 
is also made by modern apologists to the offering of sura in the 
Saufcramam isti in honour of Indra. But the circumstances 
are peculiar. SautramanI is only one out of numerous sacrifices 
and the occasions for performing it were rare i. e. it was per- 
formed at the end of Eajasuya and also at the end of Agnicayana 
and when a priest who had drunk too much of soma vomited. 
The most important fact, however, is that the remnants of sura 
offered in SautramanI were not drunk by the priests engaged in 
it but a brahmana had to be hired for drinking the remnants 
and if no brahmana could be secured then the remnants were to 
be poured over an ant-hill (vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 1226 for 
details). The Eathakasamhita 1750 contains an interesting 
passage " Therefore -an elderly person and a youngster, the 
daughter-in-law and the father-in-Jaw, drink liquor and remain 
babbling together; thoughtlessness is sin; therefore a brahmana 
does not drink sura with the thought that * otherwise ( if I drink 
it) I may be tainted by sin' ; therefore this is for ksatriya; one 
should say to a brahmana that sura, if drank by a ksatriya, 
does not harm the latter." These passages show that not only 
the priests did not drink sura oven in SautramanI but that it 
had become difficult to hire a brahmana for drinking it by the 
time of the Ksthaka-samhita. The passage of the Vajasaneya 
Samhita 19. 5 relied on at p. VH (of Intro, to 'Principles of 
xantra* part II) also TeferB to Sautramam and to no other sacri- 
fice. The mantra is "Brahma ksatram pavate teja indriyam 
suraya somah suta asuto madaya" and means that "Soma 
whenmixed with sutS becomes a strong drink and leads to 
intoxication." The Chandogya V. 10. 9 (q ahove p 1578 n. 943 ) 
counts the drinker of sura among the five grave sinners. There- 
tore, there is hardly any analogy between the offering of wine 
m SautramanI and the teaching about offering wine to Devi as 
provided in the Tantras. Similarly, the reference to the 
Atharvaveda as containing magical rites does not help at all. 
bociety had advanced far beyond that stage and Manu SI. 63 
looked upon abhicara (i.e. performance of a magic rite like 
^yenayaga for killing a person) and miilakarma (i e.hringing 



1080 Historv of Dharmatuslra [Soc.VI,Ch.XXVi 

undor one's control a porson or a woman by horbs and mantras J 
as a sin, though a lossor ono ( an upapulaka). The roforonoe to 
tho Mahabharata ( Udyogaparva, 59. 5 ff ) is again misleading. 
Wino was drunk by pooplo in tbo Mahabharata times, but not 
as paTt of a religious ritual ns in the Tantras, Vido pp 964-966 
of H. of Dh. vol. 1H for a noto on 'intoxicating drinks.' Tho 
reference to Mfirkandoya and other purSnas is of no avail as 
evidonco, since at least tho present author holds that those parts 
of tho Puranas woro written and interpolated after Tantrik rites 
had taken a firm hold on some sections of tho Hindu society. 
Tho reference to sexual intercourse in tho Mahavrata nsl is most 
misleading. In tho Tantras like tho Kularnava and tho Guhya- 
samSja it is tho Badhaka himself who is to practise mmlhma as 
one of tho ways of securing marvellous powers and higher 
spiritual attainments. But in tho Mnlmvrata tho sexual inter- 
course is by strangers to tho sacrifice (and -not by tho yajamuna 
nor by any of tho priests), is a purely symbolical act and bears 
no analogy to a sadhaka himself engaging in maithuna as a 
rehgioUB rito to placate tho Dovl. Evon a lato reformist work 
like the MahSnirvana (VIII. 174-175) expressly says that thoso 
of the five tattvas which a sadhaka can securo, such as flesh and 
others, should have recited over them tho mantra 'am, hrlm, 
krom, svSha ' a hundred times, that he should refloct that every- 
thing is a product of bia/nna, should close his eyes, should offer 
those to Kali and should himself drink and eat thorn. As the 
Tantrik proscriptions of tho mahwas for attainment of mira- 
culous powers and of liberation had shocked people and hod 
brought the tantras into great disrepute, later Hindu Tantrik 
works like the Saktisangamatantra (between 1555-1607 A D.) 
began to offer symbolic interpretations. They " M say that the

Symbolic interpretations of madya, maithuna &c 1081 

words 'madya, raudra, maithuna' &o. ate not used ia the 
Ordinary popular sense but in a special esoteric sense. T?or 
SmoS mudra has several senses, viz. a mixture of jaggery 
and ginger, or of salt and oil-cake or garlic and tamarmd frart, 
or wheat and masa beans, that madya (wine) is not what » 
prepared from maohavl ( spring flower ) but it springs from tbe 
joyful experience (or rasa) of Sakti, when effort is made to 
awaken the Kundalinl. It may be admitted that some Tantrik 
works and writers divide men into three classes, pasu (the-bestiai 
ones ),vlra( those that have made great progress on the path of 
spiritual discipline) and daiva (those who are godlike). As 
regards these three, the five makaras are assigned by some 
apologistic writers different meanings. D. IS. Bose in his work 
•Tantras, their philosophy and occult secrets' boldly asserts 
(p. 110 ) that the real significance of the five makaras has been 
deliberately perverted by vicious people and explains (p. Ill ) 
that madya is the nectarine stream issuing from the cavity of 
the brain where the soul resides, matsya means suppression of 
vital airs, mamsa means ' vow of silence,' ' maithuna ' means 
' meditation on the acts of creation and destruction. 

The Tantrikas clothe their practices in bombastic and high- 
sounding words. The five makaras are called panca-tattvas, 
kuladravyas or kulatattvas. Maithuna is generally referred to 
as paficamatattva, the woman with whom sexual intercourse is 
to be had or who wa3 at least to be associated with a male- in 
Tantra worship is called Sakti (vide Kularnava 'VII 39-43 and 
Mahanirvana VI. 18-20 ) or prakrti or lata and this special 
ritual is called ' Latasadhana ' (Mahanirvana I. 52). Wine is 
called tirthavari (holy water) or karana (VIII. 168 and VI. 17 ). 
The Mahanirvana-tantra, though a reformist work and in 
certain cases asking the king to punish drunkards (SI. 113-121 ),

the above and also later on that the explanations do not all completely

1083 History of Dharmainslra [ Sea VI, Oh. XXVI 

waxes eloquent over wine and praises it as Tara in the form Ma 
of a fluid substance, as the saviour of individual souls, as the 
mother (or producer) of bhoga( enjoyment) and moksa (libera- 
tion ) and as the remover of misfortunes and diseases and after 
some further praise of wine winds up by saying that those men 
who drink wine according to the rules and with a well-controlled 
mind are gods on earth ( XI. 108 ). For the worship of Sakti the 
five tabbvas are absolutely necessary ( Mahanirvana-tantra V. 
21-24 quoted in note 1695 above and 1754 Kularaava V. 69 and 
76). Some tantras say that the meaning of tattva differs 
according as the person concerned is Tamasiba ( a pain kind of 
worshipper), Rajasifca (a vlra as he is called), sattvika (a divya, 
a person who is godlike ). Madya means according to various 
TSntrik Texts real wine as well as a substitute like ooooanut 
water or any other liquid; it also means that intoxioating know- 
ledge that comes of Yoga practices, whereby the worshipper 
becomes senseless as regards the external world. Mamsa is the 
act whereby the sadhaka surrenders himself and his action to 
lord Siva. Mdtsya (fish, of which the first part 'mat' means 
'mine') is that psychical state by which the worshipper sympa- 
thizes with the pleasure and pain of all beings. Mmtlmna is 
the union of the Sakti KundalinI ( the woman inside a man's 
body) in the Muladhara-oakra with the supreme Siva in the 
Sahasraracakra in the highest centre of the brain and is the 
stream of the sweet juice that drops from the Sahasrara. Prepara- 
tion of hemp (called wjaya or 'bhang ' ) is madya for some. The 
Mahanirvana says (VIII. 170 and 173) that «madhura-traya 
may be substituted for wine and for 'Maithuna' meditation on 
the feet of the (image of ) Devi and japa oi the desired mantra 
may be substituted. The Kaulavallnirnaya (III 111) boldly 
states that if a man, after partaking of vijaya (bhang) engages 
in meditation, he sees directly before him the form of the goddess 
as described in the Dhyanamantra. Some Tantras like tw

from which (that has on its pericarp the moon) drops nectar 

which is figuratively spoken of a3 madya (vide notes 1716, 1752 ). 

TheKularnava at first asserts (T. 105-107) 'Mukti does not 

result from the study of the Veda nor hy the study of sastras, it 

results from (correct) knowledge alone, that the asramas are 

not a means of moksa nor are the darsanas the means, nor all 

the sastra3, that it is knowledge alone that is the cause, that it 

is the knowledge imparted hy the teaching of the guru that 

confers mukh, all (other) vidyas are mockery.' Then in the 

Vedantic strain it affirms (1. 111-112) "two words (respectively) 

lead to hondage or liberation viz. ( this is ) ' mine ' or * nothing is 

mine'. A person falls in hondage hy the thought 'this is mine' 

and hecomes liberated hy realising ' nothing is mine * and that 

that is proper action that does not lead to hondage and that is 

real lore that leads to liberation." After these high thoughts the 

same Tantra (H. 22-23 and 29 ) proceeds to Kaula doctrine. * H 

a man is a yogin he does not (ordinarily) enjoy life, while one 

who enjoys life does not know yoga; hut the Kaula doctrine 

combines both yoga and bhoga and is superior to all (other 

doctrines) ; in the Kaula doctrine bhoga turns into yoga directly, 

what is sin (ace. to ordinary people) becomes meritorious, 

samara turns into moksa. Kaula knowledge enlightens him 

whom mind is purified by the mantras of Saiva worship, Durga 
worship &c.

orown of the head is said to drink sudhu (nectar, wine); other 
people drink mere wine When the adept 17S6 in Yoga cutting 
the beast ( ego ) doing good or evil actions with the sword of 
knowledge (of reality) makes his mind merge in the Highest, 
ho is said to be eater of pala (the Highest, flesh). The (Yogin) 
who restraining the several senses by bis mind concentrates 
them on the Self, becomes 'matsyasl', 1 ^ 7 others are only killers 
of living beings. The Sakti (the woman associated with a 
sadhaka) of a beastly man is unenlightened but that of the 
Kaulika is enlightened; he who honours (or resorts to) such a 
Sakti is really a worshipper of Sakti When a man is filled 
through and through with the bliss due to the union of the 
Highest Sakti with the Self (Siva), that is called Maithuna 
(copulation); all other men are merely licentious persons. 

The apologists for unpopular Tantrik practices offer explana. 
tions of the five ' makaras * more or less on the lines of the Kular- 
anava. For example, in his Introduction to the 'Principles of 
Tantra* (part II) Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe) gives 
(pp. OV1I-GVIII) an esoteric explanation of the word 'drinking' 
used in such a verse as that in the Paranandasutra, 'Having 
drunk again and again, having fallen upon the earth, then 
having got up and again drunk ( wine) there is no rebirth' 1KS

Woodroffe's explanation of ' tome ' l68i> 

He explains' Being thus awakened KundalinI enters the great 
road to liberation (mukti), that is, the Sushumna nerve, and 
penetrating the centres one by one, ascends to the Sahasrara 
and there coming in blissful communion with the Lord of Lords, 
again descends down through the same passage to the Mula- 
dhara Ghakra. Nectar is said to flow from such communion. 
The sadhaka drinks it and becomes supremely happy. This is 
the wine called Kulamrta, which a sadhaka of the spiritual 
plane drinks ... In reference to a sadhaka of the spiritual 
(adhyatmika) class the Tantra says 'Pltva pltva... vidyate'. 
During the first Btage of Sat-cakra-sadhana the sadhaka cannot 
suppress his breath for a sufficiently long time at a stretch to 
enable him to practise concentration and meditation in each 
centre of Power. He cannot therefore detain KundalinI within 
the Sushumna longer than his" power of Kumbhaka permits. 
He must consequently come down upon the earth i. e. the 
Muladhara, which is the centre of the element earth, after 
having drank of the heavenly ambrosia. The sadhaka must 
practise this again and again and by constant practice, the 
cause of rebirth i. e. vasana ( desire ) is removed." This explana- 
tion soundsvery profound and highly psychical, but it is not at 
all convincing. Similarly, the present author wonders how many 
writars on Tantras and how many Tantrikas understood the 
theory of sublimation put forward in 'Tantras as a way of 
realization* (Cultural Heritage of India, Vol. IV. pp. 233-235) 
by way of explaining the insistence on five makaras. The first 
question is: why was it necessary to employ vulgar language to 
desoribe a state of profound bliss ? Supposing the explanation 
of madya offered by Woodroffe is accepted, what is the explana- 
tion about offering flesh and fish 1 One cannot easily get out 
ot matsyasl' and 'mamsasr the esoteric sense required by 
the apologist s. The Kularnava, the Par ananda-sutra and several

other works almosb alwaya employ the words raadya, mamaa 
and fish in the ordinary sense. They rarely, if at all, drop the 
hint that wordB like matsya and mSmsa are being used in an 
esoteric sense and proceed to deal with realities of madya and 
flesh. The Kularnava quotes (IT. 126 ) the verse of Manu IX, 93 
(sura vai malam-annanam &c.), provides for the preparation of 
the three kinds of sura ( V. 15-21 ), and says { V. 30 ) that sura is 
the 12th kind among intoxioants and that there are eleven other 
kinds of intoxicants made from jack-fruit, grapes, dates, sugar- 
cane &c (V. 29 ). In XI. 22-35 the Kularnava dilates upon the 
etiquette to be observed in drinking wine as part of Eaula 
practice. It proceeds ( V. 44 ) to divide flesh into three olassas 
viz. of animals that fly in the sky ( birds), of acquatic animals 
and of those that move on the earth. The " M Svacchandatantra 
(a work of great authority in Kashmir Saivism) prescribes that 
various kinds of fish and meat and other food that can be licked 
and drunk should be poured in front of Siva (image) and one 
should not stint for money. Quotations from ParSnanda-sutra 
(notes 1698, 1703-4) make it perfectly clear that the words madya, 
marfiBa, and maithuna are employed therein in the ordinary 
sense. Paranandasufcra (on pp. 80-81, paragraphs 69-70 and 
pp 82-83 para. 76-80) describes such obscene details of the 
sadhaka's sexual intercourse that it is not possible to set them 
down here. The ordinary worship of Devi was elaborate enough, 
containing as it did 16 upacaras ( vide p. 164 note 420 above). 
Where was the necessity of bringing in wine, meat and 
maithuna as an absolutely necessary part of the worship of Pert ? 
The Kularnava and other tantras praise the Vedas, employ 
vedic mantras and quote 176 " Upamsad and GIta passages For 
example, Mahanirvana V. 197 ff employs Vedic mantras ( as noted 
on p. 1058) for sanctifying the five makaras, the three mantras

BpWaU this lip service to the Veda the tantras ignore the 
Sat moral dangers involved in their persistent teaching of five 
makaras and also pay no heed to the impressive advice of the 
Git5( HI 21) that whatever a great or honoured man does or 
holds as authoritative is followed by all common people. There 
are several late medieval works about the Kaula cult that speak 
of drinking wine, eating flesh and maithuna in the vulgar sense 
a9 means of Devi worship and yet assert that by doing so mukh 
(liberation) would be secured. Two verses from a ms ot 
a tantrik work called Kaularahasya (containing one hundred 
verses) will bring home to fee reader how common people 
understood the cult of the makaras.™ 1 

Prof Heinrich Zimmer in the ' Art of Indian Asia* (vol I 
pp. 129-130) observes 'such living forms are suggested to the 
Indian artist by a dynamic philosophy that is intrinsic to his 
religious and philosophical tradition, for the worship of the life- 
force pouring into the universe and maintaining it, mani- 
feBting itself no less in the gross matter of daily experience 
than in the divine beings of religious vision constitutes 
the very foundation of Indian religious life. According to 
this doctrine which was particularly influential in the great 
periods of Indian art, release from the bondage of our normal 
human imperfection can be gained not only through the world- 
negating methods of asceticism (yoga) but equally through 
a perfect realization of love and its sexual enjoyment (bhoga). 
According to this view which has been eloquently expressed in 
the so-called Tantric symbols and rituals of both the Hindu and 
Buddhist traditions, there is intrinsically no antagonism between 
yoga and hhoga. The role played by the guru, the spiritual 
guide and teacher in the stern masculine disciplines of yoga, is

taken over in the initiations of bhoga by the devout and sensual 
helpmate. The initiating woman plays the part of Sakti while 
the male initiate assumes that of Siva and both attain together 
to the realisation of the immanence within themselves of the 
oonsubsiantiality of the Goddess and the God.' It has already been 
stated (p. 1054 ) that Prof. Zimmer is wrong in thinking that 
the Tantrik rites were systematically disparaged as ' vamamarga ' 
by the Indian partisans of Yoga. He is also wrong (p. 130) 
when he says that ' throughout the first millenium A. D. they 
(Tantric rites) were a basic element of normal Indian expsri- 
ence.' There is really very little evidence to substantiate this 
claim. He makes thiB sweeping generalisation as an art critic 
and historian of Indian Art from the few tantric sculptures on 
the Purl and other temples in Orissa and some other plaoes in 
India. Vide the well-known work 'Bengal Lancer' by F. 
Yeats-Brown (London, Golancz, 1930) pp 330-237, where the 
superintendent of the temple of Jagannatha justifies the obsoens 
frescoes on the ground that until a man is master of his gross 
body he oannot see the Godhead and feels sure that future ages 
will look on Tantrik psychology with understanding. 

One or two very peculiar notions and practices of the 
Tantrikas may be briefly mentioned here. The offering of flesh, 
wine and mudra to the devatS with the recital of three 
bijas 'an, hrlm, krom' and the mantras 'om Ananda- 
bhairavSya namah' and 'om Anandabhairavyai namah

was like swallowing poison, that the person doing bo would 
suffer from diseases for a long time, would soon die prematurely 
and that wine was to be drunk even by one who has attained 
some perfection only up till the mind has reached an ecstatic 
state of absorption ( in thoughts of Devi ) and that if he drinks 
beyond that stage he at once becomes a sinner (vide also 
Kularnava VH. 97-98 for the last proposition ). 

A most revolting rite from the view-point of all unsophisti- 
cated people is what is called ' cakra-puja' ( worship in a circle ). 
An equal number of men and women without distinction of caate 
and even near blood relations secretly meet at night and sit in a 
circle (vide Kaulavallnirnaya "VTH. 76 ). The Goddess is repre- 
sented by a yantra ( diagram ). There is a leader of the cakra. 
The regulations were that only persons who had attained the 
status of Vh a ( defined above in n 1763 ) were to be admitted 1764 
and pasus (ordinary men with beastly passions not curbed) were 
to be excluded. What assurance was there that the leader of the 
cakra himself possessed the noble qualities mentioned in the 
verse quoted above and would choose only men possessed of 
similar qualities ? The women assembled cast their bodices in 
a receptacle and each of the assembled men secured a female 
companion for that night by lot i. e. by taking a bodice 
out of those contained in the receptacle. The practice of

Srioakra must hare given rise to great obloquy and unpopu- 
larity for the Tantrikas. Therefore, tbe Kularnava 1765 advises 
that oakrapuja should be sub i osa. ' What happens at Srioakra, 
whether good or bad, should never be uttered (in publio); 
this is the order (of God); one should never give out infor- 
mation about what happens at Cakrapuja, '. The 18th century 
Mahanirvanatantra, which is reformist in character, Bfcatos that, 
since in the Kali age (in which people are weak and the 
influence of sinful age is very Btrong ), for tbe last tattra ( i. e. 
maithuna) one's own wife is alone to be the Sakti beoause in 
that case no fault oan be found or some substitute like red 
sandalwood paste may be employed. In the author's youth 
whispers floated about that in some towns in MaharSstra oakra- 
puja was praotised, that even great Pandits thought that their 
learning was due to the favour of Devi, that they, though very 
orthodox in other respects, took once a year in Devlpujaa 
thimbleful of wine as prasada. The learned AohyutarSya 1 '" 
Modak of Nasik composed at Nasifc a work called ' Avaidika- 
dhikkrti* (condemnation of non-vaidika practices) wherein ho 
severely handled the cult of the five makaras. 

Naturally common people, who could not appreciate or 
understand the abstruse and subtle philosophy of Sakti, Nada, 
Binduand so forth, seized with avidity upon the apparently 
easy path of worship of Sakti by the five makaras and tho 
mantras, bljas, cakras and the like taught by the Tantros and 
it has been seen above ( pp. 1.073-76 ) to what depthB some 
persons professing to be gurus, Saktas and TantrikaB descended 
in course of time. 

The path of the Tantras was in its higher lovel one of 
Upasana or Bliaktt, though it very often degenerated into magio 
and moral depravity. The deity worshipped viz. Paramesvarl

Three aspects of Devi 1^91 

presented three aspects to ths upasafca 1767 (devotee) viz. gross 
(sthula), subtle (suksma) and para (highest). The first aspect 
is represented by the form, of Devi with hands, feet and other 
limbs, which is fit for worship with the hands and the eyes of 
the devotee; the second aspect consists of mantras, which are 
fit for apprehension with the organs of hearing and speech 
by those who have the good fortune to receive the mantras 
from a worthy guru. The third aspect ( para ) is one 
to be apprehended by the mind of the sadhaka and described as 
all-pervading consciousness and the like (in NityasodasikS 
VL 49-50 ). 

Some modern writers have been somewhat unjust to the whole 
Tantrik literature in labelling it all as black magic or as full 
of obscenities The present writer is not one of those who some* 
times hold that what is not understood is either false, absurd or 
non-existent. He is prepared to believe that the end and aim of 
a few of the higher minds among Tantrikas and of some of the 
works on Tantra was the attainment of high spiritual powers 
by Yoga practices, the Realization of the Supreme Tattva 
(Principle) variously designated as Brahma, Visnu, Siva or 
Devi, and Liberation (moksa ). He is aware that many of these 
claim to be based on Vedic traditions, teachings and practices 
and to have further developed the conceptions underlying Yedio 
teachings and ritual and that even the magic rites contained in 
several Tantrik works had their counterparts, though on a much 
smaller scale, in the Rgveda, the Atharvaveda, SamavidhSna 
Brahmana and other Vedic works. The present author, though 
he has carefully studied many of the Tantras and the Yogasutra 
Sf^f^ th9Wl5sya and ^mentaries thereon, has to 
2 f ?f kd no mystio e xP<*ience,but he is not pre-

and unknown as propounded in Alexia Carroll's work * Man the 
unknown* and in 'Invisible influence' by Dr. Alexander 
Cannon ( 15th impression, Eider and Co., London, 1935 ). He 
knows that some of the Tantrik works made a distinction 
between the rules of ordinary sooial life and conventions 
( samaja-dharma ) and the peculiar forms of Tantrik worship, in 
which, while it lasts, no distinction is made on the ground of caste 
or sex (vide notes 1711 and 1713). It may further be conceded 
that the Tanfcra works placed women on a footing of equality 
with men, gave them an exalted position and that they endea- 
voured to provide a common platform (as shown in w. 1704 above) 
for differing and wrangling sects of Vaisnavas, Saivas and 
others by putting forward Devi as the object of worship for all; 
but they had not much success as is shown by the facts that 
Vaisnavas and Saivas still carried on their quarrels and that the 
Tantrik texts themselves fell into five classes, viz, Saiva, Sakta, 
Vaisnava, Saura and Ganapatya and that there are differing 
doctrines among the Tanfcrikas called Kadimafca, Hsdimata &c 

The matters that distinguish Tantrik works from other 
religious literature in Sanskrit are the 176s promise of the attain- 
ment of miraculous powers, the Eealization of the one Supreme 
Principle in a short time by meanB of the Tantrik sadhanU 
'method or procedure' (vide Intro, to 'Principles of Tanfcra' 
'p. XTv"), by their insistence on the worship of Devi with 
makaras alone as yielding the desired results (as in Maha-

The condemnation poured on Tantricism is principally due to 
their insistence on wine, meat and sexual unions as the best and 
the only means for the effective -worship of Devi, their theory 
that by merely repeating some mantra or mantras over wine, 
meat and other tattvas, by offering them to Devi and by medita- 
tion on her, one may drink wine or eat meat, when in the same 
breath they say emphatically that partaking of wine and meat is 
sinful without this ritual. This antagonizes those who are not 
kaulas and who hold that this persistent teaching is very 
dangerous for the common run of men and savours of hypocrisy. 

Some of the Tantras practically inculcated what appears to 
non-tantrikas unbridled licence. The Kaulavall-nirnaya (IV. 
15 ff) asserts: 'TheSaktas ha\e no higher means of happi- 
ness and liberation than the fifth tattva (i. e. maithuna); a 
ssdhaka becomes siddha only by the (practice) of the fifth 
tattva. If he resorts only to the first (i. e. wine ) he becomes 
only Bhairava, if only to the 2nd (meat) he becomeB Brahma, 
by the third (fish) he becomes a mahabhairava, by the 4th 
(mudra)he becomes foremost among sadhakaB. 1769 The same 
Tantra goes further and frankly says ' all women are fit for 
intercourse to a (Sakta) worshipper except the wives of his 
guru or of those Saktas who have attained to the status of Vira 
that for those who have reached the stage of adnata there is no 
prohibition nor is anything enjoined. To the pure everything 
is pure it is only the hankering that is blamable.' In this con- 
nection that work advances certain puerile and obscene argu- 
ments (m VIII. 223-225) about illicit or incestuous intercourse 
that cannot be set out here. That tantra does not stand alone 
m such statements. For example, the Kallvilasatantra (X 
<50-31) allows adulterous intercourse to a ■ Sakta ' devotee pro-

Tided it is not carried to the last stage of emission and avers 
that, if he observes the condition in the proviso, he would 
become the master of supernatural powers in spite of adultery. 
It should be noted that the author of this work has unabashed 
hardihood to make Siva tell this to Parvatl. About wine that 
work remarks ' jtist as drinking of soma ,770 is prescribed for 
brahmanas is solemn Vedic sacrifices, similarly Wine should be 
drunk at proper times (or according to the practice of Kaulas), 
since it confers enjoyment as well as moksa ; drinking wine is 
blamable in the case of those who hanker after benefits or who 
are egoistic; but in the case of those that are free from egoism 
there is neither prohibition (of drinking) nor the enjoining of 
it. One who is free from the fetters of making distinctions 
Bhould practise drinking wine for the purpose of remembering 
the meaning of the mantras and for making his mind fixed (on 
worship ) but he who resorts to wine, and other tattvas merely 
for pleasure is sinful.' The teachings of works like the KaulS- 
vall-nirnaya about drinking wine and sexual intercourse with 
all sorts of women as the highest means of Sfakti worship by 
persons professing to bBadvaitmsled to great depravity and sexual 
immorality and orgies as indicated by the criticism in medi- 
eval works oited above (pp. 1073-76) that regarded Tantrte teach- 
ings as execrable, though some medieval Hindu works admitted 
into religious praotices nyasa, mudra, yantra and the like, which 
were deemed to be innocuous and which would be dssoribed in 
this work later on. The mere intention of doing good if certain 
conditions were fulfilled is not enough excuse, when it is most 
likely that the means proposed for attaining a high spiritual 
level and for liberation would have the opposite effect on most 
people. Taking all things into consideration, the present 
author is constrained to observe that medieval and recent 
writers who severely criticized Tantrik works were on the whole 
laTgely justified in their condemnation of Tantrik practices as 
enunciated in many Tantrik works and of the works themselves. 
For one man that attained super-normal powers, high spiritual 
level and great mystic experience there must have been tanto« 
of hypocrites, charlatans, and licentious men who deluded trustful 
and ignorant men and particularly women. ^___

Puranas and T&ntrika practices 1095 

Only a few Puranas like the Davlpurana, the KslikS, the 

Devtaahatmya in the Markandeya provide for the employment 

of some of the condemned makaras (madya, mamsa, matsya) in 

the worship of the Great Goddess. From about the 6th or 7th 

century A D. Furanas began to incorporate the special ceremonial 

characteristics of the Sakfcas and Tanteikas. Apararka quotes 

a passage 1771 from the Devlpurana wherein the qualifications of 

a St kapatcai one who performs Devapratistha) are set ont, viz. 

he would be the best Sthapaka for establishing images of Devi 

and the Mates, who knows the vama (left or opposite) and the 

daks.m (right) path of worship, who has thoroughly mastered 

the veda relating to the Mates (the Mother Goddesses), who is 

clever in the interpretation of ParicaTatra works and is proficient 

in the Tantras of the Mates &o. The Kalika-purana devotes 

many chapters (54 ff) to the description of mantras, kavacas, 

mudrSs, nyasas &c The Bhagavatapurana also and Agni vni 

372 34 expressly say that the worship of gods and of Visnu also 

is either laidikt, tantnki or mtsra, the first and third being for 

the three higher varnas and the tanfaikl for sudras. The 

Bhagavatapurana refers to the worship of Kesava laid down in 

the Tantras for him who desires to cast out the knot ( bondage 

or grief) of the heart. It (Bhagavata) also mentions 1773 Vaidikl 

and Tanteiki dlksa (in XL 11. 37) and refers to the Tantrik 

method of the angas, upangas, ayudhas and decorations in the 

worship of the Lord of Laksml. 1 ™ Some of the Puranas and 

medieval nibandhas, however, fully utilized what Tantras had

Classification of Vedic mantoas 1097 

of four classes viz, rk ( which is metrical), yajus ( which has no 
restriction as to metre but which must he a sentence ), a sSman 
(which is sung) and mgada (ie. piaisa, meaning words that 
are addressed by one person to another calling upon the latter to 
do a certain act, e. g. the words ' srucah sammrddhi, proksanlr- 
asadaya'. Nigadas aie yajus in form but are distinguished 
from yajus by the fact that the former are loudly uttered, while 
a yajus is ordinarily recited in a low voice. 1778 The most sacred 
mantra is the Gayatri ( Sg. HE. 62. 10 'tat-savitur' &c). The 
Atharvaveda ( XIX. 71. 1 ) calls it Vedamata ( the mother of 
the Veda ). The Brahadaranyakopanisad ( V. 14 ) contains a 
grand eulogy of the Gayatri. 1779 Om. is a very sacred syllable, a 
symbol of h ah ma and may be called in the language of the 
Tantras a bija. There aT6 only a few syllables such as om, phat, 
vasat in the Vedic literature that on the face of them have 
no meaning but are like bija mantras in the Tantra sense. 
There is a Byamghanlu ( a dictionary of blja mantras) printed 
in 'Tantrik texts' Vol. I. pp. 38-29 (where monosyllabic bljas 
rach as Hrlm, grim, Krlm, Hum, phat, are set out and described 
in symbolic words indicated in note 1708 above. It is stated 
about a dozen times in the Aitareya Brahmana viz. it is the 
perfection of sacrifice when it is rupasamrddha ( perfect as to its 
form)i. e. when the rk verse pointedly refers to the sacrificial 
act that is being performed." 6 * The Nirukta (I. 15-16) starts 
a lengthy discussion on Kautsa's view that mantras have no 
sense (or are purposeless) There is a long discussion in the 
Purvamtoamsasutra (1.2. 31 ff) on the rame lines as in the 
JNirukta. Jaimini states that there is no difference in the 
meanings of words employed in the Veda and those employed 
by people and Sahara adds in bis bhasya (on P. M.S. I. 2 32)

define what a vodio mantra is and it is generally understood, as 
said by Sahara, that passages or verses are mantras that are 
reoognised as such by the learned "« The whole Veda is divided 
into five categories viz. Vidhi (hortatory passages as in 'Agni. 
hotram juhuyaV), mantias, namadlieya (names suoh as Udbhid 
in 'Udbhida yajeta* or 'Visvarft' as in 'Visvajita yajeta'), 
ntsedlta (prohibition as in 'nanrtam vadet') and atthavada 
(explanatory or laudatory passages as in ' Vayu is a deity that 
is swiftest'). The Nirukta (L 30 ) embodies the ancient view 
that the sages had an intuitive perception of Dharina and they 
transmitted the mantras by oral instruction to those that oame 
after them and that had no intuitive perception of Dharma. 
The mantras and stofras were supposed even in the Bg. to induce 
the gods to come to the sacrifices and to bestow on those who 
recited them protection, valiant sons, cattle, wealth, victory and 
all sorts of things (e.g. vide Jig. 1.102. 1-5,11. 24.15-16,11. 
25. 2, III 31. 14, IX. 20. 7, IX. 72. 9, X. 78. 8, X. 105. 1 ). It has 
been shown above p. 920 ( in notes 4167-4168 ) how the Puranas 
prescribed their own mantras for many religious acts but those 
mantras also are significant and not meaningless. 

Mantras are the very heart and core of Tantrasasfcra so 
much so that the sastra is often spoken of as mantiasastra. 
The theory of Tantrik writings such as the Prapancasara and 
Saradatilaka about mantras may be briefly stated as follows : 
In the human body there are ten nadls, the three principal being 
Ids (on the left side from the left testicle to the left nostril), 
SusumnS (in the middle of the body in the spinal chord) and 
Fingala( on the right side from the right testicle to the right 
nostril ). The EundalinI lies asleep colled like a snake in the 
Muladhara-cakra. It is a form of the iabda-brahma. The Devi 
(or Sakti) assumes the form of EundalinI, all gods reside in 
Devi and all mantras are Her forms ( SSradatilaka I, 55-57 ). It 
has already been stated how from contact with light (Jyotih) 
Sakti becomes conscious and has a desire to create, then it 
solidifies and appears as a bvndu. Through the inst rumentalit y

Tantrik theory about mantras 1099 

of Kala (Time) bindu divides itself into three, gross (i. e. blja), 
subtle ( suksma i. e. nada which is bljabindu) and para (i.e. 
bindu which is karyabindu). This last is of the nature of an 
unmanif est sound and is called sabdabrahma 1763 " by the sages 
(Saradatilaka I. 11-12, Prapaficasara I. 41 ff). Sabdabrahma 
exists in all things as consciousness; it exists in the bodies of 
living human beings in the form of Kundalini and then appeals 
as letters in prose, poetry and so forth, being carried by Vayu 
(air ) to the throat, palate, teeth &c. The sounds thus produced 
are called aksaras and when written they are spoken of 
as varnas (letters of the alphabet, matrka, which are 50 
from o to ksa ). The impulse to sound production arising 
in mfiladhara-cakra is called 'para' (yak),* it is called 
pasyantl when it reaches ' avadhisthSna-cakra, madhyama 
in the heart and vaikhari in the mouth. Both aksara and 
yarna are Kundalini made articulate in speech and visible 
in writing. All the viantras (some say they are nine crores ) 
are evolved from the varnas of the alphabet that are deemed (by 
Tantrikas) to be living conscious sound powers. It is the bija 
mantras like hrlm, srim, krlm that make visible the form of the 
Devata (Mahanirvana V. 18-19 ).»» it j g v^g to suppose 
that mantras are mere letters or words or language. They 
assume different forms, Buch as blja-mantraB, kavaca, hrdaya &c. 
The bljamantras like Hrlm (representing Tribhuvanesvarl or 
Maya ), Srim ( representing LaksmI ), KMm ( representing Kali ) 
cannot possibly be called language, since they convey no mean- 
ing to ordinary men. They are the Devata (IstadevatS of the

stidhatca, the Worshipper) imparted to the sadhaka by the 
qualified guru at the time of diksa ( initiation ). They are not 
efficacious if moroly learnt by reading books. A mantra accord- 
ing to Tantrik works is the sound body of Sakti charged with 
the vibrations of the spiritual personality of the original 
Tantrika seer of the manlta and endowed with a perpetual 
store of power by the Tantrik seer. What is needed to awaken 
Power in the disciple and to reap the full effect of the mantra is 
the touch of the quru, the imagination and concentrated will 
power of the sadhaka. The deity willed that certain letters 
uttered by the seer should as sound or sounds convey such and 
such a meaning and should have a certain potency. The sounds 
represented by the letters are forms of Sivasakti i. e ^abdabralima. 
From this last the whole world proceeds in the form of sounds 
( sabda ) and the objects (artka ) which sounds or words denote. 
The DevatS, the mantra and the guru are the essentials of 
sutlhana (procedure that leads on toSiddhi, laid down in Tsntrik 
works ) j the disciple has to revolve in his mind that the three are 
non-different. Mantra is not the same thing as a prayer. For 
a prayer a person may employ any words that he may choose, 
but in the case of a mantra definite letters are considered 
necessary, which are deemed to be the forms in which Sakti 
manifests Herself to the worshipper. A mantra may be in the 
form of words that have an obvious meaning or in the form of 
letters arranged in a particular order and that have no meaning 
to the uninitiated. It is recognised in some of the works on 
this sSstra that thought has creative power, that each person is 
Siva, and can attain to higher and higher spiritual levels 
depending upon his ability to realise himself as Siva Thoughts 
are real, kind thoughts will do good to ourselves and to those 
around us, evil thoughts and wishes of others may cause us 
suffering. 

Tantrik works have their own mantras and they also 
employ Vedic mantras. For example, the mantra ' Jatavedase 
sunavama* { #g. I. 99 1), though addressed to Agni, is employed 
in later works for invoking Durga, the mantra 'Tryambakam 
yajamahe' (Pg VII. 59. IS) is addressed *° E « dra .>* J * ™;f°

devotes the whole chapter 30 to the explanation of om, the vyahflts 
and the words of the Gayatrl and Gayatrl-sadhana). The 
Mahanirvana prescribes the performance of VaidikI sandhya to 
be followed by the Tantriki sandhya. The Tantriki Gayatrl is 
' Adyayal vidmahe ParamesvaTyai dhimahi t tan-nah Kali praco- 
dayat n ' ( Mahanirvana V. 62-63 ) Even Sudra Tantrikas wef e 
to recite this last, while the three higher classes were to repeat 
the vedic Gayatrl employing om, si im and aim before it respec- 
tively. The importance of guru, mantra and devata is emphati- 
cally brought out in the following verse 'thepeison, who considers 
guru as a mere mortal, a mantra as mere letters and images ( of 
deities ) as mere stones falls into Hell ' 178i The Rudrayamala 
says ' If Siva is angered, Guru can save ( the pupif ), but if Guru 
is angered, no one can save (the pupil )'. 

The Parasuramakalpasutra, JSanarnavatantra, the Sarada- 
tilaka and almost all Tantrika works say that mantras possess 
wonderful and inconceivable powers, 1785 that a follower of 
Tantra secures all powers by following the practices of the 
school of his guru traditionally handed down and by faith, that 
mantras aTe the means of securing the fruits desired, that the 
authoritativeness of Tantrasastra depends mainly on the faith 
of the followers of the sastra, that the sadhaka should come to 
feel that guru, mantra, the deity, his own soul, mind and life- 
breaths are all one and then he will possess the knowledge of the 
Highest Self. Some ot the Tantrik works contain most exag- 
gerated praises of mantras, particularly the srlvidyamantra of 
sixteen letters; e. g. Jfianarnava says 'Even encores of Vajapeyas 
and thousands of Asvamedhas are not equal ( in merit) to even 
the utterance of Silvidya and so also gifts of crores of Kapila 
cows cannot be compared to one utterance of &rividya (24th

lokyavijayavidya and Sangramavijayavidya respectively. 

Numberless mantras are contained in the Tantras made 
from different arrangements of the constituent parts of a 
mantra. The Mahanirvana first gives a mantra of ten syllables 
as noted below and then by different arrangements of the letters 
and by addition of certain other syllables and words like 
'Kalike' it forms twelve mantras, remarks that there are Mores 
of mantras and that the mantras contained in all Tantras are 
all mantras of the Great" 86 Devi. 

The word manlra is explained as derived from 'man' to 
think and 'trai' or 'tra\ YSska'a Nirukta (VII. 13) derives it simply 
from ' man ' The Knlarnava says * mantra ' is so called since it 
saves from all dangers, as the sadhaha thereby is led to ponder 
over God of immeasurable refulgence that is the only principle 
( in the world )' A similar derivation is given by Bamapurva- 
tapanlya Upanisad, by the PrapaScasara and other Tantras. 1787 
Numerous varieties of mantras called Kavaoa, Hrdaya, Upahr- 
daya, Netra, Astra, RaksS and so forth aTe specified in the 
Tantrik texts, one or two of which may be illustrated in the note 
below and the Test are passed over for reasons of space. 1788

Classification of mantias into male &c. 1103 

The Saradatilaka divides mantras into male, female and 
neuter; masculine mantras end in 'hum' and 'phat\ female 
mantras in 'svaha' and neuter mantias end with 'namah . 
This is stretched further so as to apply to letters viz. the vowels 
r r, 1 1 are said to be neither and the rest are said to be not 
neuter but only short and long (Saradatilaka, VI. 3 and 
Raghavabhatta thereon). Saradatilaka (from chap. VH to 
XXHI) is devoted to mantras of SaTasvatI, Laksmi, Bhuva- 
nesvari, Tvarita and others, Durga™ Tripura, Ganapati, Oandra- 
mas. Many of the mantras are to be repeated thousands of 
times ot lakhs of times in order to secure full effect. For example, 
in X 105-107 the Saradatilaka prescribes that a certain mantra 
should be repeated five lakhs of times and then fifty thousand 
ahutis of ghee should be made and worship of the Devi with the 
procedure prescribed should be performed. The worshipper then 
secures whatever he may desire and can make kings sub-servient 
to his will Another noticeable feature is that the mantras are 
treated like the mantras of the Veda and mention is made in the 
manner of the Anukramanfe of the sage, the metre, the deity 
and the viniyoga ( or purpose for which it is to be used or 
employed). Though the Saradatilaka is a sober work free 
from the sexual practices of Vamamarga, still it does contain 
mantras for magical purposes such as bringing women under 
control (IX. 103-104, X. ?6), 1750 bringing about the paralysing or 
the death of an enemy by mantras ( XT. 60-124, XXI. 95 
XXII. Iff). 

The Buddhist Tantras did not lag behind the Hindu Tantras 
in the matter of the potency of mantras. The Sadhanamala 1751

asserts that there is nothing that cannot be accomplished by 
mantras if proper procedure is followod. For example, it says 
that a certain mantra that is a prince among mantras confers 
Buddhahood, what need is there to say about othere siddhis, that 
by another mantra even Buddhahood which is extremely difficult 
to attain is like a jujube fruit placed on the palm of the hand 
and that a certain mantra (of unmeaning words ) if repeated five 
times at three periods in the day viz. the morning, noon and 
evening, makes even a fool (lit. an ass) master of three hundred 
works. The Buddhist Tantras also prescribe repetition of 
mantras for a lakh 1792 of times (vide Sadhanaraala, vol I, No 165

any mantra may be made to yield similar senses.

p. 336 and No. 108. p. 221). Some of the mantras embody the 
doctrines of Mahayana with the addition of syllables like om, 
phat, svaha ( such as 'om sunyata-jnanavajrasvabh&va- 
tmakoham ' in Sadhanamala vol I. p. 62 ). The Prapaficasara, 
■which is ascribed to the great advaita teacher Sankaracarya and 
on which Padmapada is said to have written a commentary 
(both published by A. Avalon in Tantrik Texts, vol. X VIII-XIX, 
1935), contains a mantra called Trailokya-mohana for the 
purpose 1793 of the six cruel magic rites and (in 34. 33) describes 
a yantra ( diagram ) by worship of which a sadhaka oan make 
a woman smitten with passion for him and draw heT to him. 
This, among other matters such as ungrammatical forms, raises 
grave doubts as to whether the work was really composed by the 
first Sankaracarya. It may, however, be stated that the learned 
Eaghavabhatta in many places in his commentary on the 
Saradatilaka (such a3 I. 7, 8, 12) quotes the Prapaficasara 
( I 42, 44 ) as the great acarya's work and several later writers 
do the same. It has to be borne in mind, however, that about 
400 works are ascribed to the great advaita Acarya and that 
Eaghavabhatta was separated by at least seven centuries from 
the great Acarya and his ascription therefore cannot be accepted 
with implicit faith without more evidence. 

Several Puranas are affected by the theory about the power 
of mantras of the Tantrika type The Garuda-purana ( I. chap. 
f and 10 J employs many monosyllabic unmeaning mantras like 
hram, ksaum, hrlm, hum, huh, srim,-hrlm and says ( I. 23 ) that 
om Knakholkaya Suryamurtaye namah' is the mulamantra 
or the Sun and this mantra is employed for sun-worship in an 
early digest like the Krtyakalpataru on vrata (p 9 note). The

purana also contains many mantras of the Tantrik type. Chap. 
121 verses 15-17 provide 1795 for a mantra whereby enemeis ara 
brought under control (as noted below) and verses 17-19 speak 
of a mantra for paralysing (stambltana) of an enemy. Chap. 
133-135 of the Agni contain several mantras of the Tantrik 
type. Chapter 307 contains several mantras of bringing under 
control the three worlds. 

A mantra called Mahasveta is spoken of in the Bhavisya- 
purana which is mentioned in the Krtyakalpataru on vrata (p. 9) 
and in Ekadasltattva p. 40 and it is ' hram hrlra sah. ' and the 
japa of that mantra on Sunday with fast is said to yield what 
one desires. 17S6 

The later medieval digests on Dharmasastra adopt the 
PranapratislhS-mantra evolved by the Saradatilaka (XXIII. 71- 
76). The Devapratistha tattva 1757 (pp. 506-507) quotes these 
verses from Saradatilaka, Bets out the mantra and explains the 
verses at length. The Divyatattva also ( pp. 609-610 ) does the 
same The Vyavaharamayukha (p. 86) sets out the same 
mantra for the consecration of the image of Dharma in the 
ordeal of Dharma without expressly naming the Saradatilaka. 
The Nirnayasindhu (pp. 349-350 ) has an elaborate rite of the 
Pranapratistha. of images full of Tantrik elements like the words 
vasat, hrlm, and phat and employs the same procedure as the 
one prescribed by the Saradatilaka without expressly mentioning 
the latter. The Saradatilaka appears to follow earlier works 
like the Jayakhyasamhita (Fatala XX) and Prapafioasara- 
tantra ( 35. 1-9 ff ).

Uontrast between Vedic and Tantrik mantras 1107 

Eeasons of apace preclude further illustrations of the use of 
Tantrik mantras by medieval digests on Dharmasastra. One 
matter of contrast between Vedic mantras and sonie Tantrik 
mantras may be noticed. A Vedie mantra, according to 
Jaimini (I 2. 33 ), was significant, but tbe Tantras go so far as 
to teach the repetition of mantras that have no meaning or that 
contain the letters of the mantra in reversed form. For example, 
the Kalivilasatantra ( XXII. 31 ) says that the reverse of the 
three letters of the mantra 'om Purge', a3 'rgedu om' yields all 
desires ('rgedu om tryaksaram mantram sarvakamaphala- 
pradatn)*. The Sad-dharmapundarlka 1798 (a standard Work of 
MahSyana Buddhism) chap. 21 (text edited by Kern and 
Bunyiu Nantfu, 1912 and translated in S. B. ~& vol. XXI. 
pp 370-375) contains spells ( called Dharanipadani). It should 
not be supposed that spells were peculiar to Hindus or Buddhists. 
Many ancient peoples believed that words and letters have magic 
power and that belief led on to another belief that it did not 
matter even if the letters and words had no sense. E. J. Thomas 
in 'History of Buddhist thought* ( reprint of 1953 ) states that 
spells similar to Hindu and Buddhist types exist in old English, 
Old High German and Keltic ( p. 186 ). 

The repetition of mantras, Vedic as well as Tantrik, is 
called 'Purascarana'»» (which literally means 'performing or 
carrying out before ' ). The Mahanirvana ( VII. 76-85 ) sets out 
various modes of purascarana ( brief as well as elaborate ). One 
way is to bring together five tallms on the 14th tithi of a dark 
fortnight or on a Tuesday or Saturday, then the Devi is to be wor- 
shipped and the worshipper is to repeat ten thousand times with 
Bingle-mmdedness the mantra in mahamsa (midnight), then 
ne is to feed persons devoted to brahman and becomes one who 
Has carried out purascarana. Another way is that he should 
repeat every day one thousand times the mantra beginning on 
a Tuesday up to (including) the next Tuesday, so that by 
repeati ng the mantra in a ll eight thousand times on eight days,

he will be deemed to liave performed purascarana. Sometimes, 
it is prescribed 1800 that a mantra such as 'Sivaya narnah' (this 
is five-lettered mantra ) or 'Om Sivaya namah' (asadaksara 
mantra ) should be repeated 34 lakhs of times and the sadhaka 
should offer into Agni twenty-four thousand ahittis of pat/asa. 
Then the mantra becomes perfect and confers on the sadhaka 
whatever he desires. The Kularnava states that Purascarana 
is so called because by the five-fold upasana the deity desired 
(as if) moves MM before the worshipper for conferring on him 
her favour. A mantra like the Gayatrl is 1802 to be repeated 
every day 1008 or 108 or 10 times. This requirement is in 
keeping with what the Puranas and Dharmasaatra works say. 
For example, the Naiadapurana (II. 57 54) provides that a 
mantra is to be repeated 8,38, or 108 times. The Bkadasltafctva ,SB 
quotes Devlpuraria for the proposition that the offerings in the 
noma to planets should be 108, 28 or 8 according to one's ability. 

Raghavabhatta in his commentary on Saradatilaka (16 56 ) 
has a very exhaustive and learned note on the details of 
purascarana that are common to all mantras. According to the 
VayavIya-samhita 18B the perfecting of the procedure of the 
mulamantra is called purascarana, since it has to be practised 
before the acts in which it is to be employed The Kularnava 18 " 
provides that there are at least five constituent elements of 
purascarana viz. pujs (worship of the desired deity) three times 
a day, japa (muttering of the mantra), ta-pan a, noma, and

dinner to brahmanas , that if any one of these cannot be carried 

out, then he should perform japa of the mantra twice as many 

times more as the number prescribed for that constituent, that, 

in the absence of some constituents, by providing a good dinner 

to brahmanas everything becomes successful and that if one 

mantra is perfected by performing the five constituents 

mentioned above, then he secures siddhi of all mantras. 

Raghavabhatta suggests another way of purascarana viz. one 

should be pure, lSS observe a fast and then in an eclipse of the 

sun or moon should stand m the navel deep water of a river 

directly falling into the sea, should recite a mantra with 

concentration of mind from the time the eclipse begins till its 

end, thereafter perform homa and the rest in order reducing each 

to 1/10 of the number of japa recitation, then secure the guru's 

contentment ( by gifts ) and that by this method mantra becomes 

perfect and the deity becomes favourable The Kaulavallnirnaya 

describes ( 14th patala, verses 75-260 ) a terrible sadhana whereby 

in a single night a sadhaka secures mantra-siddhi viz. by going 

to a cemetery ot other lonely spot after one watch of the night, 

securing the corpse of a candala, or of one who is killed by some 

one with a sword or one bitten by a snake or a young handsome 

warrior dying in a battle (not killed by himself ), he should 

wash the corpse, offer worship to it and to Durga and repeat the 

mantra ('om Durge Durge raksanl svaha'). If he is not 

frightened by the terrific sights that he may see and after 

following a very long procedure he secures manti asiddht. The 

Tarabhaktisudharnava {taranga IX pp 345 ff) describes the 

savasadhana-vidhi' and so does the KulacudSmani-tantra

worshipped, he would secure perfection of mantra even without 
purascarana, that purascarana is the main seed ( cause ) of ( the 
perfection of) mantras, that where the number of times a mantra 
is to be recited is not expressly stated, it should be repeated 8000 
times. Raghavabhatta quotes a verse saying that just as a man 
in the grip of diseases is incapable of performing all actions 
a mantra devoid of purascarana is declared to be in a Bimilar 
condition 

The Agnipurana, Zularnava and Saradatilaka lay down 
rules about the places where purascarana of a mantra is to be 
practised. The followirjg places are commended 1857 for those 
who are engaged in perfecting a mantra, viz holy places, river 
bank, caves, mountain top, ground near a ththa, confluence of 
rivers, holy forests and parks, the root of a bilva tree, mountain 
slopes, temple, seashore, one's own house or any place where the 
mind ( of the sadhaka ) feels happy. Rules were also laid down 
as to the food on which the sadhaka was to subsist during the 
days of purascarana viz, food 1608 obtained by begging for alms 
(for biahmacartn and yah ), havisya food ( prescribed for vratas ), 
allowed vegetables, fruits, milk, bulbous roots, barley meal The 
Mantramahodadhi ( 25. 66-71 ) sets out what is havisya food in 
santi and proper food in the other cruel rites Eaghavabhatta 
( on 16. 56 ) adds many rules from other sources, such as the 
sadhaka performing purascarana should avoid sexual intercourse, 
flesh, wine, should not speak with women and sudras, nor speak 
untruth, nor pamper his senses, should carry on the japa from 
morning till noon, should not allow a break, should repeat the 
mantra the same number of times every day.

The Jayakhya-samhita, ( 19th patala, verses 13-33 ) says 
that, for three years after the sadhaka begins purascarana of the 
mantra chosen, various obstacles and disturbances present them- 
selves but if his mind and action are not affected by them, then 
from the 4th year he comes to be served by disciples that 
surrender everything to him, that after seven years even proud 
kings approach him for favour, after the 9th year he notices 
many wondrous things such as joy, sound dreams, sweet music 
and fragrance, 1809 hears loud vedic recitation, he eats and 
sleeps little ( yet does not become lean ), that these are signs 
of his having reached perfection in the mantra. The 
same work provides that such signs he should not divulge 
to any one but his own guru and if he divulges those 
happy signs to others siddhis run away from him 
( 19. 34-37 ). The same Samhita ( 15. 186-188 ) provides that 
the syllables svaha, svadha, phat, hum and namah are to 
be respectively employed in homa, in rites for manes, destructive 
activities, creating hatred among friends and for securing 
moksa. All tantrik works emphasize that mantra must be 
received from a qualified guru and the sadhana of the mantra 
must be done under the guidance of the guru till the disciple 
himself becomes a siddha. As shown above it was believed that 
mantras would confer the highest spiritual and supernormal 
powers, would bring to the sadhaka all desired objects and moksa. 
The Knlarnava states «"■» 'It it declared in the doctrine taught 
by Siva that without d!ksa there would be no moksa, that diksa 
cannot be had without an acarya (guru) and that mantras would 
yield no fruit unless a guru instructs (a disciple) about them'. 



1809. The Yogasiitra III 36 and bhasya thereon state that some of the 
P°*«s developed are that the yoga expert hears divine music and receives 
the .mpressuin of fragrant scents In 'Bengal Lancer- F Yeats-Brown 
(London, 1930) narrates < pp. 216-247) how he had the experience that 
the room in which he and his American friends were sitting was filled by 
a jogic teacher who v,ore nothing but his dhoti with the perfume of attar

It was further provided"" that there was no jiddhif miraculous 
powers due to mantras) nor moksa for him who had not had 
dlksa performed for him, that therefore a man should by all 
means receive diksa from a guru and that when one is endowed 
with the ceremony of dlksa the distinctions ba B ed on caste vanish 
and a sudra and a brabmana cease to be so (when both have 
undergone dlksa) It was held that, if a person were to engage 
in the japa of a mantra written in a book, he would not secure 
siddhi and he would surely meet losses at every m2 step. 

In the Mahanirvana ( II. 14-15 and 20 ) it is said that Ved'ic 
mantras yielded desired results in Satya and other yugas, but in 
Kaliyuga they are like serpents without poison or like dead ones, 
that in the Kaliyuga the mantras declared in tantra works yield 
fruits quickly and are commended for employment in all actions 
such as japa and sacrifices. There is no such path as the one 
propounded in Tantras that would lead to moksa or to happiness 
in this world and the next. The Mahanirvana prescribes that 
' om sac-cid-ekam brahma ' ib the best of mantras (III. 14), that 
those who perform theupasana of the highest biahma are in need 
of no other sadhana and that by the mere perfection of that 
mantra the individual soul merges in brahma wl3 So Moksa 
was one of the aims. Another aim was the attainment of 
miraculous or supernormal powers The Prapancasara enume- 
rates 1814 the eight siddhis and states that one who is endowed 
with these eight is a liberated soul and is apoken of as a yoyin. 
The theory of siddhis is an ancient conception and occurs in the 
Apastamba-dharmasutTa. 1815 The eight siddhis are named and

39-41, The SKJUtR? ( Hteran°g pp. 216-17) quotes a long proso passage from 
the ancient writer ^? who names and illustrates the eight siddhis or 
vibhutis (omits jiRhi and adds '4M<hlHM44lP)<4).

Siddhis ( supra-normal powers ) l* 13 

explained in the Yogasutrabhasya as foW«* : Animan 
(becoming small like an atom, atomization ), laghiman (levi- 
tation), mabiman (becoming magnified like a mountain or the 
sky, magnification), prapti (all objects becoming near to bim 
such as touching the moon with one's fingertip, extension), 
prakamya (the non-obstruction of his desire such as diving into 
the earth underground and coming up as if he were in water), 
vasitva (mastery of the five elements and their products such 
as a jar), Isitva (sovereignty over the production, absorption or 
arrangement of elements and their products), yatra-kamavasa- 
yitva (the power to determine things according to his wish or 
will i. e. he may will that poison should have the effect of nectar 
and brings about that result ). A siddha would be one who has 
secured these eight siddhis. The Glta (X. 36) says that the 
sage Kapila is the great one among siddhas ( * siddhanam kapilo 
munih'). The Yogasutra further speaks of siddhis as fivefold 
viz. proceeding from birth, from drugs, from mantras, from 
tapas (austerities) and from concentration. There were other 
objects also sought to be achieved by mantras, such as the six 
cruel rites and making women to have passion for a man. This 
shows that not only Tantrikas, but those who practised yoga 
believed in the power of mantras to confer supernormal powers 
on the yogin. The Yogasutra provides that some of the siddhis 
( as in m. 37 ) are obstacles to the attainment of samadhi and 
they are siddhis only to those "who have awakened from 
trance. 1817 Yaj (HI. 202-203) provides that the power to 
disappear, to enter another body and temporarily to abandon 
one's body, to create at one's will objects-these and other powers 
are characteristic signs of the attainment of siddhis by Yoga 
and that when one attains perfection in Yoga one oan cast away 
the mortal coil and be able to become immortal in brahma. 

A great deal is said about the six cruel rites in the Tantras 
such as Prapaficasara (V), Saradatilaka (23. 121-145), Sakti- 
sangamatantra ( Kalikhanda "VIC. 102-106 ), Mantramahodadhi 
(25th Taranga). The Saradatilaka (23. 137-141) deals with 
the six methods or arrangements of mantra along with the name 
of the enemy against whom the six rites were to be practised,

sthula (gross), suksma ( subtle ) and highest; chap. 51 explains 
these three about the Tara or Taraka mantra m Om. 

It may be noted here that the Buddhist Tantras also 
claimed to show the way to the attainment of various objects, 
from success in love affairs to liberation and all these could be 
mostly secured by mantras. The Buddhist Tantra writers of 
the Vajrayana school state that there were 84 siddhas, whose 
names are still cherished" 20 and honoured in Nepal and Tibet. 
The Buddhists mentioned eight siddhis but they were somewhat 
different from those of the Yogasutra. The Sadhanamala. 
mentions them as follows : Khadga (a sword over which mantras 
have been muttered whereby the user of it succeeds in battle ), 
Anjana (collyrium applied to eyes which enables a person to 
see buried treasure), Padalepa (ointment applied to the soles, 
of the feet enabling a person to move anywhere undis- 
covered ), Antardhana ( becoming invisible before the very eyes, 
of persons watching him), Easarassyana (power of trans-i 
mitting baser metals into gold or finding out an elixir for 
immortality), Ehecara (being able to fly up in the sky), 
Bhucara ( going swiftly anywhere on the earth) and Fatalasiddhi 
(diving underneath the earth 1821 ) As the Buddhist monks 
were to possess no property, they had a craving for wealth and 
supposed that by means of certain mantras, the lord of wealth 
(Kubeia) would confer on them riches that would last for 
ever. 1822 They also believed that by mantras they would make

some of the Hindu gods their servants, viz. that they would be 
surrounded by many ap3araees (heavenly damsels), that Indra 
would be their umhrella-hearer, Erahma would be councillor and 
Hari door-keeper. leS They wanted to defeat opponents in public 
discussions and to acquire proficiency in Sa<stra<J without study 
through the power of mantra3 alone (vide SadhanamaU Hot, 
151, 155, 256). They were also anxious to cure and avert 
diseases and remove snake poison. They thought that by 
mantras they would attain to omniscience and Buddhahood 
(vide notes 1791-92 ). 

As stated above (notes 1810-11) a mantra had to be 
received from a guru after initiation ( dlksl ). Therefore, a few 
words must be said about dlks-3. The T»ntrika3 did not discover 
any new concept in dlksa. From very ancient Vedic times there 
was upanayana regarded as the beginning of the spiritual birth 
of a boy and the sacrificer had to undergo a purificatory 
ceremony before embarking on the performance of a sacrifice, 
hut both were not so elaborate as the dlksa described in some of 
the TSntrika works. Vide H. of Dh. vol H pp. 1135-1140 for 
Vedic dlksa (in Agnistoma), the observances and references 
to the Brahmanas and the Srautasutras. The Tai. S. (VI 1. 1-3 
and V2L 4. 8) refers to dlksa and the Ait. Br. (1 3) mentions the 
main items in Vedic dikes, such as bath with sacred water on the 
sacrificer, smearing the face and other parts of the body with 
butter, applying odUyriam to the eyes, purification of the 
sacrificer's body twice by the adhvaryu with three bunches of 
seven darbhas each above the navel and then below it with 
mantras, entering a pavilion specially prepared for the sacrificer, 
covering him with a garment that envelopes him as a sack 
envelopes an embryo, dark antelope skin a3 an upper garment, 
The Slat. Br. also refera to the details of dike* and sfcate3 that 
thereby the sacrificer becomes one among the gods for the time 
being ( vide HL 1. 2. 10-21, HL 1. 3. 7-28) and for the idea that 
dlksa symbolizes a new birth for the sacrificer. The Atharra- 
veda says « Great truth, formidable moral order, vows of initiation, 
austerities, prayer (or knowledge) and sacrifice support the 
earth.' «** -

Treatment of Z)ik£5 11 17 

Dlksa is treated elaborately in some of the Tantras such as 
Prapancasara ( V and VI ), Eularnava ( 14. 39 ff ), Saradatilaka 
( 4th patala ), Nityotsava { pp. 4-10 ), Jnanarnava ( 34th patala ), 
Visnusamhita (X), MahanirvSna (X. 112-119) and in 
Lingapurana (II. %1). The Hirnaysagara Press brought out an 
edition ( in 1935 ) of a work called Dlksaprakasika of Visnu- 
hhatta, pupil of SatySnandanatha, composed in saka 1719 
( 1797 A. D. ). Almost all of them derive M2S the word from the 
root ' da ' (to give ) and ' ksi' to destroy, in various ways. The 
Eularnava defines it as ' the good call it dlksa because it confers 
a divine (holy) state and wipes off all sins, thereby freeing 
a man from the bondage of samsaia'; the Saradatilaka states 
' since it confers divine knowledge and destroys sins it is named 
dlksa by the teachers that know the Tantras * 

The Saktisangama-tantra regards an eclipse of the sun or 
the moon (particularly of the moon ) as the best time for under- 
going initiation for a mantra from a guru and remarks that 
when performed in an eclipse, the week day, tithi, naksatra or 
month or Yoga or Karana need not be considered. 1826 The 
Kallvitesatantra states that if one is fortunate enough to secure 
Svatt naksatra and Friday on the 5th tithi of the dark half of 
Phalguna and undergoes dlksa on that date, that yields the 
rewards of a orore of ordinary dlksas ( VI. 3-4 ). The N. S. 
( p. 67 ) quotes the Jnanarnava to the effect that the diksa as to 
a mantra should be on the day of a solar or lunar eclipse or 
within seven days from an eclipse and adds that the principal 
tune is solar eclipse and quotes Kalottara to the effect that, if 
the time of a solar eclipse is secured for dlksa, De need not 
consider the month, tithi, the week day and the like. N. S also 
quotes a passage from Yoginftantra condemning diksa on a 
unar eclipse. Vide Muhurtakalpadruma of Vitthala p. 94 verse 6 
(JNirn. ed.) for further detaik about times and places for dlksa 







1118 History of Dharmaiaslra I See. VI, Oh. XXVI 

The Agnipurana ( chapters 27, 81-89 and 304) deals with 
dlksa at great length and is full of Tantrik mantras and rites, 
but reasons of space forbid any treatment of the same here. The 
Jfianarnava ( 24 45-53 ) provides that at the time of initiation 
( dlksa ) the guru has to instruct the disciple or novice as regards 
the six cakras ( Adhara up to iLjSa) together with the number of 
petals in each, the colour of each, the letters of the alphabet 
assigned to each. 

Late Dharmasastra works relied for the initiation into 
mantras on tantra works. For example, the Dharmasindhu 
(p. 32 ) expressly says so There is a difference between Dlksa 
and upadesa, which latter means the communication of only ft 
mantra in a solar or lunar eclipse, at a tirtha, Siddhaksetra 
( sacred region once inhabited by a siddha ) or in a Siva temple. 
Eaghunandana in Dlksatattva ( vol IL pp. 645-659 ) gives a 
lengthy treatment of dlksa at the beginning of which he remarks 
that in the Saradatilaka and other works numerous topics of 
dlksa are described but as in his time all those were not being 
followed he attempts only a brief treatment. 

The Mahsnirvana states (X. 201-202) that the guru for 
giving dlksa when the disciple is a Sskta, Saiva, Vaisnava, Saura 
or a Ganapatya, should be of the same sect, but a kaula is a 
good guru for every one. The Mahsnirvana (X. 112) provides 
that a person does not become a Kaula by merely drinking wme, 
but he becomes so only after abhiseka Then ( in verses 113-W 
of 10th ullasa) the Mahanirvana provides an elaborate procedure 
of complete abhiselca somewhat resembling Christian Baptism. 
There is first on the day previous to the day of abhiseka worship 
ofGanesa, then of eight Saktis (Brahml&c), lokapala, , and 
their weapons. Then the next day (i e the day of f~j 
after a bath the neophyte donates sesame and »***"»

the nine planets, naksatras, yogas, weekdays, haranas, seas, 
sacred rivers, nagas, trees &e. Then the guru gives the disciple a 
new name ending in Anandanatha, who honours the guru and 
other Kaulas present This ceremony may go on for 9, 7, 5, 3 
nights or one night. Vide Tantrarajatantra II. 58-72, Jfiana- 
siddhi (XVII) for similar procedure of abhiseka. Vide the 
Introduction to the Sekoddesatika, a Buddhist Tantrik work 
( in G. O. S.) edited by Mario E. Carelli, for its resemblance to the 
Christian rite of Baptism. The Ahrrhudhnya-samhita, (chap 39) 
provides a procedure of Maliabluseka as one remedy against all 
diseases, as one destroying all enemies and for the attainment 
of all desired objects. 

There were four kinds of dlksas, Kriyavati, Varnamayi, 
Ealavatt and Vedhamayl and there were elaborate rales about 
vaskuyaga, construction of mandapa, kundas and sthandila, 
which are all passed over for reasons of space. 



CHAPTER XXVII 

Nyasas, Mudras, Y antra, Cakra, Mandala, etc. 

One of the important items in the Tantrik ritual and 
worship is mjasa, which means 'mentally invoking a god or 
gods, mantras and holy texts to come to occupy certain parts 
of the hody in order to render the body a pure and fit receptacle 
for worship and meditation*. Several works such as the 
Jayakhya-samhita (PatalaXI), Prapancasara (VI), Kulamava 
(IV. 18 ff) refer to several kinds of nyasa; the Saradatilaka 
(IV. 29-41, V. 5-7 ), Mahanirvanatantra (III 41-43, V. 113-118) 
describe several varieties of nyasa. Raghavabhatta on Sarada- 
tilaka (IV. 29-41) cites numerous quotations on nyasa from an 
extensive literature. There are several kinds of nyasa such 1818 
as Hamsanyasa, Pranavanyasa, Matrkanyasa, Mantranyasa, 
Karanyasa, Anganyasa, PlthanySsa. Pranavanyasa is illustrated 
as ' om am Brahmane namah', *om am Visnave namah^ and 
eo on for all the nameB set out by Raghavabhatta on Saradatilaka 
35. 58. The Anganyasa (nyasa on parts of the body)^ is 
illustrated as follows: om hrdayaya namah, om sirase svaha, 
sikhayai vasat, om kavaoaya hum, om netratrayaya (or 
netradvayaya) vasat, om astraya phaf. Several PurSnafs 
contain provisions about nyasa. The Garudapurana ( l. 
chapters 26, 31, 33) describes anganyasa as part of worship, 
japa and homa. The Naradlyapurana (IL 57. 13-14), B» 
Bhagavata (VI. 8, about 40 verses ), Brahma (60. 35-40) provide 
for nyasa of the mantraB *om namo NarayanSya ', and om 
Visnave namah'. The Kalikapurana (chap. 77) deals jnBj 
Matrkanyasa. The Smrtimuktaphala (AluUa PP- jJJ*tj 
quotes several passages dealing with nyasa of the 24 let fa** 
the Gayatri (Rg.lH. 63.10) on several porta < °* ^ J^

( 60 35-39 ) deals with the nyasa of the mantra ' om namo 
Narayanaya' on the fingers and also on other parts of the "body, 
and speaks of Karanyasa and Anganyasa in 28. 26. Padma 18M 
( VI 79. 17-30 ) describes the nyasa of the names of Visnu on 
the limbs of the body from the head to the feet and Padma VI. 
85. 26 speaks of Anganyasa and Karanyasa with the mantra 
'om namo bhagavate Vasudevaya'. The Matsyapurana 1830 
provides for the employment in nyasa of mantras with 'om' 
prefixed to them Karanganyasa and Anganyasa of Gayatrl 
are dealt with in Devlbhagavata XI. 16. 76-91 and it ex- 
pressly names nyasa as part of sandhya worship. 1831 Vide also 
Devlbhagavata XI. 7. 26-38 for riyasa and KalikapnrSna 53. 36. 
The Devlbhagavata (VII. 40. 6-8 ) mentions the nyasa of certain 
letters on such parts of the body as the chest, the space between 
the eyebrows, the head. The Brhad-yogiyajnavalkya 1832 contained

verses dealing with the nyasa of the names of Visnu such as 
Govinda, Mahidhara. Hrslkesa, Trivikrama, Visnu, Madhava 
on the fingers of the right hand and the palm and back 
respectively, which are quoted by the Smrticandrika (ip 19S) 
as from Yoga-yajnavalkya and which have been taken over in 
the sandhya worship in modern times The latter work (Sm. C. 
I. p. 145) also contains Anganyasa of several portions of 
G-ayatrl, the nyasa of the single letters of the Gayatrl on the 
limbs and AparSrka (p. 140 ) quotes a passage for the employ- 
ment of the sixteen verses of the Purusasukta (Rg X 90) for 
nyasa on the several limbs in the worship of Visnu For the 
nyasa of the letters of the alphabet from 'a' to 'ksa', vide 
Saradatilaka V. 5-8 and Raghavabhatta on V 4 who quotes 
verses setting out how each letter is to be meditated upon. Tie 
Mahanirvana ( V. 176-178 ) also specifies the limbs on which 
there is to be nyasa of the letters of the alphabet from the 
forehead downwards. 

The above passages show that the item of nyasa was taken 
over from Tantrika works in the Puranas for the rites of the 
orthodox people several centuries before Yogayajflavalkya, 
AparSrka ( first half of 12th century A. D. ) and the Smcti- 
candrika. The Varsakriyskaumudl 1833 (about first half of 16th 
oentury) shows that long before it the Garuda and the Kaljka 
puranas contained provisions on nyasa. The Derapratistba- 
tattva of Raghunandana (p. 505) speaks of MatrkanySsa and 
Tattvanyasa The Pujaprakasa section of the Vlramitrodoya 
dwells upon MatrkanySsa, Anganyasa, Gayatrlnyasa on H»1M, 
131,132 respectively. The Bhaktiprakasa (pp. 88-89) of the 
same work deals with MStrkanyasa. In modern times some 
orthodox people still perform two kinds of nySsas as follows ; 
The AntarmatrkS which consists in the mystic assignment 
(mentally ) of the letters of the alphabet ( from ' a' to 'ksa ) on 
the fingers of the hands and on the palm and back of HwHanoB 
and on several parts of the body viz. the throat, organs of gene- 
ration, the adhara place and the middle of the «*w(«J 
seats of the six psychic cakras mentioned ^ no ' e /'™dual 
The Bahirmatrkanyasa consists in f^.^1 
alphabet letters with awsvara on each on the limbs from 
to feet in such forms as 'am namah murdhm and so on,

Derivation of the word nySsa 112$ 

The word nyasa is derived from the root * as * ' to cast ' with 
'ni' and literally means 'placing or depositing in or on.'. The 
Kularoava explains it as follows : 1S34 ' nyasa is so called because 
therein riches that are acquired in a righteous way are deposited 
or placed with persons whereby all-round protection is got' (so 
by the ritual touching of the chest and other limbs with the tipa 
of the fingers and the palm of the right hand accompanied by 
mantras the worshipper can act fearlessly in the midst of 
bad men and becomes like a god). Vide Jayakhyasamhita 
quoted below. 1835 

The subject of nyasa was briefly dealt with in H. of Dh. 
Vol. 31 p. 319-320. In 'Principles of Tantra' Sir John Woodroffe 
(pp. LX21-LXXVIX ) compares the ritual of nyasa with the 
Christian method of making the sign of the cross. 

Mudra is another characteristic item in Tantrik ritual. 
The word mudi a has several meanings, four of which have a 
bearing on Tantrik practices. It means a posture inyogic 
practices in which the whole body plays a part. It also means the 
symbolic ox mystic intertwining of the fingers and hands as part 
of religious worship. Mudra is also the 4th of the five makaras 
and means various kinds of grains mixed with ghee or other 
ingredient (vide note 1752 above) or parched grains. A fourth 
meaning of mudra is the woman with whom a Tantrika yogi asso- 
ciates himself (as in Prajnopaya o V. 24 and Sekoddesatika p. 56). 
The Kularnava derives the word from 'mud' meaning « delight ' 
or pleassure' and 'dravay' (causal of « dru*) and says 'mudras ' 
( ritual finger and hand poses) should be shown ( in worship) and 
are so known because they give delight to the gods and make 
ttam; mmds melt (with compassion for the worshipper). But 
the Saraaatilaka"B' app ears to derive it from « mud' and • ra' (to

give ) and according to it mudra means ' what affords pleasure 
to the Clods'. Other derivations are also proposed (vide J. 0. B, 
Baroda, vol. VI. p. 13 ). Kaghavabhatta states that the fingers 
from the thumb to the small finger are identified with the fire 
elements viz. SkSsa ( sky or ether ), wind, fire, water and earth 
and that their contact with each other tends to make the deity 
favourable and delighted and induces the deity to be present at 
the worship, and that various appropriate mudras are to be 
employed in worship, at the time of japa, in meditation and in 
all rites performed for securing some desired object or benefit, 
since they induce the deity to be present (near the worship- 
per 1837 ). It was supposed that mudras helped in enhancing 
concentration on the part of the worshipper. Even as eaily as 
the 7th century it was believed that the making of mudras may 
faring to life one who, being poisoned had fallen into coma, 
as the Kadambarl quoted below shows. The Varsakriya- 
kaumudl quotes a verse saying that japa, pranayama, worship 
of gods, yoga, meditation and asanas are fruitless unless 
accompanied by appropriate mudrSs 

The word mudra occurs in the name of Lopamudra, 1838 wife 
of Agastya, who figures in a hymn of the Eg. (1. 179. 4 ). The 
word ' mudra * is not mentioned in the Amarakosa.

frumber of mudras in different works H25 

The H of Dh. vol H. (pp. 320-321 ) makes a brief mention 
of mudras in worship and refers to the work of Miss Tyra de 
Kleen on the mudras practised by Baaddha and Saiva priests 
called pedantiis in the island of Bali. Here the same sublet 
will be dealt with in a little more detail and from different 
points of view. 

There is a great divergence among the Tantra, Purana and 
Yoga works on the number, names and definitions of mudras. 
This may be briefly illustrated. 

In the Tantrik texts ( Vol. L pp. 46-47) there is a nighantu 
(a glossary or enumeration) of mudras with names and defini- 
tions, where it is stated that nine mudras (awliani and others ) 
are common ( i. e. capable of being employed in any worship) ; 
and then are enumerated mudras specially appropriate to Yisnu 
worship (19 in all viz. Sankha, Cakra, Gada, Padma, Venu, 
Srlvatsa, Kaustubha, Vanamala, Jfiana, Vidya, Garuda, Nara- 
sirhhl, Varahi, Hayagrivl, Dhanus, Bana, Parasu, Jagan-mohinI, 
Varna; ten of Siva (Linga, Yoni, Trisula, AksamalS, Abhiti i. e. 
abhaya, Mrga, Asika, Ehatvanga ( a club with a skull at the 
top), Kapala, Damaru; one of the Sun (viz Padma); seven of 
Ganesa (Danta, Pasa, Ankusa, Avighna, Pasu, Ladduka, 
BIjapura ( i. e. a citron ). 18S9 

The Saradatilaka (23.106-114) names only nine mudras 
and defines them, while the Visnusamnita ("VII) says that 
mudras are innumerable (verse 45), names about thirty and 
defines them and Jfianarnava ( IV ), mentions at least nineteen. 
The Jayakhyasamhita (8th Patala) has about 58 mudras. 
The Tantrik" 10 works provide that mudras should be practised 

1839. These Madras are also mentioned in a work called Mudra- 
laksana(D.C Ms. 291 of 1887-91 ). Some of these madras in connection 
with the worship of individual gods occur in Visnusamhita VII and in 
J Kanaraava IV The Mudranighantu names and defines madras o£ Sakti . 
Agm, Tnpura and 'other deities. The madras specially appropriate in the 
worship of Visan, sneb as Sankha, Cakra, Gada, Padma, Kaustubha, 
Srlvatsa, Vanamala, Vena are described in a work called Naradatantra 
quoted by Varsakriyakaumudl pp. 154-156.

secretly under cover of a garment and not in the presence of 
many people and should not bo announced to another aa otherwise 
they become fruitless. The KamakalSvilasa of Punyananda expre- 
ssly mentions ( in verse 46 ) Trikhanda-mudKi and refers to the 
fact that there are nine mudras. 1811 The Nityasodasifcirnava 
( 3rd visrama ) first defines Trikhanda, then names and defines 
nine mudras most of which bear names different from those in the 
Saradatilaka. The Mudras mentioned by Nityasodasika apart 
from Trikhanda, are: Sarvasanksobhakarinl, Sarvavidravinl, 
Akarsinl, Sarvavesakarl, Unmadinl, Mahankusa, KheoarJ, 
Bijamudra, Yonimudra. 

The Jnanarnava Tantra (IV. 31-47 and 51-56 and XV. 47- 
68) names over thirty mudras, several of which bear the samo 
names as those in Nityasodasikarnava, are defined in a similar 
way and are quoted by Bhaskararaya in his commentary on tho 
latter work. In these circumstances the author proposes to namo 
and describe first of all the nine mudras of the Saradatilaka. im 
( I ) AvahanI mudra consists in folding both hands in a hollow 
and filling the hollow completely with flowers; (2) sthapanl ifl 
the same as avahanl but the folded hands are held upside down; 
( 3 ) the ' sannidhapana-mudra ' occurs when the two hands aro 
formed into a closed fist, are joined together with only the

thumbs raised up ; (4) ' Sannirodhanl* means the same as the 
preceding but with the thumbs closed inside the fist ; (5) the 
mudTa is called ' Sammukhlkaraiil ' when the two closed fists are 
held upwards; (6) ' Sakallkrti * mudra is the action of making 
the nyasa of the six limbs on the limbs of the ( image of ) the 
devata (deity worshipped ) , (7) the 'Avagnnthana' mudra. 
consists in closing the fingers held straight and turned down- 
wards and waving the hand round (the image); (8) 'Dhenu- 
mudra ' ( a complicated pose ) is formed by putting the right 
small finger over the right ring finger, intertwining the former 
with the left ring finger, the left small finger as it is, to be 
intertwined with the right ring finger, the left ring finger is to 
be passed ovbt the left middle finger and the left thumb, and to be 
intertwined with the right hand middle finger brought to the 
Tight side of the left index finger and the right hand index 
finger to be joined with the left hand middle finger , ( 9 ) Maha- 
mudra is constituted by intertwining the thumbs of both hands 
and holding the other fingers straight. 

Some of the works on Yoga desoribe various mudras, 3?or 
example, the Hathayogapradipiks ( III. 6-23 ) describes at length 
ten mudras and the Gherandasamhita (III. 1-3) speaks of 
25 mudras and describes them in one hundred verses. The 
S jvasamhita ( IV. 15-31 ) mentions ten mudras as the best. An 
important mudra in Hathayoga practices is the Khecarimudra 
described in Davlbhagavata XI. 66.62-65, Sivasamhita, IV. 31-33, 
Gherandasamhita HL 25-27, Hafhayogapradlpika HI. 32-53. 
This description differs from the definition of Khecarl in 
Jfianarnava (15. 61-63) and Wityasodasikarnava HI. 15-23. The 
Vajroltmudra ( in Hathayogapradipiks IH. 82-96 ) cannot be 
set out here for reasons of decency and it was supposed to pro- 
long the life of a yogin even after indulgence in sexual orgies. 

Some of the Puranas contain an extensive treatment of 
mudras. The Kalikapurana mentions anganyasa, karanyasa in 
chap 66 and mudras like Dhenumudra, Yonimudra, Mahamudra, 
Khecarimudra in 70. 36-56, 78. 3-6, DevIbhagavatafXI. 16.

nd the latter consisted of different arrangements of hands i and 
set It is likely that the mudras in the Hmau and Buddhist 
''antrik works are based on the poses that were evolved in 
mcient Indian dance and drama and that find their earliest 
riant description in Bharata-natyasastra and that are also to 
e found in later medieval works on dramaturgy such .as tfce 
Abhinayadarpana 1847 

The Aryamafijusrlmulakalpa names and defines 108 mudras 

p. 380}. On p. 376 it states that the combination of mudras 

and mantras would bring success in all actions and neither 

hthi, nor naksati a nor fasting would be required. In the Vismi- - 

dharmottarapurana 1848 there is a fine eulogy of the mudras made 

in dancing viz. they aTe the graces of the rich, the removers of 

the sorrow of the distressed, the instruction of the ignorant, the 

increase of the blessedness (or charm) of women; they were 

created by Vasudeva for the removal of portents, as the means 

of prosperity and of the attainment of desired objects. 

The Buddhists also had mudras. One of the early works of 
the Mahayana school viz. Aryamanjusrtomlakalpa is full of 
mudras in the 35th patala (pp. 355-381) and states (on p. 380) 
that there are 108 mudras. 1849 L. H. Waddell in ' the Buddhism 
of Tibet or Lamaism' (London, 1895 ) describes nine mudras 
practised in Tibet by the Lamas (pp 336-337 ). 

In the Indian Antiquary, vol. 26 ( 1897 ), pp. 24-25, Burgess 
mentions nine Buddhist mudras (slightly differing from 
Waddell's descriptions) as follows :— (1) Bhiimisprs or Bhiimi- 
sparsa mudra, an attitude of Sakya Buddha (-making the earth 
as witness); (2) Dharmacakra mudra (teaching attitude); 
(3) Abhaya mudra (of blessing), in which the left hand is open

fingers and thumb half extended and with the palm facing

in which the right hand hangs down over the knee, tho palm 
of tho hand turned outwards symbolising charity; (6) Lalita- 
mudra (enchanting or bowitching }; (7) Tarkamudru (rigW 
hand raised to tho chest and slightly constricted; (8) Sarana- 
mudrfi ( of refuge or protection ), (!)) Uttarabodhimudra (poso 
of highost porfoction, which is apt to he confounded with 
Dharmacakramudra ). 

The Jainas also had mudras. In J. O. I (Bnroda), vol. VI 
No. 1 pp. 1-35 Dr. Priyabala Shah contributes an interesting 
paper on two Jaina woTks, one of which called Mudravicara 
describes 73 mudras and tho other called Mudravidhi lists 
114 mudras. 

In a recent work 'Royal conquests and cultural migrations' 
Mr, 0. Sivaramamurti (Calcutta, 1955) remarks ,'on p. 43) 
that the 'hastas' and 'karanas' on the Gopura at Chidambaram 
aro found also in the Siva temple at Prambanan in Java, wh«e 
one can observe many of tho karcmas like PatSka, Tripateka, 
Ardhacandra, Sikhara, Kartarfmukha, Suci and hastas like 
Afvjali, Puspaputa. In another recent work 'Contributions to 
the History of the Indian Drama' by Dr. Manomohan Ghosh 
(Calcutta, 1958) it is stated that in the bas-reliefs of Bayon 
( Angkor Thorn) certain aspects of the Cambodian dance and 
drama, particularly certain gestures depicted and actually 
observed in practice now in the dances in the royal palace, aie 
similar to those described in the Natya&stra of Bharata sucbj w 
Afijali, Patafca, Ardhacandra, Musti, Candrakala and Kapota 
(P 63).

in Visnu -worship, some in worship of the Sun, LaksmI and 
DurgS and the Anjali and Samhara mudras (the last two ) used 
in the worship of all goda. The Ahnikaprakasa (part of 
Vlramitrodaya) names 24 mudras to be shown at the time of the 
japa of Gayatri (pp. 298-299) which are the same as in Davl- 
bhagavata XI. 16. 98-102, hut it quotes them as from Brahma. 1850 
It is difficult to say what work is meant by Brahma. Mudras 
were not universally practised. It is clear from the Dharmasindhu 
and Samskara-ratnamala quoted in note 1831 that Kyasa and 
Mudra were held to be non-vedic in Maharastra at least. 

Another item in the Tantrik worship is that of Mandala 
which has been also a prominent feature of orthodox Hindu 
practices in medieval and modern times. But it cannot be said 
that the concept of mandalas was borrowed by Sanskrit writers 
from the Tantrikas. The word was used in the ssnse of orb or 
circle. In the Tai S. V. 3. 9. 2 reference is made to circular bricks 
(mandalestaka); vide also Sat. Br. IV. 1. 1. 25. The orb of the 
Sun is also called the wheel (cakra) in ftg. IV. 28. 2 and V. 29. 
10. The Br. Up. says* this Aditya is what is (called) truth 1851 
(satya)' and refers to the Person in the orb (mandala) of the 
sun. Then it came to mean any figure or diagram (generally

circular) drawn on an altar and the like. In the Sulbasutra3 of 
JSpastarhba and Xatyayana reference is made to tlie sonaring of a 
circle (mandala). 1152 The Matsyapurana refers in several passages 
to mandalas drawn with powders of five colours (as in 58. 22). 
It also refers to the figure of a lotus of twelve or eight petals 
drawn with saffron or red sandalwood paste or with various 
colours (72. 30; 62.15; 64.12-13; 74 6-9 a lotus figure with 
eight petals and pericarp for sun worship). Varahamihira in Br. 
S. (chap. 47) describes 1633 a very auspicious ceremony called 
Pnsyasnana in which a mandala was to be drawn on holy ground 
with powders of different colours in which positions were to be 
assigned to gods, planets, stars etc. The Brahmapurana ( 28. 28 ) 
mentions the invocation of tie Sun on the figure of a lotus and 
Brahmapurana ( 61. 1-3 ) ahout the worship of Narayana on a 
mandala in the form of a lotu3 is quoted hy Kaghunadana in 
Purusottama-tattva (p 569). The Harsacarita 185 * (first half of 
7th century A. D. ) refers to a large mandala being drawn in 
several colours. The Varahapurana refers to the images or 
paintings of Lateral and Narayana in a mandala for worship 
( chap. 99. 9-11 ). The Agnipurana ( chapter 320 ) refers to eight 
mandalas, Sarvatohhadra and others. Several mandalas are 
described in Saradatilaka III 113-118, 131-134, 135-139 
(navanahhamandala), in JfiSnarnava 26. 15-17 and other works.

residence fot kings or rich people. The Saradatilaka (HI. 106- 
130) deals at length with the construction of a Sarvatobhadra- 
mandala and remarks that it is common to all worship 1856 and 
provides (HI 122-124) that the mandala should be drawn with 
five coloured powders viz yellow with turmeric powder, white 
produced from husked grains of rice, red with Kusumbha powder, 
black with the fine powder of half burnt inferior cereals sprinkled 
with milk and greenish with powder of the leaves of bilva. The 
Prapaficasara (V. 64-65) and Agni (30. 19-20) provide for 
similar coloured powders. The Vastuyagatattva of Raghunandana 
(p. 416) quotes the Saradatilaka (in. 123-124) about the five 
powders. The Jnanarnavatantra ( 24. 8-10 and 26. 15-17 ) appears 
to hold that mandala and cakra are synonyms and states that a 
mandala with nine angles may be drawn on an altar in a 
pavilion (mandapa) with saffron or vermilion powder 18S7 The 
Mahanirvanatantra also refers to mandates drawn with coloured 
powders (X. 137-138). Four characteristics of mandala 
ceremonies are mandala, mantra, piija and mudra. 

The Buddhist tantras also make much of mandalas. In the 
Manjusrlumlakalpa mandalas are described with special direc- 
tions for painting them. The Guhyasamajatantra speaks of a 
mandala of 16 cubits with a cakra inside. Vide Prof. G. Tucci's 
'Indo-Tibetica' vol. IV part I (Rome, 1941) which gives tables 
containing mandalas and A. Gtetty's 'The Gods of Northern 
Buddhism' (1908) Plate XVI for a mandala of nine elements,

A D.), describes 26 mandalas in 26 chapters, each mandala 
having a central deity and other minor Buddhist divinities, 
sometimes more than one hundred in number. 1858

History of Dharntaihstra I Sec. "VT, Oh. XXVII 



In the collection of the rites and worship oalled ' Bgveda. 
brahmakarmasamuccaya' published by the Nirnayasagara Press 
(6th ed. Bombay 1936) there are at the beginning several 
mandalas, plain or drawn in various colours, such as the Sarva- 
tobhadra, Oaturlingatobhadra, Prasadavastumandala, Grhava- 
stumandala, Grahadevatamandala, Hariharamandala, Ekalinga- 
tobhadra. The Smrtikaustubha mentions Dvadasalingatobhadra, 
Harihara-mandala inside which there is Sarvatobhadra pp. 410- 
411 ( of Mirn. ed. of 1909 ). They are all passed over here. 
Sarvatobhadra literally means ' auspicious on all sides '. This 
concept of an auspicious figure or diagram was carried over in 
the realm of Poetics. Dandin in his Kavyadarsa cites a verse 
in the form called Sarvatobhadra, which is an illustration of 
what are called ' citra-bandhas \ 1859 About a century before 
Dandin, the Kiratarjunlya (15 25) gives an illustration of 
'sarvatobhadra' 

In the Acta Orientalia volume referred to above there is an 
interesting analysis of the contents of two Tibetan ms3., one 
containing what is called * Rice-mandala * in which 37 elements

are indicated by their names (vide figure 1) and the other con- 
taining 123 drawings of mudras ( hand poses ). 

Another characteristic item in Tantrik worship is ' yanlra ' 
( geometrical diagram ), sometimes called cakra also, which one 
finds to some extent also in the Furanas and slightly in modern 
orthodox practices. A yantra is a diagram (or figure ) engraved, 
drawn or painted on metal, stone, paper or other material. It 
resembles a mandala but differs from it in this that a mandala 
may be employed in the worship of any devata, while a yantra 
is specially appropriated to the worship of a particular deity or 
employed for a particular purpose The Kularnava-tantra 1860 
states; 'Yantra is a development ( or product ) of mantra and a 
deity apprehended in the form of a mantra ; the deity worshipped 
on the yantra immediately becomes favourable ; yantra is so 
called because it removes all pains (or perturbations) arising 
from such faults as love and anger ; if God is worshipped in 
yantras, he is pleased*. The same Tantra further says 'if 
worship is done without a yantra the detain is not pleased'.. 
Here the word 'yantra' is derived from the root 'yantr'. In 
another place the same tantra states 'Tantra is so declared 
because it always saves (the worshipper) from Tama (god of 
death) and goblins and other dangers'. The Ramapurvatapanlya 
TJpanisad 1861 observes 'the arrangement (or preparation) of a 
yantra is the body of the deity which confers safety'. The 
Kaulavallnirnaya observes 'worship (of a deity) without employ- 
ing a yantra, satiating (the goddess) without offering flesh, 
drinking wine without being accompanied by a Sakti (the wife 
or other woman associated with a Sakta worshipper )-all these 
yield no fruit ' Some works evolved a ' yantra-gayatri ' also 1SS2

1136 History of Dharmaiastia [ Seo. VI, Ch. XXVU 

These passages make it clear that a yantra was deemed to 
be a factor helping in restraining the restless movements of the 
mind due to anger, love and the like and in making the mind 
concentrate on a diagram or model deemed to represent the 
deity worshipped. It induced concentration and encouraged the 
mental realization of the deity. The distinction between the 
devata and yantra is similar to that between the soul and the 
body. Most Hindus look upon such forms of worship without 
antipathy because it is felt that they serve as a way of approach 
to divinity for ordinary unsophisticated people and that it is 
better to have one's foot on the lowest rung of the ladder to 
higher life than to have it on no rung at all. 

Yantras are described in such Tantrik and other works as 
Tripuratapanl Upanisad (II 3), Prapancasaratantra (patalas 
21 and 34), Saradatilaka (VII. 53-63, &XIV), Kamakalavilasa 
(verses 22, 26, 29, 30, 33), Nityasodasikarnava (I. 31-43) 
Nityotsava (pp. 6, 64-55), Tantra-rajatantra (II 44-51, VET 30 ff. 
XXXIH), AhirbudhnyasamhitS (chap. 23-26), Mantramaho- 
dadhi (20th Taranga), KaulajSananirnaya (X, which speaks of 
them as cakras ), Kaulavalinirnaya (III. 105-135), Merutantra 
( 33rd prakasa, 562 verses), MantramahSrnava-tantra (Uttara- 
khanda, 11th taranga ). It is not possible to deal with all this 
large material here. The Fadma (Patalakhanda, 79. 1) provides 
that the worship of Hari (Visnu) may be performed on the 
Salagrama stone or on a jewel or a yantra, a mandala, or images, 
and not merely in a temple The Ahirbudhnya-samhita ( chap. 
36 , verses 5-66 ) describes the procedure of the worship of a 
Sudarsana-yantra by a king or other personage desiring wealth 
or prosperity. One yantra or cakra may be explained and 
illustrated here. The most noted is &rtcakra described in two 
verses quoted 1853 below and explained in some detail in the

& Icakra explained 1137 

Setubandha commentary on Nityasodasik&rnava (I. 31-46). 
The latter verses explain how the Oakra is to be drawn with the 
bindu in a small triangle. The bindu represents Sakti or Mula- 
pTakrfci solidified In published works on Tantra the Srlcakra 
is represented in colours ( as in Saundaryalaharl published by 
Ganesb & Go. Madras, 1957, facing the title page ), while others 
represent it only by means of plain uncoloured lines (as on the 
outer cover of the above edition of Saundaryalaharl or on the 
cover of the Kamakalavilasa ed by A Avalon and published 
by Ganesh and Co. 1953 ). In some works the figure of Srlcakra 
shows no gates as on the cover in 'Principles of Tantra' by 
A. Avalon or on the cover of Kamakalavilasa, while gates are 
shown in other works ( as in the above edition of Saundaryala- 
harl before the Sanskrit test). There are nine triangles, five 
of which have their apex pointing downwards and these represent 
Sakti and four (representing Siva) have an apex pointing up- 
wards. The bindu is situated in the smallest triangle pointing 
downwards. Then there are two pairs of ten triangles ( shown 
in some books as blue and Ted respectively), then fourteen 
triangles (coloured blue in some works), then eight-petalled 
lotus (sometimes coloured red ), 16 petalled lotus ( coloured blue), 
then three circles, then three boundary line3 with four gates, 
these two latter being the outer sections of the yantra and the 
Muses of 8 and 16 petals being the inner section of the yautra. 
There are in all 43 angles ( some works make 44). The part of 
the Cakra within the boundary lines is called bhupura. The 
worship of yantra is bahuyaga (outer or external worship of 
Sakti). The internal worship {antaryaga) consists in taking 
the awakened Kundalini through the cakras from Muladhara to 
Ajnacakra and then uniting it with the Lord Siva in the Saha,

the five elements and mind. This is described in Saundaryala- 
harl( verse 9). To what lengths ' Sakti ' worshippers had gone 
in the worship of Devi by the bahiryaga method would be cleat 
from a passage quoted from the commentary of Laksmidhaia, 
almost the latest among the numerous commentators of the 
Saundaryalaharl, who was horrified by the methods of 
Kaulikas. 1854 

The Setubandba on Nityasodasikarnava is at great pains 
to emphasize that the worship of Tripurasundari is of the 
nature of upasana, and not of the nature of bhaldi and that this 
upasana is of two sorts, one consisting of the recitation of the 
mantra of the Devi and the other consisting of the worship of 
the yantra 1555 ( or cakra ). Verses 126-204 of the NityaSodasi- 
karnava detail the different items in the worship of the Srlcakra. 
The Kifcyasodasika and other Tantrik works say that the great 
Tripurasundari is seated in the Srlcakra 1866 The great aim of 
the Sakta sadliaka is apparently to realize his identity with the 
yantra, the mantra, the guru and TripuradevI The Varsakriya- 
kaumudl quotes averse stating that worship of yantra performed 
with all mantras is commended and by so doing a worshipper 
may secure whatever he desires 1857 

Even a comparatively Eober work like the Saradatilaka 
provides for the drawing up of yantras forwicked purposes. For 
example, in VH. 58-59 it describes an Agneya-yantra to be 
drawn on a garment secured from a pile in a cemetery and 
buried near the house of one's enemy for the latter's destruction.

Yantras for cruel or immoral objects 113S) 

In XXIV. 17-18 and 19-21 two yantras for the destruction of 
an enemy are described. Vide above p 1105 for Prapancasara 
(34. 33 ) providing a yantra for creating passion in a woman and 
making her run to the person practising magic. 

The Tantrarajatantra provides ( 8th Patala, verses 30-32 ) 
that yantras that yield all desired objects should he engraved, 
painted or drawn on pieces of gold, silver or copper or on cloth 
or birch leaf with paste of sandalwood, agalochnm, camphor, 
musk or saffron and should he worn on the head or the arms or 
neck, waist ot wrist or one should worship them after placing 
them somewhere ( on the ground &c. ) ; vide also PrapancasSra- 
tantra XI. 46 for similar provisions. 

At the end of this chapter on Tantrik doctrines and practices 
reference must he made to a remarkable circumstance. The 
SarvadaTsanasamgraha of Sayana-Madhava (14th century A.D.), 
that deals with 15 Darsanas (points of view or philosophical' 
views), has not a word to say about Tantras, though it devotes 
considerable space to the atheistic Garvaka-darsana and the 
unorthodox Bauddha and Jaina systems It is impossible to 
believe that the most learned brothers Sayana and Madhava were 
unaware of the works on Tantra. The silence must be due to 
some special reason. If one may make a conjecture, it appears 
that Tantrik doctrines were discarded for the same reasons that 
induced the Bengal king Ballalasena in his Danasagara to 
exclude the Devlpurana from the authorities on which he meant 
to rely. At the time when Sayana and Madhava flourished 
(about middle of 14th century A. D. ) Tantrik doctrines and 
SnSr com t in *° Sr ea * disrepute. Therefore, Tantrik 

fokn. were probably passed over in silence by' Sayana-

SECTION VII 

CHAPTER XXVIII 

MIMAMSA AND DHARMA^ASTRA 

The Yajfiavalkya-smiti provides that there are fourteen 
sources of vidyas (knowledge) and of Dharma, 1868 viz. Purano, 
Nyaya, MJmamBa, Dharmasastra, Angas (six) and theVedas 
(four). A similar verse is quoted by some as Manu's, but it is 
not found in the extant Manusmrli. It is therefore neoessaTy to 
consider the origin and meaning of the word MImamsa, to set 
out the principal doctrines of that Sastra, to mention the 
important rules of interpretation and the maxims of the 
MImamsa in their application to topics of Dharmasastra and to 
refer to some of the important works of that Sastra together with 
their approximate dates. 

The word mlmrunsa has a great antiquity behind it. The 
Tai. S. VII. 5. 7. I 1869 sayB 'the expounders of Brahma (Veda) 
discuss ( the question ) whether a day should be omitted or not'. 
Here the verbal form 'mlmamsante' is employed in the Bense of 
discussing or investigating a doubtful point and arriving at a 
decision thereon. In another passage of the Tai. S. the same form

treatment. Even before the days of Kahdasa the VidySs had been Has

Antiquity and meaning of word mimamsa 1153 

and another 'mimamseran' aTe used in the same sense. In 
several other places the Tai. S. raises points for discussion with 
the words 'thebrahmavadins discuss' but without employing 
the word mlmamsante or a cognate word. Vide Tai S. II. 5. 3. 7 
( about the deity of sannayya), V. 5. 3. 2, VI. 1. 4. 5., VI. 1. 5. 3-5. 
The Kathaka Sarnhita 1870 puts forward a doubtful point fox 
investigation without the words 'Brahmavadinssay', but with 
the word 'mlmamsante'. The Atharvaveda 1871 states 'men 
separately discussing many times noted on the earth her 
actions'. In another place it employs the words mlrriamsita and 
mimamsamana. TheSankhayana 1872 Br. has 'they discuss the 
question whether one should offer homa after the sun rises or 
hefore the sun rises'. The Tai. Br. employs the word mlmarhsa 
and the Satapatha also in the Kanva recension does so ( vide 
S. B. E. vol. 26 note 1 ). In the Ohandogyopanisad 1S73 it is stated 
that five scholars very learned in the Veda and possessed of large 
houses (wealth) named Praoinasala Aupamanyava and others got 
together and entered upon the consideration of the guestion 
' what is ( the nature of ) our self and what is Brahma ? '. In the 
Tai. Up. occut the words 'this is the investigation into (the 
nature of) Bliss (Brahma)'. In both these passages the word 
mimamsa is used in the sense of 'consideration' (vicaiana)of 
high philosophical topics.' 

Panini provides"" f OT the formation of seven roots with 
san affix (Desiderative), one of which is 'mlmamsate' from

'man* and the Kasika adds that it means ' desire to know i. e. 
investigation and final oonolusion', having in view probably 
the Biitias * Athato dharma-jijnasa' and ' .Athato brahma-iijn3sa\ 

The foregoing brief discussion shows that long before the 
TJpanisads the word 'mlraamsa' had come to mean 'investi- 
gation into a topic of discussion and coming to a conolusion 
thereon '. The same word acquired a restricted sense ( as in the 
verse of Yaj, quoted above ) via. investigation into Dharma and 
arriving at conclusions on doubtful matters by interpretation 
and reasoning. 

Some of the Dharmasutras disolose familiarity with purely 
Mlmamsa terms and principles. For example, Qaut. states 1875 
that an option is allowed only when there is a conflict between 
two texts of equal authority. The Apastamba Dharmasntra ib 
the only Dharmasutra that contains numerous MJmSmsa terms 
and doctrines. It says * a positive Vedio text has more foroe than 
an usage which merely leads to an inference ( of its being based 
on a Vedio text now lost ) '. 187S This is similar to Jaimini 1. 3. 3 
* H there is a conflict ( between an express Vedic text and a smrti 
text) the latter is to be disoarded but if there be no conflict an 
inference may be drawn (that the smrti text is based on soma 
Sruti)*, Ap Bays 'the rules about anadhyUya (stopping Veda 
study on parvan &o. ) are applicable only to learning the Vedio 
mantras and not to their application in sacrifices'. In another 
place Ap. provides 'where activity takes place because of finding 
pleasure therefrom (i.e. from a worldly motive), there is no 
(inference of its being based on) sastra', which is similar to 
Jaimini's rule. For reasons of space other examples of olow 
agreement betwee n Ap.Dh. S.«* and Jaimini are simply referre d

to in the note below and not explained at length. These 
examples show that in Spastamba's day Mimamsa doctrines had 
been far advanced and since he employs the words 'Nyayavit- 
Bamaya'(the siddhanta or doctrine of those who know Nyaya ) 
and 'Nyayavidah', it follows that he ia referring to some work 
on Mimamsa or some author who composed a mlmamsa-sufcra. 
The correspondence in ideas and words between Ap. and the 
Purvamimamsasutra is so close that one is tempted to argue 
that Ap. knew either the extant mlmamsasutra or at least an 
earlier version of it containing almost the same expressions. It 
will not do to say that all the above passages are later inter- 
polations. They have all been commented upon by Haradatta. 

Some Srautasutras such as that of KatySyana contain rules 
of the interpretation of Yedic texts that are similar to Jaimini's 
sutras and sometimes are stated almost in the same words. 1878

The Mahabhasya and Mimamsa 1157 

Farisankhya in VH. 3. 22. The Mahabhasya on IV. 1. 14 
(vartika5) and on IV. 1. 93 (vartika9) gives valuable infor- 
mation viz. a brShmana woman is called 'Kasakrfcsna' if she 
studies the Mimamsa expounded by Kasakrtsni. 1850 This establishes 
that in Patafijali's time a mimamsa work composed by Kasa- 
krtsni was in existence and women were found studying it. It 
is not ceitain what the Kasakrtsni-mlrnamsa contained i. e, 
whether it was like the Furvamlmamsa of Jaimini or it 
was like the Uttaramlmamss(Vedantasutra) or dealt with both 
mimamsa and vedanta, which latter is not unlikely. The V. S. 
mentions the opinion of a teacher Kasakrtsna ( in 1. 4. 22 ), which 
Sankaracarya regards as the final conclusion supported by the 
real import of Sruti. The son of Kasakrtsna might have been 
called Kasakrtsni (PSDini IV. 1. 95). The Vartikas and 
Patafijali are full of the discussion of important matters on which 
the Mimamsa has its own doctrines. In the Vartikas 35 to 59 
onPanini L2. 64 (Sarfipanam-ekasesa ekavibhaktau) there is 
a lengthy dicsussion on the question of the import of words, viz. 
whether it is akrh or vyakh. It is said in Vartika 35 that, 
according to Vajapyayana, akrti is the import of a word, while, 
according to Vyadi ( in Vartika 45 ' dravyabhidbanam Vyadih), 
dravya (or vyakh ) is the import of a word (pada). The Maha- 
bhasya notes that Fanini wrote some sutras ( such as I. 2. 58 
' Jatyakhyayam ' &c) in which he accepted jah as the import of 
words, while in other sutras (such as 1 3. 64 ' sarupananT &e) he

accepted ' dravya ' as the import of words. 1881 It is to be noted 
that, according to Jaimini (I. 3 33 'akrtistu kriySTthatvat) 
akrti is the import of words. On vartika 3 on Pan. IV. 1. %i 
( Samanyacodanastu visesesu) Patafij'ali says that the vidhis 
declared with reference to certain things and objects in general 
really apply to individuals and he gives purely mlmamBa 
examples in this connection as set out in the note. The Vartika- 
kara and Patafijali both use the word ' codana ' ias2 in the Purva- 
mlmamsa sense and give examples which are familiar to us from 
SabarasbhSsya. Among the purposes served by a study of 
grammar, uha (which is the subject of the 9th chapter of PMS) 
is one. ,On Panini 1. 4. 3 Patanjali uses the language of Mimimsa 
' apurva eva vidhirbhavisyati na niyamah. ' 

It appears that the SankarsakSnda was very much neglected 
from early times. There is a conflict of views about its author- 
ship The Nyayaparisuddhi of Venkatanatha (L H. Q. vol. IX. 
at p. 299 ) states that Easakrtsna was the author of the Sankar- 
sakSnda. It appears from Sahara's bhasya that 18S3 that Kanda 
existed in his day and was looked upon by him as Jaimim's 
Work. Sankaraoarya in his bhasya on V. S. III. 3. 43 (pradanavad- 
eva tad-uktam ) mentions the Sankarsa, quotes a sutra therefrom, 
holds that it was known to the Vedantasutra and appears to 
convey that it was a work of Jaimini. EamSnuja also appears 
to hold that Jaimini was the author of 16 chapters (comprising

the twelve called PSrvamlmamsa and the four forming the 
Sankarsa). The Kalpataruparimala of Appayyadlksita on V. S. 
HL 3. 43, while conceding that the Sankarsakanda was under- 
taken foi discussion about deiatas, insists that it is a parisista 
(supplement) of the P. M. S. of twelve chapters consisting as it 
does of discussions on several topics treated in the P.M. S. and 
being of a miscellaneous nature, that it does not begin with nor 
conclude with the discussion about davatas and that its first 
sutra is 'anuyajatlti anuvasatkaras-codyafce'. Since the 
Sankaisakanda has had hardly any influence on Dharmasastra 
works no further reference need be made to it in this work. 188 * 

Later medieval writers look upon the mimamsasastra as the 
most important of vidyasthanas (other than the Vedas), since it 
removes the ignorance, doubts and mistaken notions about the 
sense of several (Vedic) passages, and since all vidyasthanas 
require its aid for the determination of the nature of their real 
meaning. 1685 

In some works like the bhasya of Ramanuja on V. S. and 
the Prapancahrdaya' 836 the Mlmamsasastra is stated to be as one 
whole containing twenty adhyayas{ chapters) and we are told 
that there was a (bhasya) commentary called Krtakoti on the 
whole of it by Bodhayana, that later on a concise commentary was 
composed by TJpavarsa, that Davasvamin wrote a commentary

on 16 chapters and Bhavadssa also composed a commentary on 
Jaimini, but that Sahara wrote a bhasya only on the first 12 chap- 
ters and did not comment on Sankarsa. InlH.Q (vol. 15 pp. 262- 
263 ) reference is made to an inscription of Rajaraja ( 999 A. D. ) 
.which records the gift of certain lands to a learned brahmana who 
was to provide to four pupils board and teaching in several sub- 
jects, one of which is specified as the mlmamsa. of twenty adhyayas. 
These 20 chapters are made up as follows: — 12 chapters (eaoh 
divided into four padas, except chapters III, VI and X, each of 
which has eight padas, in all sixty padas ) ascribed to Jaimini, 
4 chapters called Sankarsakanda and & chapters constituting the 
Vedantasutra. The twelve chapters often called Purvamlmamsa 
make an extensive work containing 915 or about one thousand 
adhikaranas (according to different writers) and about 2700 
sutras, dealing with numerous topics and laying down important 
rules of vedic interpretation. Yaj. (in Z, 3 ) means by MlmamBa 
probably the work of Jaimini in 12 chapters. Many writers 
such as Madhavacarya 18S7 speak of two Mlmamsas, Purva and 
Uttara, respectively comprising the 12 chapters ascribed to 
Jaimini and the four chapters forming the Vedantasutra. 
Sankaracarya refers to the extant Purvanumamsa as Dvada^a- 
laksanl in his bhasya on Vedantasutra IH. 3. 26, as ' Pratimma- 
tantra* in bhasya on V. S. IH. 3. 25. ILL 3. 53 and HI. 4. 27, as 
Prathama-kanda in bhasya on V. S. in. 3. 1, HI. 3. 33, DL 3. 
44, IH. 3. 50, as Franranalaksana in bhasya on V. S. HI. 4. ii. 
On V. S. III. 3. 53 he speaks of the first pada of the P. M S. as 
•Sastrapramukhaevaprathamepade' and thereby conveys that 
he regards that the PMS and VS form one entire sastra. 

Irom here onwards up to note 1890 the discussion is also 
comprised (though a little more briefly) in the present authors 
paper on 'Purvamlmamsa, Brahmasutra &c' contributed to tW> 
Prof. De felicitation volume (pp. 119-139 ).

more personal references (i. e. 32) than the P. M S. (i. e. 27 ). 
In the 2nd place, we find that the Vedantasfitras mention 
Jaimim eleven times and Badarayana nine times, while the 
P. M. 8. names Badarayana and Jaimini only five times each. 
The question arises whether Jaimini and Badarayana were 
contemporaries and, if not, what the relation between the two was. 
Scholars are generally agreed that they were not contemporaries. 
There is a tradition of some antiquity contained in the 
Samavidhanabrahmana 1883 according to which Jaimini was a 
pupil of Parasarya Vyasa. It has been shown above ( p. 857, 
note 1390 ) how the Puranas declare that Vyasa Parasarya, also 
called Krsna Dvaipayana, arranged the one Veda into four and 
imparted the Bgveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda 
respectively to Paila, Vaisampayana, Jaimini and Sumantu. 
In the Mahabbarata Sumanfcu, Jaimini, Vaisampayana, Paila 
are stated along with Suka (the son of Vyasa) to be the pupils 
of Vyasa; vide Sabha 4. 11 and Santiparva 328, 36-27 (cr. ed 
314, 23-81, 29) and 350 11-12 (cr. ed 337. 11-12). In the 
tarparia provided for in the Asvalayanagrhyasfitra (Ut. 4. 4) 
occurs the very interesting passage * Sumantu-Jaimini-Vaisarh- 
payana-Paila-Sutra-bhasya-Bharata— Mahabhatata— Dharma- 
caryah.' The above passages make it clear that several centuries 
before the Christian era Jaimini's was an honoured name and 
connected with the Samadeva Scholars have examined the 
references to Jaimini and Badarayana in the P. M. S. and the 
V. S. Prof. K. A. Nilankauta Sastri in I. A. Vol. 50 pp. 167-174 
on Jaimini and Badarayana arrives at the somewhat startling 
conclusion that there were three Jaiminis. T. E. Chintamani

references about Jaimini must have been made to the same 
person, if two different Jaiminis were intended by the P. M. S, 
(other than its own author) in the five sutras a clear warn 
ing would have been given by the author. As shown below 
a sutra should leave no ambiguity Prof Sastry holds that 
.Jaimini mentioned in VL 3. 4 is different from the Jaimini 
in the other four passages, because Sahara does not employ the 
word acarya for qualifying Jaimini on VI. 3. 4 as he does in the 
four other cases and because the view put forward in VX 3. 4 
appears to be Purvapaksa, while in the four other cases Jaimini's 
view is the siddhanta view of the MSmamsa-sutra. The number 
of sutras in which Jaimini is named is very small (only 5), out 
of which the word acarya is applied to Jaimini by Sahara in 
four places and not so applied in one. This is a very slender 
and inadequate ground for holding that the Jaimini in P. M. S- 
"VX 3. 4 is different from the Jaimini named in four other 
places. The usages of acaryas as to employment of qualifying 
words like 'acarya' or 'bhagavat' to authors mentioned by 
them differ. Kumarila applies no epithet like 'acarya' or 
' bhagavan * to Jamini and in one place 185 ' charges Jaimini 
with composing sutras containing not much substance, 
Tti the sutras in which Jaimini is named in the VS ( viz. in 
I. 2. 28, 1. 2. 31, 1. 3. 31, 1. 4 18, HI. 2. 40, TO. 4. 2, EX 4 18, HI. 
4. 40, IV. 3 12, IV. 4. 5, IV. 4. 11 ) Sankaracarya adds the quali- 
fication 'acarya' in all except on III, 4. 40, although Jaimini 
propounds many propositions not acceptable to Badarayana the 
author of V. S. or to Sankara. In HI. 4. 40, however, 1893 he omits 
the qualification ' acarya ' as regards both Jaimini and Badara- 
yana. Ho one has argued that because the word acarya doe3 not 
qualify Badarayana in HI. 4. 40, the Badarayana in that sutra 
is different from the Badarayana named in other sutras. In 
another place (on V. S IV. 1 17) it may be noted Sankara- 
carya remarks that both Jaimini and Badarayana are in agree- 
ment that certain acts of the kamya type are of no help in

attaining real knowledge of brahma. This shows that according 
to Sankara, Jaimini had treated of how brahma-vidya arises. 
As regards the second reason, it does not clearly or indisputably 
appear that VI 3. 4 is a purvapaksa view. In that adhiharana 
the Purvapaksa is stated in the first sutra 18M viz. as to such 
nitya rites as Agnihotra or Darsapurnamasa a man who can 
carry out all the details in their entirety is alone entitled to 
engage in them. The 2nd sutra states the siddttnta view that, 
as regards mtya acts, it is not absolutely necessary that one 
should be able to perform all details (aiigas) therein; tha third 
sutra only states that smrti declares that it is a fault if the 
principal rite is not performed and therefore the principal rite 
being obligatory must be performed. Then comes the 4th sutra 
in which tha name of Jaimini occurs. Sahara's bhasya on 
this sutra is extremely meagre ( 2£ lines in print) and not 
clear. The Tup-tlka does not comment separately on each 
of the sutras of VI. 3. 1-7, ism it omits the name of Jaimini 
in its explanation and its concluding words on thiB adhikarana 
appear to support the interpretation of the 4th sutra 
advanced by the present author. No one doubts that sutras 
5-7 support the siddhanta view. If VI. 3. 4 were a purva* 
paksa sutra, it is expected that sutra 5 should contain the 
word tu' or 'apiva' in order to indicate that it refutes the

view expressed in sutra 4. What that antra means is that the 
dropping of some anga in the mlya rite does not make that rite 
a different one from the same mlya rite when performed with all 
angas, since the text about its performance (withallanga9or 
with some angas) is one and the same and the vedic instruction 
is that all angas hare to be done ( if possible ). Interpreted thus, 
that sutra is not a pQrvapaksa at all, but only emphasizes the 
siddhanta with additional reasons. The upshot would be that 
Jaimini mentioned five times in PMS is only one person and 
that he is a different person (who had written on P. M.) from 
the reputed author of the extant PMS 

A parallel may be cited. SankarScSrya makes one 
adhikarana of sutras 26-33 of V. S. I. 3 (devatadhikarana) which 
establishes that not only men but gods are qualified to study the 
Vedantasastra and names BadaTayana twice in the same 
adhikarana (in 1. 3. 26 and 33 ) and in I. 3 33 he employs the word 
r tu' because that sutra is a reply to Jaimini's view contained 
in I. 3. 31-33. Similarly, the PMS puts forward the siddhanta 
view in VT. 3. % and names Jaimini in VI. 3. 4 for the same 
purpose. 

Even Prof. Sastry admits that in four out of the five 
references where Jaimini is expressly named, Wb views are the 
siddhanta views. The cases of PMS IK. 2. 3 and XJL J. 59 are 
somewhat remarkable. The adhikarana in both cases consists _ 
of only one sutra, which is the siddhanta view and Jaimini is 
expressly named therein In PMS III 1. 4 Jaimini differs from 
Badari (III. 1. 3) and two more sutras are added to complete 
the adhikarana. In PMS VUL 3. 7 Jaimini's view is opposed 
to that of Badari (VHL 3. 6), is the siddhanta view and there 
is no separate sutra setting forth the view of the autbor of 
the PMS. 

Prom the remarks of Sankaracarya on V. S DX 4 40 
(quoted in note 1890 ) it follows that he regarded Badarayana as 
the author of the Vedantasutra. In V S III. %. 38-39 the Siddhanta 
is stated that the rewards of actions are given by Isvara (God), 
while Jaimini's view is that it is Dharma that gives the rewards 
of actions (III. 3. 40) and in the next sutra (III. 2. 41) it is 
stated that Badarayana holds the former view ( or that the former 
of the two, Isvara and Dharma, gives the reward is the view ol 
Badarayana) Here Badarayana is expressly mentioned as 
holding the same view as that in the Siddhanta«mtra JD, Z. -»»■ 



Jaimini and Badarayana 1165 

The observations of Sankaraoarya in introducing 1893 the last 
sutra of the VS make it perfectly clear that he regarded Badara- 
yana as the author of the entire Vedantasutra. No satisfactory 
explanation is offered why it was necessary to mention Badara- 
yana nine times in the VS when all the 555 sutras thereof are 
deemed to have been composed by Badarayana, or why it was 
necessary to mention in a work containing abont 2700 sutras 
all deemed to be composed by Jaimini, the views of Jaimini five 
times when in all cases or at least in four out of the five cases 
the views are identical with the reputed author of the PMS. 
Only two theories are possible via. to hold that there is no 
explanation or to hold that there were two Jaiminis and two 
Bsdarayanas. 

The problem of the author of the "VS is rather complicated. 
Bbaskara (like Sankara ) holds that Badarayana is the author of 
VS, since he begins his commentary on VS with an obeisance to 
Badarayana who sent forth (into the world) the Brahmasiitra 
that brings about the cessation of the bondage of birth. The 
Paficapadika of Padmapada (a disciple of Sankaraoarya) 
performs ( in the 3nd Introductory verse ) an obeisance to Badara- 
yana. 1S « Ramamija, on the other hand, makes confusing 
statements. In the 2nd verse of his introduction to 
the&lbhasyaw® on VS he calls upon all good men to drink 

tt o n !of! ik f W0Tds oi Pal56aTya . out in his bhasya on VS

of Ramanuja, ascribes the VS to Badarayana. In spite of 
Sankaracarya, Vacaspati-niisra, author of the famous Bhamatl 
on 18 « Sankaracarya's bhasya on VS, makes an obeisance to 
Vedavyasa, the author of Brahmasutra The Farasara- 
madhavlya is in two minds, in rol I part I pp. 52, 97, vol. II. 
part 2 pp. 3 and 275 Badarayana is said to be the author of the 
VS, but in a few other places VS is spoken of as Vyasasfitra 
( vol. I. parti 1, pp.56, 113). The above conflict of testimony 
gives rise to the important question whether Badarayana, the 
supposed author of the Vedantasutras, is identical with Veda- 
vyasa or is different from him Sankaracarya's bhasya pointB 
to the conclusion that in his opinion at least they are different. 1898 
For example, on V. S. I. 3. 29 he quotes a verse of Vedavyssa in 
support of the proposition of the VS that the Veda is eternal. 
On VS II. 3. 47, in support of the proposition that, though the 
individual bouI is an amsa of the Supreme Self, the latter is not 
at all affected by the suffering of the individual soul, Sankara 
quotes two verses as smrti from the Mahabharata. This makes 
it clear that, if the author of the VS was identical with Veda- 
vyssa, the author of the Mahabharata, Sankaracarya would not 
have cited the latter as an independent smrti source supporting 
the former or would at least have used some such language as 
'this very author has said elsewhere that* &c. The same 
reasoning would apply to Sankaracarya's comments. If that 
great Scarya was of the opinion that the author of the VS was 
the same as that of the Mahabharata and the GIta he would not 
have cited passages from the Epic and the G-ItS as Smrfcis 
supporting the reasoning of the VS. 

If it were contended that there is only one Jaimini (and 
not two, much less three ) a serious difficulty arises. Why Bhould 
the author of PMS ( containing about 2700 sutras ) refer to him- 
self by name in five places only. The usual explanation offered

would be of no avail as to Jaimini, since it cannot besam that the

bis fame. Another explanation that ancient authors tften refer to 
SeLlvesintheardpersonwillnotdomyshonldthean&orJ 

about 2700 sutras choose five places only for referring to himself. 
Therefore, one is compelled to hold that, if Jaimini isthe author 
of the extant PMS and mentions the views of Jaimini fivetimes 
only, there was a predecessor and namesake of his called Jamim 
who had expressed his view3 in a different work. 

There are eleven sutras in the VS in which the views of 
Jaimini are referred to. Tbey are ( as stated above ) YS I. 2. 28 
and 31, I 3. 31, 1 4 18, III. 2. 40, III. 4. 2, HI. 4 18, HI. 4. 40, 
IV 3 13 IV 4. 5, IV. 4. 11. Out of these eleven there are six 
references to Jaimini (vie L 3. 28, 1 2. 31, 1. 4. 18, IV. 3 12, 
IV. 4. 5, IV. 4. 11) for which no corresponding adhikarana or 
sutra in the PMS can be pointed out, while sutras III. 2 40, 
m. 4. 2, m. 4. 18 attribute views to Jaimini, which are well- 
known doctrines of the PMS. VS I. 3. 31 corresponds to PMS 
VI. 1. 5 and on HI. 4. 40 (quoted in note 1890 above) Jaimini 
and VS agree. Therefore, it appears that the Jaimini who 
expresses views on purely Vedantic topics and whose views are 
not found in PMS composed a work on Yedanta. 

There are in VS nine sutras in which Badarayana is named 
viz. in VS I 3, 26 and 33 (Badarayana being twice named 
in the same adlnfiararta as opposed to Jaimini ), IIX 2. 41, III. 
4. 1, in. 4. 8, HI. 4. 19, IV. 3. 15, IV. 4. 7, IV. 4. 12. It may be 
noted that in all these cases ( except in IV 3 15 ) the views 
ascribed to Badarayana are opposed to those of Jaimini or are 
slightly different (only VS IV. 4. 7 and IV. 4. 12). Prof. 
STilakanta Sastri thinks that all the views mentioned as 
Badarayana's are the views of the author of the VS who employs

(be third person for himself as ancient authors do ( I. A. vol. 50 
at p. 169 ). This does not afford a satisfactory explanation of 
tho question why it was necessary to invoke BadarSyana's name 
in nino cases only for buttressing up the position of the author 
of tho VS (that has 555 sutras). If the author of the VS and 
Badarayana named nine times are identical, tho name of 
Badarayana should ordinarily appear towards the end of tbe 
adhiliai ana and not in tho middle. Two examples may be cited 
here to illustrate how VS deals with references to Badarayana. 
In lir. 2 38-41 (which is one adlnkarana) the siddhanla view iB 
first stated with reasons in III. 2. 38-39, then Jaimini's view 
is cited (III. 4. 40) and thon Badarayana is mentioned as 
agreeing with tho view first put forth ' purvam tu Badarayano 
hetuvyapadesat), the difference being that the siddhanta is based 
upon 'upapatti' while Badarayana relies upon 'hetuvyapadesa' 
( in sruti and smrti ). This shows that different reasons were 
assigned by the author of VS and by BadaTayana for the same 
proposition. VS. III. 4. 18-20 form one adhilcarana about sannyusa, 
Jaimini starts the purvapaksa that the Chan Up. ( U. 23. 1 ' trayo 
dharmaskandhah'} only makes a passing reference to the asramas, 
there is no vidhi ( injunction ) in that text and there is no 
exposition also. Then Badarayana's view is cited 'anustheyam 
Badarayanahsumyasruteh' i e. sannyusa should be resorted to 
just as one resorts to the householder's stage. Then cornea 
the view of the author of the VS that there is a vidhi of 
sannyusa in that text. If Badarayana and the author of VS 
be held identical, why was it necessary to add tbe sufaa 
•vidhirva dbaranavaf (VSJIL 4. 20) after stating Badarayana s 
view ? It would be also noticed that the reasons given in the 
two sutras differ. In VS IV. 4. 10-14 first the views of Badari 
and Jaimini on Chan. Up. VIII 2. 1, 5 are set out, then Badara- 
yana's view is set forth (in IV 4. 12 ) and then two more sutras 
are added by the author of VS Therefore, these illustrations 
show that, though the final conclusion of Badarayana and toe 
author of VS is the same, the language and the reasons are 
different, and that Badarayana named in the VS was a 
predecessor of the author of the extant VS that had composed a 
workonVedanta, whom the author of the VS strengthens with 
reasons of his own. 

In Panini's time there were mendicant ^"gjjjj) 
who studied the « Bhiksusutra of Parasarya or the BhiksusuK 
rf Karmanda' and were designated 'Parasannah «* 



Bhiksusvii as of Parasarya and Karmanda 1169 

'Karmandinah'. 1901 ATmiksu represents the order of Sannyasa. 
Therefore, a Bhiksusutra must have had as its subject sannyasa, 
the time for it, the rules of the order, the final goal to be attained 
and so on. The Br. TJp (IH. 5. 1 and IV. i. 22) emphasizes 
that those who realize bi ahma give up all desires and practise 
begging. The Gautama-dharmasutra 1902 says the same thing. 
No trace is found of the Bhiksusutra of Karmanda. But it is 
possible to say that the Bhiksusutra propounded by Parasarya 
must have been somewhat like the extant Brahmasutra or one 
of its predecessors. This would be the earliest reference to a 
sutra by Parasarya on the sannyasasrama. The date of Panini 
is not beyond dispute. But no modern scholar would place him 
after 300 B. O. The present writer would place him as early as 
at least 500 or 600 B. O. The result would be that the Bhiksu- 
sutra of Parasarya named by Panini would have to be placed 
at some time between 400 B. G. to 700 B. O. Further light is 
shed by Vartika 1903 (1) on Panini IV. 1 97, from which 
it follows that Vyasa's 'apatya' (son) was called Vaiyasaki, that 
is Suka (according to the Mahabhasya). Badarayana is foxmed 
from Badara which is a word in the Nadadi-gana ( consisting 
of about 76 words), according to Panini IV. 1. 99 ( Nadadibhyah 
phak), Badari being the son of Badara, Badarayana being the 
grandson (or a remoter male descendant) of Badara. At some 
period Vyasa and Badarayana came to be confounded and Suka, 
who was the son of Vyasa according to the Vartika and the 
Mahabhasya, came to be called Badarayani ( son of Badarayana) 
as shown by the Bhagavatapurana (HL5.8 where Suka is said 
to be BhagavanBsdarayamh'). It appears that from the 9th 
century A. D. Badarayana came to be confounded with Vyasa 
Parasarya.

1170 History of Dharmaiastra [Sec.VH.GhXXVIH 

A brief examination of the citation of the views of Badara- 
yana and Jaimini in the PMS and the Brahmasutra 1904 is 
necessary. Badarayana is named only five times by the P. M. 
sutra as said above. (1) In P. M. S. 1. 1. 5 the author claims 
that he and Badarayana are agreed on the eternity and infalli- 
bility of the Veda; (2) In P. M. S. V. 2. 17-20, there is a 
discussion on Kaksatresti. In the model sacrifice there are 
certain homas called Naristha; the question is whether in the 
modifications of the model wherein certain subordinate homas 
colled upahomas are prescribed, the Naristha homas precede or 
follow the ITpahomas. The siddhanta view is that Earisthahomas 
precede, Atreya being of the opposite view and Badarayana 
supporting the siddhanta. (3) In P. M. S. VI. 1. 8 Badarayana's 
view is that not men alone but women also are entitled to take 
part in Jcratus ( Vedic sacrifices) and this is the siddhanta of the 
P. M. S. ; ( 4 ) P. M. S. X. 8. 35-46 make an extensive adhtkaram 
in which the question is whether the texts prescribing iLgneya 
and Aindragna put odasus in DarsapurnamSsa for a sacrifice! 
who has not performed soma sacrifice constitute a vidhi ( of the 
two ) or only an anuvada, Badarayana's view in PMS. X. 8. 44 
being that its is a vidhi and the siddhanta being that there is an 
anuvada ( X. 8. 45 ). ( 5 ) PMS XL 1. 54-67 constitute a lengthy 
adhikarana and the discussion concerns the question whether 
agHara and other angas are to be repeated with each of the 
principal matters ( Agneya and others) in Darsapurnamasa or 
are to be performed only once. 

With regard to these five cases where Badarayana is cited 
in the P. M. S. three points emerge, viz the author of the P. M. S. 
agrees with Badarayana's view in all exoept in X. 8 44 (whore 
the two differ), that the view attributed to Badarayana in 
P. M. S. 1 1, 5 has correspondence with the views of the V. S. 
(1.3.28-29) and that four views out of five refer to purely 
saorifioial matters to which nothing corresponds in the V. S It 
follows that the author of the extant P. M. S had some work ot 
Badarayana dealing with P&rvamlmamsa matters before him 
and that, if Badarayana be the author of the extant V. S. , the 
latter had composed a work on Purvamlmamsa matters also or 
that there was another Badarayana who wrote only on Purva- 



1904. Prof. Nilakant Sastry's paper referred to above is valuable, but 
several of his cor.clns.oiis set out oo p. 172 ot I. A. vol. 50 «■»»«» 
accepted by the present wnter, who regrets that Prof Sastry drf not consider 
much other matter relevant to the points discussed by him. 



Jaimmi and BMarUycma 1171 

mlmamsa. The five references to Jaimini in P. M, S. have been 
noted above and the sutra "71. 3. 4, which led Prof Sastry to 
postulate three Jaiminis, has been already explained as not 
necessarily leading to any such conclusion. 

Another alternative might be put f OTward viz. that works" 
by Jaimini and Badarayana did not exist before the extant 
y. S. and PIS, but that the references to Jaimini and 
Badarayana concern views ourrent in the schools of Jaimini and 
Badarayana But this is not a likely hypothesis The extant 
"V. S and P M S are meant for all throughout Aryavarta and 
it is not likely that the oral traditions of two schools Weie 
supposed to be known to all and sundry in the whole of the 
country. 

In several cases where Badarayana is mentioned, the extant 
V. S makes certain additions and explanations. It has been 
Bhown above that Sankaracarya, Bhaskara and Yamuna ascribe 
the V S to Badarayana and that Vaoaspati and others hold that 
Vyasa Paiasarya is the author of V, & It is difficult to explain 
how Vedavyasa came to be identified with Badarayana after 
the 9th century A. D. Some other relevant matters have also 
to be considered A verse about kselra and ksetmjna in the 
Bhagavadglfca raises a problem. In Glta "K 13, 4 it is said ' this

real nature of ksetra and ksetrajna has been separately sung 
( i. e. propounded ) in many ways by the sages in different vedio 
hymns (or metres) and by the words of the Brahmasutra that 
are full of reasoning and that arrive at definite conclusions'. 
Here the Glta expressly mentions Brahmasutra. If one turns 
to the extant Brahmasutra (or Vedantasutra), it is found that 
in many sutras reliance is placed on smrti, which is taken to 
mean the Glta by all Scaryas. For example, on 'Smrtisca' 
( V. S. I 2 6 ) the only Smrti passages cited by SankaracSrya are 
Glta 18. 61 and 13 2. Similarly, on ' api ca smaryate ' (V S. 
I. 3 23) SankaTa cites only Glta 15. 6 and 12; on 'api ca 
smaryate' (V S. II. 3.45) the only Smrti passage quoted by 
Sankara is Gita 15 7, on ' Smaranti ca ' (V. S. IV. L 10) only 
Glta 6. 11 is quoted; on 'Yoginah prati ca smaryate smarts 
caite' (V S. IV 2 21) Glta 8 24-25 alone are set forth as the 
passages meant to be explained. Therefore, though the Bhagavad- 
glta is not expressly named in the Brahmasutra, the acaryas 
are agreed that the Bhagavadglta alone is relied upon and 
referred to in all the above-mentioned sutras Vfe have, therefore 
reached this position that the Glta mentions the Brahmasutra 
which must be held to be earlier than the Glta, but as Glta 
passages are declared to be at the basis of some of the Vedsnta- 
sutras, the Glta must be earlier than the V. S. This is contradi- 
ctory , Sankaracary a, im who saw the contradiction, therefore 
explained 'Brahmasutrapadaih' as passages (of Upanisads) that 
suggest (i. e. propound) doctrines about brabma (i. e. he 
interprets 'sutra' as meaning 'sucaka'). But this explanation 
is far-fetched and has not been accepted by other commentators. 
Therefore, other theories have to be put forward viz. that the 
author of both is the same or that the Mahabharata and Glta 
were receiving accretions from time to time and that when the 

( Continued from last page ) 
that the author who composed the extant BrahmasStra redacted the original 
Mahabharata and Glta and gave them both the present form. The present 
miter regrets that he cannot accept this surm.se of the late Lokamanya « 
may be pouted out that Prof R D bmwtarm (ABORIvo! Ill »» 
79) did not accept Lokamanya's explanation of • Brahmasutrapadaih an 
held that in Glta 13. 4 the word •Brahmasutrapada.il- does not refer 
the Badarayana sutras but refers to some similar other works. But he 
not pursue that matter further. ^

final redaction of the Mahabharata (including the Gita) was 
made the verse about Brahmasutra was inserted m the Gita . m 
tbatintbe times of the Gita there were several works called 
Brahmasutra other than the extant one. 

The present writer thinks it highly probable that the Gita, 
had before it several woiks called Brahmasutxas and in 13.4 
refers to them and not to the extant Brahmasutra of Badarayana. 
A brief examination of the authors mentioned in the PMS and 
VS is necessary. Both these works mention by name several 
individual authors (besides Jaimini and Badarayana). Both 
PMS and VS mention the following:— 
Miega-TMS IV. 3. 18, V. 2. 18, VI 1. 26 and VS III. 4 44 , 
Aimarallw -PMS VL 5. 16 and VS 1. 2. 29, 1. 4. 20 ; 
Kwsnajini -PMS IV. 3. 17, VI. 7. 35 and VS 111. 1. 9. 
Badai % - PMS III. 1. 3, VL 1. 27, VUL 3. 6, IS. 2. 33 and VS. I. 

2. 30, HI. 1. 11, IV. 3. 7, IV. 4. 10 ; 
PMS also names Slekhana (VI. 5. 17), Aitisayana (IH. 2. 44, 
m. 4. 24, VI 1. 6), Kamukayana (XI 1. 58 and 63) and Lavu- 
ksyana (VI. 7. 37), these being not mentioned at all in the VS. 
On the other hand VS mentions Audulomi ( I. 4. 21, HI. 4. 45, 
IV. 4. 6 ) and Kasakrtsna (I 4. 22 ), both being absent from PMS. 
The PMS very rarely refers to some acaryas as 'eke' in 1. 1. 27 
and IX. 3. 4 ; V. S. has ' eke' in I. 4 9 and 18, II 3. 43, PH. 2. 2. 
and 13, HI. 4. 15, IV. 2 13 and ' ekesam' in I 4. 13, IV. 1. 17, 
IV 2. 13 and 'anye' in HI 3. 27, in all of which the reference 
in V. S. is to other recensions of the Veda or Upanisads, while 
in III. 4 42 ' eke' refers to acaryah and in IH 3. 53 'eke' refers 
to lokayatikas. Vyasa or Parasarya is not mentioned by name 
in PMS or VS. The case of Badari requires caTeful considera- 
tion. The PMS mentions both BadaTSyana and Jaimini only 
five times each, while PMS and VS mention (each) Badari four 
times Badari differs from Jaimini on two important points 
viz. the denotation of the word ' sesa' and the remarkable view 
that even sudras are entitled to perform agmhotra and other 
Vedic rites. In VS. Badari is mentioned as differing from 
Jaimini on the upasana of Vaisvanara in Chan Up. V. 18. 1-2 
and on the words 'sa enanbrahma gamayati' (Chan. Up IV. 
15. 5 ) and in VS IV. 4. 10 Badari is opposed to Jaimini about 
a released soul. It follows from this brief analysis and the 
mention of Badari four times in PMS and also in VS that both 
the latter had before them a work of Badari dealing with Purva- 



1174 History of Dharmaiastra lSec.Vli,Ch.XXvTd: 

mlmamsa matters and also with Vedanta. Alekhana and Asma- 
rathya are both quoted at least 16 times in Ap. Sr. Sutra, their 
views are quoted frequently as in conflict on the ritual of sacrifices 
and these aTe the only two individual authors quoted in Ap. Sr. S. 
It is likely that Atreya, -S.smaratb.ya and Karsnajini composed 
a work or works dealing with both systems and Audulomi 
(quoted thrice by VS) and Kasakrtsna composed works on the 
Vedanta Vide Tantravartika on I 3. 2 p, 169 note 2010 for the 
view that the present PMS was preceded by several efforts in 
the same direction. 

From the above discussion it may very plausibly be held 
that the word 'Brahmasutrapadaih' in Glta 13. & refers to some 
sutra works such as those of Badari, Audulomi, Asmarathya and 
one or two others and not to the extant Brahniasutra. No one 
can say that Badari and Atreya are not 'rsis*. Sahara refers to 
Atreya as ' Muni' on PMS Yl. I. 36. 

It should be remembered that Jaimini, Badari and Badara- 
yana are gotra names. But Vyasa is not a gotra name 
and Parasarya is one of the three pravaras of the group of 
PaTasaras. 1907 

The Ap. Sr. Sutra 24. 8. 10 (ed. by GaAe) and the Pravara- 
manjarl (ed. by Chentsalrav, Mysore, 1900) p. 61 mention 
Badarayana as a sub-section of Visnuvrddhagotra, while p. 38 of 
the latter' work mentions Jaimini along with Yaska, Vadhula, 
Mauna and others as having the pravara 'Bhargava-vaitahavya- 
savataseti 1 and pp. 108 and 178 cite Badari (or Vadari) as a 
sub-division of Parasaras. Therefore, it was possible i a» 
several individuals separated by a century or more could bear 
the name of Jaimini or Badarayana. 

We have also to answer the observations of the Naiskarmya- 
siddhi of Snresvaracarya (the most famous of the disciples oi 
Sankaracarya himself) that Jaimini does not mean that a" 
passages of the Veda relate to sacrificial rites and that it » 
really meant that, he would not have composed ' Sarlrakasatta 
beginning with 'athato brahma-jijnasa' and ^nmadya^a 
ySTcontaining an investigation of the purport of all VWtog 
passages, laying bare the nature of brahma and *&?***£ 
words w ith profound reasoning ; but that as a matferoffact^ 



NaisJcarmyastddM on SSarirakasutra H? 5 

did compose such a sarfrakasastra. This passage means that 
Jaunini composed a rifea work called Sarfrafcasutra on the 
litigation and knowledge of brahma, which begar , wn* two 
sStras that were the same as the first two sutaas «*»»«*?* 
Vadantasfltra.^ Col. Jacob in his Introduction (p 3) to the 
first edition of the Naiskarmyasiddhi thought thatthe tfaiskar- 
myasiddhi made Jaimini the author of the Vedantadarsana. 
He is inaccurate, since all that Suresvara says is that Jaimim 
composed not only a sutra work on the Karmamimamsa but he 
also composed a work called Sarlrakasutra on the doctrines of 
brahmamimamsa, but he does not convey that the whole of the 
extant Vedantasutra is the work of Jaimini. "Dr. Belvalkar **» 
postulates two propositions, viz. that there were brahmasutras 
written separately for the Chandogya Upanisad and the Brhad- 
aranyaka-Upanisad and other Upanisads for each Sakha and 
secondly, that tbe Sarlrakasutra of Jaimini was bodily incorpo- 
rated within and forms the main part of tb.8 contents of the 
present text of the Brahmasfitra. The present author takes strong 
objections to both these propositions. He cannot go into this 
question at length here but has to remark that these propositions 
are based on little evidence. If 'janmadyasyayatah' was also 
a sutra of Jaimini who was specially connected with the Sama- 
veda by the Mahabharata and Puranas, why is it that that sutra 
is supposed by the btasyakaras aa baaed on a passage of the 
Taittirlya-upanisad? The Chandogya and Brhadaranyaka Upa- 
nisads are each nearly thrice as long as all the other eight Upa- 
nisads (out of the principal ten Upanisads ) and six times longer 
than the Taitfcirtya Upanisad. Therefore, these two Upanisads 
figure largely in the discussions in the extant Brahmasfitra. 
The 2nd proposition is hardly more than a pure guess. There is 
no evidence to establish that the main part of the extant Vedanta- 
sutra is bodily taken from Jaimini's Sarlrakasutra, when tbe 
latter has not come down to us and when no sutras therefrom

(other than the two noted above) are quoted anywhere as from 
Jaimini's S&rlrakasutra. 

Then some sutras of VS in which the words 'tad-uktam' 19I ° 
occur have to be considered. There are eight sutras that contain 
those words. Sankaracarya holds that in VS I 3. 21, II. 1. 31, 
III. 3.18 (where 'tad uktam* occur) the reference is to the 
preceding 3fltras of the VS itself. On V S. III. 3. 26, HI. 3. 33, 
IIL 3. 50 and III 4 42 Sankaracarya holds that these respectively 
refer to PMS X 8. 15, III. 3. 8, XI. 4 10 and I. 3. 8-9 and that 
VS IH. 3. 43 refers to a sutra of the Sankarsakanda. The other 
Scaryas differ from Sankaracarya in several places and among 
themselves VallabhScarya, who had come to regard the Bhaga- 
vata as of equal authority with the Veda and as even supersed- 
ing the latter, holds that the words ' tad-uktam ' in VS HX 3. 33, 
HI. 3 50 and HI. 4. 42. refer to passages of the Bhagavatapurana. 
The VS Id. 3. 44 appears to echo the words and principles of 
PMS III. 3.14. mi The words 'tad-uktam' should ordinarily 
mean the same thing throughout i. e. they should everywhere be 
taken as referring to the PMS or to VS. But no Scarya is 
prepared to accept entirely one of these two alternatives. It 
may further be noted that the extant P. M. S. very rarely 
employs the words ' tad-uktam ' as in V. 3. 9 where it refers to 
PMS V. 1 19. 1Ma The P. M. S.,' though it mentions BSdarayana 
five times, nowhere appears to be influenced by the V S On 
the other hand, not only are some of the sutras of V. S. contain- 
ing the words ' Tad-uktam' deemed to be references to the P. M. 
Sutras, but the V. S frequently employs peculiar Purvamlmamsa 
words such as artbavada, prakarana, linga, vidhi, SBsa and 
purely P. M. matters such as in HI 3 26 (kusachandastutyupa- 
gSnavat), III. 3. 33 (aupasadavat), in. 4. 20 (dharanavat), IV. 
4.12 (Dvadasahavat). Therefore, the extant VS very muoh 
presupposes the P. M. S., while the latter cannot be said to have 
been influenced by VS to any noticeable extent. 

The present author now wishes to draw together the separate 
threads that have been spun so far about Vyasa, JaimiW,

Conclusions about Jaimim, Vyasa and Badm ayaqa 1177 

Badarayana, the PMS and the VS and tries to present a tenta- 
tive pattern of conclusions as follows: — 

1. The Mahabharata and some PurSnas state that Jaimim 
■was a pupil of Parasarya Vyasa. But this is said in relation to 
the transmission of the Samaveda to Jaimini and therefore 
must be confined to that matter alone ( and not extended to other 
matters) in accordance with the rnlmamsa maxim -' yavad- 
vacanam vacanikam.' We have got a Jaiminlya Brahmana, 
a Jaiminlya Srauta-sutra and Grhya-sutra. The tradition about 
the imparting of Samaveda to Jaimini may be true and at 
present there is no evidence to show that it is wrong. There is, 
however, no warrant for extending this tradition to the Teputed 
authors of the PMS and the VS. Late medieval writers like 
Vallabhacarya, whose weakest points were lack of correct know- 
ledge of history and chronology and the obsession to glorify to 
the skies their favourite authors and works, extended the above 
tradition about the Samaveda to the authors of the two sutra 
works,* 9 " V i z . p^g and VS. From the above discussion it follows 
that the extant PMS is earlier than the extant VS and that the 
author of the extant PMS could not have been a disciple of the 
author of the extant VS. The medieval writers failed to pay 
proper attention to the fact that Jaimini and Badarayana are 
also gotra names and not merely individual names. 

2. Brom Panini we know that there were two blukm-sulras 
composed by Parasarya and Karmanda before his time. Patafi- 
jali mentions a rnlmamsa work composed by KaSakrtsna. There 
is, therefore no doubt that sutra works on 'bhiksus' and

extant VS shows special respect for Jaimini's views, since he 
quotes Jaimini more times than other acaryas (including 
Badarayana). It becomes necessary to hold that there were 
two authors named Jaimini, one dealing with both PM and 
Vedanta subjects and the other deemed to he the author of the 
extant PMS. This Jaimini is different from Jaimini deemed to 
be the author of the extant PMS. 

4. The fact that PMS mentions five times Badarayana'B 
views, four of which are concerned with purely sacrificial 
matters and the fact that the VS mentions BadaTayana nine 
times in connection with Vedanta matters, leads to the inference 
that Badarayana must have composed a work dealing with PM 
and Vedanta topics. That work has not come down to us. 
This Badarayana is different from the Badarayana regarded by 
Sankaracarya and others as the author of the extant VS. Thus 
there are two authors named Badarayana. 

5. The author of the extant VS was, according to Sankara- 
carya, Bhaskara and some other early bhasyakaras, also 
BSdarSyana, but from about the 9 th century A. D, onwards ha 
came to be confounded with VedavySsa. 

6. So far as the PMS and VS are concerned, there are only 
two Jahninis ( and not three, as Prof. Sastry holds in I A. vol. 50 
p. 172) and two Badarayanas. 

The present section i*b concerned mainly with the influence 
of ParvamlmamsS doctrines and methodology on Dbarma&sto 
works. But it must be mentioned here that Purvamlmamsa 
works from that of Jaimini onwards also rely upon smrtis and 
Dharmasastra. A few examples may be cited. The PMS U 
deals with the limits of the authoritativeness of smrtis, PMS y. 
7. 6 mentions the word ' Dharmasastra'. The P. M. S. expressly 
relies on smrti in support of its propositions (asm XU. 4. taj. 
On PMS VI 1. 13 Sahara quotes a smrti verse, which is alma* 
the same as Manu VJII. 416 and Adiparva (83. 33=Cr. Ed. 77. W- 
Sahara frequently quotes Dharmasutras and metrical smrta .w 
elucidate and strengthen his arguments; e.g. Sabara .on r*

examples to support the proposition stated above. Those inter- 
ested may consult the present author's paper on "Gleanings 
from Sahara and the Tantravartika* JBBRAS vol. 26 (old series, 
1924) pp. 83-98 and on 'Tantravartika and Dharmasastra ' in 
JBBRAS, New series, vol. 1 and 2 for 1925 (pp 95-102 ). 

We must now turn to the Purvamimamsasutra itself. In 
relation to every sastra there are what are called four anubandkas 
(indispensable elements) 191s viz. Vtsaya (the subject to be 
treated of), prayojar.a (the purpose or object), sambandlta (the 
relation of the sastra to the prayojana) and adhikann ( the person 
entitled or competent to study the sastra). The Slokavartika 1916 
remarks 'as long as the purpose of any sastra or of any under- 
taking (or act) whatever is not declared, so long no one will 
take it ( i. e. study or do it) ' Therefore, the very first sutra of 
the PMS puts forward the subject (visaya) and the purpose of 
the sastra (prayojana). 1917 That sutra states ' next, therefore, 
( should be undertaken ) the investigation and consideration of 
dharma'. The sambandha of this sastra with the prayojana is 
that of sadhya (the object to be attained) and sadliana (the 
means of attaining) i.e. this sastra is the means of attaining 
the knowledge of dharma. Therefore, as remarked by the Sastra-

dlpika (on P M. S. II. 1. 1), the proper subject of this sSstra is 
Dharma and not the meaning of the Veda (tasm2d dharma 
ityeva sastravisayo na vedSrtha iti ). The wlhikwin is one who 
has studied the Veda or a part of it from a guru and is treated 
of at length in the 6th chapter of the P. M. S. 

The MfmSmsasutra does not state how much of the Veda 
has to be studied before one enters on understanding the mean- 
ing of it. Here the Smrtis come to one's help. Gautama II, 
51-53 prescribes several options viz. twelve years for one Veda 
or 12 years for each of the four vedas or so long as ho can 
commit to memory (one Veda). Manu HI. 1-2 are similar viz, 
one should study vedas for 36 years under a guru or tor 18 years 
or nine years or for as many years as would be reguirod for 
committing Veda to memory and they permit the option of 
studying the three Vedas or two Vedas or one Veda Y3j, 1. 3G 
remarks that Vedic studenthood lasts 18 years for each Veda or 
five (for each Veda) or some sages say for as many years as the 
student would require to master (one Veda or moral. But even 
these prescriptions must have been rather a tall order for many 
brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas. Further, the MImsmsa 
requires that not only should a person of the three varms 
(classes) study the Veda but he must also engage in understand- 
ing its meaning. On PMS 1. 1. 1 Sahara states that the vener- 
able YajBikas do not MW declare that rewards result from the 
mere study (memorizing) of the Veda and that where the Vedic 
texts appear to assign a reward for the mere memorizing of Veda 
they are merely arthavadas ( intended only to praise Veda study )i 
as inTai. A.r.11.15 which states 19 ' 9 'whatever (vedic texts abouta), 
sacrifice he memorizes the result is that he, aa it were actually 
performs that, and he secures absorption into (or communion 
with) Agni, Vayu, Surya. The Tai. Up. I 9 attaches the 
greatest importance to svad/ij/aj/a (memorizing the Veda) ana 
pravacana (teaching it or expounding it) and after stating the 
views of two sages cites the view of Naka Maudgalya that 
evadhyaya and pravacana are the most important to be reaorto 
to or striven for, though rta, satya, dama, sama, agnihotra, 
hospitality and others may be combined with tbem, the reason

Sam much of the Veda to be studied 1181 

being that those two constitute lapas.' The PMS in IIL 8.18 
(jfiate ca vacanam na hy-avidvan vihitossti) provides that only 
he who knowB the Veda has adhikara for performing sacrifices. 
Sahara 1 ' 30 raises the question how much of the Veda must a 
man know in order to be entitled to perform a vedio sacrifice 
and replies that he must have memorized as much of the veda as 
would enable him to carry to its completion the vedic sacrifice 
undertaken by him. The TantravSrtika on the same sutra 
adds that the whole veda is to be studied during the period of 
studenthood, but if anyone is unable to memorize the whole 
voda, but somehow only the portion on Agnihotra and DaTsa- 
purnamSsa, then it cannot be said that he has no adhikara for 
performing those two. To memorize the Veda and also to study 
its meaning was a formidable task. Many verses of the Veda

yajfia), with reference to the deities (adhidaivataoradhidaiva) 
and adhyatma (with reference to the spiritual or metaphysical 
meaning ). Vide Nir. IH. 13 ( where Rg. 1 164. 21 is explained

lays down the japo (muttering) of Veda of the adhiyajna

matters viz. first memorizing it, reflection over it, constant re- 
petition of it, japa and imparting it to pupils. These were ideals 
attained by a few persons only, while most brahmanas generally 
rested content with memoriznig one "Veda or a portion of it. 

The Purvamimgrnsasastra is the most extensive of all the 
darsanas. 19J3 Sastra is that which regulates and declares 
( human ) activities and abstentions by means of eternal words 
( Veda ) or by works composed by men. 1924 And it has about 2700 
sutras and over 900 adhikaranas ( called nyayas or conclusions 
on topics for discussion). Some sutras are of ten repeated such 
as ' Lingadarsanac ca' (which occurs about 30 times) and'tatha 
canyarthadarsanam ' ( that occurs about 24 times ). An adhi- 
karana is described as having five constituents, viz (l)the 
topic for discussion, (2) the doubt about it, (3) the prima facte 
view, (4) the refutation of the prima facie view, (5) the final 
conclusion. 1925 A sutra (aphorism) should be concise 1 ' 26 
( contain a few letters ), but clear in its meaning, substantial, 
of wide application (lit. facing all directions), should be without 
pauses or interjected letters and should be faultless. A bhasya 
is that which sets out the meaning of the sutra in sentences that 
follow the words of the sfitra and that makes its own contribu- 
tion (to the elucidation of the subject of the sutra), while a 
vartika is one that considers what is stated in the sutra, or what

is omitted or what is not well stated. 1927 The Kavya-mttnamsS 
of Ksjasekhara defines the words sutra, bhasya, vrtti, tika, 
karika &c. in chap. H. 

Having deolaied in the first suto-a that after a person has 
studied the Veda and because he has done so, PMS proceeds 
to say that he should start on the consideration of what 
dharma 1928 is. The 2nd sutra, therefore, defines 'dharma 
as an act conducive to a man's highest good, that is chara- 
cterized by an exhortative (vedic) text.' Sahara explains that 
'codana' means a sentence that urges or exhorts a person 
to do an act. So this conveys that the means of knowledge 
(pramana) as regards dharma are vedic sentences and it 
also means that what is characterized or indicated by codana is 
dharma i. e. the nature (svarnpa) of Dharma is made manifest. 
The word 'artha' is put in to exclude acts (from being design- 
ated dharma) that may be mentioned in the veda hut the result 
of doing which is evil, such as the sentence 'one practising 
black magic ( to harm a person ) may perform the tiyena sacrifice.' 
This is not dharma, but adharma, since the practice of black 
magic is condemned as sinful. This vedic sentence does not 
say that one should inflict injury, it only says that syenayaga 
brings about injury and if one desires to inflict injury, syena is 
the means. 152 ' The Slokavartika remarks that the words, 
codana', 'upadesa' and «vidhi* are synonyms according to

1184 Histoiy of DharmaSaslra I Sec. VII, Ob. XXVIII 

Sahara, the bhasyakara. The word 'vidhi' is often translated as 
injunction ( i. e. an authoritative order) but in common parlance 
' injunction ' means ' restraining a person from doing something.' 
Therefore, the word, ' codana ' or 'vidhi' has often been trans- 
lated in these pages as 'exhorfeatory passage or exhortation.' 
The result is that dharma means a religious act ( a yaga) which 
confers highest good. In Bg. X 90. 16 ' yajna ' is spoken of as 
the firBt (or ancient) dharma (yajnena yajnam-ayajanta devas- 
tani dharmani prathamanyasan ) and Sahara ( in the bhasya on 
P. M. S 1. 1. % ) quotes this verse for the proposition that the 
Veda expressly says that dharma means ' yaga '. ThatVedas 
have been promulgated for yajila is stated by the Vedanga- 
jyotisa 1930 verse 3 (Veda hi yajnarthamabhipravrttah). Medi- 
eval Dharmasastra writers like the Mitaksara (on Yaj. II. 135), 
Dayatattva (p. 172), Vy. M. (p. 157) quote a verse ascribed to 
Devala or Katyayana, which provides that all wealth is created 
for sacrifices, that, therefore, one should expend it on purposes of 
dharma and not on women, fools and irreligious people 1931 (vide 
H. of Dh. Vol. III. p. 609 n. 1155 for further passages of similar 
import and their application ). 

Sahara introduces the 2nd sutra by saying that what is fa> bo 
investigated and understood is what dharma is (i.e. what is its 
nature-svarupa), what are its characteristics, what are the means 
of attaining it, what are deceptive (wrong) means of attaining it 
and what does it lead to (what the fruit or reward of knowing it 
is ) and replies that the second sutra explains the first two of 
these (viz, what dharma is and what its characteristics are Mn ).

What ts the special province of MimGmsa U85 

That is 'codanas'fvedic hortatory texts) are the pramana 
(means of knowledge) about dhaima and whatever is laid down by 
hortatory vedic texts is dharma (i. e. Dharmasvarupa). The 
relation of Dharma to the Veda and the P&rvamlmamsa-sastra 
is clearly and succinctly brought out in a verse of Kumarila 
himself as follows: 1933 "When discussion about the correct 
knowledge of Dharma is being carried on, Veda being the means 
of such knowledge, mimamsa will supply complete information 
about the subject of the procedure or method ' Just as even if 
a man has good sight he cannot perceive anything unless there 
is light, so unless a man knows the methods laid down by PMS 
he cannot correctly judge what Dharma is. Jaimini then exa- 
mines the means of knowledge (pramanas) and holds that except 
sabda [i, e the Veda) there is no means of knowledge about 
Dharma. One cannot perceive directly what Dharma is i. e. 
Dharma is not pratyaksi. All the other pramanas except sabda 
are based on pratyaksa and therefore they cannot define or 
explain what Dharma is According to Kumarila there are six 
pramanas, pratyaksa (direct perception), anumana (inference), 
upamana (analogy), sabda, arthapatti and abhava (non-exis- 
tence ) Frabhakara does not accept the last as a pramana. 

The subjects of the twelve chapters of the PMS are stated in 
the J N. M. V. to be respectively . (1st chapter) pramana (means of 
knowledge , ( 2nd ) bheda (six grounds on which religious rites are 
distinguished from each other and the distinctions of rites as 
principal and subsidiary ) , ( 3 ) Sesa ( the meaning of sesa being 
■ancillary or what subserves another that is called sesm or what is 
helpful to another'), how it is employed and the relative strength of 
sruti, linga, vakya, prakarana, sthana and samakhya; (4) prayuklt 
(what is obligatory and what is addressed to the performer's consci- 
ence i.e. what is kratvartfia and what is purusartlia), (5) Erama 
(principles of settling the order or sequence depending on sruti 
&c ), ( 6 ) adhikara ( persons entitled to perform yaga ), ( 7 ) sama- 
nyatidasa (extension of items in the model yaga to its modifica- 
tions), (8) Visesatidesa (extension of items to individual rites) ; 
(9)iiha (ad aptation of mantras and samskaras ) ; ( 10 ) badha

(omitting certain items or details in modifications of model 
yagas; (11) tantra (one item being useful and enough for 
several acts or persons); (12) prasanga ( extension of applica- 
tion ) In the four padas of the first adhyaya four matters ate 
respectively dealt with viz. vidhi ( hortatory texts ), arthavada 
( laudatory or explanatory passages including mantras ), smrtis 
(including customs and usages) and names ( of rites, Buoh as 
udbhid, ati a). Sahara himself gives a summary lm of the first 
chapter of PMS as follows; viz. the pramanas; principles of tha 
conclusions about vidhi, arthavada, mantra and smrtis, examina- 
tion of gunavidhi ( texts laying down some subsidiary or acces- 
sory matter as in ' dadhna juhoti ', where curds are prescribed 
as offering) and namadheya; the determination of doubtful 
matters by the help of the remainder of a passage or by the 
samarthya ( the suitability of things for the actions prescribed ) 
It is unnecessary for the purpose of this section to furnish here 
a summary of the contents of the other chapters of the PMS. 
For a tolerably full summary of the contents of the twelve 
chapters of the PMS the reader is referred to the author's paper 
' a brief sketch of the FurvamlmamsS system ' in ABORI, vol. 
VI. pp. 6-12. At the beginning of each chapter Sahara sum- 
marizes what he dealt with in the preceding chapter and sets 
out the prinoipal topics of that chapter. 

The P. M. S. itself is of enormous extent and it haB been 
overlaid with commentaries and with numerous commentaries 
on commentaries. Even before Sahara there was a commentator 
described as Vrttikara, M35 who is mentioned in several places

3-5 IL 1, 33, VII. 2. 6 Sabara differs from Vrttikara, The 
earliest extant commentary on the P. M.S. is the bhasya of 
Sahara. Sabara quotes many verses concerning PMS matters 
and a few also on other topics. Verses quoted on PMS matters 
are found on II. 1. 32 ( one on p. 434 and another on p. 435 ), II. 
1.33 (p 436, two verses), 1934 II. 2 1 (p. 462, two verses on 
adrstaitha), on IV. 3. 3 (one verse on p. 1247 ), IV. 4. 21 (p. 1279

1. 1 (p 2096 on tantra and praswhga), XII. 3. 20 (p. 2262 on 
bhasika-svara ). All these veTses are apparently quoted by 
Sabara from some work or commentary on the PMS or on 
PurvamSmamsS, one or two probably from some Srautasutra and 
one or two may be his own composition. 

Many glosses on PMS composed by •writeis of the 10th and 
following centuries are extant, of which 22 are referred to on 
p. 166 of vol. VI. of the Sarasvatlbhavana Studies (Benares) by

clearly indicated by the Slokavartika that Bays that the very first 
sentence 1W!f of Sahara's bbasya was interpreted in six different 
Ways before it by commentators and by the Tantravartika that 
the bhasyakara did not notice six sutras after the ' niyltadhi- 
karana'fJUI. 4. 1-9) and that commentators differed in thoir 
reasons for the omisBion, but all commentators other than Sahara 
did explain those six sutras. 1538 None of the commentaries 
composed before Kumarila is now available, 

Kumarila wrote the Slokavartika on Sahara's bhasya on 
P. M. S. 1. 1 ( in about 4000 verses ) and the voluminous Tantra- 
vartika on I. 2 to the end of chap, in of PMS and the Tup4Ika 
on P. M.S. 1V-XD. (stray notes, not a regular commentary), 
Kumarila is credited with having composed two more com- 
mentaries, 'Madhyama-tika' and 'Brhat tiki' on P. M S." 3 ' 
The latter has been referred to by the NyayaTatnSkara 1 ' 10 and 
the Nyayasudha on Tantravartika quotes several versos from it 
(on pp, 801, 339-30, 393) and the Jaimiruya-sutorthasangraha

Commentaries and works on PMS 1189 

Tuptlka mi has some regular commentaries but none is published. 
The Tantraratna of Parthasarathimisra deals at some length 
with the same chapters of P M. S (published partly in Prince of 
Wales, Sarasvatibhavaua S.). On Sahara's bhasya Prabhakara 
wrote a commentary called BrhatI, a portion of which on the 
Tarkapada (PMS II) with the commentary Bjuvimalaparicika 
of Salikanathamisra has been edited by Pandit S E. Eamanatha 
Sastri and published by the Madras University ( 1934 ). The 
Sastra-dipika of ParthasaTathi is not a regular commentary on 
the P M. S. but it is a classic work on the P. M. S and follows 
the views of Kumarila Another very useful work is the 
Jairuinlya-nyaya-mala-vistara 19U of Madhavacarya (published 
by Anan. Press, Poona) that gives summaries in verse of the 
adfitkaianas of the PMS with brief prose comments and also 
points out some of the differences of Prabhakara ( called * guru ' 
by Salikanatha and others) from Kumarila (in all about 15 
points of difference being noted between the two as regards the 
firBt chapter of the PMS and three in the 2nd chapter). Salika- 
natha wrote an independent work called FrakaTanapaficika 
(published in the Ohowkhamba S S ). There is another work of 
Prabhakara's school called Fayaviveka of Bhavanatha ot Bhava- 
deva (ed. by Pandit S. K. Ramanath Sastri and published by the 
Madras University in 1937 ). This Bhavanatha is eulogised in 
the MadanaTatnapradipa on Vyavahara (pp. 324-325, published 
J« \f ^ P S ' Librai y- Bikaner, 1948) as the sun to the lotus 
of Prabhakara's doctrine. The Tantrarahasya of Ramanujacarya 
(2nd ed published inGO.S, 1956) composed about 1750 A. D. 
is the last noted work of the Prabhakara School and this work 
furnishes some useful information about the works of Prabhakara 
and the commentaries thereon by Salikanatha. A verse in the 
PrabodLacandrodaya ( Act II) after referring to Guru, Kumarila

mentioned in the Nayaviveka (pp 271, 273 respectively ). 

Prabhakara differed from Kumarila on numerous pointB mJ 
The divergence starts from the very first sutra of the P.M S (as 
the note below will show 1914 ). Prabhakara is called guru' by 
Salikanatha in many places in the Prakaranapancika" ( vide first 
Intro verse and pp. 17, 32 &c. ) There is a very great divergence 
of views about the relative chronological position of Kumarila 
and Prabhakara Vide 'the Prabhakara Sohool' (1911) by 
M. M. Ganganath Jha, A B Keith's ■KarmamImamsa , (1931)

All I. O. Conference pp. 474-481 (both by Prof Kuppuswami 
Sastri), J. O. R. Madras, vol I pp 131-144 and 203-210. The 
fundamental question is whether Salikanatha was a direct pupil 
of Prabhakara or only a later follower. From several considera- 
tions the present writer holds that Salikanatha was a direct pupil 
of Prabhakara Salikanatha not only speaks of Prabhakaraguru,

points of difference Vide also Intro to Tattvabindu by Pandit V. A. Rama-

A. D, As SSlikanatha quotes the Slokavarfciks and Mand- 
ana's works he would have to be placed between 750-800 
A. D. If Salikanatha wa3 a direct pupil of Prabhakara 
it follows that the latter (who appears to be unknown to 
Ssntaraksifcs, should have been a contemporary { i. e. should be 
heid to have flourished nearly between 700-760 A D. or a little 
later) and was later than Kumarila. There is a tradition that 
Prabhakara was a pupil of Kumarila. Traditions (such as of

the nino gems at the court of Vikramaditya) often arise 
without much evidence to support them; they should not 
however, be summarily rejected but should be tested by other 
available evidence. 

At one time Prabhakara appears to have occupied a vary 
prominent po 3 ition. The Gadag inscription of Vikramaditya 
VI (m 1098 A. D ) refers to the founding of a school for 
teachmg Prabhakaras' system at Lakkigundi (vide E I. vol. 
XV p. 348). This and the reference in tbe MitsksarS (on Yaj, 
IX. 114) to the views of Guru on »» the Lipsasutra (PMS IV. 
1. 3.) in the third alternative interpretation put on that sufcraj 
holding that the rules about the acquisition of wealth (in 
Gautama and other smrtis) are purumnha ( addressed to the 
conscience of the performer of sacrifices) and not kralvaillm, 
show the outstanding position that the Prabhakara school 
occupied in the 11th century A. D. m the Oarnatic and Maratna 
countries, The Madanapari]5ta, a north Indian work (1360-1390 
A D.), quotes a half verse of Guru 1518 (on p. 89). The 
Smrticandrika (on Vyavahara p. 257), the Vlramitrodaya 
(on vyavahara p. 523) and the V. M. (p. 89) refer to the 
Nayaviveka of Bhavanatha, almost the last outstanding work 
of the Prabhakara school. Gradually, thB Prabhakara School 
lost ground and the Bhatta school of Kumarila has been most 
predominant for several centuries. The present writer holds 
that Prabhakara is later then Kumarila but he is not in a 
position to say from whom lie borrowed his peculiar views or 
whether they were started by him for the first time (though this 
appears more plausible) Pandit K. S Ramaswami Sastri (in 
Intro, to Tantrarahasya, G. O S„ 2nd edition of 1956) holds 
that Prabhakara took his views from Badari (p. XXV). The 
learned Pandit offers hardly any tangible evidence for his 
remark ( on p. XIX of the Intro ) that Badari held views similar

to those of Bhartrmitra who so interpreted the PMS as to make it 
atheistic. Badari's views on Mlmamsa matters are quoted only 
four times inPMSviz in III 1 3 (on what matters are sesa), 
VL 1- 27 (that vedic sacrifices can be performed even by 
sudras), "VIII. 3 6. (purely sacrificial matter about application of 
Sadaha procedure), IX. 3. 33 ( about method of singing saman, 
Badari's view being accepted by Jaimini ). In none of these 
does one find the slightest touch of Bhartrmitra's atheistic 
tendencies or of Prabhakara's special propositions. 

Prom Kumarila onwards there are numerous commentaries, 
commentaries on commentaries and manuals on some aspects of 
mlmamsa doctrines or of the contents of the PMS. Several 
difficult questions of identity and relationship among some of 
the early writers whose works are wholly or partially extant 
have also arisen during the last fifty years and many papers 
have been written. The present writer has read most of them, 
but if the whole evidence is to be set out and discussed a bulky 
volume of several hundred pages would have to be written. That 
cannot be done here. The several questions of identity and 
relationship are set out below and the present author's replies to 
all of them will be given with a little discussion on a few out 
of them: 



( 1 ) Whether Prabhakara was a pupil of Kumarila; the reply 
is that there is no substantial or compelling evidence for this 
except tradition, but Prabhakara is certainly later than 
Kumarila; 

( 2 ) Whether Salikanatha is a direct disciple of Prabhakara 
— yes; 

( 3 ) Whether Mandana was a disciple of Kumarila; there is 
no substantial evidence for an affirmative reply, but Mandana 
certainly explains in bis BhavanSviveka a verse of Kumarila 
and quotes another verse from Tantravartika Vide note 1946 
above In the Vidbiviveka also (Benares ed. 1907), which 
Mandana wrote after Bhavanaviveka he quotes (on p. 15 'abhi- 
dbabha^n,. hnadayah) from Tantravartika (p 378) and on 
P 31o of the Vidbiviveka quotes (yathoktam-sreyahsadhanata?!

certainly later than or a younger contemporary of Kumarila 

(4) Are Mandana and Umbeka identical-no; Umbeka 
wrote a commentary on the Bhavanaviveka of Mandana in 
which on pp 17 and 76 he discusses various readings in it it is 
not possible to bold that a writer would discuss variant readings 
m his own work (as would follow if the two were identical). 

( 5 ) Are Mandana and Visvarfipa identical — No ; 

(6) Are Visvarfipa and Suresvara identical— yes; the 
latter name being assumed after Visvarupa became a sanmjami. 

(7) Is Umbeka identical with Bhavabhuti— the evidence 
is not enough to give a definite affirmative reply, but it is likely 
that they may be identical 

( 8 ) Is Umbeka a disciple of Kumarila— yes ; as shown in 
note below. 195 ° 



1950. That Umbeka was a pupil of Kumarila follows from iho following 
considerations. In his com on the Bhavanaviveka {p 43 ) Umbeka quotes 
a half verse from Bhattapada (tjS,* nginf • 1 5H«J^ it vmhmnm mvm- 
WifiH:) and on the same page he quotes another half verse ' Tr^ra STTl-ai'^T 
Tre^JT'TOiEn'sTKt'iTS'ref^ren' These two halves make one verse on p 383 
of the Tantravartika. the latter half of which is again ascribed by Umbeka 
(on p 92 of his com on the same work) to Bhattapada It follows that 
Bhattapada was his guru Prof Kunban Raja tries to wriggle out by 
advancing the theory ( on pp XXXVII-XXXVIII of his Intro ) that 
some later scribe inserted the word 'guruna' and argues that there is 
no proof of Bhattapada being Umbeka's guru. Unless another reliable ms. of 
Umbeka's commentary is found which omits the word 'guruna' or 
substitutes in its place some other word it is not open to us to hold that 
the reading is not trustworthy and then build positive or negative 
propositions on our own speculations alone The Uvcyaka whose view is 
quoted by Kamalaslla in Tattvasangraha (G O S p 812 '3^lili?mi?T 

^Wraro iir 5jii*hhi snnnrcr, i% arS, 3TOn%«*rri%t^ > ) is probably a*^ 

whose name is written in several different ways in works and mss, (vide 
M M Jha's Intro to Bhavanaviveka p 2). If this identity is correct T^OT 
must have flourished before 750 A, D and chronology would not be against 
Umbeka being a pupil of Kumarila The Yukti-snehaprapurani on Sostra- 
dipika quotes Umbekabhafta in several places, But one long quotation 
from Umbeka on p. 30 is very striking In this both Sahara and Vartika- 
kara (i e Kumarila) are severely criticized and after quoting the famous 
verse frequently cited in the Mababh?rata jpftnjmSsreT • iRwi'ft' fWlln 
he discards the views of the Vartikakara. Sahara is separated from Umbeka 
by several centuries and was not Umbeka's guru Therefore, this passage 
( that occurs on pp 105-108 of the ar3r4£f5fiT of Umbeka on Slokavartika, 
pub by Madras Un in 1940 ) leads to the inference that the Vartikakara was 
( Continued on next page ) 



Chi onologiacal position of Kumai da and others 1195 
(9 ) la Suresvara, a pupil of Sankaracarya ?— Yes. 

The result of the above replies is that the following is the 
most probable chronological order of Furvamimamsa writers 
mentioned in questions 1 to 9 viz Kumarila, Prabhakaia, 
Mandana, TJmbeka, Sahkanatha They flourished between 650 
A. D to 750 A. P., Kuinarila being the earliest of the five, 
Frabhakara (who quotes Kiratarjuniya II. 30 twice on pp 242, . 
343) and Mandana being contemporaries or Mandana being 
younger than Prabhakara. 

The opening and ending verses in Suresvara's Vartika on 
the bhasya of Sankara on the Br. Up. and the Tai. Up. leave no 
room for doubt that he was a disciple of Sankara. 

From the present author's paper in JBBBAS foT 1928, pp. 
289-293 and Prof. Kuppuswami's paper on 'Mandana, Suresvara 
equation in the History of Vedanta' in ABOB1 vol 18 pp. 121- 
157 it follows that Mandana and Suresvara are not identical. 

Some remarks in the learned Introduction of Prof. Kunhan 
Eaja to the edition of Umbeka's Com. on the Slokavartika invite 
criticism. Prof. Eaja (on p. XLIX) states that bis attempt has 
been only to raise doubt3 and to attempt at weighing the evid- 
ence for and against various theories. The present writer has 
no serious objection to this. But he thinks that Prof Eaja has 
gone wrong in his inteipretation of words like ' anupasitagura- 
vas-codayanti ' (p 33} and ' anupSsitaguruprajna-vilasitam-iti ' HS1 
grantha-jilSna-manino manyante ' (p 30 ). He starts (XLH) by 
saying "whether it meant (i e. ' anupasitaguru ' meant) one by

Whom the teacher was not respected or a teacher who was not 
reApscted (by his disciples) 1 and then proceeds 'but the expres- 
sion '-upasitagurutSm' (appearing in the commentary on the 
2nd verse of the Slokavartika) settles the point. It must mean 
'one by whom the teacher was not respected'. ' Upasita-guru ' 
literally means ' one who waited on the guru i. e listened to the 
explanations of his teacher and made them his own ' ' Honoured ' 
is at most a secondary meaning of 'upasita'. Upa-as literally 
means ' sit near, wait upon ' I fail to see how it settles the 
point. The word ' upasita-guru tarn ' (when introducing the 2nd 
intro. verse of the Slokavartika) is applied by Umbeka to 
Kumarila himself in relation to the Slokavartika verse ' abhi- 
vandya gurunadau ' It means ' the characteristic or quality of 
one who has served his teacher 1 e who has carefully listened to 
what the guiu expounded and understood it.' The expression 
' anupaBitaguru ' ( which, according to Prof Raja, always refers 
to Prabhakara) frequently (vide also pp. 14, 53, 75, 391, 441 ) 
used by Umbeka means 'he or those who have not waited upon 
the guru and listened to his words carefully and therefore have 
failed to giasp the correct meaning of the passages '. The infer- 
ence suggested by these words of dension is that the objector 
( either Prabhakara or some one else ) has not understood the 
doctrine taught by Kumarila to him and the present author is 
disposed to hold that the frequent emphasis on the word ' guru ' 
in 'anupasitaguru* is a veiled reference to Prabbakara-guru (as 
Salikanatha puts hiB name in his Prakarana-pancika 'Prabha- 
kara-guror-drstya), who was Rumania's pupil but deviated from 
his guru's doctrines and wrote against them and Umbeka attacks 
and derides him for this. Supposing that Prabhakara had once 
been a pupil of Kumarila and later on propounded views that 
very much diverged from Kumanla's. it is natural if Umbeka 
took up the cudgels on behalf of Kumarila and attacked Prabha- 
kara as one who had forsaken his Guru's views, had not digested 
them properly and had written a work (not now available but 
well-known to Umbeka) severely attacking Kumarila. Pror. 
Raja (Intro pp. XLIII and XLIV ) throws out the suggestion 
that on p 14 and p 291 Umbeka possibly suggests that Prabba- 
kara preceded Kumarila There is nothing of the *»*. 
Umbeka holds that Prabhakara had not grasped his mas era 
doctrines and tries to show what the real doctrine misunderstood 
by Prabhakara was . . 

It appears desirable to set out a tentative chronological teWJ 
of the oiftstanding works and writers of the Pfirvamimamsa, with 



Probable dates of prominzmt writers on PM 1197 

a few remarks here and there Most of the dates are a -proximate 
and tentative, 

Purvamimamsasutra of Jaimini — 400 B to 200 B. 0. 

Vrttikara — There is great conflict of views about the 
person who the Vrttikara quoted several times by Sahara was. 
Parthasarathi in Sastradipika, p 48 (first line) holds that he is 
Upavarsa Vrttikara is cited with great respect by Sahara, but 
he also differs from him frequently The Prapancahrdaya 
( p. 39 ) attributes to Bodhayana an extensive commentary called 
Krtakotl on both mlmamsas. It is remarkable that Bodhayana 
is not mentioned by name by any early woik on P. M. S. nor 
does Sankara mention him though he twice mentions Upavarsa. 
Kamanujacarya in the opening words of his hhasya on Brahma- 
sufcra refers to the extensive commentary of Bodhayana on the 
Brahmasutra. But he does not say that Bodhayana commented 
on P. M. S. The present author is not even now prepared to 
hold that Vrttikara mentioned by Sahara so often is identical 
with Upavarsa. Sabara cites at some length the different inter- 
pretation of PMS I. 1 3-5 by Vrttikara and in the midst of it 
mentions (on p 45 ) by name the view of UpavaTSa on 'what is 
sabda*. He appears to regard the two as different. The fact 
that the Tantravartika (pp 602-3 on H. 3. 16 ) appears to 
identify Upavarsa with Vrttikara is not conclusive. From 
Knmttila himself we know that several Vrttis were written on 
PMS before as well as after Sabara. So even Upavarsa may 
have been deemed to be Vrttikara by Kumarila ( on II. 3. 16 > 
and h« views quoted, though the Vrttikara in other places in 
babaras bhasya may be different.

CHAPTER XXIX 

Some Fundamental Doctrines of Purvamlmamsa 

Some of the characteristic fundamental doctrines of the 
Purvamlmamsa will now be set out with some references and a 
few remarks, as to some of them, the views of Prabhakara and 
his followers being also raTely referred to. 

( 1 ) Veda is eternal, self-existent, not composed by any 
author, human or divine, and is infallible. This is the core of 
the P. M. system. Vide P. M. S I 1. 27-32 and Sabara on 1. 1. 5 
(p. 53) and Slokavartika ( Vakyadhikarana, verses 1953 366- 
368 ). The argument briefly is , Veda is learnt at present and 
was studied in the past also by students from teachers, that 
there is no evidence about the person who first composed it or 
who first studied it. If it be argued tbat such a reasoning may 
be put forward as regards the Mahabharata, the reply is that 
people know that Vyasa is the author of it. Similarly, the 
passages in Smrtis and Puranas that Prajapati created the Veda 
are merely arthavadas (laudatory) not based on any evidenco 
or perception and are meant only to convey the absolute autho- 
ritativeness of the Veda. If the connection between word and 
sense is eternal and not brought about by any person, the same 
reasoning holds good as to the Veda. This view is opposed to 
the view of the Naiyayikas who hold that God is the author of 
the Veda or the interpretation of V S.I 1 3 (Sasfcrayomtvat) 
by Sankaraoarya based on Br Up H. 4. 10. Manu 1. 21 ( stating 
that Brahma created from the words of the Veda the names and 
appropriate duties of all) seems to s uggest that ( according to

Manu ) the Veda was self-existent Similarly, the Mahabhasya 
on Vartika 3 on Panini IV. 3. 101 ( ' tena proktam ' ) remarks WS4 
that the Vedas were not composed by anyone, that they are 
eternal, tbat the meaning of the Veda is eternal, but the arrange- 
ment of the letters is not eternal and therefore we have different 
vedio texts like Kathaka, Kalapaka, Paippaladaka &o. The 
Smrtis also sometimes state tbat there is no author of the Veda, 
that Brahma remembers it and that Manu also has remembrance 
of Dharma in different Kalpas ( Parasarasmrfci I. 21 ). 

In P. M S. I. 1. 28 (' Anityadarsanac-ca') the opponent of 
the eternality of the Veda puts forward such passages as ' Babara 
Pravahani (son of Pravahana) desired' (Tai. S VII 1.10.2) 
and ' Kusuruvinda Auddalaki desired' (Tai. S VH.2. 2. 1), 
which mention men named Pravahani and Auddalaki ( son of 
TJddalaka) that are mortals and argues that Veda did not exist 
before those mortals and is, therefore, not eternal. To this the 
Siddhanta replies in P M. S. 1. 1 31 ( ' param tu srutisamanyam ' ) 
tbat such examples are to be explained differently viz, ' BabaTa' 
is a onomatopoetic word meaning 'rustling' and Pravahani 
(from 'pra* and ' vshay ' causal of vah ) means the wind. 

It may be noted that centuries before Jaimini and Yaska 
there was a school of Vedic interpreters called * Aitihasikas '. For 
example, Rg. X. 98. 5 and 7 refer to Devapi, son of Rstisena, and 
to Santanu. Yaska ( in Nirukta II 10 ), starting with the words 
' tatra-itihasamacaksate ' states that Devapi and Santanu were 
brothers of the Kuru family and the younger brother Santanu 
was crowned king ignoring the rights of the elder and that these 
verses refer to them In Bg. X 10 there is a dialogue between 
Yama and YamI and Nir. V 2 refers to the 8th verse of it. 
Those who hold that Veda is eternal would explain Yama as 
Aditya and YamI as 'Night \ Rg. HI. 33 is a dialogue between 
the sage Vis varnitra and the rivers. The Kir. (II 25-27 ) explains 
verses 5-6 and 10 of that hymn from the Aitihasika point of 
view and states tbat Visvamitra was son of king Kusika and 
does not mention the Nairukta interpretation of these verses.

About the Asvins the Nirukta ( XII. 1 ) states several views 
viz. they are Heaven and Earth, or Day and Night, or the Sun 
and the Moon and remarks that according to the Aitih5siJras 
they were kings who had accumulated great merit. Probably 
the Nairuktas were divided among themselves and explained 
that the Asvins represented different natural phenomena. About 
Vrtra (occurring in such verses as Rg 1. 32. 11} the Nairuktas 
(Etymologists) said in Narukfca II, 16 that the word means 
' cloud', while the Aitihasikas say that he (Vrtra) was an Aeura, 
son of Tvastr. As to the hymn Jig. L 105 of 19 verses (in the 
first 18 of which the refrain is 'vittam me asya rodasi') tho 
Nirukta IV. 6 states that the hymn was seen by Trita who was 
thrown into a well. In Rg. Vlt 33. 11 there is mention of 
tfrvasl and Vasistba (Maitra-Varuna) as born of Urvasland 
Nirukta (V. 13-14) explains that verse and remarks that Urvasl 
was an apaaras and Rg. X. 95 is a dialogue between Aila Puru- 
ravas and TTrvasI. But the interpretation of the Nairukfcas and 
Aitihasikas on this story are not expressly set out. Probably 
the ITairuktas would explain Urvasl as lightning and Furfiravas 
as the roaring wind. The hymn Rg. X. 108 is a dialogue 
between Sarama (Indra's hitch) and the Panis and the Nirukta 
XI. 25 explains the first vertse and remarks that there is a story 
(AkhySna) therein viz. that there was a dialogue between 
Sarama sent by Indra and the Panis who were Asuras, In all 
such legends the Nairaktas would insist that they are to be 
taken allegorically as referring to natural phenomena, while the 
Aitihasikas would insist that there is historical basis m aH 
these. Though it is not stated by the Nirukfea expressly w« 
the Aitihasikas do not hold the doctrine of the eternality of We 
Veda it implicitly follows from their explanations that they ena 
not subscribe to that doctrine. 

2. The connection between word and sense is eternal. J

the connection of word and seme. Vide P.M.S II 1.6-23, 
Sahara's btesya thereon, the elaborate treatment in 444 verses in 
Slokavartika (pp m-8<5) and Pratarana-paficika pp. 133-140 
[seventh Prakarana). On the question " what does a word lite 
' GauV denote," the P. M S. replies that a word denotes atoti 
( or jati ) i e. the universal, the class. Briefly, the MImarnsakas 
hold that the word, the denotation and the relation of these two 
are eternal. Vide P. M S. I. 3 30-35. 

3 The individual sout. The P.M.S. does not expressly 
affirm the existence of the soul in any sutra ( SankaTacarya on 
V S IH. 3. 53 refers to this fact, states that Sahara, the Bhasya- 
kara, propounded the existence of the soul and that the venerable 
Upavarsa refrained from going into that question in hi3 exposi- 
tion of the Puivamimamsa, with the remark that he would 
expound it when dealing with Sarlraka (i e the Vedanta-sQtra), 
It was probably due to this fact of the absence of a statement 
about the soul that the Purvamlmamsa was interpreted by some 
as favouring atheism Kumarila complains that the Mlmarhsa, 
though, not really atheistic, was put forward as Lokayata 
(atheistic) K!S by some and that therefore he endeavours ( in the

said that m a word hie 'ganli' it is the letters that constitute the word 
(vide Sahara quoting Upavarsa p. 45 on 1. 1.5 and sahkara on V S. I. 3 28). 
The other view is that the tetters manifest the sphota and it is the sphota

it is so, the phala (the reward ) is conferred by the sacrifice and 
not by the deities (Indra and Agni in this case) and the words 
•Indra 1960 and Agni confer progeny on the sacrificer" are purely 
laudatory. P. M. S. IX. 1. 6-10 are very important in this 
connection. Sabara quotes Vedic passages like Rg. X 47. 1, 
III. 30. 5, YIH 17. 8 (where Indra's right hand, fist, neck, 
stomach and arms are mentioned), ftg I. 95 10, VHX 77. 4 
( where Indra is said to have put in his stomach all foods and to 
have drunk thirty vessels full of soma ), Rg. VIII. 32. 22 and 
X. 89. 10 where Indra is said to be lord of the world, of heaven 
and earth, waters and mountains and then remarks that these aro 
all arthauadas, though at first sight they appear to postulate that 
Vedic deities have bodies, eat and drink. The Sastradipika 
advances the argument that if the devata had a body, ate, drank 
and was pleased, devata will be antttja (ephemeral) and could not 
m that case be treated of in the Veda that is eternal. He further 
asserts that men of limited intelligence not knowing the real 
import of the Vedic passages may hold wrong opinions. Sabara 
notes ( on X. 4. 23 ) that there are various opinions as to who the 
Devatas are to whom either a hymn (sUMa) is addressed (as 
Rg. L 94) or to whom'havis' is directed by the Veda to he 
offered as in * one should offer to Agni an offering cooked on 
eight potsherds'; that the devata becomes connected with 
the sacrifice not in its own nature but by the word used with 
reference to an offering and that where the Veda directs an 
offering to be made to Agni, one oannot use a synonym for 
Agni such as 'Suci, Favaka, Dhumaketu, Kisanu.Vaisvanaraor 
Sandfly a. Thus Devata is a matter of words, as admitted by

Relahon of Yaga and Devala 1209 

Sahara. The Piakaianapanoika also states that there is no 
proof that a sacrifice (yaga) is a means of pleasing the deity 
and that to say that there is worship of a deily in a yaga is 
really metaphorical From this and the preceding doctrine 
(No. 1) it follows that P. M. S., Sabaia, and Kum&rila discard the 
idea that the Veda is the word of God or that rewards of religious 
acts are due to the favour or grace of God. It is therefore that 
the Padmapurana quoted (in note 1957a) above dubs Jaimini's 
doctrine 'nirlsvaravada* (Godless) 

When the Veda says ' one desirous of heaven should perform 
a sacrifice', three akanksas (expectancies) arise. The first is 
'what is to be brought about'; this is satisfied by the word 
soarqa, stating the reward or the purpose. The 2nd is ' by what 
means ' is the fh-st to be brought about. That is satisfied by the 
meaning of the root 'tfcy'(i e by yaga), the third is 'what is 
the procedure or in what manner', that is satisfied by the esta- 
blishment of the sacred fires and other rites that are described in 
the context of the passage 'svargakamo yajeta'. It is learnt 
from this passage that the Teward or purpose (svarga) springs 
from (is brought about by) ygga and not by the devata. »« 

_ Later writers could not digest all these ideas about the 
deities in sacrifices. Venkatanatha ( or Venkatadesika, 1269- 
1369 A. D ) composed a work called 'Sesvaramimamsa', in which 
he criticizes both Bhatta and Prabhakara schools and being an 
ardent Vaisnava of the R&manuja school attempts a synthesis of 
the two mimamsas and brings in the idea of God as the dispenser 
ot t&e reward of sacrifices against the combined testimony of 
Sahara, Rumania, Salikanatha and others. Vide Dr. Radha- 
krisnanm 'Indian Philosophy,' vol. H pp. 424-429 for 'God 
and world according to Purvamlmamsa'.

all effort it may come to an end The world is real and has always 
been there and will go on, fcr all time. 1963 Vide Slokavartika' 
(V. 112-117), Prakaranapancika pp 137-140 and NySyaratna- 
kara on the former The Slokavaratika goes so far as to say * it 
must be admitted that all these ( worlds &c ) existed before the 
creator, and again suoh a creator may be proved (by anumana) 
to have been preceded by the Veda on account of his being an 
intelligent being, just as ourselves are preceded by the Veda ' 

It would be noticed that the Mlmamsa idea of creation and 
dissolution is opposed to the Mahabharata and Glta ( X. 8 
* aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam pravartate ). 

6. The doctrine of apurui ( invisible mysterious or subtle 
potency ). The Veda lays down that one desirous of heaven 
should perform a sacrifice. Eut the reward heaven comes off 
only after a long time, while the sacrifice lasts only for a short 
time. There would thus be no direct connection between the 
sacrifice ( the cause ) and heaven ( the reward ) or purpose It 
must be presumed from the Vedic injunction that there is some 
connecting link between the activity of man to perform a yaga 
and the reward. Before the principal and subordinate aots in 
a sacrifice are performed men have no capacity for svarga and 
sacrifices ( described in the texts ) are also incapable of producing 
the effect ' svarga'. The principal and subsidiary acts in a sacri- 
fice when carried out remove the incapacity and produce a . 
certain capacity or potency for svarga. This must be admitted 
by all Unless such a capacity exists there would be the unac- 
ceptable conclusion that not doing the acts and doing them are 
on the same level. This capacity or potency either residing in 
the man (agent) or arising from the sacrifice that is performed 
is called apui ua in this sastra It is true that this capacity 
cannot be proved by direct perception or other means of know- 
ledge except by srutai lhapath. When we are told that a man

Idea of apurva 1211 

who is fab does not eat by day we presume, in order to account 
for this, that he must ha eating food at night. Similarly, the 
Veda brings sacrifice and svarga together; we have to presume 
that sacrifice gives rise to a subtle potency, though the sacrifice 
itself comes to an end in a short time, and that this potency is 
the cause of bringing about the reward svaTga and that we may 
look upon it as abiding in the soul of the sacrificer or as an 
invisible effect (a Teaching forth of the yaga itself that has 
vanished ). 1961 Mlmamsakas do not admit that the results of 
religious acts are given by God. The V S III % 40 states that 
this is the view of Jaimini ( dharmam Jaiminir-ata eva ) and is 
opposed to the view of Badarayana, Sankara and the Bbamati 
that it is God who confers the reward. According to the 
PrakaTanapaficika ( p 186 ) the invisible f OTce or potency is not 
in the agent but arises as a subtle foTm from the action itself. 
Four kinds of Apurva 1955 ( with further sub-divisions ) as regards 
Darsapurnaniasa sacrifice are stated by Madhavacarya, 

The idea is that every rite as a whole produces an apurva, 
and that each subordinate part (anga) of the rite has also an 
(apurva) which is subordinate to the apurva of the whole rite. 

The Tantravartika explains why it is called apurva. The 
invis ible potency was not in existence before the performance of

the sacrifice and arises as something new after Us performance 
and hence apurva has a purely etymological sense. J96s 

If one holds the view that apurva is some potency coming 
to reside in the performer of a sacrifice one'B views would be 
like those of some modern writers who hold that real prayer is 
not mere repetition of certain words deemed to be sacred, but it 
is an upward movement or a real increase in the intensity of 
spiritual power in the man who prays, it being immaterial to 
ask to whom he prays (videW. James' 'Varieties of religious 
experience ' p. 467 ). 

7. Svatah-ptamanya (self-validity of cognition). It has 
already been stated that the pramanas are six (five according to 
Prabhakara ). The P. M. system postulates that all cognitions 
as cognitions are intrinsically valid in themselves, do not 
require any extraneous help to establish their validity but in- 
validity of cognitions is {paratah) established txtraneouBly by 
showing that there was defect in the organ that produced the 
cognition or it is established later on that a particular cognition 
was wrong. 1967 Prabhakara goes much further and holds that 
every experience as such is valid and no experience can be said 
to be wrong or illusory. 

8. Svarga. The ideas about heaven entertained by Jaimini,

165-167 and 168-171 for descriptions of the joys of heaven in 
the Vedie literature, the Epic and the Puranas. From considera- 
tions of space the remarks will have to be brief. In Rg. IX, 113. 
7-11 the sage prays to Soma to place him in that immortal world 
where there is continuous light, where all desires are fulfilled, 
where there are joys of various grades Heaven was deemed to 
be the place where the souls of valiant men that fought battles 
and sacrificed their lives went ( P*g. VI. 46. 12 ) and in B,g. X. 
154. 2-4 the soul of the dead is asked to join those departed men 
that had become invincible by great tapas, that bad died in 
battle, that had made gifts of a thousand cows, that had led 
a life of right and virtue and that were wise sages 

The Atharvaveda IV. 34.2 and 5-6 say that in heaven 
there are many women, they get edible plants and flowers of 
various kinds, there are streams of ghee, honey and wine (sura), 
milk, curds and there are lotus ponds all round. The Satapatha 
Br. (XIV. 7. 1.32-33) states that the joys of heaven are 100 
times greater than those on earth. Vide Macdonnell's * Vedic 
Mythology* pp 167-168 and A B.Keith's * Eeligion and philo- 
sophy of the Veda' etc. pp. 403-406 (1924). Even the Upanisads 
refer to the joys of heaven e. g. Chan. VIH. 5 3. speaks of two 
lakes in the world of Brahma, asvattha tree showering down 
Soma and the city of Brahma calld Aparajita; the Kausltaki Up. 
(I. 3 and 4) elaborates this and adds that five hundred Apsarases 
go out to meet him (who reaches heaven), one hundred with 
garlands in their hands, one hundred with ointments, one

12i4 History of Dharmaiastra I Sec. VII, Ch. XXIX 

Sabara and Kumarila say that popular 1968 ideas about svarga 
are invalid, that the Mahabharata and Puranas, being composed 
by men, need not be considered and that the Vedic descriptions 
of svarga are mere arthavadas for praise. 

P. M. S. IV. 3 15. provides that svarga 1M9 is the reward of 
all religious acts (such as Yisvajit) for which no express reward 
is provided by the texts. Sabara states ' happiness is svarga 
and all seek that '; an old verse says * that state of happiness in 
which there is no mixing of pain, which is not immediately 
overwhelmed by pain, that comes to one when one desires it, is 
called by the word star (svarga )'. 

Medhatithi remarks that smrtis sometimes state 1WD that 
the gift of a single cow yields all rewards and relieves from sins 
with the result that fruits of great religious acts and of slight 
ones would be deemed to be the same but it should be under* 
stood that the rewards differ in their duration ; otherwise, no one 
would engage in great or difficult rites. 

Some Vedic rites expressly declare fruits of sacrifices that 

are other than svarga. For example, the Tai. S. provides 'one 

desirous of (plenty of ) cattle should offer the citra sacrifice' (II. 

4. 6. 1.) or 'one desirous of (leadership or control over) a village 

should offer the Isti called SangrahanI' (Tai. S. H. 3. 9.2.).

Idea of svarga 1X15 

Sabara says the Veda does not say that the result of such 
sacrifices cannot be had in this very life. This the Tuptika 1OT1 
expands in an interesting note. The remedy declared by the 
Veda for securing desired objects ( son's birth and the like ) is 
bound to yield the result in this life or in the next. If a man 
has committed evil deeds in a previous life he has to undergo the 
effects of those sins and while he is undergoing the effects of 
sins the fruits of sacrifices are postponed. But if the effects of 
sins have been extremely reduced he secures the fruits of kamya 
rites in this very life The words of the Veda laying down an 
injunction state only so much that the fruit of the rite performed 
does come about but they dc not say that the fruit follows 
immediately ( after the rite is performed ). Therefore, there is no 
definiteness ( about the time when the fruit will follow ). But 
svarga is to be enjoyed only in another life ( as a fruit of rites 
performed m this life ). It ( svarga) means unequalled happiness 
and is achieved in a degree proportionate to the actions , but it 
cannot be enjoyed in this life, since men experience in this world 
every moment both happiness and misery. Every happiness is 
not the fruit of Jyotistoma and every being does not perform 
Jyotistoma. But some happineas does come to a man. Therefore, 
it (happiness) is natural The existence, however, of another 
body has to be imagined for the experience of unequalled happi- 
ness, there being no other reasonable explanation. That 
unequalled happiness does not come to a man unless he dies; 
therefore svarga is to be enjoyed in another life. 

9. Moksa (liberation): Neither the P. M. S. nor Sabara 
nor Frabhskara deals w ith the topic of Moksa. Kumarila and

1816 Htstoi y of Dliarmaiastt a I Sec. VII, Oh. XXIX 

Prakaranapanoika deal with it. They both Bay that liberation 
oonsists in not having to assume a body again, im The Sloka- 
vartika states ' ono desiring Moksa should not do any act that is 
forbidden or is Kamya (prescribed for those who desire an objaot 
like riches, son &c); he should perform obligatory rites (such as 
agnihotra) and nattmttika ( like bath, japa and gifts oneolipso 
&o. ) in order to avoid the sin that would accrue owing to non- 
performance of those two; if he does not desire the rewards of 
doing nitya and naimittika acts they will not come to him, as 
such a reward comes to him who seeks it. The results of acts in 
a former life would be eliminated by undergoing them in the life 
m whioh he seeks liberation. This differs from Sankaracarya's 
position who holds on V. S. IV. 3. 14 that, as declared in the 
Svet. Up. Ill, 8, there is no other way to Moksa except knowledge 
and realization of the JLtman. In his bhasya on the same sutra 
he seems to attack m3 Kumarila's position. According to 
Kumarila Upanisad passages about the knowledge of the Atman 
are only arthavadas as they convey to the performer Ilia 
knowledge that he has a soul and that the soul has certain 
characteristics, while SankaTa maintains (on V. S. 1. 1. 1) that 
the phala, the subject of investigation and the Vedic exhortation 
(codana)are different in Purvamlmamsa and in Brahamaml- 
mamsa. There exist smrtls that ridiculed the idea that the mere

Doctrines of early P. M. wiiteis are startling 1217 

knowledge of the Self would lead to Moksa. For example, 1974 
the Br. Y. Y. affirms that both knowledge and actions lead to 
Liberation, that to say that knowledge alone leads to liberation 
is a sign of indolence, that out of the fear of bodily labour 
ignorant men do not want to engage in actions. 

The doctrines of the early and principal writers on Purva- 
mimamsa are rather quaint and startling. Their arguments 
about the eternality and self-existence of the Veda are fallacious 
and were not accepted even by other ancient Indian systems. 
Both Prabhakara and Kumarila have in their scheme no place for 
God as the dispenser of rewards or as the ruler of man's destiny, 
as being pleased with men's prayers. They do not expressly 
deny the existence of God, but they assign to God or the deities 
mentioned in the Vedic texts a secondary role or rather practi- 
cally no role at all. They raise yajfia to the position of God 
and their dogmas about yajfia seem to be based upon a sort of 
commercial or busine3s-like system, 19 ?s v j z> one s^uid do so 
many acts, dispense gifts to priests, offer certain offerings, 
observe certain ethical rules, and other rules of conduct (such as 
not eating flesh, subsisting on milk)"?6 and then the reward 
would follow without the intervention of God. There is hardly 
any appeal to religious emotions, there is no omniscient Being, 
no Creator and no creation of the world. The Purvamlmamsa 
no doubt lays emphasis on (the rights and) duties of jnan in 
Me. The other daTsanas are far more concerned with the ques- 
tion of escaping permanently from the world and with man's 
.destiny after death. The PES, Sahara and Kumarila, how- 
ever, make substantial contributions to the exegesis of Vedic

texts. There are about three thousand quotations in Sahara's 
bhasya, out of which several hundred have not been yet identified. 
At least one thousand of these are taken from the Tai. S. and 
Br. About twelve adhikaranas are concerned with the Adhri- 
gupraisa ( a long formula ) which is quoted in H. of Dh. vol. II. 
p. 1121 note 2504. Some adhikaranas are devoted to the explana- 
tion of certain words in that praisa e. g. PMS IX. 4. 22 explains 
uruka as 'vapa', IX 4.23-24 explain 'prasasa', IX. 4, 25-27 
explain five words (syena, sala, kasyapa, kavasa, srekaparna). 
Similarly, X. 1. 32 explains the word brsaya as meaning * brhat.' 
Sahara's and Kumarila's stands on the individual soul and 
moksa confer on the P. M. system some status aB a philoso- 
phical one. For a systematic and exhaustive study of Sahara's 
contribution to Vedic and post-vedic exegesis, vide Dr. S. V. 
Garge's citations in Sabara-bhasya' pp. 140-213 (Poona, 1952). 

The doctrine that the Veda is eternal and of absolute and 
unquestioned authority has led to certain undesirable tendencies. 
Propounders of new doctrines make great efforts to show that 
there is Vedic authority for what they hold. 3?or example, the 
sutras in V. S. I. 1. 5-18 are concerned to show that the 
Upanisads do not postulate Pradhana as the cause of the world, 
as the Sankhyas imagine. Sankaracarya expressly states that 
the Sankhyas explain Vedanta passages as favourable to their 
theories and therefore a refutation of their arguments was 19W 
provided in V. S. I. 1. 5-18. It has been shown above how 
followers of Sakta worship try to interpret a verse like Rgveda V. ^ 
47. 4 (catvara Im bibhrati &c) as referring to the Sakta doetrineB* 
and how treatises dignified with the title of UpanisadB were 
produced by Sakta writers such as the Bhavanopanisad. Sahara 
in his bhasya on PMS. I. 1. 5 states that the Vijfianavadi 
Bauddhas put forward Br. Up. IV. 5 13 ( Vijnanaghana 
evaitebhyo bhutebhyah samutthaya tanyevanuvinasyati na 
pretya sanjnasti ) as supporting their position. One of the most 
glaring examples of this tendency is the explanation of #g. *• 
141. 1-3 by Anandatlrtha, also called Madhvacarya, who in 
•Mahabharata-tatparya-nirnaya* claims to be the third incarna- 
tion of Vayu, the other two being Hanumat and Bhlmasena, one

MadhvScanja's claim as avatSra of Vayu 1219 

of the Pandavas, and who endeavours to interpret Ug. 1. 141. 
1-3 as referring to tb.636 three avataras. 197s The words 
'Madhvah' and 'Matarisva,' (meaning 'wind-god') occur 
in Rg I. 141. 3. This was deemed sufficient to claim that 
Madhva, the -propounder of the "Dvaita system, was mentioned 
in the Rgveda. I do not know how Madhvacarya would have 
met the charge of Veda not being eternal if it referred 
to Bhlmasena ( who even according to the traditional account 
in the Mahabharata lived at the end of Dvapara age i. e. 
about 5000 years ago ) and to Madhva himself who lived barely 
seven centuries ago. The Veda would be later than these dates. 
The argument that this refers to a previous Kalpa would not he 
available to Tebut the charge, as the Kalpa, Manvantara and 
Mahayuga when Bhlma and Madhvacarya flourished and in the 
present day are the same. There was no pralaya (dissolution of 
the world) at the end of Dvapara and Kaliyuga immediately set 
in. The Bharata war was fought between Dvapara and Kali 
( Adiparva %. 13) and Kaliyuga was about to start at the time of 
that war (vide Vauaparva 'etat kaliyugam namacirad-yad 
pravartate' and Salya60. 25 '(praptam Kaliyugam viddhi)'. 
It is on account of this pretention that he was very roughly 
handled by eminent writers like Appayya-dlksita who charges 
Madhva with citing fabricated Vedio and other texts in support 
of his doctrines. Vide I A. vol. 62 at p. 189 where the writer, 
Shn Venkatasubbiah, sets out over thirty works mentioned by 
Madhva which he states occur nowhere else. M. M Chinna- 
swami, who has edited ( Benares, 1941 ) Appayya's work in 60 
verses with the commentary of Appayya called Madbvamata- 
vidhvamsana and notes of his own, sets out on p. 4 thirty-six 
unknown works and the sutras where they are cited by Appayya

It is remarkable that great aoaryas like Sankara and RSmanuj'a 
never claimed in their own works that they were tbe avataras 
of some deity. It was left to their disciples to say so, if at all. 

Haying established that Veda is eternal and self -existent the 
MimSmsakas give free rein to their ingenuity, powers of reason- 
ing and logic. They have a logic of their own whioh governed 
not only the interpretation of Vedio passages but also of the 
Smrtis and the medieval works on Dharmasastra ( including law 
and procedure). As Colebrooke, one of the most accurate and 
level-headed of Western scholars of Sanskrit, said more than 130 
years ago 'the disquisitions on the mlmamsa bear therefore a 
certain resemblance to juridical questions; and in fact, the 
Hindu law being blended with the religion of the people, tho 
same modes of reasoning are applicable and are applied to tho 
one as to the other. The logic of the Mimansa is the logic of tho 
law; the rule of interpretation of civil and religious ordinances. 
Each case is examined and determined upon and from the cases 
deoided the principles may be collected. A well-ordared arrango- 
ment of them would constitute the philosophy of law and this is 
in truth what has been attempted in the Mimansa' ( Miscella- 
neous Essays, Vol. I. pp. 316-317, Madras ed. of 1837 ). 

The first division of Vedic material is into Mantra and 
Bifflimaya. It has been already stated above (p. 1096 note 1776) 
that those are mantras that are recognized as suoh by the learned. 
P. M.S. (II. 1. 31-32) provides 1 " 9 that mantra is that whioh 
simply asserts (and is not hortatory) or (to say the samo thing 
in another way) ' those are mantras that are so called on account 
of their asserting something". On P. M. S. I 4. 1 Sahara 
describes mantra as one that at the time when the procodure of 
a sacrifice is being followed, recalls or reminds or makes clear to 
the performer the matter that is prescribed e.g. "I cut (tho 
blades of) kusa grass that is an abode for the deity*. This is 
only a general description of mantra and not an acourato defini- 
tion. Mantras are-not supposed to be useful in saorificos by

their mare utterance (uccarana) but aTe really ' abliidhayaka * 
(reminders of what is to be done or is being done). Sahara 
remarks that laksana is the only way for the recognition of 
mantaaa and not an enumeration of some characteristics of 
mantras as done by the Vrttikara such as these viz. 19B0 some 
end in'asi' (thou art) or'iua' as in Tai. S 1.1.1 'ise tva\ 
prayer or wish (as in 'ayurdha asi' in Tai. S. 1 6. 6. 1), praise 
(' agnir murdha divah' in Tai. S. IV. 4. 4). Sahara points out that 
'asi' and 'tva' occur even in the middle of mantras, the other 
characteristics such as blessing and praise are found in Brahma - 
nas also. The M B P. remarks that there are (p. 66) one 
hundred kinds of mantras and that if we take into account the 
fourteen Vedic metres and their sub-varieties there would be 273 
different varieties ot rk mantras alone (p 67). TheTe are cer- 
tain texts regarded as mantras (eg.' Vasantaya kapiftfalan- 
alabhate' V§]. S. 24. 20) which are not merely assertive but 
rather relate to the procedure of a yaga ( in the case of Vaj. S. 24. 
20, of Asvamedha). 

Mantras are classified under three heads viz. Rk, Saman 
and YajuB. These aTe defined in P MS. H. 1, 35-37 ; the name 
rk is^ applied to those »« man tras that are divided into feet, 
metrical padas (often) based on the meaning. Saman is the 
name applied to Vedic mantras that aTe sung. It has been 
established in P. M. S. VH. 2. 1-21 and IX. 2. 1-2 that the 
mantra »*» tests aTe not called Saman but only the music, that

qth is an action which manifests various tunes owing to the 
internal effort made by the Binger and in order to bring about 
the musical effect the singer has to resort to modifications of the 
letters of the rk, to disjunction (of parts of it ), to omission (of a 
letter), to repetition, to pauses, to 19B stoblta. In VU.2. 1-21 the 
PMS establishes that the words ' Bathantara-saman ', 'Brhat- 
satnan' refer only to the music and not to the rlt or basic text 
set to music. Yajas means those Vedic mantras that are neither 
rk nor suman. There jb another word 'nigada' applied to 
certain mantras that are addressed to others as directions to do 
certain acts and are uttered loudly such as ' agnldagnln vihara', 
'proksanirasadaya, ' idhmabarhirupasadaya ' . They are Yajus 
(i. e. in prose), the only difference being that they are loudly 
uttered ( in order that the persons to whom they are addressed 
may hear them), while ordinary Yajus is uttered inaudibly.

Mantra and Brahmana constitute the Veda. The P. M. 8. mi 
states that all those parts of the Veda that are not or cannot 
be called Mantra constitute Brahmana. Sahara notes that the 
Vrttikara, in order to enable students to deoide what texts are 
Brahmana texts, pointed out certain characteristics found in 
Brahmana texts such as abounding in the word 'iti* or 'ityaha* 
(so it is said), anecdote, stating the reason for an injunction, 
etymology, condemnation, praise, doubt, injunction, instance 
where another did something of the same kind, what happened in

Sahara also quotes two verses summarising under ten heads tne 

characteristics of Brahmana texts, points out that all this is 

only illustrative and that the characteristics mentioned by the 

VrttikaTa sometimes occur in mantias also, such as ' iti' in Rg. 

X.119 1 'ityaha'in Rg. VTX 41. 2, 'akhyayika' as in 5-g. I. 

116. 3, reason (lietu) in $g. I. 2, 4. The Rgveda alone contains 

over ten thousand mantras. Hardly one-third of them are 

employed in all the Vedic rites. The rest are employed in japa. 

Besides, the other Vedas also have thousands of mantras. 

Therefore, no formal definition of mantra is attempted and all 

that is stated is that mantras are those which have been 

recognised as such by the 19SS learned. 

Brahmanas are attached to each Veda, such as the Aitareya 

and Kausltaki Brahmanas to the Bgveda, the Taittiriya to the 

Krsna Yajurveda, the Satapatha to the Sukla Yajurveda, the 

Tandya to the Samaveda and Gopatha to the Yajurveda. The 

Brahmanas contain the "oldest known specimens of prose in 

Indo-European languages, though prose formulas (probably 

earlier in date than those in the Brahmanas ) are found in the 

Krsna and Sukla Yajurveda Samhitas. They are the primary 

source of information about sacrifices, ritual and priests. They 

contain numerous myths and legends put forward for illustrating 

ritual and sacrifices. They often mention contests between 

gods and asuras (titans) and abound in etymologies. Their 

contents can be divided into two broad classes, viz. injunctive 

(hortatory) passages (vidhis) and explanatory (or laudatory) 

passages ( arthavadas ). The scope and purpose of arthavadas 

will be explained later on. But one important point to be noted 

is that the Mlmamsakas are strongly opposed to holding that any 

part of the Veda, even the smallest, is useless or meaningless. 

It iB now time to see how the Mlmamsakas deal with the 
contents of the Veda. The extant Vedic literature is of

enormous extent and of greatly varied content. Once it is 
admitted that the Veda is self-existent and not the work of any 
author, human or divine, every sentence in it apparently 
becomes of infallible authority. The Veda being the only means 
of knowing Dharma, the Mlmamsakas had to accept that whatever 
the Veda says was authoritative and binding on them, as 
Sahara 19S7 admits. But many Vedic texts are apparently in 
conflict with each other and often are in conflict with ordinary 
experience. A few striking instances may be given to show 
how difficulties arose. The Tai. S V. 2. 7 and Mai. S state 'one 
should not pile the fire altar on (bare) earth, nor in the sky, nor 
in heaven ' . im No one can build a fire altar in the sky, nor in 
heaven. The Veda apparently prohibits something which is 
quite impossible and therefore this prohibition seems at first 
sight senseless. The Tai. Br. (HI 8. 10. 5 ) states that by offering 
the Purnahuti the performer secures all desired objects. If 
Purnahuti yields all objects, then one need not perform any 
further rites of Agnihotra &o Does tHe Veda mean this? The 
Veda contains stories and legends about individuals e. g. Tai. S. 
mentions Babara Pravahani who desired to be an eloquent 
speaker and therefore performed a sacrifice called Panearatra 
and secured his object. The Veda would then be later In time 
than this Babara and this would forfeit the claim of being 
eternal &c. Therefore, Sahara states that a story that never 
happened is described for the sake of praise. This may be an 
escape from a tight corner but the explanation does not redound

Veda and legends 1225 

to the credit of the Veda which is here admitted to have 
manuf actured a non-existent story for pushing up one of its 
injunctions; besides, if people come to know from what Sahara 
says that the story is false, people would not be induced to go in 
for performing that rite. A true story might encourage persona 
to follow the prescription of the Veda in this case. The 
Tantravartika (p. 125) on this explanation of Sahara tries to 
meet the objection raised here. Sometimes Veda is divided into 
three portions viz. Vidhi, Arthavada and Mantra, names of 
yagas like udbhid and viivajit being placed under vidhi. The 
Slokavartika refers to this threefold division in its last verse. 19s9 
Though the whole Veda is the only means of right knowledge 
about what Dharma is i. e. what should he done and what should 
not be done, the different parts of the Veda are not all directly 
related to right knowledge about Dharma. Large portions of the 
Veda are related only mediately to the principal part. 199 ° In one 
place Sahara very sucointly but clearly defines the three classes of 
Vedio texts and illustrates them. The Veda is also divided into 
five parts viz. vidhi, arthavada, mantra, namadheya and prati- 
sadha. These five have already been mentioned above. Here 
some details will have to be added on each of these. Vidhi is 
an injunction (or exhortation) that is meaningful on account of 
enjoining a matter that has a (useful) purpose and it prescribes

something that does not follow (or is not established by) from 
any other authority. Sahara -himself describes in many plaoes 
what vidbi means. For example, the injunction * one desirous of 
(attaining) Heaven should offer Agnihotra ' prescribes (the per- 
formance of ) homa that does not follow from any other authority 
and that has a beneficial purpose, its meaning being 'by the Agni* 
hotra offering one should effect (the attainment of) svarga '. Wherei 
however, a rite is otherwise established, all that can be done is 
only to enjoin an accessory with regard to it Thus in tbe 
sentence 'one should offer an oblation with curds' the homa 
being already established by the words 'one should ofier 
Agnihotra (if one desires heaven ) ' all that is enjoined is the 
offering of curds with regard to it, the meaning being 'by curds 
one should effect the oblation *. Vide Tup-tika on P. M. S, VI. 3. 
17 and M. N. P. p. 17 ( B. O. It. I ed. ). »» 

The collection of vidhis in the Vedic texts forms the core of 
the Veda and refers to many specific rites The central element 
in a vidhi is the verb or verbal form, which will be analysed 
later on. The question is : how is one to recognize a vidhi. 
Sahara quotes a verse which those who know the propositions 
about the meanings of words and sentences deolare traditionally, 
viz. in all the Vedas the fixed (or definite) sign of a vidhi is the 
words 'one shall do', 'it should he done', 'it ought to be done', 
« it should be so', it ought to be so'. 1992 From this it follows that 
a vidhi is ordinarily couched in the optative form ( called vidbi- 
ling in Sanskrit), and that a verb in the present tense cannot 
ordinarily be taken as laying down a vidhi ,593 But sometimes 
a vidhi may be inferred even. from a text in which the verb is in 
the present tense For example, there is a vedio text occurring 
in the MahSpitryajna which states '"he should follow holding the

fuelstiek below the handle of the ladle in the pitryajfia, since the 
performer of rites for the god3 holds the fuel-stick above the 
handle. 1991 This has been construed as a vidhi (exhortation) 
and not as a mere arthavada. Another example is that of 
Ratrisattras (Soma sacrifices occupying more than twelve days). 
A passage in the context of Ratrisattras states 'those who 
perform ratrisaitra attain stability ( or fame ), aTe endowed with 
brahma lustre and eat or possess food '. This looks likeameie 
praise (arthavada) of the performance of ratrisattras, hut really 
it is a vidhi' about the reward of ratrisattra mentioned in the 
above passage and states an exception to the rule that svarga is 
the reward of a rite in which no reward is specified by the Vedic 
texts. This is employed in the Mit. on Yaj. HI 326 which 
states that the sin committed through ignorance is removed by 
the performance of penances Ordinarily, a sinful act is deemed 
to be destroyed by undergoing the penalty that God may inflict, 
but Yaj. states a special rule. Medhatithi on Manu "V. 40 
( stating that animals, birds and herbs dying by being offered in 
yannas reach higher levels) says that this is merely an arthavada 
and no vidhi can be imagined from -this by the maxim of 
Ratrisattra. «s Tide Par. M. (1.1. p . 149 ) which holds that an

adhiharavidhi about one dosiroua of stability has been assumed 
froratho passage about ratrisattra. Eaghunandana in Bksda- 
sltattva (p. 28) oxplains the sutras ( P. M. S. IV. 3. 17-19) ana 
illustrates this nydya. 

Following the Vodas, tbe Smrtis also lay down numerous 
vidhis by means of vorbal optative forms or participles ending 
in ' ya, tavya &c". For example, vido Manu IV. 25 'agnihotram ea 
jubuyat* and XI. 53 ( ' caritavyam-ato &c.') as instances of the 
two ways. From different points of view udfn is classified in 
variouB ways. One classification is into four, Utpaltividln 
( originative injunction ), Vimyoyavidht (applicatory), prayoga 
vidhx (performance), adhihoi a-vtdhi (eligibility). Utpattividhi 
is one which shows in a general way the nature of the rite, as 
in 'agnihotram juhoti' (he offers the agnihotra oblation); an 
applicatory injunction is one which conveys the connexion of a 
subsidiary matter with the main rite as in 'dadhna juhoti* {he 
offers oblation witbourds) and this is dealt with in the 3rd 
chapter of the P. M. S. ; a prayogavidhi is an injunction that 
governs the order of parts in a rite and suggests non-delay or 
promptness in the performance, though often times it is implied 
rather than expressly stated. This is considered in the chapters 
IV and V of the P. M.S. An Adhikaravidhi (injunction of 
qualification or eligibility) is one that points to the ownership 
of the fruit of an action as in 'svargakamo yajeta' (bo who 
desires to secure heaven should perform a yaga). 1996 This is 
the subject of the 6th chapter of P. M. S.

Another classification of vidhts 1229 

Another and an important classification is apurva-vidhi 
( injunction of something quite new and not otherwise establish- 
ed as in 'svaigakamo yajeta'), niyamavidhi (a restrictive 
injunction) as in 'he pounds the rice* and parisankhyavidhi 
(an injunction in form where two alternatives being simul- 
taneously possible one is precluded). The Tantravartika defines 
these three in a well-known verse. vm For a sacrifice a plot of 
land is required which may be quite flat or may have ups and 
downs. Here there are two alternatives only and both cannot 
be availed of at the same time ( i. e. a man cannot perform a 
sacrifice at the same time on even as well as on uneven ground ). 
Therefore, ' same dese yajeta' (one should offer a sacrifice on an 
even spot) is "a myama (it restricts the performance to flat 
land only) and excludes the use of uneven land for a sacrifice. 
'Five five-nailed animals are to be eaten". This is a 
parisankhya This sentence is not a vidhi, as eating flesh is 
already established by men's appetites. Nor is it a niyama, 
since one can eat the flesh of five-nailed animals as well as of 
other animals at the same time. It is a parisankhya. i e. it 
prohibits the eating of the flesh of animals other than of five 
five-nailed animals. In form the sentence is a vidhi (as it 
employs the word •bhaksyah' (which is optative or potential 
passive participle ), but in substance it is a prohibition of eating 
the flesh of animals other than the five five-nailed ones The

word parisankhya occurs in P. M. S X. 7. 4 and 7 and Sahara 
notes that it is liable to three faults. IWS 

Dharmasastra writers make frequent use of the doctrine of 

myama and parisankhya. Medhatithi on Manu III. 45 (rtuka- 

labhigaml syat ) has a long note on niyama and parisankhya, 

quotes the verse of Tantravartika and explains the passage about 

five five-nailed animals. The Mit. also on Yaj on L 79 (tasmin 

yugmasu samviset 'the husband should -approach the wife^on 

every even night next to the 4th night up to the J16th after her 

monthly illness starts) and on L 81 holds a lengthy discussion 

whether there is a vidhi or niyama or parisankhya. The Mit. 

defines the three in prose, cites examples and tells us that some 

thought that there was only a parisankhya, while Bbaruci, 

Visvar&pa, and others ( including the Mit ) hold that there is 

a niyamavidhi only in I. 79 and 81. Ap. Dh. S. H. 1. 17 

deals with the same subject as Yaj. L 79 and 81 ana 

Haradatta says it is a niyama, while others thought it was 

a parisankhya 'and that in any oase it is not a pure vidhi. 

On Gautama V. % Haradatta comments that the acarya (i.e. 

Gautama) holds that there is a 1 parisankhya- only (the sutra 

is ' sarvatra va pratisiddhavarjam'). Compare Yaj. I. 81 

(yathakami bhaved-vapi &c. ), on which the Mit. emphatically 

says that in both Gautama and Yaj. there is a restrictive rule 

(niyama). Gautama prescribes that a brahmana should eat at 

the houses of persons of the three higher classes that are 

commended for the performance of their duties and should 

receive gifts also from such persons. Haradatta treats these 

two rules as 1999 parisankhyavidhis. £p. Dh. S. II. provides the 

rules of conduct for husband and wife after their marriage, the 

first being 'taking food two times (morning and evening) . 

Haradatta takes it as a parisankhya, meaning that eating _ a 

third time is prohibited (but they may or may not eat twice m 

the day ), while others take it as a niyama meaning tney muss 

eat twice in the day '. . „______ - •

Classification of myamaoidkts 1231 

Niyamavidhis are of three classes, viz. those concerned with 
pialimdhis (substitutes), those about pratipatti ( concluding act 
or final disposal of certain materials employed in a sacrifice), and 
those that are concerned with matters other than the preceding 
two. The Tandy a-brahmana says J0W * if one is not able to obtain 
the soma plant, one may extract juice from pfflikas *. Jai. HE. 6. 
40 and VI. 3 13-17 deal with this matter and Jai. and Sahara 
prescribe that if no soma plant is available in a soma sacrifice, 
the sacrificer should substitute putlkas for Soma and no other 
substance, even if the latter be more similar to Soma, can be 
used. 4001 The word prahpatti is used in several sutras by Jai ; 
vide IV. %. 11, 15, 19, 22) The casting into water of all 
utensils and things smeared with some ( such as the dregs left 
after Soma is extracted, the stones, two wooden boaTds and the 
post of udumbara in the midst of the sodas ) at the time of the 
final purificatory bath (avahhrtha) in Jyotistoma is said to he 
pratipattikarma (P. M S. IV. 2. 22). This terminology is 
employed in DharmasSstra works. Manu (HX 262-263) 
provides that out of the three pindas (halls of boiled rice) that 
are offered to the three male ancestors of the performer of 
Sraddha the wife desirous of a son should eat the middle pinda 
{meant for the paternal grandfather ) and Devala provides that 
the pindas may be given to a bTahmana or may be eaten by a 
goat or a cow or cast into fire or water. 1002 This is the 
pratipatti of the pindas according to ApaTarka ( on Y§ j. I. 256 ) 
and the Sm. CHp 486. Vide H. of Dh. voL IV pp. 480-481. 
The word pratipatti is opposed torn thakwrma. For example, in 
Tai. S. we read 'after the soma plant is bought, he gives the staff 
to the Maitravaruna priest '. Here the staff had been first given 
to the performer (Yajamana) at the time of Diksa and then 
transferred to the Maitravaruna who has several uses for it, viz. 
he can walk with its help in darkness, may enter water, cau 
prevent cows and snakes from, coming near him and he can

Bupport himself on it. So this is different from pratipatti, where 
the substance is finally disposed of and no further UBe is made of 
it. This is dealt with in P. M. S. IV. 2. 16-18. This (giving of 
the Btaff ) is m IhaJcarma as opposed to pratipatti-karma. This 
is mentioned inTai. S. VI. T. 4. 2(krlte some maitravarunaya 
dandam prayacchati &c.). Another example of pratipatti is the 
casting of the horn of the black antelope on the catvfila ( Tai. S. 
VI. I. 3. 8 and PMS IV. 2. 19 ). PMS XX 2. 66-68 deal with an 
example of arthakarma. Cremating a sacrificer when dead with 
his implements of sacrifice (mentioned inTai. S. 1. 6. 8. 2-3) is 
pratipattikarma of the implements (P. M. S. XL 3. 34). Manu 
V. 167 provides that if the wife of an UhitUgni dies before hint 
she is to be cremated with the sacred fires set up by him and 
with the sacrificial implements. An example of the third kind 
of niyama ( which is not concerned with pratinidhi or pratipatti) 
is ' one should take his meal, 20(B facing the east'. A man can 
take food facing any direction but this restricts him to the east 
alone. Here no question of a pratinidhi or of pratipatti arisess. 

Vidhis are also divided into Kratwrtlia (for the rite) and 
Puruffirtha ( for the man ) They are concerned with ' Prayukti '. 
(motivating force ) which is the subject of chapter IV of the P.M. 
S. P. M. S. IV. 1. 2 defines 2m purusartha and Sahara advances 
three interpretations of that sutra, one of which is * (PurusSrtha) 
is that matter on doing which follows the happiness of man, as its 
understanding is due to man's desire for obtaining it (happiness) 
and purusartha (man's purpose) is not different (from happiness)'. 
From this rather obsoure and clumsy definition it appears to 
follow that purusartha is what a man ordinarily undertakes for 
securing the reward of happiness, while kratvartha is that which 
helps in the accomplishment of purusartha and does not itseM 
directly yield any reward to the performer. All principal sacri- 
fices like Darsa-purnamasa are included under purusartha, while 
under kratvartha are" put all those auxiliary acts that have the

purpose of accomplishing the principal rite itself e. g. the five !WS 
prayajas that are auxiliary to the Darsapurnamasa are Kratvar- 
tha, while Darsapurnamasa itself is purusartha. The importance 
of this distinction lies in this that if what is kratvartha is not 
followed the rite itself becomes defective, while if what is 
purusartha is not Mowed, the result is that the man- himself 
becomes blamable or sinful but tha undertaking or rite does not 
become defective One set of the three interpretations of P. M. B. 
IV. 1. 2 given by Sahara is that it refers to the rules about the 
acquisition of wealth viz. that a brahmana should earn wealth 
by receiving gifts, a ksatriya by conquest and a vaisya by 
agriculture and the like (vide Gaut X. 40-42, Manu X 76-79). 
These are in the nature of niyamaa. If the acquisition of 
wealth is kratvartha and, if one acquires wealth by means 
other than those prescribed by the Sastra and performs a 
sacrifice with such wealth, the sacrifice itself would he defective 
and would not yield the desired reward. But if the acquisition of 
wealth be purusartha, then, by whatever means wealth with which 
a yaga is to he performed be obtained, the sacrifice would not be 
affected. The Mit on 3005 Yaj. n. 114 quotes a passage from 
Guru PrabhSkara (vide note 1947) which is quoted by the 
Dayabhaga also (II. 67 ) but without name, while the Sm. 0. II 
pp. 257-58), Madanaratna (on VyavaMra pp. 324-325) and 
Vyavaharaprakasa (p. 420) quote a similar passage from the 
Nayaviveka. Visvarupa also on TSj. H. 144 holds that rules 
about acquisition of wealth are ' purusartha '. To acquire wealth 
is natural to man and acquisition of wealth does not depend 
upon Sastra. Besides, every one can directly perceive that 
wealth when earned confers pleasure on the acquirer. Therefore, 
wealth is purusartha and sacrifices which are performed with 
wealth are also purusartha. The general rule is that all angas 
(auxiliary rites) are kratvartha and all principal ritea (like

DarSapurnamasa, Somayaga) aTe purus&rtha; all texts presori- 
bing the rewards of rites are purus&rtha. Some individual 
examples may be given. 

In the SsnkhSyana Br. (VLU) after saying that certain 
observances (vrata) mnst be followed by ~ the sacrifioer, it is 
provided that he should not sea the sun rising or setting. 
These observances are called ' Prajapativratani ' by Sahara and 
are declared by him to be purusartha, the meaning being that 
the sacriflcer should make a resolve not to see the rising or 
Betting sun. 

This distinction between Kratvartha and Purusarfha 

is often taken over into Dharmasastra matters. For example, 

Yaj. I 53 provides that one should marry a girl who is free from 

diseases, has a brother and who does not belong to the same 

gotra or piavara as that of the bridegroom. The Mit ^ 

explains that the status of being a wife does not at all arise if 

the girl is a sapiyfa or is of the same gotta or pi ami a as the 

bridegroom ( i. e. marriage itself is null and void), but a girl who 

has some disease when married becomes a wife, the only result 

being that there is a visible defeot (such as a diseased wife is a 

constant source of anxiety and unhappiness). Kulluka on 

Manu HL 7 (providing that one should not marry a girl from a 

family in which prevail diseases like phthisis, epilepsy, white 

and black leprosy, refers to this dootrine of Sahara elaborated 

above. The Mit. onYaj III. 280 quotes a verse «a wise man 

should not marry a girl who has no brother, nor father, for 

fear that she may be a putnka (daughter appointed as a son}. 

Here the prohibition is like the prohibition of marrying ; a 

deformed girl i. e. it is a perceptible purpose. Therefore, m 

marriage would be valid i. e. the prohibition is purasartba- 

Manu says (IX 168) * that is known to be an adopted son whom 

the mother or father might give (to another) with water ma 

time of distress &o. '. The Mit. on Yaj. IL 130 quotes this verse 

and remarks that, as the word 'distress' is specifioall y^ntioned^ 

,a son is not to be given in adoption to another when there is no 

distress and that this prohibition would affect «0y«J MP* 

(hut not the act of adopti on) i e. this prohibrti o^wouM^ 

against marrying a sapinda. sagotra or sapravara gW is »W», 
about not marking a diseased girl is only g^wtd. 



Kratvarika and Purusartha distinguished 1S535 

purusaTtha and not kratvartha. mis It may be noted that the 
Vyavaharamayiikha disagrees and holds that the prohibition is 
kratvartha. It may be said in a general way that those prescrip- 
tions that have an invisible, spiritual or other-worldly result 
ot reward are kratvartha, while those that have a visible result 
are purusartha. 

Before proceeding further it is necessary to analyse the 
notions underlying the word 'yajeta' used in such Vedic 
sentences as 'one desiring heaven should offer a sacrifice' 
(svargakamo yajeta). In the word 'yajeta' 2009 there are two 
parts viz. the root 'yaj' (to sacrifice) and the termination (of 
injunctive third person singular). In the termination also 
there are two parts (elements) viz. general verbal nature and 
injunctiveness (or injunctive force). General verbal naturals 
found in the ten lakwas (verbal forms in ten moods and tenses), 
but injunctiveness is found only in the injunctive form. Both 
general verbal nature and injunctiveness express only bhUvana 
(force that brings into being something, efficient force). 
Bhavana (lit ) means a particular operation or activity of an 
agent which conduces to the coming into being of the result (lit. 
which is to come into being). And this bhavana is of two 
kinds, sabdi (word force) and arllii (result-producing force ). 

It has been already stated that vidhis are the very core of 
the Veda. The doctrine of bhavana is the very heart of vidhis 
and is therefore one of the most important doctrines of the 
mlmamsa. 

In ordinary life when a person says to another ' this should 

be done by you , the prompting to do something comes from a 

person. But Veda has according to the Mlmamsa no author 

human or divine. Therefore, in a Vedic vidhi the pronip- 

ng arises from the injunctive or the optative form of the word • 

r™??™' - hllman ° f divine - b6hind the injunction;' 
S ll b \ avan5 f saidt0 b <> Sabdi (U based on the word 
itself and not on the will or di rection of a person) . There.

fore, sabdl-bhsvana is defined as a particular operation (or 
activity) of an agent (here the word of the Veda) that conduces 
to the activity of a man ; and it is expressed by that part or 
element which iB optative. It is called 'eabdV because it is 
'sabdanistba (centred in the word of the Veda) and not 
purusanistha (centred in a person ), In a sabdlbhavans there 
are three elements viz. (1 ) there is prompting of the agent to 
activity, (2) the injunction is the instrument and (3) the 
manner is furnished by the desirableness proclaimed by artha- 
vada passages. The sabdl-bhavanS gives rise to artbl-bhavana. 
In an arthl-bhavana ( that aims at or seeks the artha, tho phala) 
also there are three elements viz, (1) svarga is the pliala that 
is "to be brought about, (2) the means or instrument is yaga, 
(3) there is also the procedure or method (itfkartavyata)of the 
yaga. All this is based on the P. M. S, sutra II. 1. 1, on Sabara'B 
bhasya and certain important verses of the Tantravariika 
quoted below. This whole discussion leads on to the idea of 
apurva. Yaga lasts for a short time, while svarga comes to a 
man after death, which may be years after the performance of 
the sacrifice. "What is the connecting link between yaga and 
svarga (the cause and the result)? It is the force or potency 
generated by yaga that brings about svarga. 

Briefly, the idea is; both the root and the affix together 
express the sense of the affix and as the bhavanS ia the princpal 
element in this, it is held to be the sense of the affix. There are 
numerous aM0 'bhavasabdas' such as yajati, juhoti, dadatii

Two kinds of bhava&dbdas 1237 

dogdhi, pinasti. These are of two sorts, viz. -pradhana 
(principal) and gunabhuta. 20U Those by which a substance is 
not intended to be produced or embellished (or made fit) for 
a religious rite, are expressive of principal karma (such as 
prays jas), while those which are meant to produce a substance 
or to make a substance fit are guwbhuta ( such as pounding rice 
grains or chiselling a piece of wood for making a sacrificial post, 
wiping sruc ladle) Therefore the latter kind of actions are 
called gunakarma. There are two kinds of verbal forms 

( 1 ) those in which the form only conveys that the Jcarta ( doer 
of the action) exists such as the forms 'asti, bhavati, vidyate'; 

(2) there are others where not only there is the existence of the 
larta but there is also the understanding of some activity that 
produces a result such as 'yajati 1 (meaning 'yagam karoti'), 
' dadati' ( i. e. danam karoti ), ' pacati ' (pakam karoti), 'gacohati ' 
i. e gamanam karoti ). That is, in such cases the sense of karoti 
is also understood. Jaimini (in P. M. S. H. 1. 4 ) divides words 
into two classes viz. Namani (nouns) and Karmasabdah ( verbs). 
Under the first Sabara would include pronouns and adjectives. 
The 2nd is called 'akhyata' Sabara (on II. 1. 3.) paraphrases 
(namani as ' dravya-gunasabdah ' and remarks that in the sutra 
(IE. 1.3) the word 'namani' is employed in the sense of 
dravyagunasabdah' 20W . Sabara remarks that dhatvarlha (the

We must now turn to the 2nd great division of Vedio texts, 
viz. Arthavadas. They are dealt with in P. M. S. first adhySya, 
2nd pada. Thore are numerous Vedio passages such as 'he 
roared; because he roared he came to be called Eudra' (Tai S. I, 
5. 1. 1. ), « Prajapati out out his own fat ' ( Tai, S. IT. 1. 1. 4 ), ' the 
gods, having reached tho sacrificial ground, did not know the 
directions * (Tai S VI. 1. 5. 1. ); ' who knows whether one lives in 
the other world or not ' ( Tai. S, VI. ILL); ' there should be no 
piling of fire altar on the earth nor in the sky nor in heaven * 
(Tai S. V 2.7,1 ). The objector sayB ' you have yourself declared 
that enjoining religious rites is the purpose of the Veda ' ( P. M. 
S.I. 1,2). The above and similar passages do not serve any 
purpose in the matter of religiouB acts, they are therefore useless 
and are non-eternal (or do not refer to any permanent matter). 
The reply is that these passages form one syntactical or 
connected whole with hortatory passages of the Veda and they 
serve the purpose of commending (or glorifying) the hortatory 
passages. Sahara cites on I 2. 7 the passage 'one desiring 
prosperity should sacrifice a white animal in honour of Vayu; 
Vayu indeed is the swiftest deity ; he runs near Vayu with the 
share proper (to Vayu); he (Vayu) leads the saorificer to 

prosperity'. 2011 These words form one whole passage ; the first

Vidhi and Arthavada exemplified 1239 

part 'vSyavyam ..bhutikamah ' is clearly a vidhi, as the word 
'alabheta (in the optative form) shows. The latter portion is 
an arthavada for the purpose of commendation. People are 
familiar with the fact that Vayu is swift. Therefore, the latter 
portion (Yayurvai &o.) merely repeats what is already well 
known (that is, it is an anuvada). In sutras 19-25 of I. 2 the 
P. M. S. considers certain passages that look like vidhis but are 
declared to be arthavadas. For example, (Tai. S. IL 1. 1. 6 ) ' the 
sacrificial post is to be of udumbara wood; the udumbara wood 
is indeed vigour (or food or sap); cattle are vigour; by this 
strong (or juicy) post, he (sacrificer) secures cattle, for 'the 
securing of strength*. The objector says that this is a phalaudhi 
(an injunctive text about a result) as the words 'urjosvaru- 
ddhyai' contain the purpose and there is no word of commenda- 
tion. The reply is that there is only commendation. 

There are some passages in the Veda in whioh occur words 
like *hi' (because) such as in 'one should offer into fire the 
oblation with the winnowing basket, because food is prepared by 
means of if ( Tai. Br. I. 6. 5 ). s °" The question that arises is

whether this and other passages containing words odenoting 
reason should be construed as arfchavadaB commending what is 
enjoined in the preceding sentence or whether as stating a 
reason for the injunction. The established conclusion is that 
they are commendatory. If the other view were adopted ( viz. 
that sruti gives a reason for the vidhi ) then it may be argued 
that the ladle, pan and other utensils also may be used for 
making an offering ( not merely the surpa ), as they also are 
required in preparing food. Ragbunandana in Malamasatattva 
p. 760 relies upon and explains this maxim with reference to 
Laghu-Harita's words * cakravat parivarteta suryah kalavasfid 
yatah*. It should not be supposed that commendation (stuh) 
is the purpose of all arthavadaB. In ' he lays down anointed 
pebbles, ghee is indeed brilliance ' (Tai. Br. III. 2 5. 12) a doubt 
arises about the material with which pebbles are to be anointed* 
That doubt is removed by the remainder of the passage that it 
is ghee with which they are to be anointed ( P. M. S. X 4. 24 ) 

Arthavadas are of three kinds viz. gunavada, anuvada and 
bhutarthavada; ' when an arthavada text iB in conflict with 
ordinary experience it is metaphorical, when something is 
definitely ascertained by other means of knowledge and becomes 
the subject of a text it is called anuvada and when a text is not 
opposed to other pramanas or is not definitely ascertained 
otherwise, it is called ' bhutarthavada ' (statement of an accompli- 
shed faot, or of a past event); in this way arthavada is of three 
kinds*. mi6 An example of the first kind is 'during day-time

while the latter part containing a reason (m *sa hi &c •) is on arthavada,

viz. that Jatmim flourished in the 13th century A, D and secondly (p 13'

assigniing of a reason are to be deemed not as vidhis but simply a* 
artbavadas (recommendatory)*. This case went np to the Privy Council as

only the smoke of fire is seen and not its flame' (this is Tai. 
Br II 1. 2 10 }. One sees both, smoke and fire during the day 
and night. What this text desires to emphasize is that by day 
the light of fire is not so well seen as at night ( or not well seen 
from a distance by day as at night ). 

'Fire is the medicine (antidote ) for cold' ( Vaj. S. 23. 10 and 
Tai S VH. 4. 18. 2) is cited by some as an example of anuvada. 
The M B. P. finds fault with this on the ground that it is 
well-known as a mantoa and does not form part of a vidhi by 
syntactical relation, and that it is cited by Nrsimhasrama as an 
example owing to negleejfc of the study of the Veda or absent- 
mindedness. A proper example would be ' Vayu indeed ia the 
swiftest deity* cited above. 'Prajapati cut off his own fat* is 
cited by some as an example of bhutarthavada, but the M. B.P. 
does not approve of it and cites the -?erse 'yan-na duhkhe'na

happened in bygone ages). »» Devala states that sagos have 
laid down expiation for the first wrong, for committing a second 
double of that, for committing a third time thrice as much but 
there is no expiation for committing it a fourth time. The 
Prayasoitta-prakarana of Bhavadeva says that this is not to be 
taken literally, but it is only nindarthavada. The P. M. S, itiself 
(VI. 7. 26 and 30) states that parakrti and purakalpa are 
arthavadas. 

The VyavahSra-mayukha quotes a verse of Devala im 'on 
the father's death the eons should divide the paternal wealth, for 
they have no ownership as long as the father who suffers from 
no blemish (that deprive him of ownership ) is alive '. Here the 
first half lays down a time for partition (it is a vidhi), the 
latter half is only an arthavada praising the vidhi and means 
that, as long as the father is alive, the sons are not independent 
and not that they have no ownership in ancestral property. 

Smrtis also abound in arthavadas. For example, MedhStitbi 
on Manu V. 56 (na mamsabhaksane dosah ) says that from V. 
28 up to V. 56 all verses except two or three are arthavadas. 
Medhatithi points out in several other places in the Manuamrti 
a few vidhis and numerous arthavadas. J?or example, Manu 
II. 117 contains a vidhi about abhtvUdana, while verses II.

S7nrU examples of anuvada 1%4& 

118-131 are arthavadas in relation to it. In Manu II. 165 a 
vidhi is laid down for the study of the -whole Veda by persons of 
the three upper classes; when Manu (X. I) again lays down that 
the three classes should study the Veda, this is merely an 
anuvada. Medhatithi on Manu. IX 135 remarks that many 
verses in Manu contain arthavadas. 

The Vasistha-dharmasutra and Visnudharmottara 2018 provide 
that coVs urine, excreta, milk, curd3, clarified butter, water in 
which kusas have been dipped and a fast for a day and night 
will purify even a svapaka. A Svapaka was the lowest amongst 
untouchables and followed the same avocations as a candala and 
was governed by the same rules (vide Manu X 51-56 ). This 
verse is not to be taken literally, as nothing could make a 
candala touchable, Therefore, this is a mere arthavada meant to 
praise the purifying effects of pancagavya and a fast. 

It would have been noticed that every Vedic passage is not 
of the nature of a vidhi (of an injunctive or exhortatory 
character). There are numerous Vedic passages that are 
commendatory of a vidhi, condemn an act that is prohibited, 
give an illustration of some one having performed the vidhi in 
the past or pat forward an easily understood reason for the 
specific act which ig enjoined. These commendatory, condemna- 
tory and illustrative passages are not to be treated as unnecessary 
or purposeless, but are to be taken along with the vidhi passages 
to complete their full import. This doctrine of arthavadas saves 
a huge portion of Vedic texts from being neglected or treated as 
unnecessary.

Tantravartika makes 21 " 9 a general statement that arthavada 
passages coming after mdhi passages are weak, while those that 
borne before vidhis are stronger. 

The 3rd olasB of Vedio texts are mantras. They have already- 
been treated above (vide p. 1220, notes 1979 ff. ). Some mantras 
also lay down an injunction as in Rg X. 117. 5 'prnlyad-in- 
nadhafnanaya-tavyan ' (the strong must bestow wealth on ofie 
Who begs), also the mantra 'vasantaya kapinjalanSlabhate' 
(Vaj S, 24. 20 ) cited above on p. 1221. But generally mantras 
are only expressive or assertive and call to mind things that are 
connected with the acts enjoined by vidhi-vakyas ( injunctive 
passages). The Tantravartika 2020 notes that it is definitely 
understood that religious aots that are performed with mantras 
that recall to the mind the things enjoined lead to prosperity (or 
to svarga). The reader would notice how the Furvamlmamsa. 
system came to relegate mantras to a secondary place and made 
them play a passive role in the sacrificial system. The Rgveda 
contained sublime prayers, but in the mlmamsa system the most 
prominent place was given to Brahmana texts, that contained 
almost all the vidhis. It has been seen above pp. 950-952 how 
ftgveda mantras are full of faith (bha/di) in God and fervent 
appeals to God after confession of sin and repentance, vide ftg. 
VII, 86. 4-6 ( kim-aga asa varuna jyestham &c ) ; Eg. HI. 39 h 
a hymn full of beatitude, verse 2 of which says 'this prayer 
(dhlh) born of yore in heaven, sung in the holy assembly with 
earnestness, dressed in pure (lit-white) and auspicious garb is 
ours, ancient and inherited from our forefathers ' 

The 4th part of Vedio texts bearing on Dharma is 'Naraa- 
dheya' (proper names of sacrifices). There are such texts as 
'one should sacrifice with the udblud' (TandyaBr. 19.7.J-3), 
■ one desirous of possessing cattle should sacrifice with air a' 
(Tai. S. H. 4. 6. 1) The question is whether in these passages what 
is laid down is some substance to be offered in some rite (as in

and above p. 137 by the fluwg?* 



Udbhid and otheis are names of yagas 1245 

'dadhna juhoti) or whether they are names of sacrifices. Ho 

suhstance is well-known as 'udbhid* ( as dadhi is a well-known 

substance ). Citra means a female animal of variegated colour. 

If it is gunavidhi ( in the case of ' citraya. yajeta'), there would 

be the fault of V&kyabheda ( one sentence broken up as laying 

down two vidhis) i e. the injunction would be that a female 

pa&u was to be sacrificed ( not a male ) and further injunction 

that its colour should be variegated. Therefore, Udbhid, Citra, 

Balabhid, Abhijit, Visvajit ( Kausltaki Br. 25. 14) and Agnihot- 

ra (P.M.S 1 4 4), Vajapeya (P. M S 14 6-8), Vaisvadeva 

(P. M. S I 4 13-16) are names of rites and are not substances. 

Similarly, in ' Syenenabhicaran yajsta' (one practising black 

magic for bringing about the death of an enemy may perform a 

yaga called syena). Here 'syena' iB the name of a yaga, 

because the yaga swoops down upon the enemy and seizes him 

just as a falcon swoops down upon its victim and catches it 

(Sadvimsa Br. ID 8. 1. 3 ). The point to be noted is that these 

names serve the purpose of ffla particularising the meaning of 

what is enjoined. The Vedic text * svadhyayoSdhyetavyah ' 

enjoins the study of the Veda consisting of all parts including 

namadheyas of sacrifices and we directly see that in such Vedic 

vidhis as 'Citraya yaj'eta pasukamah' the name citra is a part 

of the vidhi. Therefore, namadheya also is a purusartha and is 

authoritative like other parts of the Veda (vide Sastradlpika 

on Jai. I. 4. 1 ) In the sentences mentioned above yaga is 

enjoined with the fruit as the object, since it is not otherwise 

established. Since it is not intended to lay down a general 

injunction to sacrifice, a specific variety of sacrifice has to be 

enjoined. When one wants to know the specific variety 

enjoined, from the word 'udbhid' it is known that it is the 

sacrifice called udbhid Dharmasastra writers apply tins 

maxim called 'Udbhid-nyaya' to 'Upanay ana' which literally

1246 History of Dharmaiastra { Sea VII, Ch. XS1X 

The fifth (and last) part of Vedio texts consists of 
prahsedha' (nisedha, prohibition). Prohibitions »» S a 
ends of man by causing men to desist from actions whlchwould 
produce undesirable results. To explain, just as vil^vS 
express an urge or prompting (to do something), suggest in 
order to effectuate their prompting quality, that the matter to be 
enjoined such as a sacrifice is the means to attain a desirable 
result and so urge a man to do it, so also prohibitions such as 
one should not eat Kalafija (red garlic)' or 'one should net 
utter what is false' (Tai. S H. 5. 5. 6) denote a turning away 
and m order to effectuate their own deterring quality, suggest 
that the thing to be prohibited viz. eating kalafija or speaking 
untruth will be the cause of bringing about an undesirable 
result and so make a man desist from it. The particle 'na' 
may come before a verbal form, a noun or an adjective and 'na' 
becomes in certain cases 'a' (as in ' abrahniana, " 'adharma') 
and ' an' in certain others when it is prefixed to a word beginn- 
ing with a vowel (as in 'anasva', 'anusna'). Panini devotes 
several stttras to 'na' and expressly refers to 'pratisedha' as one 
of the meanings conveyed by ' na ' (vide Pan. EL 2. 6, VI 2. 155 
&c.) 2MS ; 'na'H said to convey sixsenses as noted in the verao 
quoted below. 20M 

The first meaning of 'na' is 'abhava' (non-existenoe). 
But that meaning would not suit all oases When one says 
' bring abrahmana ' the meaning conveyed is not ' non-existenoe ' 
since, if that were the meaning, one could not bring non-exist- 
ing brahmana and so might not bring any one at all, or might

Meanings of 'na' 1247 

bring a clod of earth which would not fulfil any purpose of the 
person addressing these words and therefore, on hearing this, a 
person not a brahmana but resembling a brahmana (such as a 
ksatriya) is brought So in this case 'abrahmana' means a 
person other than a brahmana; 'na' also conveys the opposite 
(virodha) of that to which it is prefixed It has been seen 
above that the verb is the main part in a sentence and in the 
verbal form it is the termination that is the principal paTt, So, 
in ' one must not eat kalafija ' the negative particle ' na ' must 
ba held to be connected with the optative termination in 'hbak- 
sayet*. In a vidhi 1027 (or on hearing a vidhi) one perceives 
that the sentence urges the listener to be active. When ' na' is 
prefixed to an optative from it conveys the opposite of urging 
viz. l mtttt(ana , (desisting from something) The phala that 
one understands from a vidhi is as in 'yajeta svargakarnah ' 
svarga, while in a prohibition the phala is cessation of harm 
(anartha-nivrtti). The adhikan in a vidhi is one who desires 
svarga ; in a nisedha the adhikarl is one who is afraid of harm 
and desires to avoid what is undesirable. Therefore, these 
considerations establish that exhortation and prohibition are 
entirely different in their import. 

^ But when there is an obstacle or difficulty in construing 
na with the verbal termination, then it is construed with the 
meaning of the root. These obstacles are of two sorts; one is 
where the whole passage is introduced by the words Tiis vows are ' 
or where an option wiU emerge if the meaning of prohibition is 
stuck to. In the case of these two obstacles in sentences where

Vrata means a mental act, a resolve not to do a certain thine 
the meaning being 'he should make a resolve to act in such a 
way aa not to see the rising or setting sun and stiok to it' 
This really is niyama (restriction). This passage doos not 
mean that he should never look at the sun ( there is no prohibi- 
tion of seomg the san) but it only excludes the sight of tbo 
rising or setting sun; therefore, this is only exclusion and ho 
wbo observes this niyama (restriction) secures the roward 
while m the case of eating kalaflja there is a total prohibition. 
Paryudasa (exclusion) is to be understood where the nogativo 
particle is taken with another word ( i. e. with the verbal root or 
a different word such as a noun); prohibition is to be understood 
where the negative particle is taken with the verbal form'. 

In Dharmasastra works, 'na* is frequently oxplainodns 
laying down a paryudasa ( proviso or oxoeption ). In tbo Boction 
on the duties of a snulala in Yaj. 1. 129-166 'na* occurs vary

Paryudasa and pi atlsedha distinguished 1249 

verses on the distinction between paryudasa and pratisedha ( the 
two halves of which' are quoted and underlined in note 2027 ) on 
the interpretation of a verse requiring a man having a son not 
to observe a fast on certain days &c. The first halves "of those 
verses are; 'Pradhanatvani vidhauyatra pratisedhespradhs- 
natS (paryudasah...nafi) n apradhanyam vidhau yatra pratisedha 
pradhSnata i prasajyaprati ..nan ' U 

When the particle ' na ' is employed in a sentence, it is 
either a prohibition or a paryudasa or an arthavada, These 
three have to be clearly distinguished. In Darsapurnamasa 
the two ajyabhagas aTe an anga (P M. S IV. 4 30) and a 
passage states that the two ajyabhagas are the eyes of the 
Darsapurnamasa sacrifice 20N In connection with this the Veda 
says ' these two are not performed in an animal sacrifice nor in 
a Soma sacrifice '. The question is ; is this a prohibition or a 
paryudasa or an arthavada. A pratisedha occurs only when 
there is the possibility of what is prohibited following as a 
matter of course. As the ajyabhagas are prescribed in Darsapu- 
rnamasa there is no possibility of these two being required in 
a Somayaga and there is no real prohibition. Nor is there 
parywffiva, for if it be a paryudasa there would be no proper 
connection, since in paryudasa one would have to say 'there are 
ajyabhagas in darsapurnamasa except in somayags*, which 
would be absurd. Therefore, these words ' na tau pasau karoti 
na some' contain an arthavada. A true* 1 ™ prohibition would 
occur only when something is first prescribed and then 
prohibited. The stock example is of the Sodasin cup; there are 
two Vedic sentences of equal authority ' he takes the sodasin cup 
m Atu-atra and 'he does not take the Sodasin cup in atiratra' ■ 
owing to this conflict an option is allowed. Similarly, there is 
a Vedic passage * Vrlhibhir yajeta yavairva' ( one shall offer a 
sacrifice with grains of rice or with yavas) Therefore, in the 
above two cases where the two texts are irreconcilable, there is 



a. d. 157 



1250 History of Dharmaiastra [Seo. VII, Ch. XXIX 

no way except that of allowing an option (vikalpa). But 
' vikalpa' is liable to eight faults. 2031 Therefore, an effort has to 
be made to avoid option and accept as far as possible a paryu- 
dasa or arthavada, since by accepting an option, the authorita- 
tive statement in one case or the other has to be regarded as 
unauthoritative and not binding. Sabara and Tantravartika 
provide that vtkalpa should be resorted to only in case there is 
no other way. The P. M. S. lays down that vikalpa may be 
accepted when several things having the same object (or sense) 
are stated r by several authoritative texts. 

There is one more word, that must be explained, viz. 
■nityanuvada. W3 This word occurs in Apastambadharmasutra 
II. 6. 14, 13 (vide n. 1877 above). It occutb frequently in Jaimini 
( vide II. 4. 26, IV. I. 5, VI. 7. 30, VII 4. 5, VIII. 1. 6, IX 4. 36, 
X. 2. 38 ) and Sabara uses it oftener still. He explains that where 
the Vedic text apparently prohibits something when there is no 
possibility of what is prohibited as happening, there is nitySnu- 
vada ( as in ' the fire altar should not be piled on bare earth nor in 
the sky nor in heaven' ). The Tuptlka" states the same thing in a 
different form when it says that where a prohibition amounts to 
an arthavada, that is nityanuvada. 

Vikalpas (options) are grouped under three heada viz. 
those indicated by logic or reasoning, (2) those due to express 
words and ( 3 ) those dependent on the will of the performer. An 
example of the first kind is the option about rice grains and 
barley grains (yavairvrihibhir-vayajeta). The 2nd may be 
exemplified from Manu III. 267, which says , that the Manes 
derive satisfaction for a month when offerings are made of 
sesame or of rice or of barley or of masa pulse or of water or of 
fruits and roots. ______

Option depending on a man's-wdl exemplified 1251 

An option depending on the will of a person occurs in the 
Jabalopanisad 2053 (4) ' after finishing the period of studenthood 
one should become a householder, after becoming a householder, 
one should become a forest hermit and after becoming a forest 
hermit one may become a wandering ascetic ( sannySsin or 
parivrad), or following another method one may become a 
wandering ascetic after finishing studenthood or after becoming 
an householder or after becoming a forest hermit.' The latter 
part of this passage gives an option as to asramas.' This option 
is referred to by Gautama in the words ' some sages allow an 
option as to asramas to him ( to brahmacarin ). ' When Yaj. 
I. 14 provides that the Upanayana of a brahmana boy may be 
performed in the eighth year from conception or from birth 
there is an option depending on the will of the father. 

Manu IV. 7 provides that a dvija should amass as much corn 
as would fill a granary (i.e. as would last for a year) or a 
Kumbhl (for six months) or as much as would suffice for three 
days or may not care to amass even for to-morrow. These are 
four options and then Manu IV, 8 provides that a dmja who is 
an householder may choose one of these four, but each succeed- 
ing one is superior in point of merit and otherworldly rewards, 

A. viJcalpa may also be vyavastluta (restricted or limited to 
a certain set of circumstances) or avyavasthita (not restricted). 
The Ap.Dh.S. provides 203 * that one should offer bait with hia

should offer $raddha everyday with food, water, milk etc. Hero 
there is vyavasthita-vikalpa i. o. first food, then in its absence 
milk, fruits and roots, and in the absence of these water. When 
Manu IV. 95 prescribes " Having performed the Upakarma rito 
according to proper procedure on the Full Moon of SrSvana or 
of Bhadrapada a brahmana should diligently study the Vedas 
for four months and a half." Modhatithi says that this is a 
'vyavasthita-vikalpa' viz. the Samavedins should perform 
upakarma on Bhadrapada Full Moon, while RgvedinB and 
Yajurvedins on Havana Full Moon. Vido the Mit. on Yaj,

only a top-knot, there is an option depending on the will of the 
person. Gaut. II. 51-53, Sp. Dh. S. I. 2. 11, Manu HI. 1 
prescribe brahmacarua for Veda study for 48, 36, 24, 12, 3 years. 
Here there is an option depending on the capacity and wish of 
the student. It should be noted that the eight faults about 
accepting an option do not occur in a vyavasthita 203S vikalpa 
nor do they apply where the option is dependent on the volition 
of the performer nor where option is given by express texts. 
Those eight faults apply only to an option indicated by 
reasoning.

Aradupakaraka and Sannipatyopakaraka 12S3 

from Paraiara, Satatapa, Vasistha and Atri gives up the effort 
to bring order because it would be of no use as people do not 
accept the dicta of tbese in practice. 

Two other words require some explanation. They are 
' aradupakaraka ' and ' sannipatyopakaraka '. In the 3rd chapter 
of the PMS the author deals 2037 with iesz, its definition and 
explains how to determine what things are called sesa and 
what are sesin. Kumarila sets out five definitions of the word 
sesa, discards four and accepts one, viz 'sesa' is that which 
serves the purpose of another. Sahara comment? that what 
serves to help another is called sesa and the other is called 
sesin. Sahara adds a qualification viz. that is sesa which is of 
very much help to another. Badari holds that there are three 
groups of sesa viz dravya (materials for sacrifice such as 
rice-grains), gum (such as the reddish colour of the cow that is 
the price of the soma to be purchased), samskaras (purificatory 
acts such as the pounding of the grain* in mortar and pestle 
which make the grains fit for turning them into purodasa) 
Jaimini adds that rites (karmani) like yaga, fruit or result (of 
yaga) ate sesa as regards the performer and the performer is 
sesa with reference to the yaga. According to Badari, dravya, 
gum, samskara ate always sesa, while according to the establi- 
shed conclusion, yaga, reward and performer (yaga, phala and 
purusa) may he according to circumstances either sesa or sesin 
After along discussion the Tantravartika sums up the discussion 
that dravya, guna, and samskara are with reference to yaaa 
nvanahly sesa though they may be sesin with reference to 
then- own constituent elements, while as regards phala, yaga and

of actions. The first comprehend substances, number &o. ; those 
that are of the nature of acts are two-fold viz. sannipatyopakUrdka 
and arad-upakuraka. In the PaurjpamasI rite there are buoIi 
auxiliaries as Prayajas, the .Sgharas, the JLjyabhagas. These are 
aradupakaraka. Sannipatyopakarakas are also called aama- 
vayika, orasrayikarmani; they are such as the pounding of 
grains, proksana etc. The firadupakaraka are M38 riteB prescri- 
bed without being meant to do something about substances and 
are directly the angas of the principal rite. These do not give 
rise to any samskSra (embellishment or making fit) in the 
substance meant to be offered in sacrifice, are helpful in 
producing the paramapurva that yields the fruit of the whole 
rite. They produce a subordinate apuiva of their own. They 
are directly angas of the principal rite and are distinguished 
from sannipatyopakarakas, which are samskaraka (bring about 
some embellishment or fitness). The Sannipatyopakarakas aro 
more powerful than iLradupakarakas and therefore the Tantra- 
vartika states the proposition that where it is possible to hold an 
ao £ ao» f n a r ite to be sannipafcyopakaraka or samavayika, it is 
not proper to regard it as aradupakaraka. It is somewhat 
remarkable that Frof. Keith in his •Karmamlmamsa' (p. 88) 
inverts the meaning of these two words. The explanation of 
sannipatyopaharalca in 'Prabhakara School' (by M. M. Jha) 
p. 181 also is rather obscure. The Ekadasltattva (p. 97 ), while 
discussing the substitutes (pratinidbis) to be employed on 
EkadasI for ghee, for milk and honey (being milk-powder, curds 
and jaggery) quotes P. M. S. VI. 3. 18 «na devatagnisabda- 
kriyam-anyarthasamyogat', explains that in place of a pre- 
scribed knya like prayajas (that have an unseen or spiritual 
reward) there is to be no substitute, since what has an invisiblo 
result is aradupakaraka, but in place of rice grains ( that aw the 
means of preparing puroffia) a substitute may be employee, 
since the rice grains are sannipatyopakarakas andhaveaseen 
purpose viz. preparing purodasa. Sa nkaraoarya in h is bhasyaon

2. 22 (payo va tat-pradhanatval-lokavad-dadhnas-tadarthatvat) 
gives the illustration that in order to solidify milk a little 
of curds is enough; Vm, 4.6, (na laukikanam &c. where 
' laukikanam' means 'lokSnam' );X 3.44 (sabdarthascapilokavat),

Jaimini dealt with the eternal, self-existent and absolutely 
authoritative character of the Veda as regards Dhanna in the 
first pada of the first chapter and also dealt with the means of 
knowledge, the eternal character of the relation of words and 
senses. In the second pada of the first adhyaya he pronounced 
that arthavadas which form a very large portion of the Veda 
were meant to laud the Vidhs with wtiich they were connected 
and were not to be treated as useless. He also provided that 
mantras ( that formed part of the veda) had a purpose to serve

about which it is argued that no sense can be made out of them 
are really explicable with the help of Nirukta (etymology) and 
grammar, that some words like 'Klkata', 'Naioasakha', and 
' Pramaganda ', that are claimed to refer to a country, a city, a 
king and therefore are claimed to make tho mantra ( ftg. III. 53, 
14) non-Bternal, can be explained in a different way. In this 
way, no part of the Veda is anarthaka (without sense or usoIobs) 
or non eternal The MlmamsakaB are very keen on avoiding 
Unailhalma of any Vodio words or sentences. 

In the third psda of the first chaptor Jaimini deals with tho 
authoritativeness of smrtis, tho usages of respectable and learned 
people (sadacara), tho VedSngas &c. 

It appears that before Jaimini composed his sutra, smrtis 
had come into prominence and tho usages of the sistas had been 
recognised as one of the sources of Dharma The Dharma- 
Btitras of Gautama, Apastamba, and 2012 others had declared that 
the Vedas, the Smrtis and the usages of those who know the 
Vedas are the sources of Db3rma. Therefore, the Santiparva ( 1S7,

33 135 22 in Citrao ed.) mentions Dharmasastras and Anusas- 
an'aparva (45. 17) quotes gathas from Yama's DharmasSsfcra. 
Therefore, Jaimini had to consider whether smrtis and usages 
W e authoritative in the matter of Dharma and, if so, to what 
extant. Even if smrtis were held to be unauthoritative, the 
authoritativeness of the Veda would not be affected ; hut the very 
first sutra( of P. M.S.) postulated that the work would consider 
the question about the characteristics of Dharma and, therefore, 
smrtis that were called Dharmasastra (Manu H 10) were 
connected with the discussion about Dharma. Besides, from VI. 
7. 6 it follows that' 013 Jaimini knew Dharmasastras as he provid- 
es that in a Visvajit the performer cannot make a sodra a 
subject of gift simply because he serves a man of higher caste on 
account of the ordinances of Dharmasastra. Even in the Upani- 
sads (as inTai. Up. 1.11) the teacher after the pupil had completed 
Veda study impresses upon the latter that whenever he would 
have a doubt about the rites enjoined or about proper conduct he 
should follow the conduct of brahmanas in his country that act 
after proper consideration, that are devoted to their duties and are 
not driven to do anything by another, are not harsh of character, 
that are intent on doing their duties. This amounts to following 
"sadacara'as a source of dharma. Jaimini employs the word 
'smrti'inthesenseof works in several sutras as in VL 8. 23 
(which contains the very words that the 5p. Gr sutra employs), 
IX. 2. 1, XII, 4. 43. Sabara mentions 'smrti* and the word 
'smarati' and ' smaranti' more than a dozen times.

mentions three smrti rules, two of which can be said to corns. 

pond with extant smrtis; on PMS VX X 5, while dealing with the 

question whether lower animals (dogs&c.) have adhkaia for 

Vedic rites, Sahara denies their adhikara, since they do not 

study the Veda nor the smrtisastras (as men do), on PMS VI 2. 

21-22 (when the question is whether the smSrta rales that a 

teacher should be followed or obeyed and obeisance be made to 

him and whether one should get up and honour an old man 

apply to even children whose upanayana is not performed) 

Sahara states that smrti is equal to Veda (Vedatulya hi 

smritih, vaidika eva padartha smaryanta ityuktam). On 

VX 8. 23 he quotes one quarter of a sloka as smrti (smaranii-tesu 

kalesuMaivani-iti ). On VX 7. 31 he says that smrti speaks of 

gandharvas living for a thousand years. On VI X 20 Sahara 

says a woman owns no wealth, if one follows smrti, but is owner 

of property if iruh be followed On IX. 2. a Sahara says 'naiss 

smrfcih pramanam, drstamula hyesa '; on X. 1.36 Sahara sayB that 

from the usage of respectable people smrti is inferred and from 

smrti Sruti text is inferred; on X. I 42 Sahara says 'Smrti w 

stronger than usage *. On X. 3. 47 Sahara says ' there is a smrti 

that one should not sell a horse '. In one place Sahara employs 

the words 'pramanayam smrtau' instead of 'pramane sun-tan" 

as one would expect and the Tantravartika is at great pains to 

show that this lapse on the part of Sahara may be somehow 

justified (pp. 183-184) on I. 3. 3. The Baudhayana Dh. S. (1. 1. 

19-26) sets out five practices peculiar to the countries of tt» 

South (Southern India) and five others peculiar to the North and 

says that if one belonging to the South follows any of the usages 

peculiar to the North and vtce versa he would be guilty of sin.

discarded, since smrtis «n composed by man (i.e. they are 

often deluded and forgetful This fa the mam basis of the 
objector. To this the reply fa that for prescriptions of the srntns, 
there are passages in the Veda that suggest some of the smrta 
rules e. g that the Astaka sraddha was prevalent long before the 
soutis is indicated by the Vedic mantra 'yam janah pratinan- 
danti' 3BU The usages about obeying the teacher, about provid- 
ing cisterns for travellers have a seen purpose, viz. the benefit of 
othets. Even the Veda mentions ' pi a P n ( 8ft IX. 4 1 dhanva- 
aniva praps aai* meaning' O Agni I thou art like a prapa jn a 
desert". The Tautravarttka is most exhaustive on this and the 
following sutras, differs from the Bhasyakara in many places, 
finds fault with him and gives alternative matters as the subjects 
for discussion. He puts forward two theories about smrti 
provisions for which it is impossible to suggest Vedic indications. 
He says (firstly ) that Smrti 200 prescriptions may be based on lost 
Vedio Sakhas, or{2) they maybe based on texts contained in 
the very parts of the Veda that are available at present. If any 
one asks *how is it that they are not found', Kumarila gives the 
reply: the several branches of the Veda are scattered about (in 
many distant territories), men are negligent, and the texts are 
contained in different sections of the Veda; on account of these 
one cannot point out the texts that are the basis of the smrtis. 

That many Vedic texts were lost or are unavailable now 
was the view even before the days of the £p. Dh. S ( I. 4. 12. 10 ), 
which states 'rites were promulgated in the Br&hmana texts, but 
the exact words (of the Brabmana texts ) are loat and have to be 
inferred from the performance of the rites (or from procedure 
prescribed in Smrtis)'. 2048 There was danger in relying on the

theory that Smrtis were based on Vedio texts that are lost (or 
disappeared), because that very argument might be urged by 
heterodox sects like the Bauddhas. 20W Therefore, Kumarila put 
forward the other theory viz. the basis of smrtis are texts that 
are not found in the existing vedic texts because the Vedio 
sakhas are scattered about (as said in the verse quoted above) 

This whole subject about Smrtis according to the views of 
the Mlmamsakas has been dealt with at great length by the 
author in H. of Dh. vol. Ill pp 827-841. Therefore, only a 
few examples and conclusions may be mentioned here. Sahara 
himself proposes that PMS 1.3.4 30S0 should form a separate 
Adhikarana by itself and puts forward an important maxim viz. 
where one can find out or ascribe a visible motive for an act one 
should not postulate an unseen Vedic text or a transcendental 
motive. 20S1 The result of Sahara's dealing with PMS 13 3-4 
is neatly put by the Sastradlpika as follow; Smrti rules that are 
opposed to Sruti rules and such smrti provisions as can be shown 
to have a clear worldly motive are not authoritative or binding, 
while the rest of smrti texts are authoritative. This doctrine is 
older than the Ip Dh S (14 10. 12 ) which provides ' where 
men act because they find pleasure in doing that act there 
Sastra has no scope' Kumarila does not agree with Sahara. 
He says that visible and invisible or spiritual motives are 
often inextricably mixed up. 'Unhusking rice grains' has 
a visible purpose in order that they may be well boiled and the 
boiled rice may be offered in a sacrifice. In this act then there 
is a visible*purpose and yet this act is prescribed by the Veda. 
In a trenchant, finely worded and very accommodating passage 
redolent of a cosmopolitan outlook and the desire to give even 
the devil his due, Kumarila examines ( in pp. 166-168 ) all the 
known classes of Sanskrit works with regard to their usefulness

and relation to Veda and ordinary worldly experience. Only a 
few sentences will be Bet out here and in the notes. Therefore, he 
provides that all Smttis are authoritative according to the pur- 
pose they serve. Those parts of Smrtis that are concerned with 
Dharma and Moksa have the Veda as their source, while what- 
ever parts of Smrtis are concerned with wealth (aHha) and 
worldly pleasures ( kama) are hased on worldly practices. The 
same rule applies to the hortatory passages of Ihhasa (the 
Mahabharata) and Purltaas, hoth of which are often spoken of as 
Smrti. The episodes and tales in these two should be taken as 
aithavadws. Then he refers to the descriptions of the divisions 
of the earth and the vamsas ( dynastic lists) ( both of which are 
among the subjects treated of in the Puranas) and sets out the 
purposes they might serve. The six Vedangas (grammar, 
metrics, etymology, astronomy &c. ) are useful as kratvartha and' 
purusartha, and Mlmamsa and Ny&ya (logic) have been establi- 
shed (worked up) from worldly experience by means of pratyaksa

distinction between the power of luck and human effort He 
goes even a step farther and is prepared to admit that even 
heterodox hypotheses of Bauddhas such as the theory that only 
Vij8ana{ cognition) exists, that everything is in an eternal 
flux and that there is no (permanent) soul, which (theories) 
sprang from the arfchavada passages in the Upanisads, serve the 
purpose of inducing people to give up extreme attachment to 
sensual pleasures and are useful and authoritative in their 
own wayB. 

He sums up the distinction by stating that as regards those 
smrtis ( or portions of them ) in which the fruit or result promised 
cannot possibly be experienced in this life, but where the result 
is promised as fructifying in the remote future ( i. e. after death), 
an inference as to their being based on Veda may be drawn, 
but, as in 'the case of scorpion lore 1053 (i. e. incantations for 
curing the sting of a scorpion), works dealing with matters that 
can be seen are authoritative only because the result can be 
perceived in other men similarly stung. 

The medieval DharmasSstra works take up this dismission 
about the distinction between smrtis based upon the Veda and 
those on perceptible motives or purposes. For example, the Kalpa- 
tara (Brahma-cSri-kanda p. 30) and AparSrka (pp. 626-6M) 
quote verses from Bhavisyapurana (Brahmaparva ohap. 181, 
82-31) that divide the contents of smrtis in five oategorieB 
and exemplify that division. The Sm. 0. K p. U quotes two of 
these and the Paribhasaprakasa of Mitramisra (p. 19) W&® 
all of them. Vide H. of Db. Vol III. p. 840 note 1634 for all 
the verses, 

Eumarila (pp. 194-196 of Tantravartika). holds that the 
passages quoted by Sahara on 1.3. 3 are not really opposed to 
Veda at all and that the proper subject for discussion under i. 
3. 3-4 is the authoritativeness in matters of Dharma of «»

and he holds that all these aTe outside the pale of the three Vedaa 
and aie to he discarded as unauthoritative, although they 
contain a few mattei3 such as ahimsa, truthfulness, self-control, 
charity and compassion, that agree with Sruti and stnrti. It 
will have been seen from the above that Kumarila was awaTe of 
the emphasis placed by Buddhists on some moral values but he 
differed from them in many other matters, that he was ready to 
admit that Buddhist works had some value and he did not 
preach that they should be burnt or destroyed. Therefore, it 
appears that his attitude was far from bBing one of total hatred 
and persecution of the Buddhists, as alleged by Taranatha cited 
above on p. 1010 n. 1645 

Sabara explains that sulias 5-7 of P. M. S, I 3 are :o5s 
concerned with certain religious acts such as acamana ( sipping 
water) when one sneezes in the midst of a rite, the wearing of 
YajnopavJta (the sacred thread), the use of the right hand 
alone in all acts. These interfere with the sequence and quick 
performance of the subordinate items in a religious rite, says 
the objector. Sabara establishes that there is no substance in 
the objection. Kumarila feels that Sabara is not right as 
regards the three instances cited by him. He splits the three 
sutras into two adhkmams (topics for consideration); sutras 5 
and 6 deal (aco to Kumarila) with the contention that those 
precepts of Buddha and other founders of unorthodox sects, such 
as the construction of monasteries and parks, the insistence on 
carelessness ( va,rS gm ] , the continuous practice of meditation, 
ahimsa, truthfulness, restraint of senses, charity and kindness 
are such as are laid down also by the Veda, are not opposed to

m tho TantravSrtika fa that those usages alone are authoritative 
that arc not opposed to express Vedio texts, that are practissd by 
sis(as under the belief that they are right conduct { dharma) and 
for which no visible motive (such as pleasure or the satisfaction 
of desires or the acquisition of wealth) can be predicated. 
Sistas are only those that perform the religious rites and duties 
expressly enjoined by the Veda. The practices traditionally 
handed down from generation to generation that are observed by 
sistas (as defined above) with the conviotion that they form 
part of Dharma must be regarded as Dharma and as leading 
to heaven. The TantravSrtika remarks that practices do not 
become authoritative merely by the faot that no visible motive 
or purpose can be postulated for them; but they become so only 
when they are observed by sistas as part of Dharma. MS ' Many 
activities such as agriculture, service or trade, that are the 
means of securing wealth and pleasures and such actions as 
eating sumptuous food, drinking, sleeping on soft beds, possess- 
ing a charming house or garden, all of which are common to 
Aryas and Mlecohas are not deemed by any one to be part of 
Dharma and it does not follow that because a few actions of 
sistas are accepted as Dharma, all their actions are to be looked 
upon as Dharma, Rumania quotes the advice that a man 
should follow the path by which his father, grand-father and 
other ancestors went, provided it is the path of the good, follow- 
ing whioh he will not come to harm, J0SS 

Very intricate questions arise with regard to the relative 
force of sruti,( Veda), smrfei and sadaaira (usages observed by 
sistas as defined above and in Manu XII. 109). The Mit. on

sadaeara, and two mora ) states the general rule that in case of 
jonflict each preceding one is more powerful than each succeed- 
ing one. Mann ( 1. 12 ) states that, for those who desire to know 
Dharma, Sruti(Veda) is the highest authority. Therefore, in 
case of conflict between sruti and smrti the former prevails. 
There are a few exceptions even to this cleaT rule which may be 
illustrated later on But where two smrtis are in conflict, the 
ordinary rule, following the Sodasi-nyaya and the words of 
Gautama I. 5 ( Tulyabalavirodhe vikalpah), should be an option. 
Many works on Dharmasastra must have been composed long 
before 500 B. 0. , since Gautama mentions Manu (in 21. 7 ) and 
«ac5ryah' (in 3. 35, 4. 18) and 5p. Dh. S. (I. 6. 19. 2-1%) 
mentions no less than nine individual authors' cpinions on the 
Bingle question as to whose food may be eaten, Manu ( in HL 
16 ) mentions three views held by four sages on the position of 
a brahmana who marries a sudra wife or has a son or ohild from 
her. A striking example of a conflict between smrtis is the rule 
of Manu (HI. 13), Baud. Dh. S. I. 8. 2, Visnu Dh. S. 24. 1-4, 
Vas. L 25, Par. Gr. X 4 allowing anulama marriages and permit- 
ting a brahmana to have a sudra woman as a wife and the 
emphatic statement of Yaj. L 56-57 that it does not agree with 
those that declare that persons of the three higher classes can 
take a sudra woman as wife. Later writers of smrtis and 
mbandhas should have said that on account of this conflict there 
is an option. But they do not say so. They struck upon vari- 
ous devices to wriggle out of such apparent contradictions, 
ihe first device was declared by Brhaspati (about 500 A. D) 
that the Manusmrti occupies a pre-eminent position as it correct- 
ly represents the sense (the real view) of the Vedas and that a 
smrti which is opposed to the teaching of Manu is not held in 
esteem. *>» But this was not satisfactory and some other devices 
were resorted to One was to insert passages in Manusmrti itself

praotico of tttgorja ("in IX. 59-62), but the extant Mamismrti 
(IX. 64-68} condemns it in no measured terms. These contra- 
dictory statements wero known to Brbaspati who expressly says 
that Manu permits myot/a and himself forbids 2060 it and assigns 
a reason viz. that in former ages (Krta and Treta) people 
practised tapa? and wore endowed with knowledge while in the 
Dv&para and Kali ages men bare lost the powers possessed by 
men of the past agos and therefore niyoga is forbidden, Ysjfia- 
valkya himself proposes (31.21) that when two smrtis are in 
conflict 'reasoning based on the practices of elders was of 
greater force '. Narada has a similar rule. JMt Another device 
was to declare that the nature of Dharma differed in each of the 
four yugas and that in the krta, treta, dv5para and kali ages 
the Dharmas respectively promulgated by Manu, Gautama, 
Sankha-Likkita and Parasara were to prevail. a °« This also 
could not solve all difficulties, since medieval commentators and 
digests found that oven what was allowed by ParSsara ( such as 
permitting a hrahmana to eat food at Uie 2CM house of such 
sudras as his dasa, cowherd, barber, family friend and a cultiva- 
tor of his land for a half shaTe of the crops, permission for a 
married woman to re-marry in certain oiroumstances), came to 
be disapproved of or condemned by people. Another expedient 
in oases of conflict among Bmrtis was provided by (Jobmla -m. 
where there is a confliot of (smrti) passages, the opinion of the 
majority should pre vail. M6< _____

Long period of the composition of smrtis 1267 

As shown above smrtis had been composed before 500 B. C. 
and they continued to be compiled till about .900 or 1000 A. D. 
i. e. for over 1500 years. Taj (I. 4-5). mentions 19 smrtis 
including bis own. Vide H. of Db, "Vol I. pp., 132-135 for the 
enumeration of different numbers of smrtis in different works. 
At least a hundred smrtis if not more can be named. Daring 
the long period of over 1500 years vast changes in the religious 
and social ideas of the Indian people, in their customs and 
usages had occurred. Buddhism arose, flourished and disappea- 
red from India, the caste system became rigid in the matter of 
food, marriage and social behaviour; Vedio rites, divinities 
worshipped and language underwent great transformations, 
animal sacrifices, though occasionally performed, had ceased to 
be looked upon as meritorious. The religious literature had 
therefore to be recast to suit new ideals, new worship and new 
patrons (viz. the common people who had ceased to follow 
ancient ritual and worship). Smrtis reflected the changes in 
ideas, beliefs, worship and usages that occurred" from time to 
time and naturally gave rise to great conflicts among them- 
selves. At last it appears that the learned men of the 10th and 
following centuries of the Christian era hit upon the plan of 
providing that certain customs and practices, though formerly 
allowed and practised, were harmful in the-.Kali age. A theory 
was put forward that great sages came together at the beginning 
of the Kali age and declared that certain rites, customs and 
usages, though allowed in past ages, should be prohibited in the 
Kali age."** The actions prohibited or to be avoided in the 
Kali age (about 55 m number and therefore called Kalivariva )

the offering of the anubandhya cow (after avahbrtha) in Jyo 6i. 
stoma and f the allotment of the largest share (of aniSa 
wealth) to the eldest son. AH these three were eitoer ™S 
or permitted by *he Veda, From Rg. X. 40. % it WtaJSt 
asonless widow raised a son for the sake of the spiritual benefit 
ofhor husbands soul by sexual intercourse with the husband's 
brother.** The Tat S. (IILl.9.4) has two contradictory 
passages m 'Manu divided his wealth among his sons ' (with- 
out making any distinction among them) and 'therefore they 
endow the eldest son with (the paternal) wealth' (Tai S.H5. 
2. 7 ). In this last case it may be argued that as two Vedio 
passages are in conflict there is an option. But from very early 
tunes there is a prohibition against allowing the whole ances- 
tral wealth or a major portion of it to the eldest son. Apastemha 
quotes both"*" Vedic passages, holds that equal division among 
sons is the proper rule and remarks that allowing the eldest son 
to take the whole or a major portion of ancestral estate is pro- 
hibited by the Ssstras. Among actions forbidden in the Kali 
age but practised in Vedio times some striking ones (apart from 
the three already cited above ) may be mentioned here : ( 1 ) being 
initiated for Sattras (which were sacrifices extending from 12 
days to 12 years or even more and whioh could be performed by 
brahmanas alone ); Jaimini 2068 deals with them at some length in 
VL 6. 16-32 and other places. It is remarkable that neither 
Sahara nor Kumarila says anything against Sattradlksa as 
prohibited in Kali. So it was not among generally recognized 
Kalivarjyas till at least the 8th century A. D. (3) killing of a 
cow or bull. There were several occasions on which this was

But that does not appear to be correct. Mann (IX. 65) states that mjogs 
ts nowhere mentioned among the mantras relating to marriage nor is tUe 
remarriage of a widow referred to in the procedure of marriage. But 
Gautama and some other sutrakaras and even Yaj (I. 68-69) prescribe io 
detail the procedure and conditions governing niyoga , all writers are 
entirely silent about the procedure of the rc-marnage of widows Therefore, 
it has to be said that Eg. X. 40 2 was rightly held by ancient smrtu as 
referring to the practice of niyoga

Sautramanl sacrifice. 206S Jaimini, Sahara and the Tup-tlka of 
Kumarila describe it and both Sahara and Kumarila refer to the 
offering of cups of wine in it Therefore this rite must have 
become KalivaTjya after Kumarila's day. (4) Offering an 
animal with the recital of Vedic mantras to the bridegroom, to 
a guest and in honour of pilrs. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II, pp. 
542-546 for Madhuparka in which a bull or a cow was offered 
according to the Ait. Br. and Vol. in, pp. 945-46 for this 
Kalivarjya Manu(V. 41-44) allows the killing of animals in 
Madhuparka, in sacrifices and in Tites for the pitrs (Manes) and 
gods and emphasizes that sacrificing an animal as laid down 
by the Veda is no htmsS but is alnmsa. Yaj. (I. 258-260) 
prescribes the periods of time for which pitrs are gratified by the 
offering of sacrificial food (such as rice or sesame), various 
kinds of fish and the flesh of several animals. The Mit was 207D 
constrained to observe that, although Yaj shows that sacrificial 
food (rice &o), flesh and honey are offerings in Sraddha for all 
varnos, yet (in its day ) the rule established by Pulastya should 
bo followed viz. food fit for muni ( i e. rice) should be offered by 
brahmanas, flesh by ksatriyas and vaisyas and honey by 
sudras. 

According to the Purvamlmamsa Veda is eternal, self-existent 
and of absolute authority , one fails to understand how sages could 
have authority at the beginning of the Kali-yuga to prohibit " 
what the Veda enjoined or permitted. This seems to be a fiction 
invented to accommodate as Dharma the changes in people's 
ideas and practices that had occurred. It would have been 
honest and straightforward if the w riters on Dharmasastra had

said that changed circumstances required that the words of the 
Veda or of the old smrtis should not he followed. And there is 
nothing novel or revolutionary in saying this. Both Manu im 
and Yajfiavalkya prescribe that one should not ohserve but give 
up, what was ( once ) deemed to be dbarma, if it had become 
hateful to the people and if it would end in unhappiness and not 
lead to the attainment of heaven. Even the MifSksara follows 
this precept of the two smrtis and expressly says that unequal 
distribution (at partition) of ancestral wealth, though found in 
the SSstras, should not he followed because people had come to 
hate it. It may be noted that the word used by Yaj. and others is 
'lokavid vista' or 'lokavikrusta* (hated or reviled by the people) 
andnot'sista-vidvista', the idea being that even if orthodox 
learned pandtts insist that people must follow what the Veda and 
smrtis declare to be Dharma, common people may give up 
practices condemned by them or hateful to tbem. This attitude 
Tecognizes the historical facts that practices change in the course 
of centuries and common people are entitled to ignore the diota 
even of the Veda (much more of the smrtis). To the question

~iother s sister's daughter if a maternal uncle's daughter can be 
married, the Smrticandrika replies ' we do not say that she could 
not lie married acoording to Sastra, but she should not be married 
as people abhor such a marriage ' and it quotes Taj I.] 56 (by 
oversight it ascribes the verse to Manu). In modern times 
when any change or reform ,in religious or social practices is 
suggested, Pandits calling themselves Sanatanis put forward the 
pleas that the proposed change or reform is opposed to the 
sastras, that the controversy should be carried on according to 
the Mlmamsa rules, that all Smrti and other dicta should be so 
construed as to lead to samanvaya ( consistent arrangement of 
apparently discordant texts), that the historical approach leads 
nowhere and should not be resorted to. All these objections are 
here briefly dealt with. It has been shown how from Vedic 
times to tbe present day great changes have taken place in 
religious ideas, worship and practices, how smrtis from Gau- 
tama, Spastamba, Manu downwards espouse conflicting views 
so much so that as early as the MahabhaTata Vyasa 7ml had to 
protest that 'rationalisation is unstable, Vedas are in con- 
flict with eaoh other, there is no single sage whose opinion is 
held to be authoritative (by all), the truth about Dharma is 
enveloped in a cave (i. e it cannot be clearly discerned) and 
that therefore the path (to be followed) is the one followed by 
the great mass of people ' The Mlmamsa does not often lead to 
certain conclusions and it has already been seen how great 
Mlmamsa writers like Sahara, Kumarila, Prabhakara differ 
among themselves on numerous topics and it would be further 
illustrated later on how even great Mlmamsakas evolve highly 
conflicting conclusions in the interpretation of simple smrti 
passages. Change is the one absolute in the long history of our 
religious and social ideas and what those who appeal to the 
Historical approach mean is that the smrtis were composed by 
human authors during a period of 1500 or 2000 years and were 
greatly influenced by the then prevailing religious and social 
atmosphere, that many of their dicta cannot be fully reconciled

regarded as forever binding on all Hindus, that in the 20th 
century our people are free to introduce or recognize such'- 
changes as are required or have already taken place among the • 
people in the changed circumstances and that this course is 
sanctioned even by Manu and Yftjnavalkya and medieval emi- 
nent authors and works on the Dharmasastra such as the 
Mitaksara and the Kalpataru. It is of course clear that changes , 
in practices and principles should not be made merely for the '- 
sake of change or for the whims of some leader, hut the gover- 
ning principle of conscious change should be the feelings and 
needs of common people, while retaining the foundations on 
which society has been based for thousands of years. 

It has further to be noted" that the MlmamsS rules were 
concerned only with the interpretation of the Vedio passages on, , 
sacrificial rites and matters relating thereto and had rery Utile .' 
to do with the practices of people unconnected with sacrifices' <_ 
or religious rites. 3073 The Mlmamsasutra nowhere says that the . ^ 
same rule3 should be applied to the interpretation of smrtis. ; 
On the contrary, the P. M.S. is very critical about smrtis and ? 
usages (vide RM.S.I.3.3-4 and 7). There are fundamental ; 
differences between the Veda and the smrtis. The. Veda was , 
deemed to he self-existent, eternal and of absolute authority, 
while smrtis are pauruseya (works of human authors), haveonly

very large, they often differ so much from each other that even 

eminent authors and works like the Mitaksara had sometimes to 

give up in despair the idea of bringing order out of the welter 

of smrti passages and in their efforts at satnanuiya had^ to say 

that certain smrtis refer to a former KaTpa or Yuga { i e. to a 

society of several thousands or millions of years ago ). One of the 

well-known maxims of the P. M.S. is the one called 'Sarvasa- 

khspratyayanyaya' 20H or 'Sakhantaradhikarananyaya' {II. I. 

8-33 ). In the several recensions of the Veda and the Brahma- 

nas attached to the Vedic recensions the same rite is mentioned 

and is dilated upon with details some of which occur in one or 

more recensions but are absent from others. Jaimini and 

Sahara establish that all the Sakhas of the Veda and the Brahma- 

nas form one coi pus, that such rites as Agnihotra and Jyotis- 

toma are one and the same in all recensions of the Veda> 

though the details may vary here and there, and this is the 

proper conclusion because the name ( Jyotistoma and the like) 

is the sams in all recensions, the promised reward of the rite is 

the same, the materials of the sacrifice and the devata are the same 

and the codanas ( the eshortatory sentences ) aTe the same. This 

very maxim was extended to smrtis from very early times. 

Visvarupa, Medhatithi, the Mitaksara, ms Apararka and other 

commentators extend this to smrtis and provide that where 

smrtis are in conflict there is to be an option but that in other 

cases all the details are to be added up. But as an option was 

liable to eight faults the tendency developed that all smrti 

passages on a topic were to he so interpreted as to give no rise 

to conflict or to allow no option by means of various devices

and so on. 3?or example, even as regards the stook example of 
vtkalpa ( viz. taking or not taking the Sodalin cup in Atiratra) 
the Mit. says that it is proper to assume that it should be taken 
if it is possible to do so, or it may he assumed that by taking the 
Sodasin cup in Atiratra the attainment of svarga is hastened 
&c. 207 « The result of regarding all smrtis as constituting one 
Sastra was that many simple rites became in course of time 
overloaded with details, complicated and taxing to the perfor- 
mer. But sometimes it is necessary to apply this doctrine, JFor 
example, YSJ. 1. 135 requires the xnatalca not to look at the sun 
(neksetarkam); this would mean that to look at the sun iff 
prohibited at all times, but the dictum of Yaj. should be read 
along with Manu IV. 37 which forbids a person to look at the 
rising or setting sun or at the sun when eclipsed or as reflected 
in water or when it is at the meridian. So the rule will be as 
stated by Manu. 

While on this subject of the authoritativeness ef Smrtis it 
would be useful to glance at what Jaimini and particularly 
Eumarila say about the Vedangas. As regards &ks3 (Phone- 
tics} Eumarila says that the account given in that work about 
the organs employed in pronunciation and the rules about Vedic 
accents have their use in the correct recitation of mantras. On 
the Ealpa-Butras Jaimini 2057 has a separate adhlcaram (13. 
11-14 ). Sahara mentions by name the Masaka, HaBtika and 
Eaundinyaka Ealpasutras and the Tantravartika draws o 
distinction between kalpa ( ritual of Srauta sacrifices ) and Kalpa- 
sntras, and refers by name to eight 

These sutras (PMSI. 3. 11-14) have been interpreted by 
Eumarila in several different ways, firstly as referring to the 
authoritativeness of Ealpasutras (as done by Sahara), secon dly

(author of the Mahabhasya) in which some very interesting points 
are made bat they have to be passed over for reasons of space.

The Nirukta of Yaska, which is one of the sis afigas of 
the Veda, is an extensive work and deals with the derivation of 
words, semantics, explanations of several hundred Vedic verses in 
whole or in part. Jaimini agrees with several conclusions of the 
Nirukta, which claims that without its help one cannot under- 
stand the meaning of the "Veda, that it haB a purpose of its own 
and is a complement of grammar, and it controverts at great 
length the view of Kautsa 5080 that Vedic mantras have no meaning

Vedangas ate comprefiended under smrti 1277 

Kumarila makes a general remark that all the sis angas 
and the Dharmasastras are comprehended under Smrti. "^ 

It appears that Jaimini did not attach much importance to 
Smrtia, since out of 915 (or 1000) Adhikaranas barely about a 
dozen are concerned in any way with smrtia alone, viz 1. 3. 1-2, 
I. 3. 3-4. 1. 3. 11-14, I 3. 24-29, VL 2. 21-32, VI 2. 30, VI. 8. 
23-24, VII. 1. 10, IX. 2. 1-2, XII. 4. 43, Sabaia, however, referB 
to smrfcis in many more places such a3 on VI. I. 5 and 13, IX. 
1. 6-9. 

We are here concerned with the attitude of Jaimini and 
his early commentators like Sahara and KumaTila towards 
Smrtia. The established conclusion arrived at by Jaimini ( in 
I. 3. 2 ) is that in case of conflict with the Veda Smrti is to be 
discarded, but if there be no conflict (of Smrti with Veda), it 
may be inferred (that Smrti is based on some Vedic text). 

This amounts to saying that there is always a presumption 
that smrtis are based on Veda, if their prescriptions are not 
directly in conflict with the Veda. Smrtis prescribe the obser- 
vance of Astaka sraddhas, the digging of tanks, following and 
obeying a teacher. These are authoritative because they do not 
conflict with any Vedic text of opposite import. The Smrtis do 
claim that they are based on the Veda. Gautama says so ( in XI 
19 in note 2042 ) and Manu states (II. 7 ) « whatever Dharma is 
proclaimed by Manu for anybody has all been ( already ) declared 
in the Veda, since Veda possesses all knowledge'. 

In connection with smrtig and usages an important question 
arises viz. if there is conflict between smrtis and usages of 
sistas which is to be regarded as more authoritative. KumSrila 
holds that if the practice of good men is not opposed to what is

Si™ 2 well-known that smrtis are compositions by 

persons who were deeply versed in the Veda, while the origins of 
usages are vague and unascertainable. 

Though this is the theoretical rule, supported by Dharma. 
Sastra works such as Vas. X 5. Mit.-on Yaj. I. 7 and 11.117 
Kulluka on Manu II. 10, one finds that usages opposed to smrtis 
nave been u vogue from ancient times (such as the usage of 
marrying one a maternal uncle's daughter that is condemned by 
Manu and authoritative smrfcis). The VyavaharamayQkha (p. 
98 of the text in B. G. S. ) was constrained to observe that in the 
Furanas one often finds usages opposed to smrtis. The courts 
have held that ' immemorial usage is transcendental law' and 
that this is the translation by Sir William Jones of «ac5rah 
paramo dharmah' in Manu 1. 108. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. in. 
pp 874-876 for two interpretations of this verse of Manu I. 
108 in modern times. Manu in ( II. 10 ) asserts that Veda and 
amrti are in all matters not to be subjected to (hostile) reaso- 
ning, since Dharma shone forth from these two. Manu further 
provided that as regards matters not specifically provided for, 
whatever brahmanas that have studied the Veda together with 
the supporting lores (viz. the six angas, mlmamss, PurSnas &o.) 
and that make others realize what !§ruti sayB are Sistas and 
whatever they declare to be the Dharma in such unprovided 
cases is undoubtedly the Dharma. 

It was declared by the Privy Council that 'under tho 
Hindu system of law clear proof of usage will outweigh the 
written text of the law.' M87 From very ancient times customs 
and usages have been held to be authoritative. For example, 
Gautama XI. 20 says 'the usages of countries, castes and 
families are authoritative, provided they are not (directly) 
opposed to Vedio texts. ' Manu 1. 118 states that he has embodied 
in his Sastra the long-standing customs and usages of coun- 
tries, castes, families, heretical Beots and guilds. In some matters 

2087. In Collector of Madura v. Mootoo Ramlinga, 12 M. I. A. 397 »( 
p. 43fi the Privy Council say so. 



Iii soma makers customs Iiaue over-riding authority 1279 

modern legislation in India allows to customs and usages 
over-riding 2038 authority. 

In the examination of certain Kalivarjyas mentioned above, 
( p. 1268-1270 ) it has been shown how several actions prohibited 
in the Kalivarjya texts were practised in Vedic times or were 
enjoined by Vedio texts. 

KumSrila points out that even brahmana women of Ahi- 
cchatra and Mathura drank M89 liqura in his day, that northern 
brahmanas engage in such transactions as the gift and sale of 
horses that have a mane, of mules, camels and animals that 
have two rows of teeth and eat from the same plate with their 
wives, children and friends, that brahmanas of the South enter 
into matrimony with the maternal uncle's daughter and take 
their meals while seated on a couch of wickerwork, that both 
(brahmanas of the North and South) take cooked food (kept in 
pots) that remains after their friends or relatives have partaken 
of it or that has been touched by them ( at the time of eating), 
that they chew tambula of betel leaves, betelnut, catechu and 
lime made into a roll that has been touched (in a betel-seller's 
shop) and do not sip water at the end of the chewing, wear 
clothes cleaned by washermen and brought on the back of asses, 
that they do not avoid the contact of persons guilty of grave 
sins except of the murder of a brahmana ; there are also an infinite 
number of obvious violations df the subtle dictates of Dharma laid 
down for each man, caste or family, that these (transgressions) 
are contrary to Sruti and Smrti and have a visible purpose and 
that it Knot possible to regard such adulterated practices as 
Dtanna moulcated by sadacara. The requisites of valid usages 
according to the Purvamlmamsa school are that they must be 
ancient, not opposed to the express texts of the Veda or of Smrti, 
m ust be snch as are deemed by Sistas to be obligatory and must

they must not have a visible purpoBo and must not be immoral 
Vide H of Dh. Vol. HI. p. 853-855 for discussion on valid cus- 
toms and usages 

Tlio general rules laid down by Dharmasustra works about 
the binding character of customs and usages are in line with the 
rulos of the PGrvamJmamBa. Vide H. of Db. Vol, HI. pp. 871- 
884. But deviation from Vedic texts and smrtis gradually arose 
ab noted above. 

Even all actions done by great men cannot be called 
.sadacara, according to Kumarila, if they can be attributed to 
greed or some such base motive and should not be looked upon 
as Dharma. Gautama, MW Ap. Dh. S. and the Bhagavata-pura- 
na remark that oven groat men were guilty of violations of 
Dharma end defiant excesses, that those great men incurred no 
sin (got over tbe effects of sucb violations) on account of their 
being endowed with ominont tapas (spiritual merit due to auster- 
ities ) but that others of later ages following their examples and 
treading the same path would sink (into hell). Kumarila cites 
twelve such instances of lapses, explains them away or says they 
were due to wrath or other passions and were not intended by 
the authors (of those acts) as dharma and are not looked upon 
as sistacara by modern men. The twelve instances are: Praja- 
pati who became enamoured of bis own daughter (Tlsas, «Pta™ 
Kumarila), Indra is described as the jara (paramour) of Ahalys 
(night, according to Rumania's explanation); Vasistha througn 
grief for the slaughter of his hundred sons by a demon contemp- 
lated suicide jVisvamitra who became officiating pries l » 
Trisanku that had become a eandala through a curse; HaW» 
who, when he occupied the position of Indra, made approaches 
to Sad, wife of Indra and was transformed into an ajag <ara (bug 
reptile), Pururavas, when separated from UrvasI, thought of *»» 
(by hanging &c.); Krsna-dvaipayans who was ™' stfi ! /ia £X

pTanSySoa and other pracUces the inqmnbM of tbe senses 
cleared away is stated by Mann VI. 71. 



Ancient instances of tmnsgressions 1281 

sacrifices which blind men are not authorised to do ( compare 
Jai. VI. 1. 42); five Pandavas marrying one DraupadI; Yudhi- 
sthiia who prevaricated and thereby caused the death of Drona, 
hisbrahmana guru; Krsna and Arjuna are described in the 
Mahahharata as drunk with wine ('ubhau madhvasavaksibau 
drstaume KeSavarjunau' in TJdyogaparva 59. 5) and married 
their maternal uncle's daughters ; ESma performed ASvamedha 
by assooiating a golden image of Sita with him. 

Kumarila displays great ingenuity in explaining away 
most of these transgressions by plausible and specious argu- 
ments, by relying on the great tapas in Bome cases ( such as about 
Visvamitra) and in some cases by downright denial (as in the 
case of Subhadra being the sister of Krsna).* 091 Those interes- 
ted may refer for all these instances and their explanations by 
Kumarila to H. of Dh. Vol. HX pp. 845-848. 

One interesting adhikaram is the Holakadbikarana ( Jai. I. 
3. 15-23). It is said that Holaka should be observed by the 
easterners, linlnaibuka by Southerners, Udvrsabhayajfia by 
northerners. The established conclusion is that such observances 
are meant for all (and not merely for persons of the East or 
South to. ), if they are fit to be done by™' easterners or souther- 
ners( there is no reason why these should not be observances fit 
for all) The general rule about Vedic vidhis is that they are

CHAPTER XXX 

On Mimamsa principles and rules of interpretation' 
in relation to Dharmasastra 

The P&rvamlmamsa evolved a method of its own and a set 
of principles for the interpretation of Vedic texts. It is now- 
time to set down and explain some of these principles and rules 
and point out how they have been employed by Dharmasastra 
writers for solving their own difficulties. 

The Mimamsa principles and rules of interpretation fall into 
several groups. There are rules that are concerned only with 
the details of Vedic sacrifices and their inter-relations. The 
moat important rule in this field is this that only Vidhis proper- 
ly so called have absolute authority and binding force, while 
what are called arthavadas have authority in so far only as they 
form one syntactical whole with the vidhis and as they are 
meant to praise the vidhis. (P.M. SI. a. 7} Vidhis and 
Arthavadas are not discussed consecutively, but they are 
scattered over the several chapters of the P. M S. For example, 
arthavadas are first dealt with in I. 2. 1-18 (the arthavadsdhi- 
karana), but in many other places there is a discussion about 
arthavadas as in III. 4 1-9, IE 4. 10, lH 4. 11, IV. 3. 1-3 VI 7 
26-30, X. 8. 5, X. 8. 7 and 8. ' * 

It should not be forgotten that the Mimamsa is not concer- 
ned with legislation by the king or a sovereign popular assembly 
« promises to convey correct knowledge of Dharma (meaning 
rehgwus rites and matters connected therewith) and the means 
ofamvingatthatknowldge is the Veda itself and the main 
purpose of the Mimamsa is to regulate the procedure (U^Z

to the intent of those that made them. But the Mlmamsa is 
concerned with the Veda that is deemed eternal and self-existent 
( and not man-made ), that deals with religious matters, cannot 
he amended or repealed and is to he expounded according to the 
intent of the Vedic words. Therefore, though some rules of the 
interpretation of Vedio texts evolved by the Pfirvainlmainsa are 
identical with or resemble the rules of the interpretation of 
statutes developed in suoh works as Maxwell's on ' interpretation 
of statutes ', the author will not enter into any detailed treat- 
ment showing the parallelisms betweBn Mlmamsa rules and 
Maxwell's rules. This task was attempted over fifty years ago 
by Mr. Kishorilal Sarkar in his Tagore Law Leotures published 
in 1909. It would appeaT ungracious on the part of the present 
author to offer oriticisms against a predecessor in the same field 
who wrote more than half a century ago when Mlmamsa studies 
by modern educated Indians were in their infancy. But the 
author cannot help stating that Mr. Sarkar was obsesed by the 
notion that he must show somehow or other that Jaimini's rules 
of interpretation were not inferior to those of Maxwell's and 
agreed closely with him. For this purpose he relies often on 
far-fetohed analogies and employs obscure explanations. In 
several oases it appears that he had not been able to grasp 
correctly what Jaimini and Sahara meant. 20,s 

In this work the author is concerned only with the question 
of the influence on Dharmasastra of Purvamlmamsa doctrines 
and rules of interpretation. He has already shown how many 
of the 'doctrines and technical expressions of the Mlmamsa have 
dominated Dharmasastra He would now turn to the rules ot 
interpretation. 

The first rule is that no part of the Veda ( not even a, word) 
can be treated as anm thaka (meaningless or purposeless). «» 
therefore that a very large part of the Veda is treated as ortna- 
vadas intended to praise vidhis. This has been stated abov 
( p . 1243 ). The result of the vital importance attaoh^ dtovmn^

Result of regarding many Vedic texts as arthavUdas 1285 

in the PMS and of the assignment of a very subordinate role to 
arthavUdas (as merely intended to praise) and to mantras (as 
merely 'abhidhayaka') has resulted in this that a small portion 
of tbe Brahtnanas has been held to ba of supreme authority, 
while a large part of the Brahmanas and of Samhitas contain- 
ing mantras has become of secondary importance or of little 
importance. 

The Mlmarhsa rules of interpretation fall into different 
classes from different standpoints. Some rules are general and 
some are special. Some rules have to do with the proper proce- 
dure to be followed when several texts laying down matters 
relating to the same subject are in conflict by means of the 
application of the technical words sruti, linga, vakya, prakar- 
ana, sthana and samakhya (HX 3. 14) and there are rules about 
adhikara, atidesa, aha, badha, tantra and prasanga. 

Some examples of general rules may first be cited. That 
vidhis alone have special obligatory authority and that artha- 
radas are authoritative only in so far as they form one 
syntactical whole with the vidhis is a general rule. The rules 
distinguishing between vidhis (properly so called), myama 
vidhis and pansafikhya are general. 

The Mlmamsa rule is that where there is a »» doubt about 
the exact meaning of a part of a passage, it may he determined 
by relying on the remaining parts of the passage. Vide above 
lor the example • he puts down anointed pebbles' &c. (p 1240) The 
Mimamsa is very much against assuming conflict among Vedic 
tots and therefore allows an option only if there is no other 
way oat. Vide remarks on vihalpa above (p. 1250). Another 
general rule i S that the singular includes Sb plural In the 
Mimams, it » called 'Grahaikatvanyaya (P. M. S. HI. 1. 13-15)

whether a single cup ('graham' la the word used) is to be 
cleansed or a single purodasa is to have a firebrand carried 
round it or whether all cups called grahas or purodasas are to ba 
treated as stated. The established conclusion is that all grahas 
are to he cleansed and all purodasas have the firebrand carried 
round them. The singular number is not intended to he insisted 
on. 2W7 From this a further general rule is derived by Kumarila 
and others that an attribute of the subject (anuvadja or 
uddi&jamana) 2,m about which something is predicated (vidfieya) 
is not intended and should not be insisted upon This is fre- 
Quently relied on in Dharmasastra works Yaj tt 1S1 states 
that the father and son have equal ownership m land, a corrody 
and wealth {gold and silver &c.) acquired by the grand-father 
Here the word pitamaha is not to be insisted upon and the same 
rule applies to land or wealth acquired by a great-grand-father, 
as the V. M. says. 2099 Similarly, when Naradasmrti says (16. 37) 
'of brothers being undivided religious worship (or rites) are 
one, but if there is a partition then they may have sBparatB 
religious worship'. Here the proper subject is the word "undivided 
persons', and the word 'brothers' is used only as an attribute, 
which is not intended to be insisted on and the same rule 
applies to undivided grand-father, father, sons, uncles and 
nephews. Medhatithi on Manu II, 29 mentions this maxim. 
The same rule is applied in some cases to gender also i. e. a 
word importing males includes females also For example, Yaj 
II 182 and Narada ( 8. 40 ff ) lay down certain rules about a dasa 
(male slave). The V M. says that the masculine gender in 
these passages is not intended to be insisted upon, hut the rules 



2097 Vide Maxwell (10th ed. of 1953) p. 349 for the propositions that 
words importing masculine gender include females and that the singular 
includes the plural and woe versa

apply even to female slaves. 2lM There are exceptions to these 
rules. The rule about grahas does not apply to cximasas (P.M. 
S 111 1. 16-17 ). aM This rule that the qualification ( visesaua ) 
of the subject in a vidhi is not meant to be taken literally and 
emphasized is applied in many other cases. Three verses from 
the Xalikapurana are quoted by Kalpataru ( on vyavahSra pp. 
SI 0-211 ) and V. M. (pp. 45-46 ) about the performance of an 
ordeal in certain grave charges and this maxim is applied by the 
V.M. there in the words 'paradararupam visesanam-avivaksitam- 
abhisapasyanuvadyatvat'; vide notes to V. M. pp. 83-84. 
But in 'pasuni-alabheta', where there is a vidhi about 'y§ga' 
it must be held that what is laid down is yaga as qualified by 
being made with a male animal and therefore only one pasu 
( and that pasu a male ) is to be sacrificed. 

Although the Veda employs the masculine gender (in 
svargakamo yajeta, 'one desiring heaven should offer a sacrifice'), 
yet Jaimini establishes (in VI. 1 6-16) that even women are 
included and have a right to offer a yaga. :102 Jaimini further 
provides that husband and wife should perform a religious right 
in co-operation (VI. 1.17-21), but he provides that where the 
Sruti specifically provides for certain matters to be done by the 
Vajammta 2lI » (the male performer) it is the male alone who can 
perform them as the wife is not equal to the husband in the 
knowledge of mantels and is ignorant and therefore she is 
restricted to the performance of those acts that are expressly 
enjoined for her such as looking at the clarified butter, observing 
brahmacam and the like (VI.l 24 'tasya yavad-uktam-aslrbra- 
hmacaryam-atulyatvaf.) The wife also'performs bath and such

acts as applying collyrium,? sipping water (acamana), observes 
silence till the morning or evening agnihotra is gone through. 
She hasher waist girt up with a yoktra (a triple cord of munja 
grass) in Darsapumamasa and other sacrifices. She has also to 
look upon the clarified butter in the pot with a mantra (Tai. S EL). 
10. 3 'mahtaam payosyosadhinam rasossi adabdhena tva cakusas 
veb se suprajastvaya ' ( * thou art the milk of cows, the fluid of 
herbs, with an invincible eye I look on thee for securing good 
progeny '). The wife was to learn the mantras she had to repeat 
in sacrifices from her father or husband before the husband set 
up the sacred fires ( vide H. of Dh. Vol. IT. p. 1041 n ). Gradua- 
lly, the wife lost all importance in Vedic sacrifices and came to 
he a mere silent speotator 2101 of all the weary details that had to 
be gone through by the saorificer and the priest. 

In spite of the above restrictions on the wife's powers about 
Vedic sacrifices many smrti rules apply to women also, though 
the text employs the masculine gender. Ebr example, Manu XI. 
93 provides that a brShmana, ksatriya and vaisya should not 
drink sura. This prohibition applies to wives of the members 
of the three varnas acoording to the Mit. on Taj. HI. 256. 

The P. M. S. holds that the gender and number of a word in 
a vtdhtvakya may in certain cases be intended and insisted on. 
For example, in PMS IV. 1. 11-16 it is established that the Agnl- 
somlya animal to be sacrificed in Jyotistoma as prescribed in 
the words *yo diksitoyad agnlsomlyam pasum-alabhati' (that 
the person who has undergone dlksa and offers the animal to 
Agni and Soma) is only one and that the words in the Asva- 
medha 'he offers kapifijalas to the season of 2105 spring', the

kapinjala birds to be offeredare only thiee ( and not one nor two 
nor more than three ) Similarly, the gender in tbe passage *he 
sacrifices in tbe morning in spring an animal witb dark coloured 
neck to Agni, in summer in the noon an animal of different 
colours, in the autumn in the afternoon a white animal to 
Brbaspati ', it is a female animal that is offered because immedia- 
tely thereafter the words ' they become pregnant' occur. Dharma- 
sastra works often say that the masculine gender used in many 
texts excludes women. For example, the Agnipurana 3106 (175. 
59-61), when dealing with the rules to be observed in all vratas 
in general, provides that the person undergoing vrata should 
take a bath, should worship the golden images of the deities of 
the vratas, perform japa and homa and at the end of the vrata 
make gifts according to his ability and should feed 24, 12, 5 or 
only three ttpras. The N. S. quotes this from Prthvlcandra and 
observes that as the masculine gender ' viprah ' is employed only 
males of the brahmana class are to be fed and not women. 

As against this, when Hemadri" 07 quoting Padma says 'If 
a woman is pregnant, freshly delivered, or is ill and becomes 
impure, she should get her viata performed through another and 
when she becomes pure Bhe may observe it personally/ the 27. S. 
remarks that this applies to men also when they are impure, 
since the gender here is not intended to be emphasized. 

There are Mimamss rules about the interpretation of words 
and also about sentences. First a few of the rules about words 
may be illustrated (1 ) Sahara in the very first sentence of his 
DHasya propounds the principle that as far as possible the words 
m the sutras of Jaimini and in the Veda are to be understood in 
the sense m which they are understood in popular usage and not

business m hand'. Again, on L 3. 30 Sahara says™ that the 

,word*are the same as in the Veda and popular use and the 

meanings aTe the same. 

As regards the setting up of Vedic fires, the Tai. Br II 4 
and Ap.Sr.V.3.18 prescribe different seasons for men of the 
three varnas and add that a 'rathakara should set up Vedic fires 
in the rainy season'. The question arises whether the word 
ratbakfira m these passages means a person of that caste (i. e. 
whether it is to be taken in the popular sense) or whether it 
refers to any one of any varna who manufactures chariots (i.e. 
the etymological sense). The established conclusion is that the 
popular sense is to be taken and not the etymological (P. M.S. 
VI. 1. 44-50). In the case of the tathakara the mantra for 
adharw. ( setting up of Vedic fireB ) is * rbhunSm tva ' ( Tai. Br. U. 
4. 8). Though not belonging to one of the three higher varnas, 
the rathakara could repeat that mantra because the Sruti ex- 
pressly authorized him to do so, but he was not entitled to 
upanayana. The P. M. S. (VI. 1.50) held that the rathaKwa 
(mentioned in the Tai. Br. and Ap. Sr.) was a caste called 
Saudhanvana which is neither sudra nor one of the three higher 
varnas but is slightly inferior to them. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. ft pp.

widow to adopt is conceded, the mere fact that she is not entitled 
to repeat Vedic mantes in general cannot deprive her of that 
right and that it is possible to bold, as in the case of the ratha- 
kara, that she can repeat the specific mantra required in adop- 
ting a boy. The Tai. S. IV. 5. 4. 2 separately mentions several 
craftsmen such as taksan, rathakara, kulala, karmara &c. From 
Atharvaveda IH. 5.6 and Vaj. S. 30. 6 ( medhayai rathakaram 
dhairyayataksanatn)it appears that the rathakara held a good 
position in the then society. 

A word is to be understood in that shade of its meaning 
that is appropriate to the act in hand. For example, sruti says 
' he cuts off with sruva, he cuts off with a knife, he cuts off with 
the hand' (the same verb ' avadyati ' being used for all the acts ). 
The question is whether one is to cut all offerings, whether liquid 
or solid, whether of flesh or other substances, with sruva ladle or 
whether he is to employ the method or implement appropriate 
for each i. e. clarified butter should be taken from a pot and 
offered by means of a sruva ladle, flesh should be cut off with a 
knife and offered, and hard or thick things (like fuel sticks) 
should be offered with the hand. The conclusion is that one is 
to offer in the way most appropriate to each kind of offering. 
This is called 'samarthyadhikarana' (PMS. 21 " I. 4. 25). The V. 
M. relies on this when dealing with the homa prescribed by 
Fitamaha for all ordeals in the words 'homa should be offered in 
the four directions with clarified butter, boiled rice and fuel 
sticks & and declares that the homa of clarified butter should 
be made with sruva ladle, ofhavis (i.e. 'boiled rice &c') with 
srnc and of fuel sticks with the (right) hand, on account of the

enumerated in Tai. S. 1. 6. 8. 2 ,viz. sphya (the wooden sword), 
the potsherds &c. Here the Purvapaksa is that one may employ 
any one of these for any purpose required in the sacrifice , the 
established conclusion ( PMS HI. 1 11. and IV. 1. 7-10) is that 
the enumeration of ten implements is a mere anuuada and is 
ftot to be understood as the purvapaksa states, but each is to be 
employed for the purpose for which the Vedic texts prescnbo it 
( Buch as one cooks the purodasa on potsherds, pounds grains in 
mortar and pestle). Vide H. of Dh. vol. H. p. 985 n. 2233 for 
ten implements of sacrifice and others that are required and 
p. 1232 above for their disposal. 

One and the same word must not be used in two senses in 
the same sentence, that is, in the primary sense and also in too 
figurative sense. 2!1Z This maxim is relied upon by the Daya- 
bhaga. When brothers (sons of the same mother) come to a 
partition, smrti texts (like Yaj. II 123 ) prescribe that the mother 
takes a share equal to that of a son On this the Dayabhaga 
remarks that the word 'mata' (in Yaj II. 123 and others) pri- 
marily means a real mothar (janam, that gives birth ) and this 
smrti rule has no application to the step-mother, since it is 
improper to hold that the same word once used in a sentenco 
has a primary and a secondary sense at the same 2I " time. But 
it must be pointed out that all Dharmasastra works do not 
observe this rule AparHrka ( p 730 ) on Yaj II. 123 (pifcur-flrd- 
hvam vibhajatam matapyamsam samam haret) includes the stop- 
mother under the word 'mats ' following a text of Vyasa. Tho 
Mitabsara interpreting Yaj. H. 135 about obstructiblo heritage 
stating the order of succession as wife, daughters, parents, 
brothers, their sons, provides that full brothers first succsed, in 
default of them half brothers, in default of the last, fall brothers

sons. The V. M. disagrees 2lu with this and says that the word 
' brother' primarily means 'full brother* and only secondarily 
•half-brother', tbat, as it is not allowable to use a word like brother 
in two senses in the same passage, in default of full brother his 
son succeeds ( and not half-brother as the Mit provides). The 
primary sense of a woTd is got by ' abhidha', the secondary sense 
by 'laksana' 2 " 5 and sometimes a third sense called suggested 
sense is said to be due to vyafljana. These are the three vrlhs 
(functions ) of a word. 

One of the rules about the interpretations of words is con- 
tained in P.M S L 3. 8-9. Sahara cites three instances of words 2116 
viz cam made fromyavas, sandals made of boaT skin, a cane mat. 
The words yam, laraha and -be/asm are respectively employed 
by some people in the sense of 'priyangu' (long pepper), dark 
bird (crow) and jambu (blackberry). The prima facie view 
insists that one may use those woTds in any one of the two 
senses. The Siddhanta is that those words must be used in the 
sense in which the Veda (or sastra) or sistas employ them i. e. 
the usage of learned Aryan people is to be followed wheTe words

may have two or moie senses. As in several other cases 
Kumarila does not like Sahara's explanation and proposes two 
other explanations, viz, one being that the sutras relate to the 
word 'pllu ' used in the sense of a tree and wileccfcas employ it in 
the sense of elephant. The meaning of the word in smrtis is a 
tree and that should be followed. Here 'SastrasthaV means 
'the sense given to the word in the Saatra i. e. smrti'. Another 
meaning he sees into those sutras is the comparative strength 
of smrti and acara. This adhilearana ia relied upon by Visvarupa 
on Yaj (I. 225) on the question of the primary meaning of 
the word Sraddha which he states is 'pirjdadana' (offering balls 
of boiled rice to the manes ) and not feeding brabmanas. The 
Parasara-madhavlya refers to Parasara-smrti (VI 70-71) about 
the food cooked from rice in such quantities as measuring an 
aQhaka 2m or drona and rendered unclean by being peeked by 
crows or touched by dogs and smelt by asses and provides that 
the measures adtiaka and drona were to be taken as those known 
from sastras and not those known among mlecchas. 

Another rule (PMS I. 3. 10 ) about words is that «" words, 
though of foreign origin, that are in vogue in Sanskrit, are to 
be understood in the sense which they have in the foreign 
language and one should not think of an attempt to derive them 
with the help of Nirukta and grammar. Sahara cites four such 
words -viz pika ( cuckoo), nema (half), tamarasa (lotus), sate 
( circular wooden vessel ). 

Another rule about words is that where a single substance 
connected with several attributes is concerned in an action law 
down for being carried out, all of these attributes should ^ 
taken to refer to the same one substance (PMS m. 1 13 ;■ " 
Tai. S. prescribes *he purchases Soma with a heifer one year ow 
and having brown eyes and reddish in colour'. Here the wo 
words 'pingaksl' and 'ekahayanl' yield a good <***%£ 
meaning, are in the same case and so refer to the same substance

(heifer in this 1119 case). But the word 'arunaya' (of red colour) 
causes a doubt viz. whether it should he separated from the other 
two words in the sentence and taken in the sense of 'any 
reddish suhstance such as a piece of cloth' or whether it should 
he connected with the verb (he purchases), should thus he 
subordinate to the purchase and should he taken as referring to 
the one year old heifer. This last is the established conclusion. 
How Soma is to be purchased does not follow from any other 
text Therefore, in such a case several subsidiaries can be laid 
down in one injunction. If ' arunaya ' be taken as referring to 
any red substance such as a pieoe of red cloth this one sentence 
would have to be divided into two vidhis 'he should purchase 
with a red piece of cloth' and 'he should purchase with a brown- 
eyed (heifer) one year old'. This would be a fault called 
' vakyabheda'. This nyaya is explained by the Madanaparijata 
pp. 88-89 and AparSrka ( p. 1030 ) makes use of 2m it in explain- 
ing the correct import of the words of the Br. Up. IV. 4. 21 * tam- 
etam vedanuvacanena brahmana vividisanti' by saying that 
when the highest object in view is one but the subordinate 
elements are different these latter are to be lumped together. 

Another rule about words is evolved by what is called 
'nisadasthapatinyaya' (PMS VI. I. 51-52). «« It is stated that

ono that should bo performed for nisada-sthapati. A nisada is 
n person born of a brahmana father and sudra mother (vide 
Manu X 8 ). Ho does not belong to ono of the three higher 
varnas. Sthapati means ' chief or leader '. The question whether 
the compound word means ' a nisada who is a chief ( that is a 
karmadharaya compound) or whether it means 'the ruler of 
nisadas' who may not necessarily be a nisada himself but may he 
a ksatriya (i. e. whether one should take the word as'sasthl- 
tatpurusa' as 'nisadsnam sthapatih') The conclusion is that 
a karmadharaya is more powerful than a tatpurusa, since in 
the former both the words may he directly connected with the 
verb ( nisadascasau sthapatisoa, tarn yajayet). The V. M. makes 
use of this * maxim '. The Saunaka-smrti authorizes sudras to 
adopt a son, yet some writers like Rudradhara, author of 
Suddhiviveka, held that adoption required a homa with mantras 
and as a sudra could not repeat vedic mantras he could not 
adopt. To this V. M. replies that his power to adopt a son being 
established by Saunaka's smrti all that is required is that he 
may got the homa performed through a brahmana. The BhfimatI 
on SankaTa's bhasya on V. S. I. 3. 15, where the meaning of the 
word 'brahmaloka'in Chandogya-TTp. VIII 3, 2 is in question, 
says that the nisadasthapatinySya applies and so 'brahmalokaj 
means 'hrahma as the goal' and not ' the world of hrahma.' 
Manu XI. 54 enumerates five Mahapatakas (deadly sins), one 
of which is 'gurvanganagama' (sexual intercourse with 
gurvangana). Commentators have differed about the meaning 
of this word, some like Bhavadeva in Prayascittaprakarana 
stating that, following nisadasthapatinySya, the word must be 
dissolved as a Karmadharaya compound ( guruh or gurvl caaau 
angana ca), the meaning being one's own mother, while many 
others dissolve it as a tatpurusa compound meaning 'SU™*™ 
gurunam angana' (which would then .include a fep-motber, 
an elder brother's wife and teacher's wife &c. ). Vide H. oi ua.

that the words form a vakya. The word elcavalcyata occurs in 
V. S. HI. 4. 24 and conveys that there is a twofold akanksa viz. 
grammatical as well as psychological. It is the listener or 
reader who has, on hearing or reading a word, a desire to know 
another idea or word to get a complete sense. When several 
sentences, each conveying its own sense as far as it goes, are 
brought together having regard to the fact that one of them may 
be principal and the others auxiliary, they form one syntactical 
whole. This shows that sentences are of two kinds, vakyas and 
mahavakyas, as the Sahityadarpana puts it. 

It follows from the definition and the bhasya thereon that, 
in order to constitute a vakya, three conditions are neoessary 
viz, ( 1 ) there must be a number of words uttered or put down 
together (padasamuha), (2) the words must have an expeot- 
anoy for each other ( i. e. if a word in the collection is dropped 
no complete sense can be had ), ( 3 ) all the words must serve 
one purpose or convey together one meaning ( arthaikatva, aco. 
to another view ). It is not absolutely necessary that the words 
in order to form a vakya must be in close proximity. Even if 
some words intervene there may be a sentence, provided there 
is akanksa between the words. Sahara on PMS IV. 3.11 illus- 
trates this well as stated in the note. 21Z4 In the verse quoted 
' pasyasi * is to be connected with ' jaradgavam ', though several 
other words intervene. Though there is proximity (sannidhi) 
between 'pinaksi' and ' jaradgavam' they do not form a sentence 
as there is no capacity as also akanksa between tbe two. The 
upshot is that sannidhi (proximity) of words is generally 
required to form a sentence, though not necessarily required in 
every case. 

The different parts of a mantra text, meant to serve different 
purposes, may he regarded as distinct sentences. For example, 
the mantra in Tai. Br. 2l2S (HI. 7.5) 'I make an agreeable

seat (or abode ) for Que (O cake ! ), I prepare it as a very happy 
one with a stream of clarified butter ; do sit thereon with pleased 
mind, be established in ambrosia, sacrificial essence of rice . 
These are two sentences, the first part being concerned with 
making a seat, the latter part being concerned with depositing 
the puroiaia on the seat. Similarly, in the passage 'I (cut) 
thee ( O palasa branch ) for food, I { wash or inb ) thee for vigour ' 
there are two different sentences, that stb independent of each 
other, as the Sat Br. employs these with the words 'he cuts 
the palasa iKS branch with the words ' for food (I cut) thee ', he 
washes it with the words 'for vigour thee*. The same rule applies 
to the ten different clauses 'ayuryajnena kalpatam, prano 
yajnena kalpatam* in Tai. S L 7. 9. 2. They are all different 
sentences. rai 

The doctrine of Vakyabheda plays a very important part 
in Mlmarhsa as well as in Dharmasastra. Vakyabheda literally 
means 'split of sentences*. When the sentences are equally 
independent and one sentence does not require or expect words 
from the other sentence to complete it, they should be treated as 
separate sentences. This is one sense of ' Vakyabheda. ' Another 
and more frequent sense of Vakyabheda is as follows : The under- 
lying principle of vakyabheda is that one and the same text 
cannot be construed as laying down two separate vidJus (pres- 
criptions) or that when a certain matter has already been 
prescribed and then several auxiliary matters are to be prescri- 
bed, prescribing 2I38 all the auxiliaries in one sentence would

give rise to the fault of vakyabheda (syntactical split of 
sentence ). In Tai S there is the following passage ' the sacri- 
ficial post is to be of udumbara tree, the udumbara (tree) is 
vigour, cattle is vigour ; he obtains for him ( the sacrificer ) by 
means of vigour urj ( i. e. by udumbara post) vigour (i. e. cattle) 
for the attainment of vigour '. This is one syntactical whole 
( vakya). If it be said that there is a vidhi prescribing the use 
of udumbara post in a sacrifice and that there is also another 
vidhi about the fruit viz securing vigour (i e. cattle) ; this would 
give riBe to vakyabheda Therefore there are no two vidhis 
in the sentence but only a vidhi and an arthavada (praise). 2129 
Sankaracarya on V. S. III. 3 57 remarks ' ekam hldam vakyam 
Vaisvanaravidyavisayam paurvaparyalocanat pratlyate ... eka- 
vakyatavagatan satyam vakyabheda-kalpanasyanyayyatvat.' 
This is said with reference to the first aspect of the idea of 
Vakyabheda. 

The basic idea underlying the latter sense of vakyabheda 
is this. If an act or a substance or a secondary matter has 
already been the subject; of a vidhi and if concerning the act 
(or substances &c ) a number of other matters (actions, subs- 
tances &c. ) are ^en joined in one sentence, there would be 
vakyabheda (i. e there would have to be a separate vidhi 
for each of the other matters relating to what has already 
been the subject of a vidhi ) On the other hand, if an action, 
substance or a guva is enjoined for the first time along with 
several secondary matters in one sentence, there would be no 
fault of vakyabheda i e. in a single vakya however long or 
containing many matters, if there is a single vidhi there is no 
fault. If, in the passage quoted on p. 1258 above 2130 ' one desir- 
ing prosperity should offer in sacrifice a white animal to Vayu ', 
one were to hold that first there is to be a vtdht about prosperity 
as the fruit or reward, there would be two vidhis and so the fault 
of vakyabheda, but if one holds that the vidhi is only concerned 
with offering a white animal and what follows ' vayurvai ksepis- 

•tha bhutim gamayati * is merely an arthavada ( praise of the 

preceding vidhi), there is no vakyabheda. The fault of vakya-

Examples of vaJcyabheda 1301 

bheda arises when more vidhis than one aie held to occur in the 
same vakya. 213t 

A few examples must be cited to illustrate the principle of 
valajabheda. A simple example is 'graham sammarsti'. If one 
were to interpret this as meaning * he is to clean the cup ' and also 
as meaning that only a single cup is to be cleaned there would 
be vakyabheda. Therefore, it was decided that the singular 
number in 'graham' is not to he insisted upon and cleaning of 
all cups was to be resorted to; otherwise there would he two 
vidhis viz. 'graham sammrjyat' and 'ekam-eva sammrjyat'. 
Sahara quotes (onPMSI.3. 3) a sruti ' one who has a son and 
whose hair is dark should consecrate the vedic fires \ Agnyadhana 
is laid down by sruti texts such as Tai. Br. 1. 1. 2. 6, &at II. 1. 2. 
Therefore, the above text only lays down certain subsidiary 
matters about it A man may have dark hair but no son or he 
may have a son when his hair is turning grey. Therefore, if 
that sentence is meant to prescribe both attributes (having a son 
and also having dark hair), there would be two distinct vidhis 
in the same nJahja, that is, there would be the fault of vakya- 
bheda, which has to be avoided. Therefore, that sentence must 
be understood as indicating a certain age viz. he must not be a 
mere boy (at the time of agnyadhana) but of an age to bear a- 
son, nor very old (when hair turns grey), i. e.he must he neither 
too young nor too old at the time of agnyadhana. A laksana as 
regards the words ' jataputraji ' and 'krsnakesah' is resorted to 
and laksana is only a fault as to a word, while vakyabheda is a 
fault of a sentence and therefore laksana should be preferred to 
vakyabheda. The V. M. quotes ( p. 11 5 ) the verse of Mann ««

IX. 142 'the son given shall not have (Bhare) the family name 
(gotra) and the wealth (nlUha) of his natural father; the ptvfa 
(oako offered to deceased ancestors ) follows the family name and 
the wealth; of him who gives (Mb son in adoption) the svadha 
( obsequies ) cease ( so far as that son is concornod ) '. After citing 
the above smrti passage 'one having a son' and another tQxt 
for the position of the sacrificial post (vide PMS HI. 7. 13-14) 
with reference to the altar, the V. M. holds that one should not 
merely emphasize the words gotra, nlUha, prntfa and svadha used 
by Manu and take them literally but should hold that the 
verse contains a laksana (indicated meaning); it indicates the 
cessation of all those consequences that are due to connection 
with the pinda in the case of the natural father and Manu says 
nothing about the property taken by a son before he is given in 
adoption into another family. 

Another illustration of vakyabhoda can be cited from the 
law of re-union. The Mit., DSyabhaga and Sm. 0. (on Vyavahara 
p. 302 ) quote a text 2133 of Brhaspati ' that man who being once 
separated from his father, brother, or paternal uncle again dwells 

{.Continued from last page) 
natural family that bad become vested in him before adoption. TbRt 
decision holds that Manu laid down t«o propositions, viz (1) a man 
forfeits by adoption into another family the property that once belonged 
to the family and that became vested in him before adoption, (2) A person 
given in adoption into another family does not, after the adoption, take any 
property of the family to which he belonged but whose connection with the 
family ceased after adoption. These are two distinct propositions and to 
hold that Manu's text is capable of these tuo propositions is liable to the 
fault of Vakyabhoda. The V M (p. 115 ) further relics on the construction 
of another vedic text 'He fixes half of the yupa inside the vedi and half 
outside it,' This is interpreted by PMS HI. 7. 13-14, Sahara and the 
Tantravartika as merely indicating a certain region for the fixing of the 
yupa and that the words are not to be taken literally, because in that case 
there would be Vakyabheda. The ^qj E w r brings out the meaning clearly,

through affection with them (or any of them) is said to be 
re-united with them ( or him /. According to the Mit,, a reunion 
is possible only with father, brother and paternal uncle and with 
no one else, since no one else is mentioned in the text of 
Brhaspati. The V. M. does not approve of thia limitation and 
says that a re-union is possible with all or any of those that 
participated in the partition and that the three persons, father, 
brother and uncle are mentioned only by way of illustration 
(i. e. there is laksana ). A man may separate not only from the 
three named persons but also from his paternal grand-father, the 
grandson of his brother and the son of his paternal uncle and 
several other persons and therefore the construction of the text 
of Brhaspati by the Mit. is liable to the fault of \akyabheda, 
since on that interpretation there would be two separate proposi- 
tions via. ( 1 ) that man is to be called re-united who having 
become separate again stays together with the one from whom he 
separated, (2) one can re-unite only with the father, brother, or 
paternal uncle. Thus there would be two distinct prescriptions 
in one sentence. Therefore, one should have recourse to lakqaria 
viz. that the three named persons indicate a class of persons 
from whom one may have separated but with whom he then 
stayed together. The Viramitrodaya (on Vyavahara), V. E. 
(pp. 605-67 ), V.C. p. 533 hold the same view as that of the 
v. M, M34 

The Smrticandrika provides that after the death of a man 
when the sons divide, the mother is entitled to a share equal to 
that of each son if the estate to be divided is not very large, but 
if the estate be very large she is to get as much only as would be

words ' samara amsam ' { equal share) according as the estate to 
be divided is large or small. a3 * 

There is another principle about sentences called ' anusanga ' 
(elliptical extension) or the extension of a word, phrase 
or clause from a sentence to another or other sentences, 
provided all those sentences are of the same type or form. 
This is one type of anusanga. Anothe*r type is where 
each of two or more sentences appears to be complete by itself, 
but there are certain words of a subordinate character in the last 
sentence of a passage which have to be taken up or understood 
in the preceding sentences. This latter is also called anukarsa. 
In the three upasads of Jyotistoma, the first' 136 is in honour of 
Agni in which the mantra is 'ya to Agne ayasaya tanur-varsisthS 
gavharesthogram vaco apavadhlm tvesam vaco apavadhlm 
svaha ' ; the other two TJpaBads have the two mantras ' ya te Agne 
rajasaya' and 'ya te Agne harasaya' which are incomplete and 
in need of complementary words to complete the sentences. The 
conclusion is that the words ' Varsistha ... svaha' are to be sup- 
plied from the first sentence and not other words from the popular 
language that one may choose. Another passage of the Tai. a37 
S. is ' eit-patistva punatu, vakpatiB-tva punatu, devas-tva savita 
punatvacohidrena pavitrena vasoh suryasya rasmibhih'. Here 
the first two clauses appear to be prima facie oomplete, but when 
we look to the last clause where the word 'punatu' is parti- 
cularised by certain other words, we at once feel that the fast 
two clauses also Bhould be connected with the words 'aochidrena... 
rasmibhih' and that then they would be quite complete.

Principle of anusanga tllusliated 1305 

The V. M. ha3 a long disquisition on the principle of 
anusanga applied by the Mit and Madanaratna to the succes- 
sion to the wealth of one who died re-united. Yaj. II 135-136 lay- 
down the order of succession to the wealth of a person dying 
sonless Yaj. II, 137 deals with succession to the property of a 
forest hermit, an ascetic or a perpetual Vedic student The Mit. 
then holds that Yaj. IL 138 ' samsrstinastu samsrsti ' is to be 
construed as an exception to Yaj. II 135-136 and understands 
that the words 'of one dying without having a son* (grandson or 
great-grandson) are to be supplied before Yaj H. 138 from II. 136 
( i. e. there is to be anusanga of the words ' svaryatasyaputrasya'. 
The V. M. does not approve of this and states that there is no 
rational ground for applying the principle of anusanga and 
therefore the order of succession to the property left by one 
re-united propounded by V. M. becomes different from that of the 
Mit. The whole discussion is rather abstruse and lengthy and 
the present writer feels that the space required for exposition 
Bhould be saved. Those interested may consult the exhaustive 
notes (pp 265-275) in the edition of the Vyavaharamayukha 
(Poona, 1926 ) on the passages of the Y. M. beginning with the 
one in the note below 2,3S 

This principle of anusanga cannot apply where words of a 
different type intervene between the several sentences. For 
example, when the animal to be offered is killed a long passage 
occurs which contains the 2 * 3 ' words 'sam te prano vayuna 
gacchatam, sam yajatrair-angani, sam yajnapatir-asisa* &c. 
(may your limbs be joined to the worshipful deities and may 
the sacrificer be united to blessing &c ). Here the first clause is 






2139 






1306 History of Dliarmaiastra { Sec. VII, Ch. XXX 

separated from the 3rd clause by a clause in which there are two 
words in the plural while the first and third clauses have two 
words in the singular ; therefore there is no anusanga of the 
words of the first clause into the 2nd and one may employ for 
completing the sense of the 3rd clause some ordinary word from 
popular language (and not the words from the 1st clause ). 

Veda enjoins many acts such as performing a yaga, oasting 
an oblation into fire, making a gift, milking a cow, melting 
clarified butter &c, but all are not on the same level. Some are 
piadhana (primary 2 " or principal), while others are guna- 
bhuta (subsidiary). The acts denoted by words such as 
Prayaj'as by which some substance is not embellished or not 
made fit or is not produced are primary, while those which 
produce a substance or make it fit (such as pounding in the cas8 
of grains of paddy ) are subsidiary. Acts are further classified into 
various groups such as ndya, naimithka or kamya or as kratvartha 
and purusartha. These have already been explained. There 
are six means 2m by which is ascertained the difference or non- 
difference among actB viz. (1) sabdantara (different words, 
Buch as yajati, juhoti, dadati, i. e. yaga, homa, dana are different 
acts); abhyasa 2142 (repetition) as in ' samidbo yaj'ati, tanuna- 
patam yajati' &o. (Tai. S. II. 6. 1. 1-2), where the word yajati is 
repeated five times and therefore there are five different acts 
prescribed; (3)sankhya (number ) as in 'he sacrifices seventeen 
animals to Prajapati' (Tai. Br, I. 3. 4 3), which are seventeen 
distinct acts; (4) gurta (an accessory detail such as the deity

establish that they are six distinct acts and not one composite act vide

or substance in such a passage as ' when curds 2143 are put into 
heated milk it turns into curdled solid mass amiksa which is 
offered to Visvodevas and the liquid called vajina is to be offered 
to Vajins, these two being two distinct offerings) ; (5) prakarana, 
(context). In the sentence ' one should offer agnihotra' (Tai. S. 
I. 5. 9. 1 ) there is a vidhi of the daily performance of Agnihotra. 
In the Eundapayinam-ayana 2W1 it is said 'he offers agnihotra 
for a month'. Since this last occurs in a different context 
altogether (while the former occurs in the context of Darsa- 
pumamasa), this sentence (from Eundapayinam-ayana) deals 
with a different act from that of the daily Agnihotra. (6 ) The 
name (Sanjfia) also differentiates acts, since they occur in 
utpattivakya ( originative injunction) as in the passage quoted 
in the note below. S1K This technique about determining what 
actions are different on account of the several grounds noted 
above, was employed by Hemadri, the Ealanirnaya and the 
Nirnayasindhu in deciding whether Janmastamlvrata and 
JayantTvTata are really one vrata or separate vratas. Vide pp 
132-133 above. 

It has already been stated above (p. 1228) that there are four 
kinds of vidhis of which viniyogavidhi is one. This last conveys 
the relation between a religious act as principal ( iesln or angm) 
and »« its auxiliaries ( angas ). This is the concern of the third 
chapter of the P. M. S., which first defines ' sesa \ states why it 
is called 'sesa', how it is employed in religious acts, what are 
the means of determining the relation of sesa to sesin and the 
comparative strength of each of the means.

Some examples of anga and angin may have to be given 
here. In ' vrlhln proksati' (he Bprinkles rice grains with water) 
the sprinkling (proksana) is an anga (stands in a subsidiary 
relation to) of rice grains a3 direotly shown by the objeotive 
case (vrlhln). The proksana (is motivated by) has tho purpose 
of contributing to the transcendental result ( the apui oa ), since 
what is meant is that if, without the sprinkling of water on the 
rice grains, a sacrifice (yaga) were performed, apurva would not 
be brought about. To take another example, 21W ' ho takes hold 
of the bridle of the horse with ( the mantra beginning with ) 'they 
took hold of the bridle of rta ( cosmio order )'. Here the direot 
assertion (sruti) shown by the objeotive case in 'rasanam' 
shows that that mantra stands in a subordinate relation to (is an 
anga of ) the bridle of the horse, Bince tho utterance of it when 
taking hold of the bridle of the horse effeots a samskara in the 
bridle and taking hold is also an anga of the horse bridle (which 
is in the objective case ), just as proksana is an anga of rice 
grains. 

It has already been stated that ' sesa' means ' what subserves 
the purpose of another ' and it is sesa of that other ( P. M. S. III. 
1. % 'Sesah pararthatvat ' ) and that, according to Badari (III. 1. 
3) 'to substances, properties (like reddish colour of a cow), 
samskaras 214B (what makes a person or thing fit for being 
employed in a yaga or for any other purpose ) the word sesa is 
always applied, while, ace. to Jaimini (III. 1. 4-6) religious 
rites are sesa to the result or fruit (expressed or implied), the 
fruit is sesa to the agent of religious acts and an agent is sesa to 
certain acts. The word 'sesa' is often employed by Dharm- 
asastra works. For example, the Mit. while commenting on 
Yaj II. 118-119 states that tho first half of verse 118 is sesa to all 
the rest !149 ( l. e. serves the purpose of the remaining verse and a 
half). The result is ( if the Mit. be followed ) that if a gift is

aa the DayabhSga (VI 1. 8), and VisvarGpa Vide H. of Dh. 
vol HI. PP- 579-580 for further remarks. 

The P. M. S speaks of six means that are helpful in deter- 
minig, as regards mniyoga-vidhis, what are principal and what 
are auxiliary when there is a doubt or when there is a conflict. 
They are sruti (direct vedic statement or assertion), linga 
(indirect indication), vaky a (syntactical connection or relation), 
prakarana (context), sthana (place or sequence), samakhya 
(sanjSa, name) Whan several of these come together and refer 
to the same subject each succeeding one is weaker than each 
preceding one, since each succeeding one is more remote than 
each preceding one from the objective ( viz. the viniyoga). P. M. 
S. HX 3. 14 is called *bal5baladhikarana\ 11S0 

An example where both sruti and linga come in conflict is 
'with the Aindri verse (verse addressed tolndra) he should 
worship the Garhapatya fire'. The verse addressed to lndra alsl

is * nivesanah sangamano vasunam...Indro na tasthau samare 
pathlnam' (Tai. S. IV. 2. 5. 4). Here the doubt arises whether 
one should worship Indra as the word 'Aindrya' indicates or 
whether one should worship Garhapatya (as the passage 
directly asserts ) with a verse addressed to Indra, or whether one 
should worship both or whether one should worship either Indra 
or Garhapatya as one likes. The conclusion is that sruti ( direct 
Vedic assertion) is more powerful than linga On hearing the 
words 'Garhapatyam upatisthate* we are directly told by the 
Veda about the worship of Garhapatya. The word 'Aindrya* 
being in the instrumental (as in ' dadhna juhoti'-he performs 
homa with curds) merely supplies a detail (guna) viz. that the 
mantra to be repeated is one addressed to Indra and there is no 
word that directly asserts that Indra is to he worshipped. 2152 Sahara 
on PMS HL %. & explains that even Garhapatya has some of 
the qualities of Indra and so metaphorically he may be called 
Indra (as a brave man is called a Hon), since Garhapatya is a 
means of accomplishing yajfia like Indra or Garhapatya may be 
called Indra from the root 'ind*, and may be taken to mean 'a 
master or lord*. 

The six means may each come in conflict with all the means 
that follow each of them. Therefore, there will be five cases of 
conflict of sruti with linga (which has already been described) 
or with vakya, or prakarana or sthana or samakhya; there will 
be four cases of conflict between linga and vakya or each of the 
three ones (of the means) that follow vakya in the sUtra, in the 
same way vakya may he in conflict with prakarana and the 
other two (in all three cases), prakarana may be in conflict 
with sthana or samakhya ( i. e. two cases) and sthana may be in 
conflict with Bamakhya. So that tbeTe are in all fifteen cases of 
conflict of the six meanB among themselves. We need net

take into account the conflict of one of the ate means with its 
predecessors, since to say tot linga may be m conflict with 
Lti is the same thing as saying that tab may be ,m conflict 
withlinga. Very large space would have to be devoted if all these 
fifteen possible conflicts are to be exemplified from Vedic and 
Dharmasastra texts. Therefore, the author does not essay that 



Dharmasastra works often utilize this adhikarana called 
baiUbala {PMS HI. 3 14). lor example, the Par. M. quotes ™ 
a sruti passage that one should perform the daily evening 
sandhya adoration of Aditya (the sun) with mantras addressed 
to Varuna and remarks that " Varunibhih" (like Aindrya) is 
only linga while, 'Adityam-upsthaya' is sruti (direct assertion) 
and therefore the sun is to be worshipped in the evening with 
mantras addressed to Varuna and refers to the example ' aindrya. 
garhapatyaui upatisthate ' for support. 

The fourth adhyaya of the PMS deals mainly with the sub- 
ject of prayojya and prayojaka and kratvartha and purusai tha. 
The latter two have been explained and illustrated above 
(pp. 1232-1335). A few illustrations of the first two may 
be given. The Prayajas have been declared above to be 
kraharllia (p 1233). Therefore, kratu (sacrifice) is the 
prayojaka ( motivating force ) of Prayajas. The reward (pliala, 
svargaor the like) is the prayojaka of yaga or a purusartba 
rite. That is a prayojaka for the sake of which a man is 
led to perform something by a Vedio exhortatory passage. 
The sentence is 'one should offer the Darsapumamasa sacri- 
fice for securing svarga'; therefore the reward (svarga and

self in preparing amiksa. Therefore, it its amiksa, being the 
hams in the Vaisvadevayaga that is the prayojaka of the 
Vaisvadevayaga and vajina-yaga is not the prayojaka of 
putting curds into milk Slss ( P. M. S. IV.l 32-24 ). The result is 
that, if by accident amiksa is destroyed, in order to secure the 
havis ( amiksa ) curds will have again to be put in boiled milk, 
but if vUjmi, not being prayojaka, is destroyed, curds need not 
be put into boiled milk again. 

Examples of purusartha acts have been given above (p. 1234) 
Buchasthe Prajapativrata. This chapter (in 2nd pada) deals 
with several cases of pratipattikarma and arthakarma already 
explained above ( pp 1231-33 ). There are certain substances, 
certain embellishments and subsidiary actions with which 
some phala is associated. For example, at is said ( in Tai S III, 
7. 5. 2 ) ' he who has 3uhu ladle made of parna ( palasa ) wood never 
hears an evil word about himself ' ; ' that he applies collyrium 
( to his eyes ), he injures the eye of his enemy ' ( Tai. S. VI. 11.5); 
'That he performs the Prayajas and Anuyajas, that is indeed 
the armour of the saorifice '. PMS deolares that these texts about 
rewards associated with substances, embellishments and sub- 
sidiary acts are really not vidhis about rewards but are mere 
arthavadas, because all these serve the purpose of the principal 
kratu. 2,ss 

This fourth chapter (in 3rd pada} also decides that, al- 
though no reward is expressly declared by Sruti ( the Veda ) for 
the performance of the Visvajit sacrifice, still in the Visvajit 
sacrifice ( and in other sacrifices where no reward ib expressly 
mentioned ) svarga is the reward. 21H 

The Visvajit is a striking saorifice in which the performer 
donates all belongings of which he is the owner ('Visvajiti sarva-

are to be performed. It would not do to perform them in any 
order that the performer likes. For determining the order of

(purpose, suitability), patha (verbal texts }, pravrtti ( commence- 
ment), kanda (place in tbe texts), mukhya (principal). 

In tbe Vedic passage about tbe dlksa in a sattaa, tbe 
adhvaryu, after performing tbe dlksa (initiation rite) on the 
grbapati (the yajamana, tbe performer of the sacrifice) performs 
dlksa on tbe brahma priest, then on udgatr etc. the Vedio text 
directly lays down tbe sequence (by means of tbe termination 
'tva') that the dlksa of brahmS priest comes after tbe dlksa of 
the yajamana. In tbe passage 'samidho yajati tanunapatam 
yajati &o '. the very order in which the sentences occur in the 
text (i. e patha) determines the order of the performance of the 
several yagas (PMS V. 1 4 ). The Veda first speaks of the offer- 
ing of Agnihotra and then of the cooking of gruel. Here the 
offering of Agnihotra come3 first and preparation of gruel comes 
after that But, unless the material to be offered is ready, no 
Agnihotra offering can be made. Therefore, here the patba- 
krama has to be given up and arthakrama (order as dictated by 
the purpose and suitability )has to be followed i. e. first gruel must 
be prepared and then Agnihotra offered. 2,S1 This is an example 
showing that arthakrama is more powerful than pathakrama 
( PMS V. 4 1 ). The Parasarasmrti lays down that every day one 
should perform sandhya (morning adoration), bath, japa (mutte- 
ring of sacred texts ), homa, study of the Veda, worship of gods, 
Vaisvadeva and feeding guests. The Par. M. says that™ 11 
setting aside the pathakrama one must follow the suitability 
and therefore bath comes first and sandhya afterwards. The 
Sin. C, quotes Vrddhamanu to tbe effect that a childless chaste 
widow should offer pinda to her deceased husband and take his 
wealth. Here it is proper to hold that she should first take his 
wealth and then perform his sraddbas. In the Vajapeya the text 
says that the performer (yajamana) has to tie to the saorifioial 
post seventeen pasus to be offered to Prajapati ( Tai. B r. I. 3. 4 .

2-3). It is also provided that each of the 17 pasus should have 
several samskaias performed on it such as proksana. ( consecra- 
tion by sprinkling sacred water on it ), upakarana (bringing 
neaT ). One may take any of the 17 animals first and begin to 
perform the first of the samskaras on it; but having once begun 
with a particular animal he must perform the second and other 
satnskaras one after another on the same animal ; i. e. the order 
of the samskaras on an animal is determined by the commence- 
ment. Kanda or sthana is exemplified as follows : The Jyotis- 
toma is the model sacrifice (prakrti) of which Sadyaskra is a 
vikrti ( modification ). It is prescribed by the Veda in the case 
of Sadyaskra that all animals should be sacrificed together at 
the savanlya stage. 2163 In Jyotistoma, there are three animals 
offered viz. ' agnlsomlya' in the morning, * savanlya ' in the noon 
and ' anubandbya ' ia ths evening. Sadyaskra, being a vikrti, 
all these have to be performed in it ; but the particular text 
about it provides that all three must be sacrificed together at the 
savanlya stage. This (offering all three simultaneously) is im- 
possible and therefore all that can be done is to offer ( them ) one 
after another ( and not at three different times in the day); it 
would appear at first sight that the Agnlsomlya pasu comes 
' flrat; but that is not so, since simultaneous offerings being laid 
down at the savanlya stage in sadyaskrayaga, the savanlya- 
pasu is to be first offered (and not Agnlsomlya) and then the 
Agnlsomlya immediately after and then Anubandhya or these 
two may be offered in any order one likes (but immediately). 

An example of sequence being determined by the mukhya 
(first or principal) is : there is a sruti passage «two Sarasvata 
offerings are to be made; this is indeed a divine couple '.«6i

Details are provided as regards the two offerings to SarasvatI 
and Sarasvata The doubt arises : are the details about the offer- 
ing to be made to the female deity to be performed first or are 
they to be first performed as the offerings to the male deity ? 
The prima facie view being that as no ieistra exists regulating 
priority one may do as one likes, the established conclusion is 
that the order of sequence in the case of the details should be 
determined by the order of the Yajyanuvakya verses. These 
are mentioned first about the female deity in the words ' pra no 
devl SarasvatI ' ( Tai. S I. 8. 22. 1, B.g VI 61. 4). Therefore, 
the conclusion is that in the details also the offering to the 
female deity should come first. 

In PMS V. 1 16 it is decided that the order expressed in 
mantras should be followed in preference to the order contained 
in Brahmana texts. 2165 The Darsapurnamasa sacrifice ib made 
up of three component sacrifices, JLgneya, TJpamsu and the Agnl- 
somlya. In Tai S. II. 5 %. 3, the Agnlsomlya sacrifice is first 
described and in Tai II, 6 3. 3 the Agneya is described. But 
these are held to be Brahmana texts, though now appearing in the 
Samhita texts, since they lay down a vidhi ; but in the Mantra- 
patha the Agneya mantra 'Agnir-murdha' ( Tai. B. HX 5. 7 1) 
is first set out and then follows the mantra ' Agnlsoma savedasa' 
( Tai Br IIL 5. 7. Z) Therefore, the Agneya is to be first per- 
formed and the Agnlsomlya afterwards. 

If there are several deities or brahmanas to be honoured 
with several acts or things, or there are several yfipas (sacrificial 
posts} as in Aikadasina animal sacrifice on whieh several 
samskaras are to be performed from afijana to purivyana (sur-

no special ground of choice between the two, holds that the father takes 
first following certain other smrtis like Brhaf-Visna The Dayabhaga

rounding with a girdle ), then one should perform all the sams - 
karas from anjana to parivyana on the yupa first and then all 
these on the 2nd and so on up to the last yupa or whether one 
should perform anjana on all yupas one after another, the next 
samskara on all yupas one after another and so on till the last 
sarhskaia of parivyana is done on all yupas one after another. The 
former way is called kandanusamaya and the latter ' padarthanu- 
samaya '. 2I6S Jai. V. 2 7-9 refers to the first method and Jai. V. 2. 
1-3 to the 2nd "Vide for the explanation and illustration of these 
two, H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp 739-740, p 1132 n 2538 and Vol. IV. 
pp 441-48 n 987. On Yaj I 233 ('apasavyam tatah krtva) 
the Mit. remarks that the performer of Sraddha follows the 
kandanusamaya method for the Vaisvadeva brahmanas i. e. 
gives them water for washing the feet, then acamana, seat, 
sandalwood paste, flowers &o, then he should wear the sacred 
thread on the right shoulder and offer the upacaras to the pitrya 
brahmanas. 

The sixth adhyaya of PMS is a very interesting one. It 
deals with the various aspects of the question of adhikara, that 
is, qualifications of the performer of a sacrifice. It is a very exten- 
sive chapter having eight padaa like chap. HI and X A. few of 
the numerous propositions contained therein that have influenced 
the works on Dharmsastra have already been set out, such as 
women s right to participate in Vedic sacrifices, sudra's ineligibi- 
lity for them, the rathakgranyaya and nisadasthapatinyaya 
andafew more will be dealt with here. As a preliminary 

one desirous of heaven should offer the Darsapurnamasa sacrifice

'adhikarl is the owner (or master) who stands above all actions 
(yaga).' Another more elaborate definition is given as * adhikarl 
is one who desires some reward ( such as heaven or happiness ), 
who is possessed of the oapaciby to perform the act prescribed, 
who has learning and who is not excluded from performing a 
sacrifice (by Sruti) *. Even lower animals desire happiness ; hence 
to exclude them the words 'possessed of the capacity ' &o. are 
added. A man may be totally ignorant and so the word ' vidvSn ' 
is added ; a sudra may desire happiness, may have capacity and 
be also learned but he is excluded by the vedic text, ' Therefore 
the Sudra is not fit (or ordained ) for sacrifice '. 

In VI. I. 39-40 it is established a168 that every man belong- 
ing to one of the three higher classes has a right to perforin 
Vedic sacrifices A man though at one time devoid of wealth 
may acquire wealth by various means. Similarly, it is said in 
VI. 1. 41 that one who is defective in a limb is just like one who 
is devoid of wealth i. e. such a man has a right to offer Vedic 
sacrifices provided he takes steps to remove the weakness. In 
"VT. 1 42 it is further provided that if the defect is oongential 
and incurable, the person who suffers from such a defect is not 
entitled to perform Vedic sacrifices.

Exclusion from inheritance 1319 

The ancient and medieval Hindu law of inheritance and 
succession was modelled on this. Vide Taj. II 140, Manu IX. 
201 and Narada (dayabhaga, verses 21-22) Yaj II. 140 declares 
that the impotent, the outcast and his son, a lame man, a 
lunatic, an idiot, a blind man and a person afflicted with an 
incurable disease ate not entitled to a share, but aie entitled to 
receive maintenance. This subject has been dealt with in H. of 
Dh. Vol. HI pp 610-612 The Mit. on Yaj. II. 140 provides that 
the grounds of disqualification apply to males and females 
alike. But the recent Hindu Succession Act ( No. 32 of 1956 ) 
sweeps away all these grounds of disqualification by providing 
that no person Bhall bB disqualified from succeeding to any pro- 
perty on the ground of any disease, defect or deformity or, save as 
provided in this act, on any other ground whatever (section 28). 

A good many sQtras (in chap. VI. 3. 17-41) deal with 
what are oalled 'pratinidhi' (substitute, representative or 
proxy). These have been described in H. of Dh. Vol. H. pp. 684' 
1110, 1203, Vol HI. pp. 471, 637, 653. 654 (where Satyasadha Sr* 
S. HI containing similar rules is mentioned). A few of them 
are briefly mentioned here. The first rule is that if the substance 
declared by the Veda for preparing an offering perishes or is 
lost as regards an obligatory rite or as regards kamya rite that 
ib already begun, one should substitute another substance (like 
nlvaras, wild rice grains ) for vrihi (rice grains) or yaia i.e. 
barley grains and finish the rite (VI. 3 13-17 ). In some cases 
Vedic texts prescribe a substitute for the substance required to be 
used asm ' if he (the performer) cannot obtain the Soma plant, 
fie suould substitute putlka stalks and extract juice therefrom' 
isis argued by the objector that, as the Veda expressly substitutes 
puukas for soma, one should conclude that where Veda does not 
™™f» ? ° nt T a substitute f°* a prescribed substance, it

formed on them. When rice grains are employed the mantra 
expressly speaks of the rice offering as the sap or essence of rice 
grains. There adaptation (H/*«)istobe made as 'nlvaranam 
medha' (videPMS IX 3. 1-2 ).« 70 But in certain cases no 
substitute is allowed viz the devata with respect to which an 
Iiavts (offering) is prescribed cannot have another substituted 
in a rite e. g. ' Agneyostakapalah * cannot he changed into 
' aindrostakapalah ', since in that case the rite will cease to be 
what was intended Similarly, when the text says ' he offers into 
the Ahavaniya fire,' one cannot substitute the Garhapatya Are ; 
another mantra cannot be substituted for the one prescribed nor 
can other rites be substituted for the Prayajas 'samidho yajati' 

&C.). 2 " 1 

The Veda forbids the use of ocuakas, kodravas and masas as 
unfit for a sacrifice. If a person mistakenly takes masa grains 
or particles believing them to be mudga grains or particles and 
uses them in a sacrifice in which an oblation of boiled mudga 
pulse is prescribed, he will not be performing the desired rite as 
what is forbidden as unfit cannot be a substitute. 2in 

This nyaya is relied upon by the Mit. on Taj. II. 126 
(which simply states that if joint family properties are sup- 
pressed or concealed by some members and kept for themselves, 
they should be distributed in equal shares even after partition 
( when this is found out ), which holds that this verse cannot be 
interpreted so as to absolve the concealer of such joint property 
from guilt simply on the ground that he was himself a part 
owner and explains that just as a sacrificer mistakenly believing 
masa particles as mudga ones loses the fruit of the sacrifice, so 
the concealer of joint property is guilty of wrong. The Vyavaha- 
raprakasa ( p 555 ) and Apararka p. 733 take the same view, but 
the Dayabhaga (XII. 11-13) and V. E. (p. 526 ) are opposed to 
this ( vide H. of Dh Vol. III. p. 636 ). The PrSyascittatattva 
p. 482 has an elaborate note on this nyaya.

About pratimdhis in sacrifices 1321 

Another rule is that there can be no substitute for the 
performer of the sacrifice (VI. 3. El), since (in Jai. HE. 7. 
18-20 ) it is laid down that the fruit of the rite belongs to the 
owner, though after beginning the rite he leaves everything to 
the priests engaged to perform the rite. The only exception is 
in the case of sattras ( Jai VI. 3. 22 ) performed by many persona 
together acting both as performers and as priests. 

One important adhikarana is VI. 7. 31-40. There is a 
Sattra called ' Visvasrjam-ayanam* which is said to last for 1000 
samvatsaras. After referrring to Tai. Br. X 3. 7. 7 and 1. 7. 6. 2 
( satayuh purusah ) and to the views of Karsnajini and Lavuka- 
yana.Jaimini boldly establishes the conclusion that satiivat- 
sara here means day. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. H p. 1246 n. 2683 for 
the Maliabhasija stating that the Yajfiikas in speaking about 
such sattras only follow the tradition handed down by ancient 
sages. Medhatithi on Manu L 84 (' vedoktam-ayur-martyanam ) 
has a long note wherein he refers to the viw of Jaimini, 
quotes 'satayur vat purusah' and also ' satam-innu sarado anti 
deva ' ( Rg. 1. 89. 9 ) and cites the views of other interpreters. 
The Katyayana Sr. (16. 17-27) discusses this very subject 
at great length, refers to the differing interpretations of 
Bharadvaja, Karsnajini and Laugaksi but ultimately holds that 
samvatsara means ' day ' here 

In tbe first six chapters of the P. M. S. the procedure of such 
rites as Darsapurnainasa the details of which are expressly laid 
down by the Veda has been considered. In the six chapters 
from the 7th consideration will be given to sacrifices like 
Amdragna the procedure of which is not expressly laid down by 
hoVeda.*" In the 7th chapter what is considered is whether 
L^/\ ^ ( .fr fiC6a that are "ofcfieBttoas °f ^ model

process or method by which the details prescribed in connection 
with one rite are taken beyond that rite and transferred to 
another. Sahara quotes from some anoient author a sloka defin- 
ing atidesa. The sacrifice from wbioh details are transferred is 
called prakrli ( model or Archetype ) and the sacrifice to which 
details are transferred or extended is called vikrti ( or Ectype }. 
Atidesa may be provided for by vacana (Vedictext) or by the 
name The first is of two kinds viz. by a direct statement or by 
an inferential process. For example, as regards a magic 
sacrifice called Isu the text says, after speaking of some details, 
that the rest are the same as in 217i Syena. An instance of an 
inferential vacana is the extension to the Saurya sacrifice of the 
details of the Agneya in Darsapumamasa, because both are very 
closely connected and because no details are prescribed by the 
text about ' Sauryayaga* (PMS VII. 4.1). The name also is 
two-fold, viz. name of a rite and name of a samskaia. The 
Masagnihotra prescribed (vide PMS II. 3. 24) in Kundapayi- 
nam-ayana is a different rite from the obligatory Agnihotra (as 
in'yavajjlvani-agnihotramjuhuyat*) as proved above, but the 
name * agnihotra' being common to both, the details of the usual 
Agnihotra ( such as milking the cow, offering curds or milk, 
using a Khadira fuel stick &c. ) are to be extended to Masagni- 
hotra ( Jai. VII. 3 1-4). Extension due to samskara name ia 
instanced in Jai.VII. 3 12-15. In the Varunapraghasa (one of 
the oaturmaByas ), Avabbrtha ( bath) is prescribed, but no details 
are added and therefore the requisite details are to be taken from 
the rules about the Avabhrtha in Somayaga, 217S 

Atidesa is frequently resorted to by smrtis and digests. 
For example, Taj. I. 236 and 242 extend the procedure of Pinda- 
pitryajfla as regards Agnaukarana and offering of pindas to the 
Parvanasraddha. The Parasarasmrti (VII. 18-19) speaks 2176

of a woman in her monthly illness as a oandall on the first day 
of the illness, as the murderess of a brahmana on the 2nd day 
and as a washerwoman on the 3rd day. The Par. M. remarks 
that the intention of calling such a woman by these names is to 
convey that intercourse with her will result in the same sm as 
would be incurred by a person of higher classes if he had inter- 
course with a candali &c. For an instance of express extension, 
vide V. M. pp 56-57 when it quotes a verse of Pitamaha on the 
balance ordeal (in which the word 'yupavat' is used) and 
remarks that atidesa is prescribed expressly by the word ' yupa- 
vat'. 

The 8th chapter deals with specific cases of extension 
(atidesa). The Darsapurnamasa is the prakrti of all 2177 tshs 
and ' Darsapurnamasabhysm yajeta' is called wdhyadi and 
vtdhyanta is the whole procedure of Darsapurnamasa ( except the 
originative injunction ' darsapurnam§syabhyam yajsta) detailed 
in tbe Brahmanas about the offering of purodasa ( cake ) &o. In 
the Vikrtiyaga called Saurya 2178 the sentence ' one who desires 
to secure the lustre of Vedio learning should offer boiled rice to 
the Sun ' is the vidhyadi, but no details are mentioned there. 
There is an expectation of some procedure and, though there are 
numerous vidhyantas in relation to sacrifices, the special word 
'mtivpati* is indicative of the procedure of Darsapfirnamasa 
(in which also there is nirvBpa) and one comes to understand 
that the Saurya cam is offered as in Sgneya ( the first rite in 

2177. Yedic sacrifices are usually divided for convenience into three 
varieties, viz. Isti ( in -which offerings are o£ milk, clarified butter, rice, 
barley and otter grams ), Paso and Soma and the latter again info Eksha 
(i-is't-iR for one day hie Agnistoma ), Ahina ( lasting {or more than one day 
up to 12 dajs) and Sattra (lasting from 12 days to a year or more) 
Sahara on PMS IV. 4. 20 states that there are fonr Mahayajnas, viz. 
Agniholra, Darsapurnamiisa, Jyotistoma, Pindapitryajna There are seven 
Soma sacrifices as stated by Gant Dh S. VIII. 18. Besides these Srattta 
tltes, there arc other rites prescribed in the grhynsutras, which are offered 
in grhya fire and seven important ones from which are called pikayainas.

Daisapurnamasa ). The details of the prakrti are to be perfor- 
med in all other istts along with the few details that may have 
been stated expressly as to some. 

The Jyotistoma is the prakrti of all soma sacrifices of one 
day and of Dvadasaha and its details are performed in all modi- 
fications of soma sacrifices such as Atiratra. The Agalsomlya 
is the prakrti of all sacrifices in which a. pasu ( animal ) is to be 
sacrificed, the details of which are to be performed in all vikrtis 
of pasuyagas. Dvadasaha is of two kinds, Ahina and Sattra and 
is the prakrti of all Ahina sacrifices like DviratTa, Triratra up to 
Sataratra; and Dvada&aha of the sattra type is the model of all 
sattras. Gavam-ayana is the prakrti of all sacrifices like 
Adityanam-ayana. Darvihomas are sut jut is and are not 
prakrtis or vikrtis of any other sacrifices. All these are consi- 
dered in the 8th chapter. 

The 9th chapter deals with uka (adaptation). When 
applying the principle of atideia certain alterations and adapta- 
tions are necessary in the matter of mantras, samans and 
Bamskaras. The word uha ordinarily means only tarha or 
vt-carana (reasoning), yet in PMS it has a special meaning. 2179 

The Agneya is the prakrti in whioh the mrvaipa (offering) 
is to be made with the words *I offer to Agni what is liked by 
him ' ; in the Sauryayaga, which is a vikrti of Agneya, the 
offering has to be made with the words ' I offer to Surya what is 
liked by him. ' In the Vajapeya we read ' he offers to Brhaspatl 
mrvapa grains cooked on seventeen pans'. The Vajapeya is a 
modification of Darsapurnamasa in which the grains of rice are 
sprinkled with water; therefore sprinkling has to be done on 
nlvara grains also (PMS IX. %. 40). On the 2nd and following 
days of the Jyotistoma sacrifice there is recitation of the Subra- 
hmanya litany zl8 ° addressed to Indra by the Subrahmanya 
priest, beginning with the words 'Indra agaooha, hariva agaccha, 
Medhatither-mesa &o'. In the Agnistut sacrifice also there is

Adaptation of Subrahmatyya^nigada 1325 

Subrahmanya-nigada Mt addressed to Agni. In reciting it the 
word ' Agne' is substituted for ' Indra'; but the following words 
' Hariva agaccha ' is aTe not to be changed and are to be recited, 
as they are attributes whioh may be predicated of Agni also 
( PMS IX. 1. 42-44 ). The principle deduced by the Mlmamsakas 
Beams to be that, only if the words in the original mantra 
cannot at all be extended to the modified yaga as they stand, 
then uha may hare to he resorted to but not otherwise. Sahara 
however, notes that the 'yaj&ikas perform uha { i. e. adapt them 
by suitable changes ) i. e. they recite ' agne agaccha rohitasva 
brhad-bhano' # etc.). It is noteworthy that, according to PMS 
II. 1.34 and Sahara thereon, a mantra as adapted (uhtta) is not 
called a mantra, since only those are mantras 2152 that aTe 
recognized as such by the learned. In the Darsapurnamasa 
when the priest takes out four handfuls of grains and puts them 
in a winnowing basket he repeats over three of the handfuls the 
mantra which literally means ' at the command of God Savitr, 
with the arms of Asvins and with the hands of PQsan I take out 
for Agni thee that art dear ( to him )'. * is * The PMS holds (in 
IX 1. 38-37) that the words Savitr, PQsan, Asvin aTe not to be 
changed by 5ha in the modifications of Darsapurnamasa where 
the deity to which the offering is to he made is not Agni. 
Sahara assigns rather faT-fetched meanings to the words Savitr,' 
Asrins and Pusan ( as in the note below) and says that they are 
meant to eulogize the laying aside of the handfuls of grains for 
offering. There is another interesting case where there is no

ulta. In the DaT§apurnamasa there Is a praisa (diteotion) 'set 
down 2184 the water for sprinkling, put down the fuel sticks and 
the bunch of kusa grass, clean the sruc and iruva ladles, gird up 
the wife (of thesaorificer) and come out with clarified butter*. 
Suppose the sacrificer has two or more wives. Still the singular 
' patnlm' was to be used and not the dual or plural either in the 
model itself (IX. 3. 20) or in any modification thereof (IX. 
3. 21). Dharmasastra works make use of uha. The Visnu- 
dharmasutra provides that one should perform Sraddha of one's 
maternal grand-father and the latter's two male ancestors in a 
similar way by the uha of the mantra. 218S r The mantra in the 
case of the Sraddha of male anoestors is * Sundhantam pitarah ' 
(Ap Sr I. 7. 13 ), 'which should be ohanged into 'Sundhantatn 
matamahah', vide Mit. on Yaj. 1.254 and, H. of Dh. Vol. IV 
p. 513 n. 1142a. 

When in a sacrifice boiled rice is to.be offered the mantra is 
' syonam...vrihmam medha sumanasyamanah ' (vide pp. 1298-99 
n. 2125 above ). If boiled rice is destroyed or not available and 
niuara grains are substituted, there is no uha as ' nlvaranam 
medha' but the words 'vrlhlnam medha' are to be retained 
(PMS IX. 3. 23-26), because, as stated in PMS VI. 3. 27 
( samSnyam tac-ciklrsa hi ), nlvaras are substituted on aooount 
of the similarity of parts of boiled nwaras with the parts of rice 
grains. 

In the third and fourth padas of the 9th chapter there are 
twelve adhiharanas about the adhngu-praisa recited by the 
Hotr in Pasubandha. Vide H. of Dh Vol II p. 1121, note 2504 
for that praisa. There is uha to be made about certain words 
therein and PMS explains some of the unfamiliar and difficult 
words in that text. 

The tenth chapter is the longest chapter in the PMS, 
having eight padas and 577 sutras (i. e. more than one-fifth of

Badha explained l^S? 

the total number of sutras) just as the third { with 363 suttas) 
and the 6th (with 349 sutras) have eight pSdas each. This 
chapter is concerned with badha ( annulment or exclusion ) and 
a&ta««wyaorsamuocaya which is the exact opposite or anti- 
thesis of badha. The general rule is that the details of the 
prakrtiyaga (model sacrifice) should be taken over in the vikrtt 
(modification). But in some oases the vikrti-yaga 2186 has a 
different name, some of the samskaras ( purificatory and embelli- 
shing acts ) and some of the substances ( dravya ) employed in 
the prakrti cannot be extended to the vikrtis, because there ate 
express tests negativing their employment or because they 
serve no purpose or have become useless or senseless. Sahara 
states that badha occurs when an idea or knowledge determined 
for certain as this type or that has to be understood as wrong 
owing to some (special) reason while abhyuccaya (addition or 
combination) occurs when even after we have the knowledge 
that certain matters are to he extended to the viktti there is the 
further idea that a few others also are to he additional in the 
vikrti. 

The Mai. S prescribes that one desirous* 187 of long life 
should offer a lump of one hundred krsnalas (golden pieces 
shaped as grains of rice) heated in clarified butter. But no 
pounding (aiagkata, threshing) iato be done in this, as the 
grains being made of gold, there is no chaff which can be 
separated by pounding ( X 1. 1-3 ). Similarly, no upastarana, 2m 
(pouting of clarified butter) and abhigharana (the subsequent 
pouring of clarified butter) are to be done, since in the model 
sacrifice these two are done for making the oblation to have a 
sweet flavour (XJ 3-11). A caru of rice ha3 to be boiled 
(i.e. the heat of fire is to be applied to it ). In the same way 
the golden pieces are to be heated in clarified butter by fire ( X. 2. 
1-2). The golden pieces have to be sucked like sugarcane 
pieces (X 2. 13-16), because they cannot be eaten while in the

model sacrifice ids and praiitra 2m> are actually eaten. In a 
magic rite like syena reeds are spread on the ground and not 
kusa grass (as in the model sacrifice). This badha is due to a 
special text. 2,9 ° The general rule in vedic sacrifices is that 
priests have to be chosen and daksina is to be paid to them at 
the end but sattras aie an exception, since in sattras all 
are priests as well as performers (yajamanas). Here the 
exclusion of varana ( choosing } is due to the fact that in the 
other sacrifices the yajamana and priests are different and the 
latter are engaged for fee. There is a visible purpose in select- 
ing or engaging priests, 2191 but in asattrawhere ex hypothesi 
all are yajamanas and priests as well, there is no visible purpose 
in going through the ceremony of choosing priests (rtvig- 
varana). 

One example of samucoaya may be given. In the Vajapeya 
(which is said to be a form of Jyotistotna according to PMS HI. 
7. 50-51 ) seventeen animals are to be sacrificed. In the model 
sacrifioe (i e. Jyotistoma) also there are certain animals to be 
offered. The question is whether there is badha of the pa&us 
prescribed in the prakrtiyaga or whether there is combination 
(samuccaya). The conclusion is that there is samucoaya 
( X 4. 6 ), because in the Tai. Br. there occur passages like this-' 
" The Brahmavadins say ' why is it that all saonfioial rites are 
contained in Vajapeya ' ? He should reply ' by means of pasus, 
viz. he sacrifices an animal to Agni, thereby he contains Agnis- 
toma, he contains the TJkthya &c." This shows that he has to 
sacrifice also other animals besides the seventeen. 21W The Mit.

Cases of badha in Tanti aiarhka 1329 

on Yaj. HI. 243 furnishes examples of samuccaya in the matter 
of expiations. 

The Tantravarfcika ( on PMS HI. 3. U pp. 859-860 ) collecfe 
together ahout three dozen cases of badha in general not 
dependent on either the conflict between sruti, linga &c. or not 
falling under the badha instanced above. They are 'inference 
and such appearances as mirage are dispelled by or invalidated 
by direct perception, deceptive means of knowledge by the six 
means of knowledge, smrti by sruti, a contradictory and untrust- 
worthy smrti by a trustworthy and uncontradicted smrti, a smrti 
with a visible purpose by another with an unseen purpose &c. '. 

There is in the 10th chapter an important topic about 
daksmu ( sacrificial fees ). In X 2. 22-28 it is established that 
daksina is to be given not for an unseen purpose ( adrsta > but 
for engaging the priests to perform rites required in sacrifices. 
In HI. 8 1-2 it is established that the yajamana ( the svSmin ) is 
to engage priests for sacrifices except where a vedic text 
expressly directs otherwise ( as in Tai. S. V. 2. 8. 2 ). In X. 
3. 39 the items of daksma are set out from TandyaXVI 1. 10-11 ; 
it is held that the words ' dvadasasatam daksina ' mean aB that 
the cows are to be 112 ( X. 3 39, 49 ) and in X. 3. SO it is 
provided that the yajatnana should himself distribute the fees 
and X. 3 55 sets out the method of distribution. All priests are 
not to receive equal shares. The four principal priests are hotr, 
adhvaryu,««udgatr and brahma and each of these four have 
three assistants arranged in a certain order set out in the note 
below. Suppose there are one hundred cows to be distributed

as foo. Each group of four is assigned 1/4 i, e. 25 for hotU and 
hiB assistants, tho hota getting 12 and tho other three getting 
respectively 6, 4, and 3 i. o. they get respectively half, 1/3 and 1/4 
of what their principal gets. Tho same method applies to tho 
other threo groups. Tho prima facie im view is that there 
should be an equal distribition of the foo (oows)as sruti does 
not lay down any unoqual distribution ; this is not accepted and 
it is proposed that tho fee should bo distributed in proportion to 
tho work done by oaoh. Tho established conclusion is that both 
the views are unacceptable and that tho distribution should be 
in accordance with the moaning of tho words ' ardhinah, im 
trtlyinah and padinah' employed by Sruti. 

M ami (VIII 210 ) mentions tho method of tho distribution 
of fees in Vodic sacrifices outlined above and extends its prin- 
ciples of division to men working jointly on such undertakings 
as the construction of houses &c. mi Though the sutra (samam 
syad-asrutivat ) is only the purvapaksa view and not accepted 
as to the distribution of the cows as fees in Vedic sacrifices, it 
has been frequently followod as an equitable rule by medieval 
DhaTmasastra writers. The Sm. C, relies on it about the liability 
of sureties (II. p 152), about equal shares between father and 
sons in partition (II. p. 260) and II. 285 (distribution of yautaka 
among unmarried daughters ), II. 404. Kulluka on Manu III. 1 
(where 36 years are laid down as the period of studontship for 
mastering the three Vodas) states, relying on the sutra 'samam' 
&o. that thirty-six years should be equally distributed over the 
three VedasSkhas. The Madanaratna (on Vyavahara) p. 202

quotes both verses of Manu (YUL 210-11), then quotes Man 
VHX 210 (on p. 213 ) and explains and then sets out the distribu- 
tion of the daksina if it was 112 cows. The Yyaharaprakasa 
pp. 443 and 548 (on division of mother's yautaka strtdhana by 
unmarried daughters) refer to the rule of equal division.^ Most 
of these works (as printed) read the sutra as ' samam syadasru- 
tatvat' and not as Jaimini and Sahara read. 

The eleventh chapter deals with tantra which embraces 
cases where one act serves the purpose of several other acts or 
rites. 2193 For example, there are three yagas viz. purodasa 
( cake) baked on eight potsherds for Agni, curds for Indra and 
milk for Indra ; one performance of the Prayajas serves these 
three (XL 1. 5-19 and XI 1. 29-37). Adhana ( establishment of the 
sacred fires) is to be done only once and is not to be repeated in 
each isK, pasuyaga or somayaga (XI. 3. 2); the utensils required 
for Srauta rites are prepared only once and are to be kept till 
the death of the saCTificer ( XL 3. 34-42 ). 21 " All these are cases 
of tantra. The general rule is that the place, time and the per- 
former as regards all principal matters in one composite rite 
such as Agneya and others in Darsapurnamasa are one ( 211, 
2. 1) and also that they are the same for angas ( details); but in 
the case of the ahgas( details) the place, time and the performer 
may be different on account of express texts.

sacrifices collectively, then the subsidiary details have to be

performed only once and not separately in the case of each 
component; this is tantra. But if the result follows from each 
of the component sacrifices separately, then the subsidiary 
details should be performed with each one of those components. 
That would be a caBe of av&pa ( decentralisation or scattering). 
In the Darsapurnamasa there are really two sets 2aj0 of sacri- 
fices, one called Darsa (on amavasya) and the other Fflrnamasa. 
The subsidiaries prescribed for each are almost the same. Yet 
they have to be repeated with each of the two sets, the principal 
reason being that the two are performed on two different days 
separated by a fortnight, though the two sets together make one 
single sacrifice leading to a single fruit. Vide PMS XL 2, 12-18 
which is a case of avapa. 

The Avesti is a sacrifice which is performed as part of the 
composite sacrifice called Rajasuya that could be performed only 
by Ksatriyas. It is also an independent sacriSce that could be 
performed by any one of the three higher varnas. This is no 
part of the Rajasuya and is different from it, though the passage 
about it occurs in the midst of the description of Bajasuya. 2301 
This is relied upon by the Nirnayasindhu in connection with 
the NavarStra from iLsvina 1st to 9th of the bright half. There 
were different views, viz. Devlpuja was to be performed for 9 
days or on 8th or 9th tithi (vide above p. 154). The Kalika- 
purana quotes 22M a verse about Devlpuja on the 8th or 9th alone 
of JLsvina (iukla) and the N. S. interprets it as a separate wor- 
ship on 8th or 9th alone distinct from the whole Navaratra.

Sense of ' raja' m the Avesti text 1333 

The same adhkararia where the Puivapaksa proposes that Raja 
means any one of any varna who rules over a kingdom and 
offers protection to the country and its cities, the siddhanta 
( PMS and Sabara ) holds that 'raja' is a word expressive of a caste 
viz. Ksatriya, and this is referred to by several late Dharmasiastra 
works like the Rajadharniakaustubha (p. 5). The V. P. refers 
to this adhikarana and interprets the verse of Warada viz. ' one 
who is an apostate from the order of ascetics would become the 
slave of the king* as providing that even a ksatriya apostate 
would have to be the slave even of a vaisya ruler, though the 
word 'raja' in the primary sense means a ksatriya yet in a 
secondary sense (laksana) any one who protects subjets could 
be called raja. The Par.M. discusses this adhikarana at great 
length (L l.pp. 449-55). It may be noticed that the meaning 
of ' raja ' as ksatriya in early texts changed to any ruler of any 
class who protects the country and people ruled over by him. 
This change is brought out briefly in Tantravartika on HI. 5. 26*. 

The 12th chapter deals with the topics of prasaftga, vtkalpa 
and tte like. Prasanga occurs when something done in one 
Place is helpful in another place also, just as when a lamp is 
Sighted in a mansion it illumines the public road also. » In

different kinds or of the same kind, there is no necessity of a 
separate expiation for venial sins on the analogy of pasupuro- 
dasa. 22DS VideH. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 88-91 for twelve years' 
expiation for brahmana-murder. 

Vikalpa has already been dealt with above (pp. 1249-1252 ). 

The preceding pages are enough to exhibit the main 
doctrines and some of the principal Mlmamsa rules of interpreta- 
tion and the great influence that the Mlmamsa exercised for 
over two thousand years on Dharmasastra works from the 
ApastambadharmasStra to late medieval works like the Smrti- 
tattva, Mirnayasindhu and Vyavaharamayiikha. An exhaustive 
treatment of the numerous technical terms, topics and principles 
of the mlmamsa would easily cover a thousand pages, would 
enormously add to the extent of this work and has to be given 
up here for reasons of space, if for no other reason. 

The Mlmamsa rulsB have been of considerable help to 
Dharmasastra writers. But it should not be supposed that 
application of the Mlmamsa rules is easy or that the rules always 
enable scholars to arrive at agreed or certain and definite 
conclusions. Apart from the schism between the Prabhakara and 
Bhatta schools already referred to above ( on p. 1189 ) there are 
many circumstances which militate against the certainty and 
usefulness of mlmamsa conclusions. There are variant readings 
in the sutras themselves ( e. g. on I. 2. 9 there are three readings 
according to Tantravartika p. 123, on I. 2. 14 two readings aco. 
to Tantrav pp. 128-129). Sahara omitted the Butra H. 4. 17 
( vakyasamavayat ) and the Tantravartika notes (pp. 895-897) 
that Sahara omits six sutras after IH. 4. 9. Sahara frequently 
mentions a predecessor called Vrttikara with great respect but 
differs from him in some cases ( e. g. on 1. 1. 3-5 ), does not like 
his way of dealing with sutras like II. 1. 32, 33 and VBI.1.2. 
Sahara gives alternative explanations of the same sutra (e. g. of 
I. 3. 4, VII. 4. 13, VHI. 1. 39 ). Sometimes he treats two or more 
sutras as forming one adhikarana and alternatively treats one 
of them as forming a separate adhikarana (as in L 3. 3-4, 
11.2.23-24). He proposes more than two explanations of the 
same sutra viz. IV. 1. 2. He puts forward two or more explana- 
tions of the same adhilcarcma ( as in IV. 3. 27 -28, VIH. 3. 14-1 5

Several explanations of same adhikataqa 1335 

of two sutras out of four ), IX. 1. 1, IX, 1. 2-3, IX 1. 34-35 , 
IX. 2. 1-2, IX. 2. 21-24, IX, 2. 25-28 four explanations, X. 2. 
30-31 three explanations, X 1. 1-2 three explanations, X 4. 
1-2 three explanations. On ' Visaye prayadar^anat ' II. 3. 16 
Sahara himself is at a loss as to what the douht intended hy 
the sutrakara is or what the sutrakara want3 to establish and 
relies upon what the vrttikara says about the passage to be 
discussed and about the doubt that arises. Besides, Sahara and 
KutnaTila differ about the subject matters of certain adhiharanas 
as in 1. 3. 3-4 (where EumSrila gives on pp. 194-195 a different 
interpretation altogether after first accepting Sahara's view ), 
1. 3. 5-7, 1. 3. 8-9, 1. 3. 11-14. Kumarila shows scant respect 
for Jaimini by naming him without the honorific title 'hhagavan* 
or 'acarya' on pp 495,650,655,895, charges Jaimini with 
composing sukas not containing much substance (p. 895) and 
remarks that Jaimini's sutra is improper or wrong (e. g. vide 
p. 1241 about IV. 2. 27). 

Kumarila is often critical of Sahara's bhasya and remarks 
dozens of times that the bhasya is improper (ayulda) or 
deserves to be discarded, is unmeaning or absurd ( asambaddlia ) 
as on pp. 165, 302 (upeksitavija), 313 (asambaddlia), 314,662, 
710,731, 863 (asambaddlia), 950,953, 1090-91, 1615 (bahavo 
dosuh), 1714, 1980, 2004, 2193, 2204. 

Another circumstance that makes one entertain grave 
doubts about the universal validity and usefulness of the 
principles evolved by the PMS system must also be adverted to 
The greatest students of Mimamsa arrive at entirely different 
conclusions on many points. Some striking cases may be 
referred to here One of the most glaring of such cases is the 
interpretation of the short sutra of Vasistha"** (15. 5 na strl 
putram dadyat pratigrhnlyad v5 anyatrarmjfisdbhartuh ) «a 
woman should not give or take a son in adoption except with 
dtr? t0fhe ? hUBbantl ' This has been interpreted in four 
Potro X> W ° TkB ^ *^™^ a Hindu widows 
widowed ? a E °?- Tb6 D ^akamtmamsa holdsthatno 
widow can adopt a son, because, the husband being already dead 
no assent of his can be had at the time of adoption. yS^lti, 



1336 History of Dharmaiastra I Sec. VII, Oh. XXX 

a Maithila writer, was of the same opinion on the further ground 
that, aa Vasistha lays down that one about to take a son in 
adoption should, after having performed a homo, in tho middle 
of his house with the vyahrtis, take ( in adoption) only him who 
is closely related and who is a kinsman and not remote ( in 
habitation &c. ) and, as women cannot .perform a homa with 
Vedic mantras, all women inoluding widows have no power to 
adopt. But in Bengal, it was held that the husband's assent 
need not be given at the time of adoption and that it may bo 
given long before the actual adoption. In Madras it was held 
that the word husband in ' exoept with the assent of the husband' 
is only illustrative and that therefore the assent of the agnates of 
the father-in-law ( husband's father ) or of tho husband's agnates 
would be enough to enable a widow to adopt. The Vyavaharama- 
yukha, 2207 the NirnayaBindhu and the Samskara-kaustubha hold 
that the asBent of the husband is required for a woman whose 
husband 'is living and that a widow can adopt provided she has 
not been forbidden to adopt by her husband. For a detailed pre- 
sentation of these four views and the case law, vide H. of Dh. 
vol. IIL pp. 668-674. The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act 
( No. 78 of 1956 ) has made far-reaching and radical ohanges in 
the Law of Hindu adoptions and section 4 of that Aot overrules 
all texts, rules or interpretations of Hindu Law or oustoms and 
usages as part of that law, except in so far as they may have 
been expressly saved by tbat Act. 

The Mitaksaxa and the Dayabhaga, both steeped in 
Mlmamsa lore, differ on numerous points, some of which are :— 
(1) The Mit. holds that property or ownership arises by birth, 
the Dayabhaga denies it and says it is on the death of the previ- 
ous owner or by partition, (2 ) superior right to inherit depends 
on religious efficacy according to the Dayabhaga, while nearness 
of blood relation ib the determining factor according to the Mit.; 
(3) Members of a joint family hold family property in quasi- 
severalty and can dispose of their shares even before partition 
according to the Dayabhaga; the Mit. does not say so; (4) aoo. 
to Dayabhaga even in a joint family a widow sucoeeds to her 
husband's share on his death without male issue, while the Mit. 
does not accept this view. _ _

One may note the great cleavage of opinion (above p. 1230) 
on such texts as Yaj I SL (whether there is a vidhi or a niyama 
OTpaiisankhya), in note 2111 (p 1291) between the V M and 
Eaghunandana both great Mimamsakas ; in note 2113 p 1292 
on the interpretation of the word ' matr ' by Apararka and the 
Dayabhaga; on pp 1302-3, notes 2133-34 above on Brhaspati's 
verse on re-umted coparceners. 

In passing it may be stated that to call the Act ' Hindu 
Adoptions Act ' is a travesty and misnomer. It should have 
simply been called the Law of Adoptions in India and should 
have retained the ancient Hindu rules for Hindus as developed by 
the courts and should have been of a permissive character for all 
Indians like the English Statute ( of 1926 ) on the adoption of 
children. The general Hindu law of adoption as developed in the 
authoritative smrtis and commentaries and the case law did not 
contemplate the adoption of a daughter ( except when she was 
made in ancient times a putrtka) and to allow the adoption of a 
daughter when a son was living throws to the winds the basic 
pnniciple of the Hindu Law that a sonless man should adopt a 
male as a son for the sake of the presentation of pindas and water 
(to the Manes) and for continuance of the family name 
( sections 7 and 11 of the Act). The Act allows a woman ( even 
if not mamed ) to adopt to herself a son or daughter or both and 
under it a woman, if married, can adopt a daughter even if she 
lias a son but a married woman cannot adopt a daughter if she 
has already a daughter or a son's daughter living at the time of 
adoption (sections 8 and 11) The Act does not recognize 
dvyamusyayana adoptions which were recognized by Sanskrit 

SSL??. ^f^ers (most of the latter hardly know what 
Hindu Law was and has been) were carried away by enthu- 
siasm for equality of rights for both men and women As

extent a socialistic pattern would bare been advanced. There is 
no evidence to show that women were keen on the right to adopt 
a son or daughter even when they were unmarried. The first 
principle of introducing reforms in the existing law is that only 
strictly necessary ohanges should be put forward. Reformers 
and legislators should take to heart the advice of Mr. Aldous 
Huxley (in ' Ends and Means,' p. 30) that change as such is more 
or less distressing to most human beings, that man's conser- 
vatism is a fact in any historical situation and that social refor- 
mers should abstain from making unnecessary changes or 
ohanges that are of startling magnitude. Legislators should 
not forget that when they introduce far-reaching ohanges to 
lessen hardships, real or supposed, deemed to be caused by exist- 
ing social conditions, they very often create new problems for 
the immediate future. To take a simple example, under the old 
Hindu Law all girls were to be married before puberty, though 
Manu (IX. 90 ) provided that a girl should wait for three years 
thereafter during which, her parents or relatives might seleot a 
bridegroom for her, but that if they failed to do so she may 
herself choose her partner. ThiB was not a bad provision. 
People however went in for ohild marriages for girls and the 
problem of spinsters never arose. Then over thirty years ago 
came the Child Marriage Restraint Act ( XIX of 1929 ) whereby 
the legally allowed marriageable age for girls was fixed at 14. 
By subsequent amendments and by the Hindu Marriage Act 
( 25 of 1955 ) the lowest marriageable age for girls is now fixed 
at 15. This Act of 1929 originally went a long way in raising 
the minimum age for the marriage of girls. Then, after the 
second world war, owing to eoonomic stringency, and other 
factors, the tendency of marrying at a late age increased and 
now the problem of spinsters among Hindus has emerged and 
great difficulties about the marriages of grown-up women in 
middle class families are being experienced. 



Appendix to Section VII Chap. XXX. 

It wonld be helpful to the students of Pnrvamlmamsa and of Dharma- 
SKtra, if some of the important and frequently cited maxims (nyayas ) 
of the former, are brought together in one place with references from the 
P M. S , Sahara, Rumania, Parthasarathi, the MahSbhasya ofPatanjali, 
Santaracarya's bhisya on the Vedanta-sutras, the Bhamatt on the Sahfeara- 
bhjisya and a few others. Rumania, particularly, is very fond of employing 
Nyayas in the Tantravartika e g, on p. 415 (on Jai. II. 1.8) he employs 
five different nyayas. Many of these nyayas have been explained in the 
several volumes of the History of Dharmasattra to which references will be 
furnished at the appropriate places. Several of the nyayas here mentioned 
occur in the LaukiLa-nyayafijah ( in three parts) published by the indefati- 
gable scholar. Col. Jacob. In some cases his explanations are not accurate 
or satisfactory, but one must not forget that be wrote about half a century

and PavamSna offerings and it is stated that one of these is subordinate 
to tbe other Both snbscrve the same purpose, viz. being employed in 
Darsapurnamnsa and other sacriBces. A. Vedic text stales that vessels 
made of Varana and Vaikankata wood are fit for sacrifices, but a vessel 
of Varana wood is not to be used for homa while one of Vaikankata may 
be used. Both classes of vessels are subsidiary to sacrifices, but tbe 
text about not using Varana vessel in homa is of a general character. 
Therefore, one of the two clauses is not subordinate to the other, 
Hence Vatkankata vessels are to be uBcd in yagas in which homa is 
requisite, but Varana vessels are not to be used in such yagas.

SECTION VIII 

Relation of Sankhya, Yoga and Tarka to Dharmasastra 

CHAPTER XXXI 

Dharmasastra and Sankhya. 

Sankhya is one of the well-known six darianas ( philoso- 
phical points of view) , 

Sankaracarya in his bhasya 3303 on V". S. II 2. 17 says that 
Manu and others who were deeply versed in the Veda took up 
to some extent in their works the doctrine of piadhana being the 
cause of the world with the idea of relying on that part of its 
doctrine viz. the effeot is {already) existent in the cause. 
Similarly, on V. S. I. 4. 28 he says that great effort was made by 
the Sutrakara and himself for refuting the doctrines of the 
Sankhya system ( and not for the refutation of the theory of 
atoms being the cause of the world), since the Sankhya system 
is near to the VedSnta as it accepts the view of the non-differ- 
ence of cause and effect and as some DharmasQtra writers like 
Devala have had resort to it in their works. On V. S. H, 1. 3 
Sankaracarya remarks that, though there are many smrfciB 
dealing with metaphysical topics, great effort was made for the 
refutation of Sankhya and Yoga only, since the two systems are 
well-known in the world as means of securing the highest goal 
of man, as they have been accepted by hstas (respectable and 
learned people) and are supported by Vedic indications in then- 
favour ( as in Svetasvatara Up. ' tat-karanam sSnkhyayogabhi- 
pannam ' VI. 13 ). It would be shown later on that Manu and 
Devala rely on and propound (some) Sankhya doctrines.

Origin and development of Sankhya 1353 

It would not be irrelevant to say a few words about the 
origin and development of the Sankhya system. This (rise of 
Sankhya) is one of the most difficult problems in Indian philo- 
sophy. A good many works and papers have been written on 
the Sankhya system. 211 " As to what the original Sankhya 
teaching revised in the Sankhyakarika of Isvarakrsna was, no 
generally accepted answer can be given. Jfrom the 5tb century 
A. D at least the SankhyakaTika of Isvarakrsna has been re- 
garded as the foremost exponent of the Sankhya. The Sankhya- 
karika and a commentary on it were translated into Chinese 
about 546 A D by Paramarfcha, originally a brahmana of 
Bharadvaja gotra and a sramana from Ujjayin! ( vide BEFEO, 
1904, p 60 ). Sankaracarya on V. S I. 4. 11 quotes the whole of 
the 3rd verse of the Sankhyakarika and the first quarter of it on 
V. S. I 4. 8. But the Sankhya system, it appears, went through 
saveral phases. Chinese sources say that there were eighteen 
Sankbya schools (p 3 of Johnston's " Early Sankhya," quoting 
Takakusu in BEFEO, 1904, p. 58 ). 

There is the Sankhyasutra or Sankhyapravacanasutra 
attributed to Kapila (published with two commentaries viz that 
of Aniruddha and parts of the TVca of Vedantin Mahadeva edited 
by Garbe in B I. Series 1S81). This is a late work composed 
about 1400 A. D as shown by Garbe m his Introduction and by

Fitz-Edward Hall in hia learned Introduction to the edition of 
the Sankhyapravaoana-bhasya (B.I. Series, 1856). There is 
an edition of 23 sutras called Tattvasamfisa with a commentary 
called Kramadlpika in the Ohowkhamba Sanskrit series which 
has also published several other brief late works that are passed 
over here. Several commentaries on the Sankhyakarika havo 
been published. The earliest appears to be the one translated 
into Chinese by Paramartha about 546 A. D. , which has boon 
reconstructed into Sanskrit from the Chinese by the learned 
Pandit Aiyaswami Sastri and published { in 1944 ) in the Sri. 
Venkatesvara Oriental Series with a valuable Introduction; 
another commentary styled Matharavrtti was published (in 1922) 
in the Ohowkhamba Sanskrit Series. Dr. Belvalkar ( in ABOBI 
vol. V. pp. 133-161 ) contributed a long and scholarly paper on 
the Matbaravrtti in which he holds that the Matharavrtti is the 
original of the commentary translated into Chinese by 
Paramartha together with some accretions made from time to 
time, that Gaudapada's commentary is a simplified abridgment 
of the Matharavrtti (p. 148), that the Matbaravrtti cannot bo 
placed later than 450 A D. (p. 155 ) and that Isvarakrsna cannot 
be assigned to a date later than 250 AD (p. 168). Prof A B. 
Keith in ' Sankhya system ' (p. 51 ) places isvarakrsna at a date 
not later than 325 A. D. Another early commentary is tlio 
Yuktidlpika of an unnamed author edited from a single ms. by 
Shri Pulinabehari Chakravarti in Calcutta Sanskrit Serioa 
(1938). This is a very valuable commentary and has boon 
very competently edited even from a single ms, though there are 
a few gaps here and there. That commentary is replete with 
quotations and polemical discussions, mentions several Sankhya 
teachers who differed among themselves and whose opinions aro 
cited on many topics. For example, vide under Vindhyavflain 
below. It mentions some acaryas that aro hardly ever montionod 
in any Sankhya work. It frequently oites an author oallod 
Paficadhikarana (vide pp. 6, 108, 114, 132, 144, 147, 148 whoro 
two S-ryas apparently of Paficadhikarana are quoted). Another 
hitherto unknown Sankbyaoarya mentioned by this com. is 
Paurika on p. 169 and p. 175, who holds the surprising view 8310 
that there is a separate piaOhuna for each Purusa, Patafijali jb 
frequently mentioned on pp. 32 (who denied tho existence of

meaning ' the son of Vrsagana '); all these refer to the views of 
Yarsaganas Paficasikha (p. 31 in the plural, p. 61, p. 175 ) 
is mentioned and one passage which is quoted in the Yyasa- 
bhasya (on Y. S. 1 4 ) and ascribed to Paficasikha by Vacaspati 
is quoted by the Yuktidipika on p. 41 as Sastra, From pp. 113 
and 129 it appears that the author of the com. was a Vedantin. im 
It is probable that he flourished between 500 and 700 A. D. , 
since he quotes ( on p 39) Dinnaga's definition of 'pratyaksa' 
and is not cited by Vacaspati and other commentators on the 
Sankhya 

Gaudapada composed a commentary on the S. Karika but 
only on 69 verses published in the Oh. S. Series. The Commentary 
called Sanfchyatattvakaumudi by the f amouB writer Vacaspati- 
misra was published in the Chowkhamba S. S in 1919. A com- 
mentary called Jayamangala ascribed to Sankaracarya ( in the 
colophon ) on the S. Karika was published at Calcutta in 1933 by 
Sri H. Sarma with a brief but interesting Introduction by 
Principal Gopinatha Kaviraj (vide also I. H. Q. vol. V. pp. 417- 
431 ) where Sri H. Sarma tries to prove that the Jayamangala is

BtateB that the line of teachers and pupils from Paficasikha is : 
Paficasikha-Gargya-TJluka-V&rsagana-lsvarakrsna. It is clear 
from the ahovo that several teachers, in any case not less than 
five or six, intervened between Paficasikha and Jsvarakrsna. 
From a somewhat mutilated passage 2212 of the YuktidJpikfi 
(p, 175 ) it appears that at least ten persons intervened hotweon 
Paficasikha and Isvarakrsna. If this bo accepted and if Ilvara- 
krsna be assigned to about 250 A. D. , then Paficasikha cannot be 
placed later than the first century B. C. and may be much earlier 
still. On ' tena ca bahudbs krtam tantram' (S. Karika70) the 
YuktidlpikS speaks of bhagavat Pancasrikha as ' daaama-kumBra' 
( tenth son of Prajapati 'i) and states that he expounded the sSstra 
to many persons such as Janaka and Vasistha and thereby 
identifies Paficasikha with the toacher Paficasikha mentioned 
by the Santiparva ( vide note 2186 below ). 

Vacaspatimisra in his commentary on the Yogasutrabhasya 
(II. 23) sets out eight alternative views among S5nkbya writers 
on the question of 'darsana' and 'adarsana' and remarks that 
the fourth out of the eight alternatives is the real doctrine of 
the Ssnkhyasastra 2M3 From about the 5th century A. D. the 
Sankhyakarika has been regarded as the standard work on the 
Sankhya system. The S. Karika itself states that the holy 
sastra was expounded by Kapilamuni to Asuri, who expounded" 1 * 
it to Paficasikha and the latter expounded the (Sankhya) system 
to several disciples and that it came down to Isvarakrsna in a 
succession of teachers and disciples, who summarised it in SryS

Fundamental conceptions of Sankhya 1357 

verses. Kapila-muni is here said k> be the first promulgator of 
the Sankhya. 

Before proceeding further the most characteristic and 
fundamental conceptions of the standard Sankhya must be set 
out. The most fundamental conception is that there aTe two 
entirely distinct essences existing from eternity, viz. piakrh ( i. e. 
nature or matter) also called pradhana and avyakta, and pwiusa 
( soul ot spirit, the knowing subject ). The 2nd fundamental 
conception is that purusas are many. Another most characteri- 
stic feature of the Sankhya system is the doctrine of three 22,s 
gunas (factors) called sattia (light, intelligent), rajas (energetic, 
active, domineering), tamas (coarse, inert, enveloping, dark). 
Pradhana or prakrti or avyakta is said to be constituted by the 
three gunas (trigunatmaka) when they are in equilibrium 
( Sattvarajastamasam samyavastba ). The Sankhya analysed 
all physical and mental phenomena. The lowest factor is the 
heavy impenetrable matter and coarse foolish impulses. They 
are called tamas (described as gum. heavy and zaranaka, 
enveloping ). Then there is the factor of constant change in the 
physical world aa well as in the mental. This is called rajas 
(cala, changing and upastambhaka, exciting, as the S. Karika 
puts it). The third factor or element in the world is the varied 
operation of consciousness that leads to knowledge and experi- 
ence which is called Sattia {laghu, light as opposed to the coarse 
merely material objects and prakasaka, luminous, as contrasted 
with tamas). These three factors or elements combine in 
various proportions and make up the evolving universe. The

is not different from the gunas, but it is only the name of the 
primordial matter before evolution starts. Prakrti being anadi 
and eternal, the Sankhya system did not postulate God as 
creator, and held God to be a superfluity. The Sankhya propounds 
a theory of cosmic evolution which is practically as reasonable 
as any modern theory of evolution. It is probably the earliest 
attempt to furnish an answer from reason alone to the questions 
about the origin of the world, about the nature of man and his 
relation to the physical world and man's future destiny. In the 
nineteenth century mind and matter were held to be entirely dif- 
erent and atoms were supposed to be indivisible. Modern physios 
has reduced matter to energy but the nature of this last also is a 
mystery. Under the Sankhya system, purusa or prakj-ti or both 
serve no religious purpose. There is no definite or convincing 
answer as to why purusa becomes entangled in the web of prakrti. 
The Sankhya simply says that as a result of non-discrimination 
purusa somehow becomes entangled. The Vedantasutra refers 
to pi adhana as smSrta in I. 2. 19 and as ' anumanika ' in I. 4. 1. 
From Prakrti evolves mahan ( i. e. buddhi, consciousness ) from 
which arises ahafihai a, from which evolve on the one hand the 
five tanmatras (subtle elements, viz. sabda, sparsa, gandha, rasa, 
rupa) and on the other hand matias (mind) and the ten indnyas 
( sense organs ). From the five subtle elements are evolved the 
five great elements, earth, water, tejas,' vayu and akasa ( ether). 
These are twentyfour 2216 tatluas (categories) and purusa is 25th. 
Pr adhana is distinct from purusa and serves the purpose of 
purusa (who is passive and a saksi)who is distinct from the 
evolutes of prakrti and is bhoktr ( and not kartr). The Sankhya aa 
does not admit God Prakrti and purusa come together in order 
that the latter may see its working; just as a blind man and a crip- 
ple (a lame man) may come together (and the blind man may carry 
the lame man on his shoulder, the latter showing the way and 
both may reach their destination by this joint effor t) MM When

conceptions of Sankliya 1359 

purusa realizes the difference between himself 27Aa and the gunas 
constituting Prakrti he is liberated. Both Sankhya and Toga 
treat the external worid a3 real. They both postulate plurality 
of souls ( purusas ), that axe eternal and unchanging. This latter 
is one of the most crucial differences between Sankhya and 
advaita Vedanta. It is not necessary for our purpose in this 
chapter to go into greater details One more doctrine of the 
Sankhya is called satkaryaoada i. e. the theory that the effect 
already exists in the cause and does not arise from nothing 
( S. Karika, verse 9 ) ; compare Chan. Up. "VX 2. 2 ( kathamasatah 
saftayeta ) and Gita H. 16 ( nSsato vidyate bhavo ). 

It is difficult to assign a definite date to the Sankhya- 
karika As PaTamartha translated the K§rika as well as com- 
mentary on it into Chinese in about 546 A. D. the Karika 
cannot in any case be placed later than about 250-300 A D. 
It may be earlier by a few centuries. Umbeka in his commen- 
tary on the Slokavartika of Kumarila mentions an author called 
Madhava as ' Sankhyanayaka ' and Yuan Chwang also refers 
to a Sankhya teacher called Madhava, Dr. Raghavan in 
' Sarupa-Bharatr (pp 162-164) shows that Madhava was really 
a destructive critic of Sankhya, that the proper reading is 
•Sankhyanaiaka.Madhava , and that he was probably earlier than 
even Dinnaga and DhaTmarklrti ( i. e. earlier than 500 A. D.). 

Sankaracarya in the passage quoted in n. 2208 remarks that 
certain Upanisad passages may be relied upon as apparently 
supporting the Sankhya system. Some of the Upanisad passages 
that either foreshadow Sankhya doctrines or employ words that 
have technical meanings, in the Sankhya system would be

cited. K2 ° But ons passage from the Atharvaveda X. 8. 43 
deserves notice, viz. ' the knowers of Brahma know that ijaksa 
endowed with atman which abides in the lotus with nine gates 
( the physical body ) covered by three gunas,' With this may be 
compared Sv. Up. III. 18 and Glta, V. 13 ( navadvare pure dehl ). 
The Mundaka Up. states ' From Him are born prana, mind, all 
indriyas, the five elements, and sky, wind, jyotis ( tejaa ), 
waters and the earth.' The Katha Up refers to indriyas, the 
objects of senses, mind, buddhi, mahan, avyakta, purusa as a 
rising series, similar to that of the Sankhya with one exception 
viz the Up. does not mention ahankura and holds that buddhi 
and mahan are different, while the official Sankhya identifies 
them. It is, therefore, clear that the evolution in these two 
Upanisads is very similar to the theory of evolution stated by 
the classical Sankhya, the only difference being that the Upa- 
nisads postulate a supreme Creator ( that produces the cosmos ) 
while Sankhya drops the creator and accepts the evolu- 
tionary series only. On V. S I. 2. 12 Sankaracarya oiteB 
the verse ' dva suparna sayuja ' ( which is Mundaka Up. 
1U 1. 1, Sv Up III. 1 and also Ifrg. I. 164. 20) and 
explains it, as referring to the individual self (jlva) and the 
Highest Spirit (paramatman) The acarya then mentions the 
argument of a predecessor who relies upon Paingirahasya- 
brShmana where the latter half of the verse is explained as 
mentioning sattva (buddhi) and ksetiajna (i.e. the individual 
self). This indicates that some took that verse as putting 
forward Sankhya ideas. The Katha Up III, 4 states that the 
description of the individual soul as the enjoyer ( bhoktr ) results

Similarities between Upamsad-i and Sankhya 1361 

from the union of the atman with OTgans of sense and the mind. 
The Svetisvataropanisad expressly 2m iefeis to Sankhya and 
Yoga (in VI. 13) and says that ' on realizing that cause which 
can he apprehended hy means of the study of Sankhya and Yoga 
he is released from all bonds'. That Upanisad is full of words 
that are frequently employed in the Sankhya system such as 
' avyakta' (18), guna(V. 7 *sa visvarupas-trigunah * and VI. 
2, 4 and 16), jna(v. 2,VI 17), prakrti ('mayam tu prakrtim 
vidyat' IV. 10), purusa (I 2, HI. 12, 13, IV. 7 ), pradhana (1. 10, 
VL10 and 16). linga (I 13, VI. 9). The St. Up. (VI. 11) 
describes the one God as ' saksl ceta kevalo nirgunas-ca '. The 
Sankhya denies God and transfers these epithets to the Purusa, 
who in his true essence is, according to the Sankhya, merely a 
passive \vitness, pure intelligence, unaffected by gunas. The 
Prasna Up. (IV 8) speaks of the five elements and their matras 
(prthivl ca prthivlmatra ca &o), the ten indnyas and their 
objects, manas, huddhi, ahankara &a The Sankhyas rely on the 
verse ' ajamekam ' (Sv. Up. IV. 5 ) 3222 for Upanisadic support to 
their theory about prakrti and its three gunas (vide bhasya of

Sankara on V. S, 1. 4. 8 ). That verse means : there is one unborn 
(female), constituted by red, white and black, but producing 
manifold progeny resembling each other, there is one unborn 
being (a male) who resorts to her ( loves her ) and lies by her; 
there is another, who leaves her after having experienced 
enjoyment. Similarly, Sankhyas argue that Kapila, the 
founder of the Sankhya system, is mentioned in the Sv. Up. 
(V. 2) 'it is he who, in the beginning, bears (nourishes) by 
thoughts Kapila sage when born and looks on while he is being 
born.* If one looks to various passages of the Sv. Up. such as 
in. 4, IV 12, VI. 18 one must hold that rsi Kapila," 23 the reddish 
Bage, is Hiranyagarbha (the golden child), the first creation 
( Hiranyagarhhahsamavartatagre,' Eg X. 121.1). Sankaracarya 
(on V. S. II. 1.1 ) replies that from the mere occurrence of the 
word ' Kapila * one cannot at once jump to the conclusion that 
he must be the founder of the Sankhya, since another Kapila, 
called Vasudeva, who reduced to ashes the sons of Sagara by his 
angry look, is well-known. 2224 Sankaracarya concedes on V S. 
II 1. 3 that both Sankhya and Yoga are within the pale of Vedio 
orthodoxy as regards those portions of them that are not in 
conflict with the Veda. The five elements (mahabhutani) are 
mentioned in the Ait. Up. (III. 3), Frasna VI. 4 and the five 
speoial qualities of these five in Katha Up. (HI. 15). 

In view of the fact that the word "Sankhya 'occurs in the 
Sv. Up. and that the Katha and Mundaka have some dootrines 
similar to the Sankhya system and the Svetasvatara employs 
many words that occur frequently in the works on Sankhya, 
the question arises — what is the relation of the Sankhya to 
the Upanisads. There are three possible views, ( 1 ) that Upa- 
nisad thought and Sankhya made parallel progress, (2) that 
Sankhya adopted and expanded some of the germinal ideas

Srithatcanbeasdgned to a period even a few centuries 
earlier than the Christian era and when no one can place the 
principal Upanisads (about twelve, including the Svetasvatara) 
later than 300 B C , since even the Sv. Up. is referred to as 
'Sruti* in V. S I. 4 8, II. 3 22 Garba (in 'Die Saiikhya 
Philosophie* pp 3 ff ) denies that Sankhya underwent any essen- 
tial modifications in its long history. Jacobi does not agree, 
holding that SSnkhya originated out of a common cultural and 
philosophical heritage andOldenberg sees the origin of Saiikhya 
in the Katha and Sv Up. and holds that epic Sankhya is an 
independent development ( ' Die Lehre der Upanishaden und die 
A.nfange des Buddhismus *, 1915, pp. 206 ff) Sankhya and 
Yoga were known to Kautilya ( Sankhyam Togo Lokayatam 
cetyanviksikl' Aithasastra I 2.p 6.). Therefore, we may say 
that Sankhya as a philosophical school started at least before the 
4th century B C. 

We should now turn to Sanskrit works other than the 
Upanisads for seeing the origins of the SSnkhya system. First 
comes the Mahabharata. 

In many passagos of the Ssntiparva ■ 22S references to some 
of the doctrines, technical words and persons connected with the 
mature Sankhya system occur. The references are so many that 
the ptesent writer will have to select only a few passages by way 
of sample In chap 203 there is a dialogue between a clever 
pupil and his guru It begins by stating { in verse 8 ) that

creates endless things, but does not become reduced ( in size 1 
thereby ; buddhi springs from the activity of avyakta (i.e. prakrti) 
and ahankara is produced (from buddhi) and from ahankara ia 
evolved akasa from which vaiju arises and then tejas, water and 
the earth arise each from its predecessor ; these eight are the 
mulaprakrtis 2226 and the whole world is centred in them (verses 
24-26). Then the chap, mentions five organs of knowledge 
(ear, skin, eye, tongue, sense of smell) and five senses of aotivity 
(hands &c) and then there are the five objects of sense (viz. 
sabda, sparsa &c ) and the mind is all-pervading and the 16th 
(verses 27-31). Then the chapter speaks of purusa ( the soul ) 
that resides in the city with nine i127 gates and is undecaying 
and immortal, which shines in all beings just as a lamp, whether 
big or small, does. In chapter 204 the same dialogue is pursued 
and the first verse says all bhutas Bpring from avyakta and are 
merged (die) in avyakta, it refers to ksetra (the body) and 
Jcseti ajiia ( in verse 14 ) and winds up by saying that, just aa 
seeds burnt by fire do not grow, the soul is not again connected 
with klesas 1328 when they are burnt by the fire of (correct) 
knowledge In chap. 205, verses 22-23 speak of the characteri- 
stics of the three gunas ; chap. 206 says that when a person 
brings under control anger, avarice, 23Z9 fear, pride and becomes 
pure he merges into the highest self that is Visnu in avyalda 
form and chap 207 deals with the measures for reaching the 
highest goal and puts forward brahmacarya (sexual purity) as

le first measure. In these chapters, though some doctrines 
aouliar to the standard Sankhya of the Karika appear, they are 
.11 brought in line with the Vedanta of one supreme Being, 
rhich is negatived in the official Sankhya. 

That there were philosophers, who adopted some of the 

Sankhya and Yoga doctrines, postulated Paramesvara (Supreme 

DBity) and held that the three, viz Pradhana, Purusa and Isvara 

were different from eaoh other, is expressly stated by Sankara- 

carya* 30 in his bhasya on V. S IT. 2 37. Therefore, the fcEaha- 

bharata references to Sankhya probably relate to philosophical 

doctrines in which all three viz Prakrti, Purusas and Supreme 

Self were recognized, from which arose the later official Sankhya 

that discarded any supreme Ruler of the Universe. In the 

Narayaniya section of the Santiparva (quoted in note 1544 

p. 954 above) 'Sankhya, Yoga, Paflcaratra, Vedas and Pasupata 

are said to he knowledges ( jnanani ) and ' nanamatSni ' ( different 

points of view ) and Kapila, a paramarsi, is said to be propounder 

of Sankhya. Chapter 294 (inverses 26-49) deals with the 

twenty-five tattvas of the Sankhya from Prakrti or Ayyakta, 

mabat, ahankara, the five elements from ahankara ( these eight 

being called prakrtis ) and then 16 vikaras ( verse 29 ). These are 

called hselra, the soul is the 25th (v 35) and is called ksefcrajiia 

and Purusa ( v 37 'avyaktake pure sete purusas-ceti kathyate \ 

and Isvara or brahma is not brought in anywhere in that 

chapter 

Chapters 211-212 (containing in all 100 verses) of Santi- 
parva deal with what Janaka, called Janadeva, 3231 king of 
Mithila, learnt from Paficasikha, when the latter, after wandering 
over the whole eaTth, visited Mithila and who is described as the 
first (or foremost) pupil of Asuri and who is said to have 
performed a sattra for a thousand years on Parieasrotas 2232

( veise 10 ). He was the son of a bTahmana woman called Kapila 
and was therefore known as Kapileya (verses 13-15). Janaka 
had a hundred acaryas in his palace who propounded the 
different views of different sects. Verse 9 says that Pancasikha 
made people wonder when he appeared like Kapila, the great 
sage (paramarsi ) and Prajapati, that he confounded the hundred 
acaryas by his arguments ( v. 17 ). Later Janaka abandoned 
those acaryas and followed Pancasikha ( verse 18 ) He, after 
creating disgust in Janaka about his caste or about rites and 
about everything, expounded to Janaka the highest moksa which 
is declared as Sankhya. In chap. 213 Pancasikha expounds 
five elements, five jnanendriyas, five karmendriyas, mind (verses 
7-22) and the signs (hngas) of sattvika, rajasa and tamasa 
bhavas (verses 25-28) and describes how a person who seeks the 
Self is freed from the fetters of pleasure and pain and being 
beyond the fear of old age and death reaches immortality. In 
the first place, these two chapters are not sometimes very clear, 
offer no consistent clear-cut system and employ words that are 
difficult to construe and are not completely identical with the 
scheme of the 25 tattvas of the official Sankhya of the Karika, 
since chap, 2J1 verse 13 speaks of ' ekaksara brahma assuming 
many forms'. For example, it is difficult to say what is meant 
by 'purusavastham-avyaktam'. The meaning that can be 
drawn out of the words seems to be 'he (Pancasikha) conveyed 
knowledge (to Janaka) about Avyakta (i.e. Pradhana) that 
depends upon Purusa ( i. e that becomes active through union of 
Purusa with it ), which is the highest truth. It further says that 
Pancasikha became perfect (in knowledge) by the performance of 
istts and sattras, again by abounding tapas, had a vision of tlio 
deity ( Grod ) and he realized the distinction between ksetra and 
ksetrajna and also realized bi ahma symbolized 2233 by om. There-

Paficaiikha's doctrines and Sankhya 1367 

fore the doctrine of Pancasikha in these chapters of Santiparva 

is really adimta (monism) on which are grafted some doctrines 

similar to the later official Sankhya for explaining creation and 

so forth. 2231 In Santiparva 306. 56-66 ( = Ohitra ed. 318 58-63 } 

Visvavasu tells Yajfiavalkya that he has heard ahout the 35th 

tattva (i. e. Purusa) from Jaiglsavya, Asita-Devala, Varsaganya 

( of ParasaTa gotra ), Bhrgii Pancasikha, Kapila, Suka, Gotama 

Arstisena, Garga, Narada, Asuri, Pulastya, Sanatkumara, 

Sukra and Kasyapa ( father of Visvavasu ) and 336. 65 ( Chitra. 

ed 318. 67 ) states that Yajfiavalkya had mastered completely 

bothSankhja and Yoga. Santiparva 304 4 (=316.4 of Citra. 

ed. ) states that Sankhya and Yoga are one a3s 

Pancasikha figures frequently in the MahabhaTata. In 
Santiparva, chap. 307 ( containing only 14 verses ) Yudhisthira 
asks Bhlsma how one can rise superior to old age and death, 



( Continued from last jiagc ) 
but from the passages in the Ahirbudbnya-samhita, chap XII. 18-29 it 
follows that the doctrines ot Kapila' s SIhkbya — tantra were divided into 
two mandalas called Prilrta and Vaitrta and the two bad 32 and 28 topics 
respectively. ' yk^^tui Vlgi^ 5«r: tnlQcild?).! fiTtiiil -m^W ^f iH4y SS 

The com. Arjunamisra appears to take it as ' the great doctrine of Kapila 
came to him (Pancasikha) in the form of an aura of light and expounded to 
him the highest truth" etc This is extremely far-fetched. There is a doubt 
about the agent of ' nyabadhayat and as to whom ■ samasmam ' refers. To 
me it appears that the meaning is that "ParcasiLha came to him (i e to 
Janata) ana imparted to him the great Kapila mandala, the highest troth, 
the avyalta etc ' According lo the usual Sanskrit construction the agent of 
•agamja' and 'nyabodbayat' must be the same (i e Pancasikha). ^prrafcf

whether by very great tapas 2J3fi or by rites or by Vedio learning 
or by the use of ratayanas ( elixirs of life or alchemist's proscrip- 
tions ). Bhlsma speaks of an ancient dialogue between Janaka 
and Bhiksu Pancasikha, where the same question was put by 
Janaka and Pancasikha replied that none can escape theBO two 
and that union with wife arid relatives is like meeting persons 
when on a journey ( i. e. the company of those is not durable or 
permanent ), nobody has seen heaven or hell, that one's duty is 
not to violate tho ordinances of Vedas, and to make gifts and to 
offer sacrifices. In this chapter there is hardly anything which 
approaches the special doctrines of the Sankhya, though 
Paficasikha's views are here set forth Chap. 308 ( 191 verses 
out of which less than 30 have anything to do with Paficasikha's 
teachings directly) begins with the question of Yudhisthira 'who 
secured mokea without giving up the stage of householder.' 
Then Bhlsma. narrates to him the dialogue between Janaka 
called Dharmadhvaja 2237 and SulabhS, a nun Janaka was 
learned in the Veda, in moksasastra and in his own sastra 
( rSjadharma ), he had controlled his senses and ruled the earth. 
She heard from ascetics about Janaka's righteous conduct and 
she desired to find out the truth. She gave up her form as 
a nun by her yogic powers and became a woman, a paragon 
of beauty, and met Janaka. The latter informed her that 
he was the pupil of old bhiksu 2238 Pancasikha of tho 
Parasarya gotra who stayed with him during the four months 
of the rainy season and who expounded to him the threefold 
moksa ( viz. Sankhya, Yoga and the science of government ) 
and yet who did not ask him to give up rulership. Janaka said

Dialogue between Janaka and Sulabha 13(19 

" J, giving up all attachment, though occupying the highest 
position ( as ruler ), follow the three paths of mohsa , the highest 
rule of this moksa is ' freedom from attachment, the absence of 
attachment is due to correct knowledge whereby one is freed 
from bondage ( of samsara ) ". Janaka further avows that 2239 on 
account of the knowledge imparted to him by the bhiksu who 
is called after his top-knot, he is free from all attachment, 
though looking after the kingdom and that he is different from 
other sannyasins. Then Janaka gives in verses (308.38-41) 
another meaning 2210 of the threefold Moksa propounded by 
PaBcasikha to him viz. (1 ) highest knowledge and renunciation 
of actions, ( 2) strict adherence to the patha of karma ( duties 
prescribed by Sastra) and ( 3 ) combination of knowledge and 
actions, and it is said that those who follow this third path 
resemble householders in several respects. Janaka asserts his 
view | wearing ochre-coloured 2241 garments, shaving the head, 
carrying a water-vessel placed on three staves-these are merely 
outward^ signs and do not lead to moksa and that moksa does not 
consist in non-possession of wealth and bondage does not follow 
possession of some wealth, but it is jfiana by which a person 
secures deliverance, whether there is possession or non-possession 
of wealth*. It appears from verse 40 that Paficasikha emphasized 
the third kind of MoksanisthS, (JBanakaTmasamuccaya) and 
Janaka followed that teaching. The rest of the chapter ( 308 ) is 
concerned with Janaka's charges against Sulabha and Sulabha's 
scathing remarks against Jan aka. 22 " She says at the end 'you

have indeed heard from Faficasikha the whole (doctrine) about 
moksa together with the means (for attaining it), with the 
Upamsad passages expounding it or with the auxiliaries (of 
meditation ) and with definite conclusions.' 

_ This passage expressly refers to Upanisads in connection 
with moksa and the preceding verses emphasize the freedom 
from attachment on the part of Janaka (in 308. 37 'mukta- 
sanga ' ). The Br. Up in in. 1 refers to the sacrifice performed 
by Janaka, king of Videha, who set apart a thousand cows to he 
given to him from among the brahmanas assembled at it, that 
would be the most profound in learning and be brdlimistiia 
(most learned in or devoted to brahma). Ysjfiavalkya asked 
his disciple to take the cows away ; thereupon followed a learned 
disquisition by questions (of angry brahmanas including a 
woman ) and answers by Y ajfiavalkya; »« the questioners were 
Asvala (the holy priest of Janaka), Jaratkarava SitabhSga, 
Bhujyu Lahyayani, Usasta Cakrayana, Kahola ESusttakeya, 
GargI Vaoaknavl, Uddalaka, Sruni, Vidagdha Sakalya (HI. 1-9 
ending with ' vijnanam-anandam brahma) '. In Br. Up. IV. 2 
it is said that Janaka Vaideha approached Ysjnavalkya, did 
obeisance to him and said ' instruct me ' and that then the sage 
spoke to him *you have studied the Veda and the Upanisads have 
been expounded to you by Scaryas, but, when you will he leaving 
this body, where will yo go'? Janaka replied that he did not 
know it and requested the sage to enlighten him on that point. 
Then a long disquition follows ( Br. Up. 1Y. % S) in which occurs 
the famous passage ('sa esa neti netyatma, agrhyo na hi 

grhyate asango na hi sajjate abhayam vai Janaka 

praptosi ' ( IY. 2. 4 ). It appears to the present writer that some 
one desirous of boosting Sankhya teachings inserted the chapters 
about Sankhya in which Paficasikha is substituted in place of 
Yajnavalkya as the teacher of Janaka. 

It would be seen from the brief synopsis of the chapters 
811-12, 307 and 308 that the views described in all of them are 
not the same as those of the official or standard Sankhya, 
that Panoasikha's views as presented in chapters 211-212 seem 
ts be different from those in chap. 308, particularly when chap. 
308 emphasizes that jfiana-karma-samuccaya was the view of

Santiparva passages on Pailcahkha examined 1371 

Pafioasikha, while the official Sankhya holds that jnana alone 
leads to liberation. It should he noted that these chapters 
nowhere refer to a work of Pafioasikha hut show him to be a 
wandering aacetio holding certain views The present writer 
believes that the author of these passages in the Santiparva had 
no woTk before him and only knew by hearsay and tradition 
that PaScasikha was a great Sankhya teacher. Prof. Keith 
holdBthat the Paficasikha of the Santiparva is not identical 
with Paflcasikha, the author of Sastitantra (p. 48 of ' Sankhya 
System' ).»» 

There aTe other chapters in the Santiparva where the 
peculiar Sankhya doctrines and terminology are employed but 
they are brought in line with VSsudeva or Highest Self to which 
the Sankhya doctrines are made subordinate. Por example, in 
chap. 340 Narada is said to have been 2211 told by God himself 
some of the tenets of Sankhya such as the twenty-four tattvas 
and Purasa as the 25th tattva, the three gunas, that Purusa is 
ksetrajna and bhoktr, that acaryas, who have arrived at definite 
conclusions about Sankhya, call God who is in the orb of the Sun 
as Kapfla, that Hiranyagarbha, who is well praised in the Veda 
and is announced as ( author) of Yogasastra, is 'myself '. 

Not only in the Santiparva, but also in other parvans of the 
Mahabharata, Sankhya doctrines are dwelt upon. For example, 
the Ssvamedhika ( in chap. 35. 47-48 ) speaks of sattva, ra3as, 
tamas as atmagurms and mentions their equilibrium. In another 
place, the same parvan enumerates the 24 tatlvas viz. avyakta, 
mahSn, aha nkara &c and describes the three gunas. 221S

1370 Histoiy of Dharma&aslra \ Sec. VIE, Oh. XXXI 

Asuri is mentioned by the S. Karika as the pupil of Kapila, 
also in a quotation in Yogasutrabhasya on L 25 (note 2251) and 
by the Santiparva (chap. 306). But no work is attributed to 
him and hardly any quotation from him is cited by writers on 
Sankhya (except a verse quoted as his by Haribhadra a lata 
Jain writer). Kapila is a legendary figure. In Rgveda X. 27. 16 
Kapila 2246 is mentioned as one among ten ( Angirases ) whom, 
though similar to them, they (Angirases) urge on for a saorifioe. 
Vide Hall's Preface to Sankhya-pravacanabkasya ( ed. 1856 ) 
pp. 14 ff for the confused legends about Kapila. Some references 
to Kapila in the Mahabharata have already been noted. In 
Vanaparva (221.26) Kapila is styled as the promulgator of 
Sankhya-yoga, as ParamaTSi and as an incarnation of Agni. 
In the Matsyapurana 2247 it is stated that water should be offered 
to the seven sons of Brahma, viz Sanalca, Sananda, Sanatana, 
Kapila, Asuri, Vodhu and Pancasikha. The Vamana-purana 
(60.70) mentions Kapila (as knower of Sankhya), Vodhu, 
Asuri, Pancasikha ( as 'yogayukta') and states that Sanat- 
kumSra approached Brahma for yoga lore. 

In the Snanasutra of Katyayana ( kandika 3 ) attached to 
the Paraskaragrhyasutra the above seven are the only persons to 
whom tarpana is offered among rsis (vide H. of Dh. vol.11.

Kapila in Bhagavata and GUa 1373 

p 693 ) In the Bhagavatapurana ( I. 3. 10 ) Kapila is said to b B 
the 5th avatara of Vismi, is called siddlieia ( the lord of siddhas } 
and the teacher of Asuri in Sankhya that had bscome decadent 
(by lapse of time). TheGSta also (X.26 ■siddhanam Kapilo 
munih ' ) mentions Kapila as a mum and the most eminent 
among Biddhaa. The S. Karika. also refers to him as muni. The 
Kurmapurana ( H. 7. 7 ) echoes the very words of the Gita 
( ' Biddbanam Kapilo munih ' ). 

In the tamsas in Br. "Up. H. 6. 3 and VI. 5. 3-3, in which 
succession lists of teachers and pupils differing from one another 
occur, Asuri is said to be disciple of Bharadvaja in the first and 
the pupil of Tajnavalkya in the second. Bach list contains at 
least 60 teachers from Brahma downwards. In the first place, 
it is difficult to hold that these lists are authentic and there is no 
evidence to establish that the Asuri mentioned in both is the 
same as the pupil of Eapila. 

Paficasikha's is a great name in tbe Sankhya system. His 
systematic work on that system was called Sastitantra. The 
S. Karika ( 70, 72 ) refers to him as the author of the Sastitantra 
containing great details, illustrative tales and discussions of 
others* views. It was called Sastitantra because it expounded 
sixty topics and it contained Bixty thousand gathas. 22 * 5 The 
Yogasutrahhssya ( IV. 13 ) quotes a verse which is ascribed to 
Sastitantra by Vacaspati on Yogasutrabhasya TV. 13. The 
present writer cannot agree with Keith p. 69 that the reference 
to Sastitantra in S. Karika (verse 72 ) is not to a work but to a 
philosophy of sixty topics. The arya 72 had a Sanskrit commen- 
tary which was translated into Chinese in 546 A. D. in which it 
was stated that the work contained six thousand gathas, 22M but 
the BhamatI (fay Vacaspati } on V. S. IL 1. 3 ascribes it to 
Varsaganya, It may be a slip on the part of Vacaspati or it is 
possible that he regarded Paiicasikha and Varsaganya as the 
names of the same person, the first being a nickname and the 
latter a gotra name. On Yogasutra I. i, 25, 36, H 5, 6, 13, 17,

18, 20, in. 13 and 41, IV, 13 ( tafcha oa sastrSnusaflanam 'Gu'»5nam 
&o ), prose passages occur winch Vacaspati ascribes to Pafica- 
sikha. On S. Karika 2 Vacaspati quotes in his com. the view of 
Paficasikhacarya. In Y ogasutrabhasya on I. 25 a sutra is quoted 
which Vacaspati ascribes to Paficasikha in which Kapila is 
styled 'adividvan' (the first master of SSnkhya) and 
' paramarsi ' and is said to have imparted to JLsuri the Tantra, 
the Sankhya Siddhanta. 

In the dialogue between VisvSvasu Gandharva and Yajfia- 
valkya ( in Santiparva, chap. 30G ) there is a long list of sagos 
from whom Visvavasu says he learnt a great deal (invereoB 
56-60) but prays to Yajnavalkya M5 ° that the latter should 
expound to him the knowledge of Sankhya and Yoga (voraes 
65-66). Then Yajfiavalkya states that pralcrli is also called 
pradhana, that it does not know the 25th (viz. the purusa) ond 
that there is a 26th ( Highest Self ) and so on. That list contains 
the following names : Jaigi^avya, 2151 Asita, Devala, Varsagawa 
of the Parasaragotra, bliiksu, Paficasikha, Kapila, Suka, Gautama, 
Srstisena, Gargya, Narada, Asuri, Pulastya, Sanatkumara, 
6ukra, father of Kasyapa. The sages are not mentioned in 
chronological order. Five of them (that are in Italics) aro 
important bo far as Sankhya and Yoga are concerned. We Haw 
above that Paficasikha is said to be of Par&sara gotra and in tho 
above list Varsaganya also is said to be of the same gotra, 
VacaBpati on S. Karika 47 ascribes to Varsaganya the view that 
aridya has five facets or aspects. 22H The Yogasutrabhasya on 
III. 53 quotes a sutra of Varsaganya. It is shown above from

Paiicasikha and Varsgarfya 1375 

the reconstruction of the Sanskrit Com. from Chinese that 
Varsagana was one of the teachers after Paiicasikha and before 
Isvarakrsna. So it is extremely doubtful if Paficasikha and 
Varsaganya are identical. Vide JEAS for 1905 pp. 33-53 ( by 
Takakusuwho shows on p 47 that Vrsagana was a teacher 
of Yindhyavasa and that Vasubandhu wrote a work called 
Paramarthasaptati in opposition to Vindhyavasa and that 
Paramartha was in China from 546 to 569 A. D. 

In the Introduction to the Uttaradhyayana-satra ( a Jain 
woTk) Charpentier refers to two different lists one older and 
shorter which speaks of the four Vedas, Itihasas (as 5th), 
Nighanlu as the sixth and of the Vedic angas and upangas and 
then of Sastitantra. This last may be a reference to Panca- 
sikha's work or simply to the 60 topics dwelt upon in the 
SSnkhya system. 

In Santiparva (chap. 222) Tudhisthira asks Bhlsma: by 
what character, conduct, lores and by being intent on what does 
a person reach the abode of Brahma which is higher ( or beyond) 
prahHt and Bhlsma mentions the dialogue of Jaiglsavya and 
Asita Devala in which it is stated that he who is unperturbed by 
being reviled or praised, who keeps silent over his good deeds, 
does not harm even him who harms him, is always calm and 
does good to all beings, reaches the abode of Brahma. The

(bhumfoiposnalo v&yuh fcham mano buddhireva ca t ahankara 
itlyam mo bhinna prakrtir-astadha « ), VII. 13, H. 28. The Gita 
in VIL 6 and 8 emphatically states that God is the source of the 
whole world, which ultimately is merged in Him. Herein the 
Glta differs materially from the standard Sankhya. The Glta 
exproasly mentions "Sankhya-kcfcanta" J2S3 (i. e siddhanta) in 
XVEH, 13; what that means is that by that time Sankhya tenets 
bad aasumod the form of a system but there is no express 
or definite reference to a work such aB in the caso of Veda or 
Vodanta ( in XV, 15 ) or Brahmasutra ( in 2311 4). 

Vindhyavasa or Vindhyavasin ( dweller on Vindhya moon- 
tain ) is identified with Isvarakrsna by Takakusu in B. E. F. 
E. O. for 1904 p. 48 and by Koith on pp. 73-79 in 'Sankhya 
System.* HiB view about the non-existence of the athahtla 
body after a man's death is mentioned by Kumarila.* 331 Dr. 
B. Bhattacharya (in J. 1 H. vol VI. pp. 36-49 ) goes into the 
question of the identity of Vindhyavasa with Isvarakrsna. The 
present writer agrees with him but he does not agree with his 
further conclusion (p. 49 ) that Vindhyavasa lived earlier than 
Isvarakrsna whom he assigns to the period 330-390 A. J>. The 
evidence is too meagre to prove this. In JRAS for 1905 pp. 47 
ff. Vindhyavasa is said by Takakusu to be a pupil of Vrsagapa 
and that according to Paramartba Vrsagana and Vindhyavfisa 
lived in the 10th century after Buddha's nirvana. From Kamala- 
slla (p. 22 of Tattva-sangraha ) it appears that Budrila was also 
a name of Vindhyavasa, 

The AbhinnvabharatT of Abhinavagupta distinguishes between 
thotwo; 22SS so it is possible that Vindyavasa only revised the 

2253. Vide p. 954 note 1545 above where the Hve Siddhantas (Krtanta- 
pancaka) are Sankhya, Yoga, Pancaratra, Saiva and Pas'upata.

lomposad some work other than fte Sankhyakarika, Vindhya- 
vasin must be treated as different from Isvarakisna according 
to Bhojadeva. The Yuktidipika several times mentions the 
views of Vindhyavasin and indicates *•»*£"£**£* *££ 
the author of the S. Karika. Vide pp. 4, 108 144 148. This 
work says that the acarya < author of S Karika) did not enum- 
erate jtjna^a 22S1 and other constituents of the SSstra hut other 
acaryas like Vindhyavasa did mention them in other treatises. 
On pp 144-145 this com. shows that Vindhyavasin held that 
tndwjas were nWm (all-pervading), denied the existence of 
a subtle body (suksma sarira), while in S. Karika (40-41) 
lsivarakrsna held that the mdriyas were not vibhn and that there 
was a hnga or suksma body and Yuktidipika p. 144 says that 
Patailjali postulated a subtle body. 

How the name Safikhya came to bo applied to a system of 
philosophy has to be considered. ' Sankhya ' means ' number \ 
hence enumeration. As the Sankhya system enumerated 
twenty-five tattvas and as the Sastitantra of Pancasikha dealt 
with sixty topics, it is likely that the philosophy came to be 
called Sankhya. The Sv. Up. L 4 is full of numbers. M5S Verse 
I 5 of Sv. Up. employs the word panca (five ) seven times and 
also has tbe word 'paficasadbbedani', similar to ' satardharam " 
in I. 4); vide VI. 3 also. In this sense Sankhya means the

philosophic system which postulates twentyfive tafctvas, Prakrti, 
Furusa and others. This is the sense in which the word is used 
once even in the Glta (18. 13, Sankhya krtante proktani &o). 
The Matsyapurana also emphasizes this aspect of the Sankhya 
system. 

The word 'Sankhya' has another sense as the Amarakosa 
states ('carca sankhya vicarana ) viz. ' rational examination ' or 
' discernment'; and the word Sankhya may be derived from it in 
the sense of 'system of rational examination' and in the sense 
of 'philosopher* (masculine) according to 'tadadhlte tadveda' 
(Pan. IV. 2. 59) meaning 'Sankhyam veda\ 2:59 The BhamatI 
explains the word in the second sense. Sankhya in a general 
sense means tattvajuana ( knowledge of ultimate reality, includ- 
ing Vedanta) or a 'person who knows the ultimate reality.' The 
word Sankhya is frequently used in the Bhagavadglta in the 
sense of tattvajilana (as in IL 39, V. 5, XIII. 24) and in the sense 
of a person knowing ultimate reality ( in IH 3, V. 5 ). 

Some comparatively early Sanskrit works that disclose tenets 
similar to the standard Sankhya of the Karika may be briefly 
noticed here. The Buddhacarita of Asvaghosa (in chap. XIII. 17ff ) 
mentions a dialogue between Arada and Gautama (the future 
Buddha) in which occur prakrti, five elements, almnkara, buddhi, 
the indriyas, objects of sense, mind, ksetrajna as 5.tman and 
states that Kapila with his pupil was enlightened as to these, 
that nescience, actions and desires are the causes of samsara; 
that awdya has five aspects ( verses 33-37 ) which are defined, 
speaks of brahmacarya, and mukh. Though the tattvas are 
mentioned here the rest of the doctrines bear very little 
resemblance to the official Sankhya. 

TheCarakasamhita 2 " 60 (Jamnagar ed. 1949), SarirasthSna 
chap. I (particularly verses 17, 36, 63-66) contains some 
doctrines similar to the Sankhyakarika scheme and verse 151

refers to Yogins and Sankhyas and ultimately the liberated soul 
is said to become bralima. Therefore, it is more like the philo- 
sophy of Katha and Sv. Upanisads. 

The SusrutasamhitS also ( in Sarirasthana, ohap. I para- 
graphs 3,4-6, 8-9) sets out the Sankhya, 1261 is much closer 
to the standard system of the Karika than either the Buddha* 
carita or the Carakasamhita as the quotations in the notes 
will show. 

From p 1352 and note 2208 above it Would be seed that the" 

tenet oipiadhana being the cause of the world was mentioned in 

their works by Manu and others. This will he briefly illustrated. 

Manu I. 15 in speaking of creation mentions mahan, the three 

gunas, objects of sense, five senses. Manu I. 27 refers to the five 

tanmalras of the five elements. In Manusmvti XII. 24 sattva, 

rajas and tamas occur as the three gunas, verses 26-29 define 

and illustrate these three and XII. 30-38 dilate upon the different 

effects of the three gunas and the indications about these gunas ; 

XII. 40 provides that those who reBt in sattva-guna become gods, 

those who are rajam become men and those that abide in tamas 

become lower animals. :26J Manu XII. 50 speaks of mahan and 

avyakta. Yaj. smrti (III. 91-92) speaks of the five objects of 

sense, five jnanendriyas, five karmendriyas and mind ( 16 in all ) ; 

these sixteen together with ahankara, huddhi and five elements, 

ksetrajtla and Isvara are mentioned in Yaj'. III. 177-178 and 

verses 179-180 set out the evolution of buddhi from avyakta, of 

ahankara from buddhi, of tanmatras from ahankara, the five 

gunas (sabda, sparSa &c ) of the five elements and verse 182 

speaks of the three gunas.

On p. 1352 and in note 2208 above occurs the statement of 
Sankaracarya that Devala, a Sutrakara on Dharma, accepted 
Sankhya doctrines. This will be briefly indicated here. Apararka 
on Taj. III. 109 quotes a very long passage 2263 from Devala, 
Which after stating that there are two goals of human life 
(purusartha) viz abhyudaya and mhsreyasa and that the latter 
comprises Sankhya and Yoga, defines Sankhya as the knowledge 
of twenty-five tattvas, and yoga as the fixing of the mind on the 
desired goal after turning it away from objects of sense, and

( existence of prafcrti &c ). After this there is again an enumera- 
tion of prakrti, avyakta, mahan, ahankara, five tanmatras &o. 

It would be noticed that the quotation from Devals in 
Apararka contains two parts, the first stopping at the words ' Hi 
dasa nmlikSithah ' and the 2nd containing the rest. It appears 
that the two parts cover mostly the same ground and it is 
probable that the two parts are summaries of two different works 
on Sankhya. 

Another important digest of the first quarter of the 12th 

century A. D, namely the Krtyakalpataru of Laksmldhara in its 

MoksakSndapp 100-101 also quotes from Devala's Dharmasutra 

a prose passage which agrees word for word with a portion of 

the passage quoted above from Apararka viz. from the words 

'fcatra efakhyanam eka mulaprakrtih' up to 'trlnyantah- 

karanani' Then the portion from ' catasras-catasro* to 'iti 

daia mulikarthah ' is dropped by the Kalpataru and then it has 

the whole of the passage from 'atha mulaprakrtiravyaktam ' 

up to 'abhimanaityanarthantaram', 2264 after which it adds a 

short passage not found in Apararka (which is quoted below). 

It has the passage 'prakrter mahanutpadyate' up to ' ityutpatti- 

kramah '.

the note below. It will be noticed that after enumerating the 
twenty-five tattvas Yama adds Furusottama as the 26th 
tattva. 3265 

Puranas contain lengthy diBquisitioDB on the Sankhya 
doctrines. For example, the Visnupurana I, 2. 19-23, 25-62, 
VI, 4, 13-15, ll, 3240 (in all about 66 verses) are full of Sankhya 
doctrines and are all quoted in the Krtyakalpataru (Moksakanda 
pp. 102-108). But that Pm-ana emphasizes that Paramatman 
{called Visnu) is the support of all tattvas. In Visnupurana 
I. 2. 22-23 it is asserted 22M that brahmavadms who are proficient 
in Vedic doctrines recite (averse) that expounds pradhana, 
(and state) 'there was then (before creation) neither day nor 
night, no sky nor earth, neither darkness nor light, there was 
only one male brahma that was evolved as pradhana and that 
could not be apprehended by the ear (and other indriyas) or by 
buddhu Verses 39-40 (of Vismipurana VI. 4) assert that both" 67 
prakrti and purusa become dissolved in the Highest Self who is 
called Visnu in Vedas and Vedantas ( Upanisads ). 

Many other Puranas devote a great deal of space to the 
elucidation of Sankhya doctrines and terminology. Considera-

chapters and verses of some Puranas and the citation of a few 
striking or informative verses. Matsya ( 3. 14-29 ) begins with 
prakrti, gunas and all the twenty-five tattvas, remarks that the 
three gods, Brahma, Visnu, Mahesvara, though one, arose from 
the gunas being put into activity and winds up by saying that 
Sankhya is full of enumerations and was proclaimed by Kapila 
and others. 32 ® The Brahmapurana (1. 33-35, 33. 3-4, 242, 
67-70, 76-85) recounts the tattvas from prakrti to ksetrajfla 
and remarks at the end that the soul becomes heiala (free from 
all contacts and liberated) when he realizes the truth about 
himself. The Padmapurana in several places dilates upon the 
tattvas of the Sankhya such as in Patalakhanda 85. 11-18, 
Srstikbanda, chap. 2. 88-103, chap. 15 177-187, which closely 
follow the S. Karika verses. The Kurmapurana (1.4.13-35) 
Btates that Mahesvara enters prakrti and purusa, activates them 
and sets out Sankhya ideas and in II. 7. 21-26 it refers to the 
twenty-four tattvas and the state of equilibrium (samyaVastha), 
The Markandeya-purana in chap. 42. 32-62 treats of creation 
with Sankhya terminology. Three verses of the Brahmanda 
IV. 3. 37-46 referring to the threefold bondage (bandha) are 
quoted by the Krtyakalpataru (moksa) p. 124. Similarly,

1884 History of DliarmaSStira [Sec. VIII, Ch. XXXI 

Vide Bhagavatapurana III. 26. The Varahapurana ( B. I. ed. of 

1893 ) narrates the story of king Asvasiras to whom Kapila and 

Jaigtsavya ( the prince of Yogins ) came after he had performed 

the avabhrtha bath and was surrounded by brahmanaB and who 

asked them how the highest Narayana was to be worshipped, 

when the two told him that they were themselves Narayana. 

On his doubting these words of theirs Kapila assumed the form 

of Visnu and Jaiglsavya of Garuda and after other similar 

wonders, the king requested that his doubt whether Moksa ia 

attained by him who follows karmamarga or jfianamarga be 

resolved. The same Purana in chap. 25 (verses 1-5) declares 

that auyahla, the first tattva, made up of three (gunas) arose 

from the highest Purusa, from the union of the two ahankara 

was produced also called mahat, that Purusa is named Visnu 

or Siva while avyakta is called Uma, Devi or Sri and Guha 

(Kartikeya) is ahankara. The Bhagavatapurana (1.3.10) 

mentions Kapila as the fifth avatara of Visnu (vide above p. 1373) 

and ( in X. 8. 37-38) states that when Yasoda asked the child 

Krsna to open his mouth she saw inside the mouth the whole 

world, the five elements, the indriyas, mind, matras and the 

three gunas. Even great poets like Kalidasa and Bana are fond 

of utilising SSnkhya dootrines and terminology. For example, 

vide Kumarasambhava II. 4 (Gunatrayavibhagaya &c), Raghu- 

vamsa X 38 ( anginam tamasevohbau gnnau prathamamadhya- 

mau), Raghuvamsa VIII. 21 ( Raghurapyajayad-guna-trayam 

prakrtiBtham &a); Kadambarl, very first verse (rajojuse 

janmani...trigunatmane namah ). 

Even the Tantras were influenced by the Sankhya system 
as the S&radatilaka shows ( vide above p. 1061). 

It is not a vain boast when the Santiparva 2269 asserts that 
whatever knowledge is found in the Vedas, in Sankhya and 
Yoga, in the various Puranas, in the extensive itihssas, in the 
arthasastra and whatever knowledge exists in the world, ai 
that is derived from the Sankhya, For a dispassionate appraisa'

CHAPTER XXXII 

Yoga and Dharmasastra 

Sankhya and Yoga often go together in the Upanisade as 
well as in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavadglta and the PurSnas 
and their relationship to one another is the same in all these 
InSv.TJp.VI.13,Vanaparva2 15, Santiparva" 70 238.38,289.1, 
306. 65, 308. 25, 326. 100, 336. 69, Anusasana 14. 323, Bhagavad- 
glta V. 4-5, Padma purana ( Patalakhanda, 85. 11 ff ), the two 
are mentioned together. 

Though Sankhya greatly influenced all works dealing with 
the evolution of the world in its various aspects, it did not enjoy 
that great esteem among all sorts of people in India that the 
Yoga system enjoyed and still enjoys. The word yoga is derived 
from the root 'yuj' to join or to unite ( of rudhadi class). The 
germs of yoga can be traced back to the Bgveda. ftgveda V. 
81. 1 (a verse in praise of Savitr) reads 'wise men, priests and 
sacrificers concentrate their minds and join their prayers to the 
wise, the great (Savitr), who knows all (prayers)'. Another 
Vedic" 271 verse also speaks of concentrating the mind. The 
word' yoga* occurs frequently in the Rgveda in several shades 
of meaning. Sayana in many passages takes 'yoga' to mean 

acquiring what is not already possessed' (as in "Rg. I 5.3). 
In Rg. 1. 18.7 God Sadasaspati (Agni) is said to pervade ' the 
prayers (or thoughts) of sacrificers. In Rg. 1.34 9 it means 

yoking Jkada yogo vajino rasabhasya yena yajftam nasatyo- 
payathah . The word « yoga * is often used with the word Aaron 
(separately as in Rg. VII. 54. 3, VII. 86. 8) or as a compound

1386 Histm y of Dharmaiastra I Sao. VIII, Oh. XXXIt 

(as in Bg. X 166. 5 'Yogaksemam va SdSyaham bhuyteam- 

uttamah ' ). There is a great distance or gap between the 

meaning of the word yoga in the Bgveda { even in the verses 

about concentrating the mind) and its meaning in some of the 

"Upanisads and in classical Sanskrit. In Bg. X 136. 2-3 there 

is mention 327a of mums, sons of Vatarasana, who wore dirty 

and tawny garments and who say in verse 3 ' we being in ecstasy 

( or wild bliss ) owing to cur way of life as munis resort to winds ; 

mortals I you look on our bodies only ', This shows that even in 

those ancient times, some people practised tapas, did not care 

what clothes they wore and thought they (i. a their souls) would 

be merged in the wind (that is, the souls are formless and could 

not be seen ). In Bg. VIII. 17. 14 Indra is said to be a friend of 

munis and muni is also a friend of every god in Bg. X 136. 4. 

But as to yati s (he position was rather different. The word yah 

occurs several times in the Bgveda but in most cases that word 

has no certain connection with the meaning of 'ascetic'. In 

Bg. VIII 3. 9 'by which (says brahma priest ) wealth was given to 

Bhrgu from the yatis and by which you helped (or protected) 

Praskanva'; here Indra seems to be opposed to yatis. In Bg. 

Via. 6. 18 the poet says * Valiant Indra I listen to my prayer 

alone from among the yatis and Bhrgus that praised thee'. 

Hera Sayana explains ' yatayah ' as ' Angirasah '. In any case 

'yatis' are here shown- to be devotees of Indra. But in other 

SamhitSs it is said that Indra threw 'yatis' to the wolves or 

hyenas. 3273 Later on, however, the meaning of yah seems to hare 

changed. In these Sainhita passages * yatis ' appear to be persons 

hostile or alien to the Vedic rites, but what they did to desorva

slaughter by Indra is not clear. In Atharvaveda II. 5. 3 Indra is 
said to have killed Vrtra as he did in the case of yatis. Some ot 
the Upanisads, howeveT, show that 'yati' was a person who had 
given up worldly affairs, practised yoga and endeavoured after 
the knowledge of Atman and realized Brahma; vide Mundata 
Up III. 1. 5 (yam pasyanti yatayah ksinadosah) and III. 2. 6 
( sannyasayogad-yatayah suddhasattvah ). Some like Hauer in 
'Die Anfrange der Yoga-praxis', 1922 pp. 11 ff) hold that the 
Vratyas of Atharvaveda XV were ecstatics of the ksatriya class 
and forerunners of Yogins. 

The word ' yoga ' occurs in some of the Upanisads in the same 
sense in which it is employed in the Yogasfitra. In Katha Up. 
II. 12, it is said 2274 'the wise man reflecting on God by means 
of yoga, by concentrating the mind on the inner spirit 
becomes free from joy and grief ' ( adhyatmayogadhigamena ). 
The same Upanisad says that the state described in VI. 11 
is regarded as Yoga because therein the organs ( and the 
mind and buddhi) are firmly held under control. In Katha 
Up VL 18 it is said that Naciketas having understood the 
vidua and the whole procedure of Yoga propounded by Yama 
attained (the realization of) brahma. The word 'Yoga 4 occurs 
in the Tai. Up. II. 4 ( in speaking about vijnanamaya atman, 
yoga is said to be its atman, the exact sense being doubtful), and 
in the Sv Up. II. 11 and VI. 13. Prasna ( 5. 5-6 ) speaks of the 
three matras (a.u.m) of Om In Sv. Up. 1. 3 occurs the word 
'dhyanayoga'. The Sv. Up. (II 8-13) refers to asana and 
pranayama and sets out the first signs of the successful practice 
of Yoga. The Chan, Up. VHI. 15 appears to refer to pratyahara 
(though the technical word is not used) in 'Stmani sarvendri- 
ysnipratisthapya' (having brought all organs of sense to rest 
in the atman).' The Br. Up. (1. 5. 23) appears to refer to pranayama 
in 'he should observe the one vow, viz. inhalation and exhala- 
tion (tasmad-ekameva vratam caret pranyac-caiva apanyacca).

that >og.vviahi is separately mentioned (probably as a means to brahma- 
realizntion ) 



1388 History of DharmaiUatra I Sec. VIII, Ch. XXXh 

The VedanfcaButra (II. 1. 3 'etena yogah pratyuktah) states 

that Yoga is refuted by the reasoning adopted for the refutation 

of the S&nkbya system. The position of Sankaraoarya as to both 

SSnkhya and Yoga has been stated abovo (pp.1352 and 1361 

n. 2208 and 2231 ). He points out in the purvapaksa that 

Veda 2 " 5 proscribes Yoga as a means of achieving correct 

knowledge and refers to Br. Up. II. 4. 5. He further points out 

that in the Sv. Up. Yoga is expounded in great detail after first 

mentioning the proper posture (for the practice of Yoga) in the 

words 'having held the body straight but raised high in three 

places viz. chest, neck and head' (Sv. Up. II, 8). From the 

words of Sankaraoarya that in Yogasastra also Yoga is held to 

be a means of the realisation of right knowledge, it follows that 

he had a yogasastra before him in which occurred the words 

, atha...yogah,'but as he does not employ the word YogaBfltra 

he probably does not refer to a sutra work. If a conjecture 

may be hazarded, it is possible that the Yogasastra meant by 

Sankara is a work like the Yogasastra ascribed to Yajiiavalkyo 

in Yaj. Smrti HI. 110 (YogasSstram oa mat-proktam &c). 

Sankaraoarya admits on V. S. 11. 1. 3 that a part of the yoga is 

acceptable to him but other parts conflict with the Veda. 

Mundaka Up. (H 2.6) enjoins samudhi in the words 'ora-iti 

dhysyatha atmanam' as Sankaraoarya states on V. S. II. 3.39 

(samadhyabhavac-ca). In the Upanisads 'Muni' and *Yati' 

have come to denote 3276 the same meaning, e g. Br. Up, IV. 

4. 22 states ' one becomes muni by realizing this very self,'

Muni and yah mean the same in Upamsad* i389 

while the Mundaka (DLL 5)«" states 'this self is to be 
attained by Truth, by tapas, by right knowledge and by sexual 
mtrityat all times- that self resides inside the body (like a 
light ), is pure, whom spotless ascetiog realize.' The Kathopamsad 
(III 13) provides that the wise man should restrain speech 
in mind (speech and mind, as the text stands), he should 
keep it within the self which is knowledge, he should keep 
down knowledge within the self that is the great, and he, 
should keep that (the great) within the self which is quiet. 
The Upanisads thus not only employ the word 'Yoga' but 
provide some of the stages of yoga and its technique for realiz- 
ing the Supreme Spirit. About twenty Yoga Upanisads are 
published at Adyar, edited by A. Mahadev Sastri (1920), but as 
their chronology is most uncertain and as most of them appear 
to the present writer to be later than the MahabhSrata, Manu 
and probably the Yogasutra, they are passed over here and are 
referred to in this work sparingly 22M 

Panini provides for the formation of the words ijama and 
niyama (twoangas)of Yoga and the word 'Yogin' appears to 
have been derived by him from the root ' yu] * with the affix 
' ghinun * ( i. e. m ) in the sense of tacchllya (being habituated 
to) according to Pan. HI. 2. 143 (which is a very long sutra). 2279

The Apastambadharmasutra (1.8 23.3-6) quotes a verse 
'The total destruction of tf osas ( taints ) ia due to Yoga in this 
life ; a wise man after having expelled all dosas that cause harm 
to all beings reaches peace (moksa)' and then it sets out fifteen 
dosas such as anger, ecstatic joy, greed, hypocrisy, the destruc- 
tion of which is due to Yoga and enumerates the qualities that 
are opposites of the dosas. This shows that long before the 4th 
or 5th century B. C. Yoga as a discipline of the mind had bean 
well developed. 

The V. S. II. 1. 3 indicates that the Sfitrakara had before him 
a body of Yoga doctrines, some of which were the same as fchosa 
of the Sankhya and he also knew Samadhi (V. S. II. 3. 39). 
Again, the V. S. mentions ( in IV. 2. 21 ) Yogins and distinguishes 
Sankhya and Yoga as smarta (and not srauta). Sankaracarjra 
on V. S. J. 3. 33 quotes the extant YogasStra II 44 (svSdbyayad- 
ista-devats-samprayogah ) and on a28B V. S. II. 4. 12 he appears 
to be willing to admit that the Yoga-sutra preceded V. S. and 
quotes YogasStra 1. 6 in the 2nd interpretation of that sutra. 

The important question is whether the author of the V, S. 
refers to the extant Yogasutra. The present author holds for 
various reasons that the V. S. does not Tefer to the present Yoga- 
sutra, but to the Yoga doctrines that had been developed even 
before the Katha Mundaka, Svetasvatara and other Upanisads, 
In the Santiparva it is stated that the propounder 3381 of 
Sankhya was poramarsi (highest sage) Kapila, Hiranyagarbha

Ancient propounders of Sankhya-yoga 1391 

was the ancient knower of Yoga, no one else (knew it); 
Apantaratamaa was Vedacarya whom some called the sage 
Fracmagarbha. In the previous chapter it is stated that Sankhya, 
Yoga VedaTanyaka and Pancaratra are one and are angas of 
each other. In Santi. 326. 65 Hiranyagarhha is again connected 
with Yogasastra. Videp 1371 above. In the Anusasanaparva 228 
Sanatkumara appears to be connected with Yoga as the founder, 
just as _apila was the founder of Sankhya. In the Ahirhudhnya 
Samhita (XIL 32-33) it is stated that Hiranyagarhha first 
propounded two Yogasamhitas, one was called ' Nirodhayoga' 
and the other was called *_armayoga', the first of which was 
again divided twelve-fold The Bhamati M8S on V S IL 1.3 states 
that that sutra does not totally negative the authoritativeness 
of the Yogasastra of Hiranyagarhha and _ atanjali. The Visnu- 
purana 2281 appears to quote two verses from Hiranyagarhha 
(vide note below). Vaoaspati in his commentary on Yogasutra 
1. 1 states that Yogi-Yajnavalkya mentions that Hiranyagarhha 
was the propoundeT of Yoga. Vaoaspati regards the Yogasutra 
of Patanjali as later than Yoga-Yajnavalkya-smrti. There- 
fore, it is almost certain that the V. S. refutes the doctrines of 
that Yoga system that was known to the Santiparva, 

In Salyaparva ( chap. 50 ) a story is told about bhiksji 
Jaiglsavya who was a great Yogin and of 'Asita Devala*, a 
householder staying on the holy Sarasvata-tlrfcha. 

In the Santiparva ( or. ed. chap. 222 = Ch. ed. 
chap. 229 ) there is a long dialogue between Jaiglsavya and 

Asita about Yoga, one verse (14) nSi from which may be cited

here * Yogins do not talk much by way of censure and praise of 
others and their minds are never affected by the praise and 
censure of them indulged in by others.' In that chap. Jaigl- 
savya is described as one who was never angry nor joyful. In 
the VarsbapurSna ( 4. 14) it is stated that Kapjla and Yogirat 
Jaiglsavya came to king Asvasiras that had taken the atabhrlha 
bath after Asvamedha and assumed the forms of Visnu and 
Garuda respectively. It may he noted that on Y. S. H, 55 the 
bhSsya quotes several views, but prefers that of Jaiglsavya. 
On Y. S. HI. 18, 228S the bhasya mentions the dialogue between 
Avatya and Jaiglsavya, where the latter'B opinion is stated to 
be that from the point of view of kmvalya, the happiness of 
contentment is also misery, though as compared to pleasures 
of sense contentment is supposed to be and may he called 
happiness. 

In the Buddhacarita (XII) when Gautama (the future 
Buddha ) approached a philosopher Arada, the latter desoribed 
to Gautama his idea of the path to moksa and mentioned 
Jaiglsavya, Janaka and Vrddha-Faraiara as persons that had 
become liberated by following that path.' 387 

From these references it follows that Jaiglsavya was a 
great teacher of Yoga long before the Christian era and probably 
had composed a work on Yoga not now available. 

There are numerous English translations of the Yogasutra 
(wholly or partly) and of the Bhasya and Vacaspati's Com- 
mentary, such as that by Dr. Bajendralal Mitra with text of 
Y S., bhasya and com. Bajamartanda and an appendix (p. 3»"

Many editions of the Yogasutra of Patafijali with the 
bhasya of Vyasa and the commentary ( called Tattvavaisarad!) of 
Vsoaspati have been printed in India. I shall mention only 
two or three editions of the text of the Sutra and the two 
commentaries viz. the edition by the late Pandit Bajaram 
Shastri Bodas, printed in beautiful type at the Nirnayasagara 
Press in 1892 and the other, the Anandasrama edition of 1932 
which contains the sutra, bbssya, Vsoaspati's commentary and 
also the commentary called Rsjamartanda of king Bhoja. in 
the Eashi Sanskrit series the Yogasutra was printed (in 1930) 
with six commentaries viz. the Rajamarfcanda of Bhojaraja, ths 
PradlpikS of Bhava Ganesa, vrtti by JNagoji-bhatta, the Mani- 
prabhaby BamSnandayati, the Oandrika by Anantadeva and 
the Yoga-sudhSkara by Sadasivendra Sarasvati. 2 " 6 *

SamSdhi ( concentration), Sadhana (means of attainment), 
*££ (super-normal power,) and; Kaivalya ( aloof hess 
ligation). There are only 195 sutras in all fee padas together 
(51+55+55+34). 

Dr.Radhakrishnanin 'Indian Philosophy" (vol. n. f the 
ed of 1931 pp. 341-42) holds that the anthor of the Yogasutra 
I not later &an 300 A. D. Prof. S. N. Das Gupta in 'History 
of Indian Philosophy' (vol I. PP 226-238) is »*«««"**» 
identity of the two Patafijalis and therefore holds that ^Khe 
author of the Yogasutra flourished in the 2nd century B u 
The Sanskrit paper of Pandit B. Ramamurtisarma m J. of 
Venkatesvara Institute of Tirupati (vol. H pp. 889-294) and 
Mr. Govind Das's brief note in I. A. vol. 44 (foT 1915 p. 24) may 
also be read in this connection. Jacohi and (following him) 
Keith hold that the Yogasutra ( I. 40 ), meaning at the most ' the 
mastery of the Yogin extends from the minutest particle to the 
greatest magnitude imaginable', 2290 refers to the atomic theory 
of the world. This is a good sample of the way in which even 
great Western writers read in simple words later theories and 
try to give late dates to early works. The Upanisads speak of 
the self as more minute than what is ami and as greater than 
the great and the Mahabharata also uses the same phraseology. 
There is no convincing reason to suppose that the Yogasutra 
refers only to a theory of atoms propounded in the Yaisesika 
system and is not paraphrasing the words of the Upanisad and 
the Mahabharata. 

We have also to consider the early tradition embodied in 
an introductory verse in Bhojadeva's commentary (not later 
than 1055 A D.) and mentioned by Cakrapani (commentator 

2289 Most scholars accept 2nfl cenrnry B C as the date of the 
Mababhlsya. Dr t> C. Sircar in I H.Q. vol, IS (pp 633-638) tries to 
show that the Mahabhasya cannot be placed earlier than the 2nd century 
A, D His arguments cannot be discussed here The present anthor does 
not agree with Dr, Sircar and holds that the arguments (or placing the 
Mahabhasya in the 2nd century B, C are far more weighty than those pat 
forward by Dr Sircar.

of the Oarakasamhita 2291 (about 1060 A. D.) that Patafijali 
(deemed to be an avalSru of Sesa) composed works on Grammar, 
Yoga and Medicine. 

The present author cannot deal at length in this volume 
with the two questions of identity and of the dates of the two 
works, as he is mainly concerned with the influence of Yoga on 
Dharmasitstra works. He thinks that hardly any cogent argu- 
ments have been advanced to positively disprove the identity of 
the authors of the MahabhSsya and of the Yogasutra. Whether 
the revision of Oaraka's work was done by the same Patafijali 
is very doubtful. In the Santiparva the founder of Cihtstta 
(medicine ) is said to have been Krsnatreya and not Garaka nor 
Patafijali. The Caraka-samhita uses the expression 'iti ha 
smaha bhagavan-Atreyah' in the beginning of its chapters. 
Caraka (in 1. 1. 23 ff ) states that the sage BharadySja learnt 
Ayurveda from Indra. His pupil was Punarvasu Atreya, who 
had six disciples viz. Agnivesa, Bheda, Jatukaroa, Parasara, 
Hartta and Ksarapani. First, Agnivesa composed a treatise on 
Ayurveda and read it to Atreya and then Bheda and others did so. 
In the chapter called 'Tisraisanlya* in Caraka-samhita (I It 
75) Krsnatreya's view is specially mentioned. Therefore, 
it appears that Ersnatreya 2292 is different from Atreya who w 
reverently mentioned at the beginning of CaTaka's chapters. 
Even the Buddhacarita of Asvaghosa mentions Atreya as the 
first propounder of medical science. 

It is possible to argue that the tradition that Patafijali dealt 
with Yoga and Grammar is older than the Vakyapadlya , ot 
Bhartrhari. That work states in its first section"* [cam 
Brahmakanda) that the taints that affect the body, speech ana

intellect are purified (respectively) by the sciences of medicine, 
grammar and metaphysics. Then in the eulogy of the Maha- 
bhasya it remarks ' alabdhagadhe gambhiryad-uttana iva 
sausthavat ', on which the commentator explains that in the verse 
from the Brahmakanda the author of the Mahabhasya is praised 
and in the other verse there is praise of the bhasya itself. 3?rom 
this it appears to follow that according to the commentator the 
Vskyapadiya attributes the three sastras on medicine, grammar 
and metaphysics (i. e. Yoga) to Patafijali himself. 

Even if it be held that the authors of the Yogasutra and of 
the MahabhSsya are different persons, there are hardly any 
reasons for definitely assigning the author of the Yogasutra to a 
date later than the 2nd or 3rd century A D. The date of the 
Yogabhasya of Yyasa is of considerable importance in arriving 
at the probable date of the Yogasutra. But the question of the 
date of the Yogabhasya is also debatable. The Vyasa who 
composed the Yogabhasya would have to be held as different 
from Vedavyasa, the reputed author of the Mahabharata. 

The author of the Yogasutra is, according to the tradition 
embodied in such Comparatively early commentaries as that of 
Yacaspatimisra, said to be Patanjali. Important questions arise 
as to his age and his identity with Patanjali, the author of the 
famous Mahabhasya on Fanini's grammar and the Yartikas 
thereon. The grammarian Patanjali is generally held to have 
flourished about 150 B.C. Therefore, the question of identity 
becomes amportantforthe date of the Yogasutra. Some scholars 

S f n n ? hl t' Dr ' Haaei (p - 98 of *» WOTk ° f W33 ) and

Patafijali also employs such an expressions as 'aviravikanyaya* 2 * 1 
( which should be avyavikanysyena ) for which Patafijali is 
criticized in the long Purvapaksa on Vyakarana contained in 
the Tantravartika and which is not explained away in the reply 
to the Purvapaksa. It cannot be supposed that the Yogasutra 
for the first time settled the technical terms of Yoga, Yoga 
terms had been evolving from Upanisad times and Patanjali 
only used them in the sense which they had acquired in the 
course of centuries. Prof, Renou arrives at the conclusion that 
the Yogasutra is later by several centuries than the Mahabhssya. 
Jacobi in his paper on ' the dates of the philosophical sutras of 
the BrShmanas' ( in JAOS, vol 31 pp. 1-29 ) holds (p. 29 ) that 
the Yogasutra must be later that the 5th century A. T>. and, 
following Garbs, thinks that it is not improbable that the 
VyasabMsya was composed in the 7th century A. D. The views 
of Jacobi are strongly criticized by Jwala Prasad in J. B. A. S. 
for 1930 pp. 365-375. The present author disagrees with JaooW 
and Prof. Renou. 

The date of the Yogabhasya will have considerable bearing 
on the date of the Yogasutra. The Yogabhasya presupposes much 
literary activity on Yoga. It mentions by name on Y. S. II. 55 and 
onlH. 18 Jaiglsavya who is a prominent figure intheMahahharato 
as shown above ( pp. 1367 and 1374). Vide also the story of 
Asita Devala with whom Jaiglsavya stayed for many years as 8 
bhiksu and adept in Yoga ( Salyaparva, chap. 50 ). It has to l>° 
remembered that several interpretations of the Bame Yogamitro 
are noted in the bhasya ( as on II. 55 ). The Yogabhasya quotes 
several Karikas and verses dealing with the matters treated oi 
in the Y. S. as on Y. S. 1. 28, 48, II. 5, 28 ( on nine causes that leao 
to Vivekakhyati ), H. 32, III, 6, III 15 ( on seven Oittajharmafl 
of the apandrsta type). Besides these, several quotations i « 
prose are cited in the bhasya, many of which are attrihutea w 
Pancasikha by VScaspati (vide pp. 1373-74 above), and som « 
on H. 22, 30, 52) to Sgamins (those who know *»*™ 
or Veda). Therefore, it follows that some centuries mtorven 
between the Yogasutra and its bhasya. 

The Bhasya on Y. S.IL 42 quotes a verse with i «» ^ 
' tatba coktatn- ( it has also been said ), whichjs joW^ 

«i^a:i'(p. 260. Snan.ea.) 



Quolalions in Yogabliasya discussed 1399 

a verse from the Santiparva.* 295 It is most unlikely that an 
author will rely on his own work for supporting a proposition 
propounded in another work of his own. Besides, the Yogabhasya 
quotes on Y. S. I. 28 a verse, which is Visnupurana 2296 - VI. 6. 2. 
The Visnupurana is one of the earliest among extant Puranas 
( vide above pp. 907-909 ) and cannot he assigned to a date later 
than the 3rd century A. D. Therefore, the Yogabhasya which 
quotes the Mahabharata and the Visnupurana may be assigned 
to about 4th century A. D. As argued above, the Y. S. would 
therefore have to be assigned to a date not later than the 2nd or 
3rd century A D. Though the present writer holds that the Yoga 
that is said to be refuted in V. S. IL 1. 3 is not that of the Yoga- 
sutra but the Yoga found in the Santiparva, yet he is not 
prepared to place the present Yogasutra earlier than the 2nd 
century B. 0. Mr. K. K. Kolhatkar in his very exhaustive and 
learned Introduction ( in Marathi) asserts (on p. 126) that the 
Yogasutra is later by 3000 years than the Brahmasutra and that 
the Bhagavadglta was composed about 5000 years before the 
present day (p. 224). But he adduces no evidence for such an 
ancient date for that work. He probably relies on the traditions 
that Vyasa, the reputed author of the Mahabharata ( including 
the Gita ), flourished towards the end of the Dvapara age and 
that Kahyuga started in 3179 B. C. Modern critical scholarship

Sitnilai ihes between yogasutra and Gita 1401 

Dharana and Pranayama. The Asvamedhikaparva 19. 17 
( Ch. ed. ) appears to refer to pratyahara. 2300 

There is also striking similarity between the Bhagavadglta 
and the Yogasutra. 2301 For example, the definition of Yoga in 
the Yogasutra as the ' mastery over ( or elimination of ) the 
functions ( or fluctuations ) of the mind ' has a close parallel 
in the Gita. The Gita, insists on the yogin being 'aparigraha' 
(VI. 10); 'apaTigrha* is one of the five yamas ( Y. S. II. 30 ). 
Similarly, the seat and posture ( asana) in which a yogin is to 
practise must he stable (this refers to, the seat) and comfortable 
( says Yogasutra ) ; the Gita says the same thing in greater detail. 
In Vm 12 the Gita speaks of Yogadharana. Th8 Gita says ( in 
VI. 35 ) that the mind is certainly Testless and difficult to control, 
but it can be controlled by practice and passionlessnes3 and the 
Y. S. ( 1 12 ) speaks of the same two means. The Gita ( in V. 4-5 ) 
emphasizes that it is the ignorant that regard Sankhya and 
Yoga as different, that he who applies himself or stands com- 
mitted to one of these secures the fruit held out by both and that 
he who sees both ways as identical sees truly. Here Sankhya 
means (sannyasa) * renunciation ' and Yoga means 'Karma- 
yoga'. 

The Yogasutra of Fatanjali nowhere expressly sets out its 
scheme of the evolution of the world. But it contains enough 
material to enable ns to hold that it presupposes and accepts 
some of the Sankhya doctrines such as the theory of Pradhana 
the three gunas and their characteristics, the real nature of the 
individual self and favalya (the state of the soul in final 
liberation) This may be established by a few references to Y. S 
x.b. ill 48 describes the results that ensue to the yogin from

1402 History of Dharmakasti a [ Sec. VHI, Oh. X33H 

' pradhanajaya' 3302 ( subjugation of Pradhana the primary cause 
of the world according to the Sankhya). The T. S nowhere 
describes what Pradhana is and what its evolutes aTe. Therefore 
it follows that it takes over from the Sankhya all that is said 
about Pradhana. About the individual soul the T. S. states 'the 
seer (Purusa) exists 2203 as merely pure capacity of awareness 
(or as the mere power of seeing) and although pure (changeless 
or undefiled or free from any taints ) appears as if he sees all 
experiences ( that really pertain to Buddhi ) ' The characteristics 
of the three gunas (sattva, rajas and tamas) are clearly and 
succintly 2301 stated in T. S. as in S, Karika 13, when it says 
'the seen (phenomenal universe) is characterized by light 
(sattva), activity (rajas) and inertia or dullness (tamas), it is 
the essence of the elements and organs and it exists for the 
purpose of giving experience and liberation (to the soul)'. The 
gunas are frequently referred to in Y. S. 1. 16, IV. 13, 32, 34 and 
saitvaguna in Y. S. II. 41, III 35, 49 and 55. The Y. S, postulates 
three pramaiias ( in I. 7 ), but does not define them ; the S KarikS 
( 4-6 ) mentions the same three pramanas and briefly defines 
them They both agree about the plurality of souls It may 
further be noted that Vyasabbasya on Y. S. is full of Sankhya 
doctrines and quotes, according to Vacaspati, Pancasikha twelve 
times and Sastitantra once (vide above p. 1374 and n. 2250 ). 

In spite of the fact that the Yogasutra accepts some of the 
fundamental doctrines of the Sankhya, there are certain points of 
differencebetween the two. The«tandard Sankhya finds no place 
for God ( Is vara ) i. e. it is frankly atheistic ( if theism means 
belief in God who is the creator of the universe and regulator 
of rewards and punishments), while Yoga finds a place for God in 
Y. S, X 23-29, though not a basic one, but only secondary, 
probably as a concession to populaT feelings and belief. The

The place of Isiara m Yogasulia 1403 

Y. S. nowhere expressly says that Isvara is the creator of the 
world and all that it says about Him is that in him omniscience 
is at its highest, that He was the teacher of primal sages and 
that by repetition of the mystic syllable * om * and reflection on 
it the yogin attains correct knowledge of the real nature of the 
self. In the nest place, though the summum bonum in both 
systems is called kmvalya ( S Karika 64, 68 and Y. S III. 50, 
55, IV. 34 ), yet the Sankhya does not set out any elaborate 
discipline for attaining it except correct knowledge, that is, it is 
metaphysical and rational, while the Y. S. gives an elaborate 
treatment on mind discipline, insists on effort rather than irvere 
jnana, attaches great importance to pranayama and meditation 
( dhyana) and is psychological. 

The Sankhya postulated that an intellectual understanding 
of the nature of pmusa and of ptakrk{oT guiias) and of the 
difference between the two was sufficient for the emancipation of 
the individual self from the liability to rebirth, while yoga, on 
the other hand, was not content with this philosophic easy-going 
mental frame and emphasized systematic training of the will 
and emotions In both Sankhya and Yoga each individual soul 
is eternal and his destiny is to become free from the influence of 
Prakrti and its evolutes and to remain for ever the same ( viz. 
pure intelligence). Herein they differ from the Advaita Vedanta, 
according to which the final destiny of the self is to become 
absorbed in and one with brahma. 

There is another matter for consideration. In the Yajna- 
valkya-smrti.Yajfiavalkya is put forward as saying that the 
soul shining like a lamp in the heart should be realized, that on 
such realization the soul is not horn again and as adding that 
for the purpose of attaining to Yoga one should understand the

Yogasastra propounded by me.' In the Kfirmapurana it ia said 
that Yajfiavalkya composed Yogasastra at the order of Hara and 
the Visnupurana ( IV. 4 107 ) states that Hiranyanabha attained 
the knowledge of y oga from the great Yoglsvara Yajfiavalkya 
who was a pupil of Jaimini. In the Brhadaranyaka Up. (H 4) 
Yajnavalkya tells his wife Maitreyl (who hankered after 
immortality and cared naught for worldly goods ) that he would 
expound to her the path to immortality and the very first 
sentence calls upon her to cultivate 'nididhyasa' (i,e. dhyana) 
and the first part of bis discourse ends with the memorable 
words (Stma va are drastavyah srotavyo mantavyo nididhya- 
sitavyah, Br. Up IL 4. 5 ). What work is meant by the Yoga- 
sastra composed by Yaj is a debatable point. There are thres 
works (other than the Yaj. smrti) connected with the name of 
Yajnavalkya viz. .. Vrddha-Yajfiavalkya, Yoga-Yajnavalkya 
and Brhad-yogi-yajfiavalkya (vide H. of Dh. vol. I p. 188-190). 
The la»t has been published by Eaivalyadhama, Lonavla (1951), 
the Yoga-Yaj. was published in T. S. S. (1938) based on 
a single ms., then in the JBBRA.S (vol. 38 and 39) byShri 
P. O. Diwanji and now available in book form ( 1954 }. This last 
is in the form of a dialogue between the great yogin Yajfiavalkya 
and GSrgl (who is identified with Maitreyl by Sbri Diwanji on 
pp. 27-28 of his ed. of 1954 ) and sages and learned hrahmanas 
Yajfiavalkya narrates what he learnt from Brahma. On Yaj. 
III. 110 the Dlpakalika of Sulapani remarks that the Yogasastra 
referred to is called * Yogiyajnavalkya '. But this again leads to 
uncertainty as both the works viz that published by Eaivalya- 
dhama and the one by Mr. Diwanji are so referred to as Yogi (or 
Yoga) Yajfiavalkya in several digests Mr Diwanji 2306 tries hard to 
establish that the work published by him 'has abetter claim to» 
adjudged the specific work on Yoga referred to in Yaj m. iw. 
I think that the claim is not at all justified. The work ediM by 
Mr Diwanji no doubt contains a good deal of Yoga knowleoge.

matters alone may be pointed out to show that the Yoga- 
Yajfiavalkya could not have been the work of the author of the 
Brbadaranyaka and the Yogasastra ( as stated in Yaj HL 110 ) 
and of Yaj. smrti. In the Br. Up. II. 4. 1 and IV 5. 1 ( Yajna- 
valkyasya dve bharye babhuvatur-Maifcreyl oa KatySyanl ca ) it 
is expressly stated that Yajnavalkya had two wives, (philosophy- 
minded ) Maitreyl and Katy ayani ( worldly-minded ). Maitreyl 
desired Buch knowledge as would lead to immortality and she 
asks questions, in all of which she addresses Yajnavalkya as 
'bhagavan' (in Br. Up. H 4. 3 and 13 and IV. 5 4,14) and 
never as mere Yajnavalkya. On the other hand, Gargl in the 
Br. Up. is called Vacaknavl ( in III. 6. 1, HI 81 and 12 ), is not 
Yajfiavalkya's wife but a pert and rationalistic woman inquirer 
like Asvala, Sitabhaga, Bhujyu Lahyayani, Usasta Cakrayana, 
Kahola (all present in the court of Janaka), who including 
Gargl questioned the claim of Yajnavalkya to he regarded as 
'brahmistha'. In Br. Up. III. 6.1 when Gargl pursues her 
ratiocination too far (in matters depending uponagama and 
being beyond reasoning ) Yajnavalkya reprimands her and says 
that she would die (lit. her head would fall away) if she pursued 
the subject in a pure logistic way. All those inquirers address 
Yajnavalkya as mere Yajnavalkya without any honorific epithet 
like 'bhagavan' and Gargl does the same (in Br Up. HI. 6. 1, 
III. 8. 2-6). Ace. to Yaj Smrti III. 110 the Br. Up , a Yoga- 
sSstra and the smrti are the works of one man (whose two wives 
were Maitreyl and Kstyayani) and who had a philosophical 
skirmish with Gargl "Vacaknavl (according to the Br. Up. ). The 
present Yogayajflavalkya (ed by Mr.Diwanji) makes Gargl wife of 
Yajnavalkya 231 " (vadhuh ). One would like to know whether Yaj. 
had three wives, as Br. Up. says he had only two Mr. Diwanji 
(pp 27-88 of the ed. of 1954) tries to make light of this discrepancy 
and regards Maitreyl as another name of Gargl. We are here con- 
cerned not with pure Yoga doctrines but with the question

whether a work attributed to Yaj wliioh makeB GargI the wife 
of the ancient Yajfiavalkya (when the Upanisad makes her only 
a more or Ibbs insolent woman ) oan be regarded as the work of 
the same Yaj. who propounded bi ahmaudya in the Br, Up. and 
is supposed to have composed the Y3.J srarti This one circums- 
tance alone is enough to brand the Yoga- Yajiiavalkya ( of Mr. 
Diwanji) as a fabrication sought to be passed off as an ancient 
work. If identity was really meant tho verse could easily have 
been read as ' Maitreyyakhya mahabhaga ' without any metrical 
fault. Therefore, it is not possible to hold that Yogayajfiavalkya 
is the Yogasastra composed by Yajiiavalkya before the Srarti 
going under his name was composed. A few other decisive 
grounds may also bo urged. The work edited by Mr. Diwanji 
mentions Tantras ( in V. 10 ) and Tantrikas ( in VIII. 4 and 35 ). 
Tho Yaj. smrti nowhere mentions these two and is free from the 
peouliar Tantrik words or technique. Therefore, the present 
Yogayajiiavalkya edited by Mr. Diwanji waB composed long after 
the Yaj'. smrti and probably in the 8th century or after when 
Tantrik rites and works had become common. One mors 
important matter may be adverted to. The Yaj. srarti and the 
Yoga-Yajfiavalkya ( ed. by Mr. Diwanji ) both enumerate ten 
yamas and ten myamas. But the two diverge materially in the 
ten names as the note below will show 2308 The number of yamas 
and niyamas differs in different works, but if the Yaj. smrti and 
Yoga-Yajfiavalkya were the works of the same author, the 
differences in the ton names would not have occurred at all. 
Therefore, the author of the Yaj. smrti is quite different from 
the author of the Y. Y. There is no evidence for holding that 
the latter flourished before the Sth or 9th century A. D. 

A good deal has been said by Mr Diwanji in his paper on 
'Brhad-yogi-yajfiavalkya and Yoga-Yajfiavalkya' in ABOrU. 
vol XXXIV (1953) pp. 1-39, in his preface to Yoga-Yajnavalkya

published separately as a pamphlet in July 1958 ). It would not 
be relevant in this work to discuss the points in dispute between 
Mt. Diwanji and Swami Kuvalayanand. In the bhasya on the 
Svetasvataropanisad attributed to SankaracaTya 2309 (published 
by Anan. Press ) on p. 28 four verses and a half are quoted from 
Yogi-Ya3navalkya, none of which is found either in Br, Y. Y. 
or Y. Y. Besides on Sv. Up. II. 9 (pp. 42-44 ) 29 verses on Yoga 
matters are quoted in the bhasya, but the name of the author or 
work whence the quotations aTe taken is not mentioned. Not 
one of the 29 verses wholly occurs in Mr. Diwanji's Y Y. He is 
able to point out only five or six half verses as occurring in Y Y. 
out of the 29 verses, while a whole verse quoted in the bhasya 
(viz. 'pranayamair' &c) occurs in Br. Y. Y. ( 8. 32). It may be 
further pointed out that Apararka and the Smrticandrika quote 
in all about 100 veTses from Yogi (or Toga-) Yajnavalkya which 
are found in Br. Y. Y„ but not in Y. Y, The Krtyakalpataru 
(on Moksakanda alone) quotes (on pp. 146, 149, 166, 171, 
196-197 ) about 70 verses from Yogi-yajfivalkya which are 
found in chapters 2, 8, 9 and 11 of the Br. Y. Y. Mr. Diwanji 
has not bean able to show that verses of the Y. Y. ( ed. by him ) 
are cited anywhere in the above three digests. Mr. Bhabatosh

smrti himself. Therefore, the Br. Y.Y. is an early work and cannot 
be assigned to a date later than the 7th century A. D. ; while Y. Y, 
is a much later compilation composed in the 8th or 9th century or 
even later. The present author is not, however, prepared to 
hold that Br. Y. Y. is the Yogasastra of Yaj. mentioned in Ysj 
smrti JH. 110, since the Yoga 4 material contained in it is meagre 
as compared with the Smrti material The present author is 
glad to find that on pp 7-8 of the Sanskrit Preface to the edition 
of the Brhad-Yogi-Yajnavalkya-smrti the editors express grave 
doubts about the identity of the author of the Yaj. smrti with the 
author of the work edited by them. 

The Yogavasistha is an extensive work in 32000 Slokos 
(one sloka meaning 32 syllables) printed in two volumes with a 
commentary by JLnandabodha by the Wirn. Press. It is really an 
eclectic work embodying 2311 the tenets of the Glta on anasaltt, 
the tenets of the Trika system of Kashmir, of Advaita Vedanta 
&c Its text appears to have been added to from time to time. 
Controversies have raged about its date and its contribution to 
Indian philosophy. The present writer holds on reading the 
contributions au that the extant Yogavasistha is a late work 
and was composed some time between the 11th and 13th 
century A. D. 

It is now necessary to furnish a brief outline of the main 
teachings of Y. S. Though the work is comparatively small, its 
rendering in English requires to be amplified in order that ft 
may be understandable. Only the most important and instruc- 
tive matters are set out here. 

Yoga is defined (2nd sutra) as the elimiriation of or 
mastery over the functions (activities) or fluctuations of the 
mind This is provisionally explained b y VySsa ( on I U j»

Sarnadhi. The different stage, vk (bhunns) of ^ J^/f JJJ 
( viksipta), one-pointed (ekagra ) and controlled ( niruddna ). 

Ib this connection ( i. e. on the topic of bhumis) the .present 
author has to bring to the notice of readers apaper by S to 
Kuvalayananda contributed to the Yogamimamsa vol. VI. Mo 4 
on 'Traditional reading of Pataffljala-yogasutra III .U ; is it 
accurate.' The traditional reading accepted by the bhasy a .of 
Vyasaandall other commentators is ' Sarvarthataikagratayob. 
ksayodayau cittasya samadhiparinamah \ The Svam^» argues 
that the correct reading should be « «» varthatailvrtliayo* &c 
He states that the bhumis should be six, the sixth hemg ek&rtha 
and bases his arguments on the combined explanations of <> o„a- 
sfltra I. 2-4, 18 and IH. 9-12. AH that the present miter can 
say is that his arguments deserve serious consideration. 1 he 
fact that even Vyasa, the bhasyakara of Yogasutra, would have 
to be held not to have seen the difficulties in the traditional 
reading of Y. S. HI. 11 would have to be given due weight bafore 
any final conclusion can be arrived at. That sutra states the goal 
of Yoga viz the soul that is seer abides in its own form then ( i e. 
when the functions of the mind have been mastered ), while in 
ordinary life the soul appears to assume the forms of the fluctua- 
tions of the mind. The Vrttis 2315 aTe five, some of which are

afflicted by hindrances called Mesas and the others are not so 

hindered (those that are hindered are to bo mastered or 

eliminated and the others are to be accepted). The fivo vrllis 

are pramam (means of valid knowledge), viparyaya (wrong 

conception), vikalpa (fancy), mdra (sleep), m6 smrti (memory). 

Pramanas are three, pratyaksa (perception), anamana (inference), 

aqama (verbal testimony). The means for the suppression of 

the vrttis are abhyasa (practice) and xauagya (passionlesBness) 

(simultaneously carried on), the first being the effort to secure 

a calm flow of the mind free from vrttis, continued for a long 

time uninterruptedly and earnestly and the latter ( vairagya) 

being the consciousness of mastery over ( i, e. freedom from 

thirst for) seen objects (such as woman, food* and drink, high 

position ) and objects promised by Revelation (such as heaven, 

disembodied existence &c. ), 23 " * Vairagya is of two kinds 

apara ( described in Y. S. 1. 15 just above) and para (highest) 

described in Y. S. I 16 and bhasya thereon. In the highest 

vatrSgya the yogin ( who has reached discrimination between 

the self and the gunas, sattva &c. ) is free from thirst not only 

for objects of sense, but also free from the gunas, attains a stag 6 

of undisturbed consciousness only and leads the yogin to reflect 

' I have attained what was to be attained, the Mesas (hindrances 

2316. According to the YogabbSsya on Y S. I 10 steep is » special 
positive idea or experience Ipratyaya) and not a mere absence of any 
activities or 6uctnalions of the mind, since when a man rises from sleep lie 
reflects ' I have slept well, my mind is happy and makes my intellect cleat 
and this reflection on waking would not be possible if there had beet i no 
experience < during sleep) of the cause of such a feeling. Just as in *<"'"•* 
one has to master other ideas {viz. misconception, fancy &c ), so i the 
has to master sleep also as a hindrance to the attainment of Saroadbf.

The Bhasya remarks 'the highest limit of consciousness 
(knowledge) is Vairagya and Kaivalya is inseparably 
connected with it.' Vacaspati states that this last is called 
' Dharmamegha-samadhi' (mentioned in Y. S IV. 23). Sutras 
17 and 18 of first pada deal respectively with samprajfiata- 
samadhi ( conscious concentration ) or salambanasamadhi and 
asamprajnata-saniadhi ( concentration in which there is no con- 
sciousness of objects, gross or subtle ). The first is of feur kinds 
(or of four stages) viz. savitaika ( deliberation over or realiza- 
tion of a gross object like Salagrama or the image of a god 
with four arms and the like ), saoicd.) a ( where there is reflection 
over a subtle object such as the lan-mati as), sananda where the 
reflection is on the mind which is full of sattvafthat is a 
samadhi of joy ) and sasmilat upa ( i. e where there is only a sense 
of personality in which the knower himself is the object of 
perception ). 2318 These four kinds lead on to the asamprajnata- 
samadhi, which results when all vrttis have disappeared, when 
there is persistant exercise of this state and the mind consists 
of sub-liminal impressions only. Sutras 19-51 (to the end of the 
first pada) deal with the different kinds of samadhi, the different 
ways of attainment, the position of Isvara in the Yoga system, 
the nine obstacles ( antaraya ) that cause distraction of the mind 
of the person who practises Yoga and the companions of these

obstacles, the means of preventing obstacles &c. such as practice 
of concentration on a single entity, the cultivation of friendliness, 
compassion, joy (towards holy men), indifference (towards 
unholy men) cr by pranayama. 

The Patanjalasutra ( in I. 19-23 ) divides yogina for 
asainprajnata-samadhi into various categories (nine in all), 
which are passed over here. Patafijali says that asamprajfista- 
samadbi in the case of yogins (who are not godB or not those 
whose bodies are resolved into primary matter) follows upon that 
practice which effects the cessation of all vrttis and which com- 
prises only subliminal consciousness and is preceded by faith, 
perfect repose or serenity, energy, mindfulness and discrimina- 
tory insight ( into what is real ) due to passionlessness. It would 
be noticed that so far Patanjali asks the aspirant for Yoga to 
rely on his own efforts, practice &c. He does not mention Goi 
or his grace anywhere so far. From this it follows that any man 
or woman and even one who is an agnostic may pursue yogio 
practices and attain to asamprajfiata-Bamadhi and liberation 
without devotion to God or without God's grace. But Patafijali 
as a keen psychologist knew tht> help that faith affords. Therefore, 
he provides that, if you believe in God, He will help you in the 
practice of Yoga and from that point of view he assigns to 
Isvara a role ol a limited scope. 

In Y. S. I. 23-28 Patafijali provides that Samadhi and 
liberation (the result of Samadhi) may also b e secured by "^

the results of actions or by hankerings, in whomtbeom MS ci- 
ence, that 1b only a germ ( in others ), is infinite ; He, being not 
limited by time, is the teacher of even the ancient teachers The 
mystic syllable (Om) is expressive of (i.e. representative or 
symbol of) God andja^a of that syllable and constant reflection 
upon the meaning of ' om' (i e. on Tsvara) leads to one-pomted- 
ness (ekagrata) of mind. Devotion to Tsvara secures for the 
practitioner attainment of right knowledge of the nature of the 
soul and the absence of hindrances {arilaraya) that distract the 
mind ( I. 29 ) These hindrances are nine such as illness, langour, 
doubt &c and they are also called Yogamala ( taints or blemishes 
of Yoga ), the enemies ( pmhpaksa ) of Toga. These hindrances 
are accompanied by pain, mental distress, tremor of the limbs, 
irregular inhalation and exhalation (I. 31 ). These jiistractions 
and their accompaniments that are the foes of samadhi may be 
prevented or mastered in various ways such as practice of con- 
centration on one entity (Isvara or the like), by the practice 
of such attitudes of mind as friendliness, compassion, cheerful- 
ness and indifference respectively towards the happy or the 
distressed, the good and the evil (1 33) or by the expulsion and 
retention of breath (bbasya uses the woTd 'pranayama' }. When 
the mind is concentrated then arise the four kinds of samprajfia- 
tasamadhi (called saiitarha &c. in I. 17). The knowledge that is 
gained in the last kind of samprajfiatasamadhi is of a higher 
order than what is obtained from scripture or inference and the 
subliminal impression made in this samadhi is hostile to all 
other impressions and when this last impression also is suppr- 
essed or removed, then results the seedless samadhi ( i. e. aaampr- 
njiiatasamadhi). In this last the mind itself ceases (from its 
task) and the yogin's soul abides in itself, shines forth in its

own light and is called pure, isolated and liberated.' 320 Isvarar- 
pranidhana does not lead to union with Isvara, but it enables 
the soul that is still bound to become what Isvara always is. In 
the Yogasutra there is very little about blialdi for God. 

Pada II. The first pada ends on the note of samadhi and 
liberation i. e. describes the Yoga for him who has succeeded in 
concentration. The 2nd pada deals with the procedure for a 
person whose mind is not used to concentration but is restless, 
infatuated or distracted ( vyutthita ) M21 and who is desirous of 
learning the technique. This pada is the most important of all 
the four padas for modern students, either Indian or Western, 
and has exerted groat influence on Dharma&Sstra works The 
fundamental idea of Yoga is that the individual self is real, 
otornal and pure, but it is immersed in the objeotive world and, 
though oternal, pursues transient objects. Pataujali is a master 
psychologist. The goal being set ( viz how to secure the isola- 
tion of the soul from avidija and the gtnias and its attainment 
of its own pure nature) Y. S. prescribes a rigorous discipline for 
the attainment of the goal. Pataiijali differs from many modern 
Western psychologists (like Freud) 232z in two very fundamental 
matters The first is that Pataiijali puts all empliasis at his 
command on the freedom and liberation of the soul from bond- 
age, prescribes restraint of the activities of the mind as the

2322 Freud gives the name " libido' to the energy of the sexual 
instinct, while Jung, who was once a disciple of Freud, diverged from Frond, 
holds it as applicable to all forms of mental, psycho-physical or conativc 
energy. The theory of the Oedipus complex is the central core of the 
Freudian system. It appears that Freud later in life modified his theory of 
the Oedipus complex and, though he assumed that the Oedipus complc\ is 
present in every infant, he came to hold that in the course of normal 
development the complex becomes eradicated in early childhood. Vide 'An 
outline of abnormal psychology 'by W.Macdougall (London, cd. of 1952) 

p. 418. 

Prof J B.Watson propounded the theory of •Behaviourism' (vide 
the work so called, London, 1925), which denies the existence of mind or 
mental traits, dispositions or tendencies On this view the subject matter 
of psychology is not mmd but the behaviour or acUvit.es of the human 
being and the concept of.instincts on which most psycholog.sls dwell at 
length becomes meaningless.

means and several preliminary steps of the training of ordinary 
emotions and will, while several modern psychologists condemn 
repression of the mind. In the 2nd place Pataiijali is a firm 
heliever in the doctrine of karma and rebirth and ( in II. 13-15 ) 
holds that even good actions that give rise to a future life of 
pleasure and happiness are a misery to the enlightened, while 
modern psychologists speak of severalinnate instinots and are 
not at all agreed on what the3Q are, they do not tackle the 
problem of karma and rebirth and their relation to what they 
call instincts If there is no pre-existince of the soul as Christians 
and many others believe, how do the human mshncts arise? There 
is hardly any convincing or satisfactory explanation of this. 

The first sutra (of pada II) says that the activities or 
practices that are preliminaries to the attainment of Yoga are 
tapas 3323 (austerity), bvadhynya and devotion to Isvara; these,

asceticism (or tapas) appeared among Indians earlier than among any other 

known people. In Rg X. 190 1 it is stated that right and troth and the 

sun and the moon and the universe are born of tapas. In Rg X 109.4 

the seven sages are said to have sat down for tapas In Rg. X 136. 2 

sages (mums) having long hair and wearing dirty yellowish clothes are said 

to roam over paths. In the Sat Br. VI 1 1. 13 and Ait. Br XI 6. 4 it is 

indicated that tapas like Yajha would give everything. The Upanisads 

(e g, Tat Up III 5 ■ tapasa brahma vijijnasasva', Br. Up IV. 4. 22) 

emphasize that tapas is one of the means of realising brahma Chan, Up 

II. 23 postulates tapas as the 2nd of three dharmaskandhas . The Ap Dh. 

S. 1. 2 5,1 holds that the strict observances laid down for a Vedic student 

are called tapas (fshjftg 3015155.). Gautama Dh. S 19. 15 provides that 

sexual parity, truthfulness, bathing three times in the day, wearing a wet 

garment, sleeping on the sacrificial ground and fast are austerities. Manu 

X 70 provides that even three pranayamas are the highest tapas for all 

brahmauas provided they are performed according to prescribed rules and 

are accompanied by the seven vyahHis and pranava Manu (XI, 234-244) 

contains a grand eulogy of tapas. verse 238 states 'everything can be

when resorted to, serve for the culti ration of samadhi and for 
minimising the klesas, which are avidya (nescience which is 
the field that produces the other four ), asmita ( the feeling of 
personality), raga (attachment to pleasures), dvesa (aversion, 
that dwells angrily on pain and its causes) and abhmivesa ( will 
to live or clinging to life ). Tapas is explained by Vyasabhasya 
( on Y. S. IT. 32) as bearing or enduring the pairs (of opposites) 
such as hunger and thirst, cold and heat, standing and sitting, 
stillness of a stump ( i. e. not indicating what is passing m 
one's mind even by gestures }, stillness of the body (not speaking 
at all), and also such observances as Krcohra, Candrayana and 
Santapana (vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 120 and 132, 134-137, 151 
respectively for krechra &o. ).

target &e ), Prasna Up. V. 5 ( Yah punar-etam trimatrenomity- 
etenaivaksarena paTam purusam-abhidhyaylta). The T. S. 
borrows this importance of Om froin the TJpanisads. The five 
Mesas are defined in Y. S. II. 5-9. Avidya (ignorance) 2325 
consists in regarding the non-eternal as eternal, the impure as 
pure, pain as pleasure, the non-self as the self. Asmita ( sense of 
personality ) consists in the seer ( the self ) being, held as if 
identical with the instruments of seeing ( such as mind and sense 
organs). Abhinivesa (clinging to life) means the craving 
('May I not cease to live, may I live') which sweeps on by its 
own force and is established in this form even among the learned, 
tsvarapranidhana has been explained above (p. 1412 note 2319 ). 
The Y. S. (H. U and 13) says that the fclesas have subtile con- 
ditions (viz. avidya and asmita ) and coarse effects in the form of 
vrttis ( the fluctuations of the mind, raga, dvesa and abhinivesa ) ; 
escape from the former is secured by resolving them by means 
of real knowledge while the coarse ones are controlled by 
contemplation (dhyana). The accumulated deposits of Karma 
arise from the five Mesas, aTe fit to be experienced in the seen 
birth { that is in the present birth ) and in an unseen ( i. e. future ) 
birth. So long as the root (viz the klesas) exists the accumulated 
karma leads to fruition in three forms viz. birth, life (longer 
short) and experience, which three result in giving joy or

anguish according as tha accumulation is due to meritorious or 
evil acta. The Yogasulra says that the Yoga system has, just 
like the system of medicine,^*" four divisions or aspects, viz 
samara (the round of births or transmigration), the cause of 
samsara, the release from samsara, the means of release (viz. 
samyak-darlana, insight into reality or discriminating discern-' 
ment between the purusa and sattva, unassailed by false know- 
ledge); sutras 16-37 of the Snd pada set out these four and 
explain some of the terms used in defining them. Sutra 28 
provides that when impurities are washed away by practising 
the angas of Yoga, the knowledge shines forth (more and more) 
till discriminatory discernment becomes perfect. Then sutra 2316 29 
enumerates the eight afigas (aids, or auxiliaries) of Yoga, viz. 
yama (abstinences), niijama (observances), asana (bodily 
posture ), pranayama ( control or regulation of breath ), pratyahara 
(withdrawal or suppression of the organs of sense), dharanS 
( fixed attention ), dhyana ( meditation or contemplation ), 
samadhi (concentration or absorption into the objeot of medita- 
tion). The Vaikhanasasmartasutra enumerates the same eight

Yamas and myamas defined and e tplained 1419 

angas of Yoga. The remaining sutras of pada two ( from 30 to 
55 ) deal with the enumeration and definitions of yamas and 
niyamas, their explanations and the treatment of asana, 
pranayama and pratyahara. The Santiparva ( 304.7 == 316.7 of 
Ch. ed.) speaks of Yoga as ' astagunita' or astagunin). Out 
of the eight angas the first five are indirectly useful for samadhi, 
because they eradicate what are opposed to samadhi (such as 
himsa, asatya &c ), and are therefore called bahirafiga (external, 
indirect ) sadhanas ( means ) of Yoga, while dharana, dhyana 
and samadhi are said to be antaranga to Yoga ( Y. S. HI. 7, 
' trayam-antarangam purvebhyah '. The last three are dealt 
with in the 3rd pada. It is these sutras in the 2nd pada that 
are emphasized and elaborated in Dharmasastra works. Therefore 
some detailed treatment of these matters is needed here. 

In some works, such as the Goraksasamhita the angas of 
yoga are said to be only six (omitting yama and niyama 
or omitting some others). The MaitrayanI Up. (VI. 18), 
the Dhyanabindu Up. the Atri-smrti XL 6, Daksa VII. 34, 
Skandapurana, Kaslkhanda, 41. 59 and Buddhists say the 
same. Manu 2337 provides (IV. 204) 'a wise man should always 
practise yamas but not the myamas always, one who only 
practises niyamas and does not practise yamas incurs sin 
(or falls into hell)*. This does not mean that niyamas are 
forbidden but it means only this that yamas are far more im- 
portant than niyamas. The words 'yama' and' niyama' both 
occur in the Santiparva (cr. ed. 326. 15 and 339 16 of Ch. ed.). 
Some Smrtis omit them from the angas of yoga probably 
because they are prescribed for all persons in general by Manu, 
Yaj. and others. Manu does not enumerate yamas and niyamas, 
but Yaj ( quoted on p 1406, n. 2303 above ) enumerates ten 
yamas and ten niyamas. The five yamas 2328 of the Y. S. are

( truthfulness )_, a** f non-stealing i. a not approbating 
otban fhiagB m a way not sanctioned by the Sastra), b,al,ma- 
carm (i. e. control of the organ of generation while guarding the 
other organs of sense also), apangraha (non-acceptance of anything 
from another beyond what is necessary for preserving the body) 
Ihese five constitute for a yogin a great vrata when practised 
wiUunrt reference to species, place, time and occasions (or 
exigencies ). As provided by Manu, yamas have to be observed by 
all but there are exceptions. The observance of yamas would be 
called vrata, but the rigorous observance of yamas without 
allowing exceptions is called by the Y. S. ma!,nv>ata which 
has to be observed by yogins without exception at all stages. 
The observance of yamas and niyamas is a first step ior the soul's 
ultimate success in winning Liberation or Isolation (kaivalya), 
since, unless the soul is purged of all sexual and egoistic 
desires, it cannot live the divine or spiritual life that the higher 
stages of yoga require. What is meant may be briefly exem- 
plified as follows: Smrtis recognize some exceptions to all these 
in the case of ordinary people. For example, it is the ksatnya's 
duty to figbt and therefore it was provided by Manu ( VU 87, 89) 
that a ksatriya should not run away from battle and that 
ksatriyas fighting and dying in battle on both sides went to 
heaven. Vide Yaj, I. 324. So himsa was allowed to a ksatriya 
but if he wanted to follow the Yoga discipline he had to give up 
himsa. Similarly, Smrtis excused untruth on five occasions 
(vide Gautama 23. 89, Vasistha 16 36, Adiparva 83 16, SSnti- 
parva 34. 25 and 165. 30, quoted in H of Dh vol III. p 353 and 
notes 536, 537) Manu in IV. 138 makes an exception for 
ordinary men viz one should not speak what though true is 
painful to another ( na bruyat satyamapriyam). But one who 
enters on the discipline of Yoga must always speak the truth 
except when speaking the truth would result in the ruin of

creatures 2329 The Mitaksara on "Yaj III 312 remarks that 
telling a falsehood in the case of arranging a marriage though 
excused (by smrtis) Bhould be avoided and also the beating of 
a son or a pupil as punishment by one who observes a vrata. 
A householder who approaches his wife on certain specified days 
after her monthly illness and avoids the parvan days { vide H. 
of Dh. vol. HI n 1425 ) is to be regarded as one observing 
brahmacarya, ace. to Yaj 1/79 and Manu IV. 138, but if he 
takes to the path of Yoga, he would have to give up this latitude 
( vide note 2308, S330 above ) and avoid all contact whatever with 
all women including his own wife as the LingapurSna empha- 
sizes The Yuktidlpika, one of the earliest commentaries on the 
Sankhyakarika, mentions (on p. 112) five yamas but puts 
'akalkata' (absence of crookedness) as the 5th instead of 
apangraha. The Visnupurana ("VI. 7. 36-37) enumerates five 
yamas and five niyamas as in Y. S. but substitutes 'mind bent 
on the highest biahma' (kuivlta biahmani tatha parasmin 
pravanammanah)for ' Isvaiapranidhana '. The five niyamas 
according to Y S. IL 32 233r are sauca (cleanliness), santosa 
(contentment), tapas (austerity), svadhyaya (study of Veda), 
Uvaiapiawdhana (devotion to God, or surrendering all actions 
to him). Three of the five niyamas, viz. tapas, svadhyaya and 
Isvarapranidhana constitute knyayoga as already stated in 
Y. S. II. 1. It is most difficult to give an objective definition of 
duty, but duties can be defined on the subjective side. The 
object of emphasizing duties is to make men rise above lower 
desires and to make the higher self shine forth. These are

basod mora or loss on the Upanisads; vido e. g. Chan. Up. III. 
17. 4 whoro tnfias, ahtinsa, truthfulness, dana, (charity) and 
Tii jam (straightforwardness) arc put forward as virtues to bo 
cultivated by a sacrificor, Bi. Up. V. 2.3. whoro all mon are askod 
lo cultivate davia (self-restraint), dana (charity), dai/ii (kindness). 
Thoroforo, tho yamas proscribod by the Yogast\tra constitute 
wliat may bo called oxtra-regarding dutieH and aro mostly in tho 
nature of prohibitions ( such as ' don't injure anyone, don't tell 
a lie, don't rob a person, don't accopt gifts'), while tho niyamas 
aro concerned with the individual himself ( who has embarked 
on Yoga practice ) and are of a positive character ( viz. bo 
clean, be contented, bo austere, do study tho Voda and be a 
devotee of IsvaTa ). Tho Amarakosa 23n defines 'yama' as 
actions that aro obligatory (or to be always porformod) and 
that dopolid upon tho body as the means for being carried out, 
while niyamas aro acts that are not obligatory ( or not to bo 
continuously engaged in) and that depend ( for carrying them 
out) on means that aro outsido the body (such as water &o). 
Sanca (cloanliness) is of two kinds, bahya ( of tho body effeoted 
with water, loose oarth, paficagavya, pure food &c.) and 
tSbhuantai a ( internal or mental ). Vido H. of Dh. vol, H. pp. 651- 
52 and -vol. IV. pp. 310-311 for details of the sauca of both kinds. 
A verso of Manu (V. 106) desorves to be noted 2533 m this 
connection viz 'of all kinds of sauca the highest is the one that 
relates to wealth (onomust desire wealth without depriving 
another of his wealth by improper means ) , that man is sua 
(pure) who is pure as to wealth and not he who is purified by 
loose earth and water.' Sutras 33-34 of p*da II provide that 
whon the practitioner of Yoga is assailed by the outbreak of the 
fever of perverse thoughts (such as * I shall kill him who has 
harmed mo', *I shall tell a he, I shall appropriate another s 
wealth, I shall commit adultery with another's wife'), he should 
revolve in his mind and cultivate the opposites of such thoughts 
and dwell on tho consequences of such thoughts, viz. they cause 
endless suffering and lack of right knowledge. Yama and

Pama and nJvama ethical code for yogin W® 

niyama constitute the preliminary ethical code *J 
aspirant for yoga must observe and some part of it must to 
followed by all men as Manu and YSj. prescribe. 

In 8 utras35to45 ( of ptfe It) the results ^ &e f 00 ° ti ™ 
practice of the several yamas and niyamas are set out viz. wnen 
the aspirant has become established in ahimsa, all beings (men 
and animals) give up enmity** in Ms presence When the 
aspirant for Yoga is well grounded in the practice of abstinence 
from falsehood Ms speech comes out to be effective unfailingly 
(that is, if he says to a person « be you a righteous man at 
•may you attain heaven ', the man becomes righteous or attains 
svarga). When he becomes rooted in abstinence from theft all 
jewels wait upon him from all quarters (that is, though he may 
not hanker after riches or means, the latter come to him of their 
own accord). When the Yogin is firmly fixed in brahmacarya,^ 3 
he secures energy (whereby he treads the path to such super- 
normal powers as anima ) and when he reaches perfection he is 
able to transfer knowledge about Yoga and its angas to Ma 
disciples. InY. S 1.20 it is stated that asampiajfiata-samSdhi 
follows when the yogin has faith, vuya (energy) and. other 
qualities. The greatest emphasis is laid on chastity in thought, 
word and dead for the yogin or the seeker for brahma (vide 
Mundaka HI. 1. 5, " aatyena labbyas-tapasa hyesa atma samyag- 
iaanenabTahmacaryenanityam'). The idea is that the yogin 
makes very rapid progress towards the final goal of samadht and 
/cattali/a if he is thoroughly chaste and that without it the 
practice of rajayoga is futile and dangerous. Those interested 
in the importance of 'brahmacaiya' should read MaMtmg 
Gandhi's 'self-restraint versus self-indulgence' ( 3rd ed. 1928 ), 
particularly the Appendix I pp. 13?-1S8 which reproduce W. L. 
Hare's article). When the yogin is firmly established in non-

acceptance of gifts he has a desire to know his past, present and 
future hves (and receives illumination thereon ). 

As a result of having to clean »* one's body theYogin 
becomes disgusted with his own body and avoids contact with the 
bodies of others. Other results of cleanliness (of the mud) that 
arise are the purity of nUvagmu ( i. e. not being assailed by rajas 
and lamas), gentleness, one-pointedness (of the mind), mastery 
over the senses and fitness for the sight (realization) of the Self 
tfrom contentment results w Baprem9 happiness. Tapas gives 
risers to perfection in the body (i. e. acquisition of some occult 
powers like anima ) and perfection as to the sense organs (such 
as being able to hear and to see what is distant) owing to the 
eradication of impurities (i. e. the hleSas and sin); (continuous) 
study of the Veda ( and japa of om &c. ) leads on to the union 
with (realization of ) the deity he chooses. Brom devotion to 
Isvara results perfection m Samadhi. 

Asana (bodily posture) 2339 is defined in Y S. as one that 
is stable and easy (or comfortable). Asana means a seat which 
is covered with kusa grass, deer-skin and a garment in that 
order ( this would be bahya asana ) as laid down in Gita (VI. 11 ),

J&sanas in yogasastra 1425 

while the word asana (in Yoga) means bodily posture. It should 
be noticed that the Yogasutra does not expressly prescribe any 
of the numerous asanas mentioned and defined in the Hatha- 
yogapradlpika and other works on Hathayoga and indicates 
that those asanas are not necessary in the practice of the 
Patanjala Yoga and that any posture which is easy, stable and 
comfortable would be enough for the yogin. The Y. S. here 
follows the Sv. TJp. (II. 8 and 10 ) and not the works on Hatha- 
yoga, if any existed in its times. In order to secure the posture 
described above the yogin should relax the usual physical 
movements of the body (prayatnasaithilya) and bring the mind 
to reflect on the Infinite (brahma). As a result of perfect 
mastery over posture, he is not overwhelmed (or overcome) 
by the pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold, hunger 
and thirst). 

A few words must be said about asanas. The present author 
recommends to all those interested in asanas a very useful and 
instructive handbook ( in 188 pages) on * asanas' composed and 
published by Sri Kuvalayananda of the KaivalyadhSma at 
Lonavla near Poona (third impression in 1949) with 81 plates 
(78 on different asanas and 3 on nauh). The Daksasmrti 
(VII. 5) mentions Padmasana and Yaj. in HI. 198 appears to 
allude to it. Dr. K. T. Behanan on ' Yoga, a scientific evaluation * 
inserts 16 figures (between pp. 186-187 ) of several asanas. 
Though the Y. S. does not mention any asawa by name yet the 
Vyasabhasya" 10 names ten and indicates by the word ' adi '

Supreme Self may be promoted) in the Bhagavadglta, which itself 
is described aa Yogasastra and each chapter of which is also 
called Toga. For example, we have in the Glta ' abhyasayoga ' 
( 8. 8, 12. 9 ), karmayoga (3. 3. and 7 ), jnanayoga ( 3. 3.). bhakti- 
yoga (14 26 ). A few other works also do the same. Some "Western 
writers speak of several kinds of Yoga such as Mantrayoga, 
Jfianayoga, Bhaktiyoga, Karmayoga, Rajayoga and Hathayoga 
( vide ' Bengal Lancer ' by F. Yeats-Brown, London, 1930, p. 284 ), 
E O Oman's ' The Mystics, ascetics and saints of India ' p. 173 
( ed. of 1905 ), Geraldine Coster's ' Yoga and Western psychology ' 
p. 10, Alain Danielou's work pp. 83 ff. (for descriptions of 
Mantrayoga, Layayoga, Kundalinlyoga' &e. ). Some late Sans- 
krit works like the Yogatattvopanisad M and Sivasamhita 
(5. 9) speak of four Yogas viz Mantrayoga, Hathayoga, Laya- 
yoga and Rsjayoga. All these have in view the system of 
Patafijali, but each emphasizes some particular aspect of yoga 
discipline. But there sts really only two main systems of Yoga, 
viz. the one expounded in the Yogasutra and its bhasya by Vyasa 
and the other dealt with in such works as the Goraksasataka, 
the Hathayogapradipika of Svatmararaa-yogin 234 * with the 
commentary called Jyotsna by Brahmananda. Briefly, the 
difference between the two is that the Yoga of Patafijali con- 
centrates all effort on the discipline of the mind, while Hatha- 
yoga mainly concerns itself with the body, its health, its purity 
and freedom from diseases. This is illustrated by the facts that 
Patafijali defines asana as any posture that is 'sthirasukha', 
while works on Hathayoga describe many asanas like Mayur- 
asana, Kukkutesana, SiddhSsana, which are deemed to remove

diseases (1.31) and which are said to be 84 (for the names 
of the 84 asanas vide pp. 146-149 of Danielou's work) and 
Hathayoga deals with such processes 2345 as Dhauti (washing 
the stomach), Basti (yogic enema) and Jtfauli (shaking the 
abdomen) about which Patanjali is silent. Hathayoga, if 
practised with proper guidance and perseverance, will not only 
endow a man with a strong, healthy, pure and active body but 
also may develop inner strength and happiness. The technique 
of Hathayoga claims three kinds of results viz ( 1 ) cure of 
diseases and disorders of the mind also; (2) attainment of 
supernatural powers called siddhis; (3) leading to ESjayoga and 
Kaivalya. The Hathayogapradipika itself states that Hathayoga

several years, generally once a week (or oftener). He can say from personal

York, 2nd impression, 1945 This author travelled over the whole of India, 
settled down at a guru's retreat in the hill near Ranchi, and went to Tibet 
also at his guru's bidding The book contains 36 photographs, 28 of which 
represent various asanas, VII, XXVI-VII of Mahamudra, Vajrohmudra 
and Faanlmudra, XXXII and XXXIII represent the first and second stages 
of Uddiyana-bandha and Nos XXXIV-VI represent Nauli-madhyama, Nauli-

Another recent work is * The Yoga of Health, Youth and Joy ' (a treatise on 
Hatha-yoga adapted to the West ) by Sir Paul Dukes (Cassell, London 1960) 
This is a very useful book, contains about seventy excellent photographs and 
is written with great moderation after long personal practice The author 
was engaged for years in lecturing to the army on the usefulness of yoga

Relation of itathayoga to Bajayoga 14#9 

is expounded only foi leading on to Rajayoga 2346 i. e. Bajayoga 

is the principal fruit of Hathayoga and not siddhis and Kaivalya 

i3 due to Rajayoga. The Hathayogapradlpika enumerates the 

names of the same eight angas as Patafyali does, but its yamax 

are ten of which taking a light meal is the principal and ahimsa 

is the first among niyamas. Besides the eight angas, it deals 

specially with Mahamudra, Khecarl, Jalandhara, Uddiyana and 

Mulabandha, Vajroll, Amaioli and Sahajoli ( I. 26-27 ). The 

Hathayogapradlpika (I. 5-8) mentions that Hathayoga started 

from Adinatha (i. e. Siva) and then enumerates 35 great siddhas 

in all from Matsyendranatha, Goraksanatha onwards. The 

famous exposition of the Bhagavadgita. by Jfianadeya called 

Jfianesvarl cites at the end the GuruparampaTa as Adinatha, 

Matsyendranatha, Goraksanatha, Gahinlnatha, Nivrttinatha, 

Jfianadeva. 

There are other differences between the works on Hathayoga 
and the Patafijala Yoga According to the Goraksasataka and 
H. Y. P. the main aim of asana and pranayama is to rouse the 
EundalinI ( the vital force in a person slumbering at the base of 
the spine coiled like a snake) and take it through the several 
cakras and the Susumnanadi to brahmadvara, while the Y. S. 
hardly ever dilates upon chakras and nadis 33w Several people 
after reading some modern works on Kundalim are tempted to 
make efforts to rouse the Kundalinl. This is a dangerous experi- 
ment. Shri Purohit Swami in his ' Aphorisms of Yoga' states

that the awakening of the KundalinI is a terrifying experience, 
that on the first day on which the EundalinI was awakened, the 
whole body was as it were on fire and he thought that he was 
dying and that he drank in three months gallons of milk and 
clarified butter and ate all the leaves on two nimba trees (pp. 
57-58 of the translation). The germ of the doctrine of nadls 
in Tantras is found in a verse occurring in Katha Up. VI. 16 
and Chan. Up. VIII. 6. 6 'there are hundred and one nadls 
(arteries) of the heart; one of them penetrates the (crown of) 
head; moving upwards by it, one attains immortality; the 
others ( of the nadls ) serve for departing in various directions,' 
The Prasna Up. (Hf. 6-7) states that each of 101 nadls has 
72 sub-nadls, each of which again has 1000 more. Vide 
Mundaka Up. II. 2. 6. In Chan. Up. VIII. 6. 1 it is stated that 
the nadls of the heart consist of a subtle substance, brown, 
white, blue, yellow or red in colour. This is probably the germ 
of the statement of a nSdl being called pingala. The Maitra- 
yanl Up. VI. 21 speaks of the nadl going upwards as Susumna, 

The Vlsnupurana mentions Bhadrasana 3318 which passage is 
quoted by Vacaspati. The Puranas, Vayu ( 11. 13 ), Markandeya 
(36. 28 ), Kurma (II. 11. 43 ), Linga (I. 8. 86 ), Garuda (1 238.11) 
mention the same three asanas, viz. Svastika, Padma and 
Ardhasana. The Visnudharmottara-purana ( lit 283. 6 ) pres- 
cribes for dliyana the asanas called Svastika, Sarvatobhadra, 
Kamala (Padma) and Paryanka. The Bbagavata III. 28.8 
employs the same words as the Gits VI. 11 about asana (viz. 
' sucau dese pratisthapya). 

; Asanas are of two kinds, one type being helpful for prana- 
yama, meditation and concentration, such as Padma, Siddha 
and Svastika (figure 20 p. 59 in Sri Kuvalayananda's handbook 
on 'Asanas' ). The other kind of asanas are helpful in eradicat- 
ing diseases and for physical culture. But most of them i 1 u "^ 
different physical movements and the final form assumed by 
these postures would make deep meditation difficult, if not 
impossible (vide SIrsasana figures .24-27 between pp. 62-63 of 
Sri Kuvalayananda's Handbook on Asanas), Sarvangasana 
(figures 33-36) of the same work, Halasana (fig. 42-47 of the 
saS, Viparitakarani (figures 77-78 pp. 121-123), Mayurasana

What is prope) asana 1431 

, 109 ). The Tejobindu Upanisad I 23 (Adyar ed )' aii 
holds ' that alone is (proper) asana which makes continuous 
meditation on brahma possible; other postures only lead to dis- 
comfort ' It should not be supposed that one who seeks higher 
yogic disciplines must devote some time to asanas and then 
pass on to the next stage. The asanas ate primarily meant for 
physical culture and eradication of diseases. If the individual 
yogin possesses a tolerably sound body he may proceed with 
pranayama and other angas. Besides the postures, the practi- 
tioner of Yoga is asked to gaze steadily at the tip of his nose 
(Gits VI. 13). 

Some regulations are prescribed about the food to be taken 
or avoided by a seeker after Toga and about the places where he 
is to practise. The Santiparva 2350 of the Mahabharata provides 
that the yogin should subsist on cooked small particles of grains, 
or oilcakeB and should avoid oily substances and even when 
subsisting on yavaka (i. e. kuhnasa or cooked barley grains) for 
long, he would still be strong; he should drink water and milk 
mixed together and should resort to caves. The Markandeya- 
purana (q by Krtyakalpataru on Moksa pp. 167-177 ) states 
'The yogin should begin meditation in unoccupied spots, in 
forests, caves and should avoid practising Yoga in noisy places, 
near fire and water, in old oowsheds, where four rpads meet' 
near a heap of dried leaves, on a river bank, in a cemetery or 
m a place where creeping creatures exist, in a dangerous place 
near a well, near a caitya (funeral ground) or an anthill ' The 
same purana says that he should not practise when his stomach is 
windy, or he is hungry or tired or when disturbed in mind, nor 
when it is very cold or hot or windy. The DevalaDharmasfitra an

1433 Htstoiv of marmaiaslra [Sec. VIH,Gh.XXXIl 

prescribes that a yogin should practise meditation in a shrine, 
empty house, mountain cave, on the sands of a river, in caves, 
or in a forest, in a pure spot free from danger. H. Y. P. I 61 
and 64 prescribe what foods to avoid and what foods may be 
eaten. The Goraksasataka 2352 prescribes that the yogin should 
give up pungent, sour and salted food and should subsist on milk 
diet. The Glta (VI. 16-17) says 'one cannot succeed in Yoga 
who eats too much nor one who observes total fast and Yoga 
removes pain for him who takes proper food and exercise. 
The Chan. IJp. (VII 26.2) where Sanatkumara gives instruc- 
tion to Narada about the Eeality remarks 'Purity of the 
mind follows on purity of food &o. (aharasuddhau sattva- 
suddhih' &c). Apararka on Yaj. 1. 154 quotes a long prose 
passage ( on p. 221 ) from Harita " one should be pure and should 
subsist on a limited quantity of food that would be enough or 
useful for his purpose as the acaryas say 'purity of mind 
...food". It is clear that Harita takes the words ' aharasuddhau 
&c. ' literally, while Sankaracarya in his bhasya on Chan takes 
Shara to mean ' experience of objects of sense such as Sabda'. 

Pranayama— It is this anga of Yoga that figures most in the 
works on Dharmasastra from the earliest times. Literally the 
word means 'restraint or pause of prana'. Other synonymous 
words are 'pranasamyama' (note 2310) and 'pranasamrodTia'. 
The important point is: What does 'Prana' mean here. 
The word is derived from the root 'an' (to breathe) with the 
prefix «pra\ The verb and its forms occur in the Egveda 
as in 1.101.5, X. 131 3, X. 135.4. In various passages of 
theftg. prana means simply 'breath' (as in 1. 66.1, m. 53. 21, 
X. 69. 6 ). In Rg X. 90. 13 (pranad-vayur-ajflyata) it is stated 
that Vayu (air, wind) arose from the prana of the primeval 
purusa. The word ' asu ' also is used in the Rgveda in «»«»■■ 
of 'prana' in I 113. 16 (udhirdhvam jlvo asur-na agat),I M*.* 
We have both prUnana (breath ) and jlvana (life) in Rg. V» 8 £

Pedic reference to five pranas 1433 

names of pranas appear in pairs as in the nota ss below from 
Tai. S. In the Tai. S. 1. 7. 9. 2 occur the three words 'prana, 
apana and vyana'. The Atharvaveda (inVULl. 1) mentions 
'pranah' and 'apanah' in the plural and ' asu ', 'prana' and 
*ayuh' in YIIL 1.3, all probably meaning 'life'. In the 
Upanisads, prana becomes the vital force or principle of all 
beings, the representative or symbol of brahma; vide Br. Up. I 
6. 3 (Prano va amrtam, namaTupB satftam, tabhyam-ayam 
pranaschannah), Br. Up. 1. 5. 23, which, after quoting a verse that 
the sun rises from Prana and sets in Prana, goes on to say 
(tasmadekam-eva vratam caret, pranySc-caiva-apanyacea, 
nen-ma papma nirtyur-apnavad-iti ) * therefore one must 
observe only one vow, he should inhale and exhale with the 
(fearful) thought that otherwise, the Evil one, Death, might seize 
me'. Here it appears that we have the germ of the theory of the 
importance of pranayama. In Chan. Up. V. 18-24 it is stated 
tbat the five ahutis are offered to prana, vyana, apana, samana 
and udana( in the words •Pranaya svaha' &c ) at the time of 
a meal and that one who knows the true meaning of Agnihotra 
and offerings offers it in all worlds, in all beings and in all selves. 
Even now these ahutis are taken before meals by biahmanas, only 
the order of the five differs, Prasna II, 13 says :— * All this that is 
established in the three worlds is under the dominance of Prana.' 
In Chan. Up IV. 3. 3 Prana is again given five names on 
account of its working in the different parts of the human body 
viz. prana, apana, vyana, samana and udana (all five being 
named m the Tai. S.). It follows that some distinction among 
the operation of the five pranas must have been made at least 
a thousand years before the Christian era.

only mean 'inhaling'; hut that expression is capable of mean- 
ing * it draws the aii into the inside of the body ( i e. in the 
abdomen) and what is more important, one has to note that the 
interpretation put on Sankara's words here by Caland, Dumont 
and others is directly opposed to Sankaracarya's own explana- 
tions in several other passages of the Upanisads, such as Br. Up. 
I. 5 3, HT. 4. 1, Chan Up. Ill 13. 1-6, Katha 5. 3; Prasna HI. 
4-5 ( vide note 2353 ). The bhasya on Br. Up. I. 5. 3 23SS remarks 
' Prana is an activity of the heart which moves about in the 
mouth and nose and is so called because it is led forth ; Apana 
is a downward movement starting from the navel and is so 
called because it casts out urine and excreta'. On Prasna Up. 
111. 4 (quoted in n. 3353 ) the Sankarabhasya says the same thing 
about Prana and Apana. Not only Sankaracarya but a much 
earlier authority viz the Dharmasutra of Devala (mentioned 
by Sankara, vide p. 1353 n. 3208 above) defines the working of 
Prana and Apana as done by Sankaracarya in his bhasya on 
Br. Up. 1. 5. 3. 

In the Yoga system ( which is based on the Upanisads ) prana 
implies more than mere breath. It means vital energy, powers 
such as speech, eye, ear, manas in the body as well as in different 
forms m the universe. Its most perceptible manifestation in the 
human body is the movement of the lungs. The Y. S. inculcates 
on the yogic student the doctrine that by scientific control ( as 
hid down in ,t) of prana in the body it is possible to obtain 
control over the deep-seated (and ordinarily imperceptible) 
forces ia human consciousness as well as in the external world

aiid that if a Vodio student chances to see an impure person like 
aCandala, ho Bhould, after performing one Pranayama, look at

pranayamas as expiation for sovcral lapses. 

The abovo examples show that in the times of tho Sutras 
(i. o. several centuries before tho Christian era) the conception 
of pranayama had been so developed as to hold that it was a sort 
of penance and religious rite for removing tho taint attaching 
to acts and omissions that wore condemned by the then society. 
At this stage pranayama appears merely to have boon a religiouB 
act independent of any theory about its being one of the eight 
angas of yoga. 

To tho five pranas mentioned in Vedic literature, the 
Puranas and other medieval works added five more pranas with 
different 2359 names.

Pranayama explained in yoga-sutra 1437 

Its is now proper to see how the Y. S. defines and explains 
pranayama. 'When the stability of posture has been assured 
(or secured) pranayama is the pause (lit, cutting off) in the 
movements of inhalation and exhalation'. The bhasya explains 
' svasa' as ' drawing in of the air which is outside one's body ' 
and 'prasvasa' as the expelling of the air in the trunk (or chest)' 
and the absence of both these is pranayama. This shows that 
the chief element in pranayama is the absence of both inhalation 
and exhalation i. e. kumbhaka in the technical language of yoga 
works The next sutra states that pranayama (the pause in 
movement) is of three kinds, viz. external, internal and 
suppressed. The idea is that Kumbhaka ( stopping or pause ) 
may be done after one has taken in air from outside (first kind) 
or after one has expelled air from the trunk ( 2nd kind) or when 
one is in a normal condition (i. e. neither making an effort to 
fill his chest with air or emptying it of air) one may make a 
pause (3rd kind). Each of these may be regulated and considered 
from the point of the units of space, time (measurement by 
Mas or matras) and numbers. Pranayama is called mrdu (mild) 
when pause is kept up for 36 matras, then moderate one when 
kept up for 72 matras and keen (tivra) when kept up for 108 
matras. When practised for days, fortnights and months, it is 
called protracted and when performed with great skill it is called 
suksma ( subtle ). 

In connection with pranayama we must look to T S. I 34 
also. That sutra lays down that for securing the undisturbed 
calm of the mind one remedy is the expulsion and retention of 
the breath *« I appears from that sutra and its btasya that 
vidhu,a,m (retention of breath, i. e. Kumbhaka) is pranayama.

to the time required for pronouncing a short vowel and this was 
called vilit) Ti The time taken for touching one's knees thrice 
with one's hand and snapping the thumh and forefinger was 
also called rnafcra. Other units are passed over The general 
mles are that both tecfika and pWaha must be uniform and quiet, 
that the timo givon /or puraka should bo half of that given to 
rccaka. Three views about the duration of puiaka, humbhaka 
and i ecaKa are that tboy should be in the proportion of 1 : 4 ■ 2 or 
1:2:3 or the same for all. The Puranas give different matras 
for pransyamas e g. the Markandeya ( 36. 13, 14 ) says that the 
larjhu (nirdu of tho bhnsya) is of twelve matras, double of that 
is madhyama and tho nilai hja (tivra in the bhasya) is for three 
times twelve matras, while the Garudapurana ( I. 226. 14-15 ) 
puts down the figures as 10, 20, 30 respectively and the Kurma- 
purana (II. 11. 32) agrees with the Markandeya. The Mitaksara 
on Yaj. III. 200-201 provides that pranayama is of three varieties 
( adhama of 15 matras, madhyama of 30 matras and uttama of 
45 matras). Tho Lingapurana (I. 8. 47-48) also puts forth 12, 
34, 36 matras as the timo of nlca, vdghata, madhyama udghata 
and mukhya and states that obvious results of these three are 
respectively perspiration, tremor and utthana ( prasada-kampa- 
notthana-janakasca yathakramam ). Compare Mark. 36. 16 
which states that those three are to be mastered respectively by 
tho different longlbs of pranSyama (prathamena jayet svedam 
madhyamena ca vepathum I visadam hi trtlyena jayed-dosan 
anukramafc II ). 

It should be notic'ed that neither Patanjali nor the Vyasa- 
bhasya employs the well-known words, pTiratca, tecaka and

Besides, Fataujali and Vyasa say nothing about the .japs .of Om

Sankaracarya (vide note 2208 above). The Brhad-Yogi-Yaj. 
and Vacaspati also mention them. The Visnupurana in a 
poetic description of the Sarad season employs them by way of 
slesa 2364 (as below). Several modes of performing pranayama 
are prescribed. One of the simplest is to stop the right nostril 
with the thumb, to fill in air through the left nostril according 
to one's ability ; then to throw out the air through the right 
nostril; again inhale through the right nostril and eject air 
through the left. Do this at least thrice. Practise this at least 
twice every day, preferably in the morning after bath and in 
the evening or four times (before dawn, during midday, in the 
evening or at midnight). In the beginning kumbhaka need 
not be practised at all. After some practice with pflraka and 
recaka, kumbhaka may be begun after recaka. Kumbhaka after 
pfiraka is to be practised with great caution and should be 
attempted under the direotion of an expert. 

The Manusmrti contains im a great eulogy of pTanayama 
in the following words 'even three pranayamas performed 
according to the rules prescribed and accompanied by the 
vyahritis and piamava (the syllable om) should be regarded as 
the highest tapas for a brahmana; just as in the case of metals 
(like gold and silver) impurities are burnt when they are melted 
in the blast of a furnace, so blemishes (like passion &c.) of 
the organs of sense ( including the mind) are destroyed by the 
control of breath; one should extinguish the blemishes (passion, 
hatred &c.) by pranayamas, sin by dhaiana, contact with the 
objects of sense by pratynhai a and such attributes as are 
ungodly (viz. anger, avarice, jealousy &o.) by meditation ( on 
brahma ). 1 he Y. S. states that from the practice of pranayama 
results the dwindling of actions (or klesas) that envelop 
enlightenment (which is the characteristic of sattta) and the

mind of the yogin becomes fit for fixed attention. 2E6S The 
Goiaksasataka 2367 provides ' a yogin always eradicates diseases 
by asana, sin by pranayama and mental disturbance by 
pratyahara*. The Smrtis state that pranayamas have great 
efficacy in destroying sins. Manu XI. 248 ( =Vasistha 36. 4, 
Band. Dh. S. IV. 1. 31 and Sankhasmrti XII. 18-19) states 
' sixteen pranayamas performed everyday for a month together 
with the vyWirtis and pranava ( om ) purify even the murderer 
of a brahmana. Manu XI. 199 and 201 prescribe the performance 
of a single pranayama as a purification for light lapses or 
riding an ass or a camel and such incidents as being bitten by a 
dog, jackal, hoise, camel, boar or man. Yaj. III. 305 prescribes the 
performance of a hundred pranayamas for the destruction of all 
sins, of upapatakas (lesser sins described in Yaj. HI. 234-242) 
and of sins for which no specific prayascitta iB provided. Mann 
n.83(=YasisthaX5 and Visnudharmasutra 55.83) states 'the 
one syllable (om) is (the representative of) the highest brahma 
and pranayamas are the highest tapas'. 

It may interest readers to note that the great Jaina monk 

acarya Hemacandra, condemns pranayamas by saying that they 

. allow no rest to the mind, that there is physical effort in pftraka 

kumbhaka and recaka and that pranayama is an obstacle to'

In kumbhaka performed after puraka the nerves, heart and

that with fow exceptions Yoga can safely he learnt by direct 
contact with a teacher'. The fact, that the Yogasutra con- 
taining 195 sutras in all devotes only five sutraB (II. 49-53) to 
pranayama and that even thoBe five aro of a very general 
nature, indicatos that Patanjali intended that the yogin should 
not practise pranayama by merely listening to or reading these 
sutras but should approach an expert yogin for instruction and 
guidance. 

It should be noticed that Patanjali does not require in his 
definition of pranayama the mental or inaudible repetition of 
any syllable like 'om' or any mantra like the Gayatrl. But the 
Smrtis prescribe the practice of pranayama every day in the 
Sandhyavandana. Yaj. ( 1. 1% ) prescribes 237 ° that a man of the 
three higher varnas must every day take a bath, perform 
maijana (sprinkling water with kusas) with the mantras (Rg. 
X. 9. 1-3 ' 3po hi stha &c.'), practise pranayama, worship of the 
sun and japa of Gayatrl (Rg. IQ. 62. 10) and that pranayama 
compriBBB the japa three times of Gayatrl preceded by the 
Vyahrtis, each being preceded by Om and followed by the &ras. 
Pranayama as described by Yaj. is prescribed even in modern 
times for the morning and evening Sandhya adorations. Prana- 
yama with mental repetition of 'Om' or a 'mantra' is oaUed 
' sagarbha* M71 or ' sabija,' while pranayama not so accompanied

Prayayama of two kinds 1443 

is called 'agarbha' or 'ablja' and it is said that 'sagarbha* is 
the better of the two. Santiparva (304. 9. cr. ed. = Ch. ed. 316. 9-10} 
speaks of saguna and nirguna pranayama. The Yogabhasya 
(on Y. S. IE. 52) quotes a passage 33n 'there is no higher tapas 
than pranayama, therefrom arises purification of the taints and 
knowledge flashes forth.' 

The H. Y. P. speaks of eight kinds of Pranayama ( in II . 44 ). 
The two most important ones, viz Ujjayl and Bhastrika are 
described by Sri Kuvalayananda in chap. IV. pp. 67-68 and 
chap. VI. pp. 101-115 respectively in his handbook on Prana- 
yama, part one and the other six viz. Suryabhedana, Sltkarl, 
Sltall, Bhramarl, Murccha, PlavinI in. pp. 6-25 of the handbook 
part 2. H. Y. P. ( II. 48-70 ) describes all the eight at some length. 

Dr. Bale in his work 'Mysterious Kundalinl* provides at 
the very beginning a diagram of the autonomic nervous system 
according to the Western anatomical science, Bhowing the six 
cakras and identifying the positions of these sis and the 
sahasraracakra (lit. thousand-petalled i. e. having numberless 
petals ). He propounded an original view that the Kundalinl is 
the right vagus nerve. His book is very interesting and he has 
explored a very large field of yogic practices. He has very 
thoroughly utilized his deep knowledge of Western anatomy 
and physiology, but he himself admits in his preface ( p. 2) that 
the explanations of the various Yogic practices and phenomena 
given by him are possible suggestions only. But it may be 
noted that Sir John Woodroffe, who made a deep study of Yoga 
and of Tantra works and who wrote a foreword to Dr. Eele's

Vivokananda's locturos on Rajayoga Buffer from the Bflmo draw- 
backs as tho work of Dr. Rolo doos. Sri Kuvalayanand shows 
(on pp. 131-12G) tho valuo of pr&nayama for physical health 
and tho propor functioning of tho lungs, tho organB of digestion, 
tho livor, pancreas and kidneys and assorts that the spiritual 
valuo of Pranaydinn is vory groat. 

Prahjuhura (withdrawal of tho sonso organs from tho ohjootB 
of sonso ) is dofinod 23H in Y. S. II. 54 as ' when tho sonsoB have 
no contact with (aro withdrawn from ) thoir ohjocts (bocause the 
mind is restrained ) and thorohy resemble the stato of tho mind 
itself, thoro is pratyahara. ' Whon tho mind, being rostrainod by 
tho yogin, doos not corao in contact with tho objects of sense, 
viz. sound, touch, form, tasto, smoll, the organB of sonso also 
bocomo disconnected with them, tho organB como to resemble the 
mind itself (honco tho words ' nnulcara iva ' in tho sutra). From 
this ( non-contact ) results tho complete mastery over tho senses. 
Tho idea is that in restraining tho mind from the objects of 
Bonso tho organs also aro withdrawn from contact with them. 
Since tho mind is mado e/.ur/ro (one-pointed) the sense organs 
together with tho mind do not cognise or apprehend tho objects. 
Pratyahara is tho chocking of the outgoing activities of the 
mind and freeing it from being tho slave of the senBeB. Tho 
Santiparva (cr. od. 188. 5-7 s Ob. od. 395. 6-7) speakB of it.

PralyaJiara explained MAS 

as 'Indriyanlndriyarthebhyah pratyahara ivaharat'. Vacaspati 
quotas two verses from the Visnupurana which employ the very 
characteristic words of the T. S. and probably borrow the idea 
and language from the Y. S. The Dharmasutra of Devala J37S 
explains pratyahara as 'establishing (or yoking) the mind to 
the soul by bringing it back (to the soul) when it has swerved 
from the path of Yoga, because of its subtlety, its restlessness, 
its thoughtlessness or its force'. The Kurmapurana 2376 defines 
it as ' the suppression or mastery over the organs of sense that 
are naturally attracted to objects of sense ". Vide Santiparva 
(or. ed. 232. 13) also 

It appears that when the Chan. Up. (in VIII. 15) enumerates 
the circumstances which enable a person to reach the worlds of 
brahman it has an idea of pratyahara in the word ' atmani 
sarvendriyani sampratisthapya* ('when he concentrates all his 
senses in the self). 

The third pada of the Y. S. is called 'Vibhuti-pada'(pada 
that deals with the super-normal powers of the yogin). The 
word 'vibhuti' occurs in Prasna 5. 4 where it is stated that he 
who contemplates on Om of the dvimatra type is taken to the 
world of the moon where he enjoys ' vibhuti* and again returns 
to the earth. There the word probably means nothing more than 
prosperous life. The third pSda first deals with the last three 
of the eight angas of Yoga, the first five being called bahranga 
(indirect helpers of samprajnata-samadhi), while the last three 
are said to be antamnga of samprajnata-samadhi (but even 
these three are bahiranga with reference to nirbija Yoga, as the 
latter may occur even in the absence of the three • dharana ' &c 
These three are called dharana, dhyana and samadhi and these

144r) History of bliarma&astra { Sec. VtH, Ch. XXXtl 

Dharana, dhyana and samadhi are said to be the direct 
auxiliaries of Yoga and are three successive stages, the preceding 
one leading to the next. Dbarana is the holding of the mind to 
a certain spot or point 23 ' 7 or object. The bhasya explains that 
the mind is to be held down to such spots (in one's body ) as the 
navel, the heart-lotus, the head, the light ( in the eye ), the tip 
of the nose, the tip of the tongue and the like or on external 
objects (such as images of gods in various forms). In this 
stage attention has to be firmly held upon the chosen object for 
a period of time determined by the will of the yoga aspirant. 
In this stage there are three elements, the subject, the object and 
the act of concentration. The next stage is dhyana, which will 
be described immediately below. The Markandeya Purana 
speaks of ten dharanas on the different parts of the yogin's own 
body 23ra and is in accordance with the plural ' dharanasu oa 
yogyata manasah' (in Y. S. II. 53) employed by Patafijali 
himself. The 5ivamedhikaparva also employs the plural 
* dharanasu '. Vide the Santlparva (cr. ed. 188. 8-13 = Oh. ed. 
195.8). The Yajfiavalkyasmrti 23TO in a succint manner brings

in the angas from asana to dharana and dhySna as follows : 
(Theyogin) occupying a seat neither too high nor too low, 
having placed his upturned heels on his thighs and having 
placed on the left (palm placed on the upturned right heel) 
his other (right) palm (turned upwards), having slightly 
raised his face and having braced up his body with his (raised) 
chest, having closed the eyes, being free from rajas and tamas, 
not allowing the upper and lower rows of teeth to touch, holding 
his tongue firmly in the palate, and allowing no shaking of the 
body, covering the mouth, holding back the organs of sense 
from their objects, should perform pranayama of the twofold or 
threefold type (of 24 or 36 matras), should contemplate on the 
Lord that occupies his heart like a lamp, and fix his mind on 
that Lord by way of Dharana. Devala states »» that dharana 
is the holding in check of the body, senses, mind, intellect and 
atman (egoism). 

M. Charles Baudouin in 'Suggestion and auto-suggestion 1 
tr. by Elder and Cedar Paul (ed. of 1922, Allen and Unwin ) says 
(on p. 150)* As one of the curiosities of history and further as 
a lesson in humility we must point out that the states just 
described under the names of collectedness, contention and auto- 
hypnosis are described with considerable psychological acumen 
(though not m modern psychological terminology) in the 
precepts by which for centuries past the Yogis of Hindustan 
have been accustomed to attain to self-mastery' and the author 
refers to Fratyahara and Dharana in this connection and on 
p. 151 remarks that auto-hypnosis is encountered in Toga but it 
is tinged with mysticism because the sacred word W is 
repeated hundreds of times.

unaffected by any other idea or apprehension. The Upanisads s381 
insist upon dhyana, e. g. Mundaka says ' contemplate upon the 
Self in the form of Om'; the Br. Up has the famous passage ' the 
self should be seen, heard, understood and reflected upon. ' The 
Chan. Up. ( YIL 6. 2 ) employs the word * dhyana ' in the sense of 
'concentrating all thoughts on one object'. The Sv. Up. (1.3) 
mentions dhyanayoga and also Glta 18. 52 does so ( dhyanayoga- 
paro nityam ). The Santiparva ( or. ed. 188. 13 ff = Ch. ed, 195. 
13-18) speaks of dhyana. The Krtyakalpataru (on Moksa 
p. 181 ) quotes a long prose passage from Devala-dharmaBntra 
about dhyana. The Visnupurana 3382 closely agreeing with the 
Yogabhasya in phraseology describes dhyana as the one-pointed 
succession of the apprehension of the Lord's form, unmixed with 
another idea, brought about by the practice of the first six angas 
of Yoga. Apararka (pp 1025-27) quotes a long prose passage 
from Visnudharmasutra (chap 97), which asks the yogin to 
contemplate upon the all-pervading and all-powerful Lord who 
is free from gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas), is beyond the twenty-four 
tattvas and who is imperceptible to the senses, and that, if he be 
unable to focuss his mind on formless God all at once, to

gradually rise up from Prthvl and the other elements, mind, 
intellect, the soul, avyakta (unmanif ested Spirit ) ; if he be unable 
to do even this he should contemplate on the person that is like 
a lamp in his own heart ( lotus ) ; if this is impossible, he should 
contemplate upon the form of Vasudeva having on his cheat 
vanamala, having four arms, holding the conch, the quoit, mace 
and lotus ; and adds that he secures whatever he contemplates 
upon and that this is the secret of dhyana. This shows that 
dhyana is either saguna or mrgunu as stated by the Fadmapurana 
IV. 84. 80-86 (nirguna) and IV. 84. 88-96 (sagwna) or sSfeora and 
mrakura ( PadmapuTana, II. 80 70, 77-78 ). The Visnupurana 
(VI. 7. 78-90) contains a passage similar to the Visnu Dh. S. 
Skanda (KasSkhanda, chap. 41 19) speaks of dhyana as saguna 
and nirguna and defines saguna as depending on different forms 
or as accompanied by repetition of mantaras and nirguna as ' not 
depending on any particular form or as not accompanied by 
mantras '. The NaTasimhapurana (17. 11-28 and 26. 17 ) describes 
at some length the form in which Narayana or Visnu is to be 
contemplated upon and these verses are quoted by the Krtya- 
kalpataru (Moksa, pp 191-192). The Sankha-smrti states that 
one has realization {daHana) of the Lord of gods that abides in 
the heart (of every person) by means of dhySnayoga and 
describes the mode of dhyana. Daksasmrti also emphasizes 
dhyana and jfiana (correct knowledge) and states that descrip. 
tion of others serves no purpose beyond adding to the bulk of the 
work In this stage there is only the duality of subject and 
object, there is no awareness of effort to tie down the minion

moditation is carried to a stago whore the object contemplated 
upon alone appears and the meditator is not conscious of the 
idea of contemplation, becauso the object meditated upon entirely 
ongulfs the meditator. The yogin becomes so much identified 
with the object meditated upon that he is not conscious that he 
is contemplating upon an object. This is what is meant by 
* svariipasunyam-iva * ( in Y. S. III. 3 ). In Samadhi the subject 
and object, the individual and Paramatman are completely 
blended into one, so that the consciousness of the subjeot as 
separate from object disappears. The word 'Samadhi' does not 
occur in any of tho ancient Upanisads, though it is known to 
the MaifcrayanI Up, (vide n. 2327abovo). The word Samadhi 
occutb in tho Bhagavadglta (II. 53-54) and in "Vanaparva 
(3 11) and in Santiparva 195. 19-20, Ob. ed. ). The Visnu- 
purana 2381 provides that it is called Samadhi when the mind graBpB 
as a result of dhyana the real nature of that (tho Paramatman) 
in which thero is absence of the separate apprehension (of the 
object to bo meditated upon, tho act of meditation and the 
meditator). The throe (dharanS, dhyana and samadhi) are 
direct aids in samprajnata-samadhi but they are indirect aids m 
asamprajnatasamadhi, as this last may follow without these. The 
Hathayoga-pradlpika 238S states 'that is called Samadhi where 
there is equality and oneness of the individual self and tho 
Highest Self and where all desires cease to exist*. Sabija and 
mrbija Bamadhis would bo equal to savikalpa and nirvikalpa 
samadhi defined hy the Vodantasara. There are several grades 
or stages in samadhi. There are four grades S38S of Samprajiiata

Four kinds of samadhi 1*51 

samadhi, viz. savitarka, nirvifcarka, savicara, nirvicara Vide 
p. 1411 note 2318 above. The word gauh , the object cow denoted 
by it and the concept or idea(jfiana) 'this is a cow* are all 
really three separate matters, but they are apprehended as mixed 
up. When a yogin concentrates upon a gross object and his 
intellect is conscious of that object as permeated by all the 
above three, then that samadhi is savitarka (Y, S. I 42). ¥or 
the others vide note 3318 and below. In the asainprajfista 
Samadhi, the ultimate reality dawns on the yogin, 
prakrti does not affect him in any way, his soul which 
abides in itself and is not conscious of personality and even of 
joy is all at or atiakh and nothing else. In this section 
about the influence of yoga on Dharmasastra it is not necessary 
to go deeply into the several stages of samadhi described in the 
yoga works. The Goraksasataka 53W describes the final stage of 
samadhi as follows: 'A yogin in Samadhi does not apprehend 
nmell, flavour, form, touch or sound nor does he apprehend him- 
self or others (as distinct); knowers of brahma hold it to be 
pure, immovable, eternal, not engaged in activities, free from 
the gunas, expansive like the sky, as intelligence and bliss; the 
knower of yoga reaches non-duality in the highest stage as 
milk poured in milk, ghee into ghee or fire into fire.' 

It would have been noted that in dharanS, dhyana and 
samadhi the principal emphasis is mental. External conditions 
do help in the training but they are subsidiary. As noted above 
(pp. 1431-22) cleanliness, contentment, austerities (tapas), 
sexual purity, certain easy postures and living in detachment, 
restrictions as to quantity and quality of food— these aTe the 
chief physical or external conditions While the yogin practises 
the above three he may develop certain super-normal powers 
which he is advised to ignore, as they are hindrances in the 
attainment of his goal (Yogasutra lH 36). Though this is the 
opinion of PataBjali, from the fact tb.3t with most yogins the 
siddhis are an important part of yoga doctrines and the fact that, 
out of 195 sutras of the Yogasutra, 3a (III. 16-50) are devoted

to the description of siddhis, the prtsent author is constrained to 
say that siddhis are an integral part of Yoga. The Vaikhanasa- 
smartasfitra says that the yogin can vanish from people, can 
see distant objects and hear in Bpite of great distance. 

It is unnecessary to dwell upon the results of all samyamas 
mentioned in Y. S. psda three. A few are cited by way of 
sample. By samyama on the power of an elephant one secures 
the strength of an elephant (III. 24), by samyama on the sun 
there arises the knowledge of the seven worlds (IIL 26) and by 
samyama on the moon, there arises knowledge of the arrange- 
ment of the stars (HI 27), by samyama on the navel cakra 
arises knowledge of the arrangement of the body (IIL 29, viz. 
the three dosas, vata, pitta, kapha and the seven dhatus viz. skin, 
blood, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow and semen). By samyama 
on the coarse ^ forms, the essential attributes (svarupa), the 
subtle form (tanmatras), the inherence ( anvaya ) and the pur- 
posiveness of the five elements results the conquest (or mastery 
over) elements and from this results the appearance of the per- 
fections called amma and others, perfection of body and non- 
obstruction (of the actions of the yogin by the qualities of the 
elements i. e the earth cannot prevent the yogin by its hardness 
from penetrating inside the earth's rocks nor can fire burn him 
&c ) In IV. 1 Patafinali states that supernormal powers 
(siddhis) arise in five ways viz. by birth in certain a385> bodies

( e. g. being born as a bird which can fly high in the sky ), by the 
use of certain drugs, by the japa of certain mantras, by tapas 
(which is one of theniyamas) and by samadhi, each succeed- 
ing one being superior to each preceding one. 

The siddhis have been enumerated and explained above on 
pp 1112-13. The Devaladharmasutra has a long note on siddhis, 
which is quoted in Kalpataru (Moksakanda pp. 216-217). S9 ° 
The Ysjgavalkya smrfci (ID, 202-203 ) enumerates some charac- 
teristic signs of Yogasiddhi, viz. becoming invisible to others, 
remembrance of incidents in past lives, charming appearance, 
ability to see past and future happenings or objects that are 
distant, knowing what is being said at a great distance, entering 
another body after leaving one's own body, creation of things at 
one's will (without possessing the appropriate materials ). 

A great deal has been said above on mantras under Tantra 
( pp. 1096-1107 and notes thereto ). There are two theories about 
mantras ; one is the vibration theory, viz. that the letters of 
the mantra are charged with certain powers by the original 
composer and user of it and when the mantra is repeated 
certain imperceptible vibrations are set up which help in 
securing the purpose for which the mantra is repeated. The other 
theory is that the mantra comes down from antiquity and from

a great sage and its power of suggestion is groat. But the 
real effective power of a mantra seems to the present author 
to depend far more on the knowledge, the responsiveness 
and the high spiritual level which the person who repeats it 
brings to bear on its use. No scientific tests have been employed 
and different works emphasize with exaggeration one of the two 
theories about mantras. All is speculation. The present author 
believos that the «3nd theory has greater elements of trust-worthi- 
ness than the first, as it relies on human psychology, while the 
first degenerated so much that the famous mantra, ' om main 
padme hum* (dedicated to Avalokitesvara) written on some 
material and pasted on a wheel which was turned round and 
round hundreds of times was supposed to yield great results. 
The 2nd theory led to the importance of guru and dlksS 
(initiation) and here also extravagant claims were made. This 
latter theory, however, required that the disciple should possess 
certain qualifications such as implicit faith in the guru, respaot 
for matters spiritual, some knowledge of the tenets and the basic 
scriptures and readiness to devote time and energy to the study 
and practice of the teachings of the guru. Vide Siva-samhlta 
(III. 10-19 ) for the relation between guru and disciple. 

The fourth pcuJa deals with Kaiudya. The yogin who has 
gone through the whole discipline up to samadhi and has become 
thoroughly aware of the distinction between Purusa and tho 
gunas {sattva and others), becomes free from the influence of tho 
three gunas, because they merge in Ptadliana after having 
served the purpose of the soul, that is Kaivalya (isolation) or it 
(Kaivalya) may be stated to be the principle of consciousness 
that abides by itself (and does not become connected with even 
saltva-gtma).^ This has also been alluded to m Y. S. il. re 
that states that when amd'ja (nescience) is removed by discri- 
mination the self (who is the perceiver) does not come .into 
co ntact with the gunas, which state is Kaivalya. 23 ' 3 Kaivalya

is put foiword in IV. 34 from two points of view. When a 
purusa ceases to be affected in any way by the gunas (that 
constitute prakrfci) because he has become entirely passionless, 
praktti becomes aloof (kevala) so far as that purusa is concerned. 
When purusa has thorough knowledge and ceases to be affected 
by gunas he remains as bate consciousness (citisakti) and 
remains aloof (kevala) and that is the 2nd point of view about 
fauvalya. In tbat state of kaivalya or moksa we cannot 
predicate any happiness or bliss about him but we can only 
say about him that he is in a state of bare consciousness 
(citisakti;. The Upanisads declare 2393 that in such a state the 
liberated soul has neither joy nor sorrow, that happiness or its 
opposite does not touch such an one, since he has risen above 
identifying the body with himself. The ideal of Yoga is to be 
jlvan-mukta (i e. to reject Life and Personality, to die to this 
world though the body may persist for some time ). 

The eight angas of Yoga are described in moTe or less detail 
in several Puranas. Vide Agni, chap. 214-215 and 372-76, 
Bhagavata III. 28, Kurma IX 11, Earasimha 61 (verses 3-13 of 
which are quoted by Kalpatam, moksakanda pp. 194-195), 
Matsya chap. 52, Markandeya (chap. 36-40 'ofVenk. edition! 
39-43 of Cal. ed. ) about 250 verses, many of which are quoted by 
Krtyakalpataru (on Moksa), Apararka and others; Linga I 8

1456 History of Maniioiast/a (See. VHI,Ch. XXill 

The last chapter in Dr. Behanan's book on « Yoga, a scientific 
evaluation' is interesting and important. He makes an appraisal 
of several aspects of Yoga by means of experiments which he 
carried out on himself after spending one year under the 
guidance of Swami Kuvalayanand of Lonavla and after he had 
three years of experience in Yogic breathing. It is not possible 
for reasons of space to give here a summary of his appraisal ot 
several aspects of Yoga but reference may be made to a few of 
his findings. He finds that by yogic practices the mind is turned 
inward and detached from the external world (p. 232), it seems 
to him very probable that the pranayamio breathing induces a 
state of relaxation, thereby inducing the mind to take an inward 
course (p. 234), that taking normal breathing as a basis of 
comparison it was found that oxygen consumption increased 
24. S per cent in UjjayJ, 18. 5 per cent in bhastiifcu and 12 per 
cent in Kapalabhati ; that the nasal gaze in a meditative posture 
is an aid to checking the wandering propensities of the mind 
(p. 242), that Yogic practices lead to an emotional stability and 
that watching at close range for a year the daily lives of more 
than half a dozen practitioners of yoga I>r. Behanan concluded 
that they were the happiest personalities that he had known and 
that their serenity was contagious (p. 245 ). 

Dr. P. A. Sorokin of the Harvard University, one of the 
greatest living sociologists, contributes a very valuable paper 
on 'Yoga and man's transfiguration' to the Bharatiya Vidya 
Bhavans Journal for November 1958 (pp. 111-120), the very 
first sentence of which opens with the words 'The methods and 
techniques of the yoga, particularly those of the B&jayoga, 
contain in themselves nearly all the sound techniques of modern 
psycho-analysis, psychotherapy, psycho-drama, moral education, 
and education of character.' 

That a person engaged in Yoga practices is succeeding in 
reaching higher and higher spiritual levels is shown by the 
appearance of certain traits in himself. The Sv. Up. states that 
the firBt favourable signB of the working of Yoga are: lightness 
or agility of body, health, freedom from desires, brightness of 
complexion, fineness of voice, pleasant bodily odour, passing 
onlv a small quantity of urine or excreta. Almost the same 
verse occurs i n the Yayu »» and the Markandeya Purana sjmd 

( Continued on next page ) 



Signs of tlie approach of siddhis l4&? 

Markandeya further says 'people come' to like the yogin and 
sing praises of his qualities behind his back and all animals are 
not afraid of him ; he is not affected by severe cold or heat and 
is not afraid of others; these show that siddhi in Toga is 
approaching' The Vayupurana adds 'if the practitioner of 
Yoga sees the earth or his body as if on fire and if he sees him- 
self entering the elements ( or all beings ) he should understand 
that success in Yoga is neaT.' S95 

The Markandeya-purana ( chap. 38 verse 26 ) and the Visnu- 
puranall. 13 describe at some length yogicarya (i. e. behaviour 
or conduct of a yogin). It is not possible to set out all that is 
said in these chapters but two striking verses are rendered here. 
The Markandeya Z3K says * honour and disrespect causa pleasure 
and distress to man ( in general ), but these two have the reverse 
effect and serve to produce perfection in the yogin; these two 
are called poison and nectar respectively ; disrespect is nectar 
for the yogin and honour is terrible poison.* The Visnupurana 
emphasizes that a yogin should so act that people will disrespect 
him and would not seek his company. The Manusmrti ( in 
VI. 38-85) enlarges upon the duties of sannyasins, many of 
which are applicable to yogins. In VX 65 Manu calls upon the 
sannyasin to ponder by means of Toga over the subtleness of 
the Highest Self and in VI. 73 Manu advises the ascetic to 
practise dhyanayoga. The Yajnavalkyasmrti also (in III 
56H57) prescribes the duties of sannyasins, one of which {in 
verse 64 } is the same as Manu VI. 73.

when he curbs the senses by his mind and makes the mind 
itself firm by his intellect and he becomes unmoved ( by objects of 
sense) as if he were a stone, is unshakable like a tree-trunk, strong 
and motionless like a mountain. The wise call a man yukta 
(a yogin), when he neither hears, nor smells fragrance, nor 
tastes nor sees, nor touches and when his mind does not form 
( ever changing ) ideas, when he does not regard anything as his 
own, when he does not cognise (external objects) as if he were a 
log of wood and when he can be said to have recovered the 
original real nature (of the Self). The Devaladharmasutra 
provides that all beings come under bondage owing to aJmiilcara 
(egoism that one will do this or that) and mainatva (regarding 
transient things as owned by oneself) but he who is free from 
these becomes liberated. 2393 

Through centuries Sannyasins and Yogins have been paid 
the highest honours in India. Special emphasis is laid on 
inviting a Yogin at a sraddha and it is said by some authorities 
that a single yogin is equal to hundreds and thousands of 
brahmanas. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. IV. pp. 388, 398-399 for 
original authorities. In cases of doubt as to what the proper 
conduct or Dharma is in a set of circumstances, the matter was 
left to be decided by a parisad (an assembly) of ten learned 
brahmanas or at least three, but even one may constitute a 
parisad, provided he is learned in Veda and knows Dharma 
(vide Manu 231. 108-113). But Ysj. I. 9 and others say that 
four persons knowing the Veda and Dharmasdstra or three of 
the same type or even one who is the best among knowere of 
spiritual matters (ascetics) may constitute a parisad and what 
he declares would be the right course of conduct. Vide H. of 
Dh. VoL TL 969 for texts on this point. The Bhagavad-glU 
says 'the yogin (who is a real karmayogin surrendering the

tapas (such as fasts or following Hathayoga) and superior even 
to those -who hare mastered philosophical knowledge (like that 
of Sjnkhya) and he is superior to those who are performers of 
Vedic rites (leading to siarga }; therefore, Arjuna ! be a yogin, 
that does acts (because it is his duty to do so and who doB3 not 
hanker afer the fruits of those actions). 

Manu (XII. 83) states 'study of the Veda, tapas, true 
knowledge ( about brahma), restraint of the sense organs, ahimsa, 
attending on one's guru-these are the highest means of nthsreyasa 
(te. moksa). Then Terse 85 proceeds * of all these six means 
true knowledge of the Self is the highest, it is at the head of all 
vidyas (lores), since immortality (moksa ) is obtained by means 
of it. 

The highest value is attached to Yoga 2SW as an integral 
part of VedSnta by the Yajfiavalkyasmrti when it states that 
realization of the Self by means of Yoga is the highest Dharma. 
Then the same Smrti provides M0C study of the Veda, perform- 
ance of sacrifices, brahmacarya (sexual purity), tapas and dama 
(restraint of senses), faith, fasting and freedom from attach- 
ment to worldly objects; these are the causes of securing know- 
ledge of the Atman.' It should be noticed that some of thesB 
fall under yama, nnjama and pi atyahai a. The Daksasmrti avers 
'even the country, where a yogin, who has profound know- 
ledge of yoga and who is given to dhyana, becomes holy ; what 
need is there to say about his relatives (i. e. they will certainly 
be pure). 2fflt 

The Yogasutras are difficult and do not give complete 
explanations of the several stages of Yogic practices. They are 
in the nature of brief notes or hints that are calculated to rouse 
the curiosity of the hearer or reader and induce him to go to 
a competent teacher and learn Yoga practices. A few examples 
may be cited Y S.II 50 refers to three kinds of PranaySrL,

between a siddhi due to a drag and siddhis due to samadhi 
"Patanjali says that Om is the symbol of Isvara and that repeti- 
tion thereof and reflection on its meaning is a means of attain. 
ingekagiata, but there is no explanation why Om is expressiv 
of Isvara nor is any reference made to the Upanisads &c. abou 
the importance of Om or how japa is to be performed. This is 
probably due to the ageloDg tradition that spiritual knowledge 
should be kept secret, should not he taught to all and sundry, 
but only to a disciple possessing certain qualifications. Already 
on pp. 1071-72 notes 1733, 1734 it has been shown from a few 
TTpanisad quotations how esoteric knowledge was imparted only 
by a guru to a disciple In the dialogue of Yajnavalkya and 
■Srtabhaga (Br. Up. Ill 2. 13), when the latter asked, after 
saying 'after a man's death his speech enters fire, his breath 
enterB into wind, his eye into the sun, his body into the earth' 

* where does then the man remain ? ' Yajfiavalkya replied 
take my hand, on this matter we two alone must oome to Borne 
understanding, but not here in the midst of company.' Then the 
two went aside and conferred with one another. That shows that 
the knowledge about what happens after death was not held to be 
a matter proper for being discussed in an assembly of people. The 
GhSndogya Up. (12X11.5) states 'therefore a father may tell 
that doctrine of Brahma to his eldest son or to a worthy pupil 
but not to anyone else even if the latter gave him this earth girt 
by waters (Beas) and full of wealth, for this doctrine is worth 
more than that '. The Br. Up. VI. 3. 12 provides ' one should not 
speak of it (brahma doctrine) to one who is not his son or 
pupil'; vide Sv. Up. VI. 22, MaitrayanI Up. VI. 29 for similar 
words. The Santiparva in a chapter dealing with spiritual 
knowledge provides that it should be imparted to one's dear son 
and an obedient disciple, but not to one whose mind is not 
quiescent nor controlled, nor one who is jealous or crooked or a 
backbiter or a logicohopper. 2 m H.Y.P. states *a Yogin desirous 
of attaining siddhi should keep the knowledge of Hatha as 
highly secret; it becomes potent if kept secret, but becomes 
impotent if exposed to all; one should practise yoga alone in 
the way expounded by the guru'. 2103 This applied in anoient

Secrecy about higher knowledge 1461 

times not only to esoteric knowledge but to other scholastic 
studies. The Nirukta (H 3) says that it (Nirukta ) should not 
be taught to one who does not know grammar, nor to one who 
does not approach (the guru) for knowledge or who is not awaTe 
of the importance of the sastra, since an ignorant person always 
bears ill-will to knowledge ; and the Nirnkta quotes (II. 4) four 
verses ( called Vidyasukta ) on this matter. 2401 In the Bhagavad- 
gita Krsna frequently emphasizes that the knowledge of Bhakti- 
yoga is a sovereign secret { IX %), in XVII. 63 the knowledge 
conveyed to Arjuna is stated to be more secret than all secrets 
and in XVTII. 64-65 Krsna asks Arjuna to listen to the most 
secret words of his viz. ' fix they mind on Me, be my devotee, 
offer sacrifice to me, prostrate thyself before me; thou shalt 
come to me; I promise to thee truly as thou art dear tome'. 
This last is repeated from IX. 34. At the end of chap. XV it is 
said * O blameless one ! this most secret doctrine has been ex- 
pounded by me to you'. 

Whether the path of Yoga is desirable or feasible in its 
entirety cannot be debated here. But there have been great men 
in India for thousands of yearB who have trodden the path of 
Yoga that led to the desired goal of freedom of the self from 
avidya and the bondage of birth and death by means of Yoga. 
Even as eariy as the Santiparva ( chap. 289, cr. ed. verses 50 and 
54), the path of yoga is said to be very difficult and that it is 
easy to stay on the sharp edges of razors, but that those whose 
souls axe not purified would find it difficult and painful to 
continually practise Dharanas. Kalidasa so finely describes in 
the 8th. canto of the Baghuvamsa (verses 16-24) how Yoga was 
practised by kmg Kaghu. Kalidasa refers {in VUX 16) to 
apatarga as the goal of the ascetic Baghu as contrasted with 
'>>ahodaya(ablwdavaoTbhoga), both words occurring in Y S 
II 18 (Prakasa ... bhogapavargartham drsyam), mentions 

nSr (1D I?V 8)l * ranidh5n * ***» and consequen 
mastery over the five pranas (in Baghu VIII. 19, Y S 1L45 

•samadhisiddhinsvara-pranidhanat), mastery over the three 

gunas that constitute prakrti (Baghu VH. 21, Y S ! m~S 

melons <pradhanajaya), Yogavidhi as a means of P ara m i 

madarsana (Baghu VIH. 2%, Ya 3 smrti J. 8 quoted to nZS).

Rajayoga holds the supreme goal to be liberation from 
Nature (prakrti) or Maya of the Advaita) and its attitude 
towards the world of senses and our empirical lifo is that of 
shunning these. Mukti moans absorption into brahma for the 
Vedantist or Kaivalya ( isolation of the Individual self from tho 
bonds of birth and death and from prakrti according to pure 
Yoga). For the vast majority of men and women the path and 
final goal of Patafijala Yoga or of the Advaita VedSnt3 are 
almost inaccessible and unattainable, as tho Glti itpolf slates 
(All. 5) "Those whose mind is set on the UnmanifoBted 
encounter greater difficulties (than those who worship a personal 
God ), since the goal of tho unmanifestod is hard to reach by 
embodied beings'. The path of Karmayogu (performing good 
deeds and acts prescribed by Sastra without hankering for 
rewards ) and Bhaldiyoga ( wherein there is deep dovotion to God 
and self-surrender) appear to be more suitablo and practical for 
ordinary human beings. The Glta in chap. XIH. ( verses 13-17 ) 
contains one of the best descriptions of God as transcendent and 
immanent and verse 18 adds that tho devotee of God who under- 
stands this reaches God. 

Many readers familiar with Shri Aurobindo's uiiamu at 
Pondicherry and his voluminous writings might express Furprififl 
at the present author's non-mention ( in what precodos ) of Sim 
Anrobindo (who is called Mahayogl by his disciples and 
admirers) in this hection on Yoga and its influence on Dharma- 
sastra. But the reasons are obvious. In the first placo, 8h» 
Aurobindo pays hardly anything about Dharmagastra in relation 
to Yoga. In the 2nd placo, Shri Aurobindo admits that ho poo 
'no touch from a guru \ that he got an inner touch and practiFOfl 
Yoga, that he got some help from Mr. LeJo of Gwalior, that when 
he came to Pondicherry ho got from within a programme for w

Shri Aurobindo 1463 

men like the present author to have diverged far from the well 
trodden path of ancient Yoga and become like one described in 
the well-known words ('Murarestrtlyah panthah'). Shri 
Aurobindo is a mystic, 2405 the experiences of mystics are 
peculiar and their own, ordinary words and modes of speech fail 
to communicate them to those that cannot claim to have ever 
shared such experiences. Aurobindo became a recluse from 
November 1926 to his Mahasamadhi on 5th December 1950 and 
gave darsana. 2 * 06 only on four days in the year viz. 15th August 
(his birth date), 24th November (day of victory for him ), 21st 
February ( the birth date of the Mother ) and 24th April the day 
of the Mother's coming to the Ashrama ( vide Mr. DiwakaT's 'life 
of MahayogI' p. 265). For forty years Aurobindo lived in 
Pondicherry. His Ashram became a centre of the gospel of 
integrated Toga and a home for those who sought real life and 
light, a place of pilgrimage for men and women attracted by 
his teachings. 

On 15th August 1947 when India attained Independence 
(which happened to be the date of Aurobindo's birth) he issued 
a long statement referring to the dreams of his youth, which ha 
thought were arriving at fruition or were on their way to 
achievement. He stated 'the first of these dreams was a revolu- 
tionary movement which would create a free and united India. 
Another dream was the resurgence and liberation of the peoples 
of Asia and her return to her great role in the progress of human 
civilization. The third dream was a world union forming the 
outer basis of a fairer, brighter and nobler life for aU mankind

tion is a necessity of Mature, an inevitable movement. Another 
dream, the spiritual gift of India to the world, has already 
begun; India's spirituality is entering Europe and America in 
an ever-increasing measure. The final dream was a step in 
evolution which would raise man to a higher and larger con- 
sciousness and begin the solution of the problems which have 
perplexed and vexed him since he began to think and to dream 
of individual perfection and a perfect society. Here too, if the 
evolution iB to take place, since it must proceed through a 
growth of the spirit and the inner consciousness, the initiative 
can come from India and, although the scope must be universal, 
the central movement may be hers'. 

These emotional and eloquent words are flattering to the 
pride of all Indian people, but it is possible that, bearing in 
mind that the whole of India wjs mostly under the heel of 
ruthless or exploiting conquerors for over seven hundred years 
from the 13th century A. D. ( except for some parts and for brief 
periods as under the Vijayanagar Empire or under the Marathas 
for about 150 years and for about 50 years under Maharaja 
Ranjit Singh in Panjab ) these proud assertions of Aurobindo 
are likely to bring derisive smiles on the faces of many non- 
Indian readers. It is for discerning Indian readers to judge 
whether any of the dreams of Shri Aurobindo ( except the first 
about 2407 Independence) are on the way to achievement or 
realization, whether during the last fourteen years after Independ- 
ence India has progressed in the way of spirituality among men 
in general, whether there is any likelihood of there being ft 
union of peoples and nations in the near future or whether the 
world is on the brink of a precipice. 

Shri Aurobindo had set his heart on the unity of the human 
race by an inner oneness and purpose and not by an external 
association of interests; for 'U years he completely withdrew 
from the outer world and gave darsana only on four days in iu° 
year What efforts he made for the inner oneness of the human 
race except by his writings is not clear and nor does it efp»n

a pre-eminent position and energetically and fruitfully pursued 
the path marked by the Master and carries on the work that the 
master dreamt of and left unattempted and unfinished. Pass- 
ages quoted from his letters by Shri Diwakar (on p. 258) clarify 
what visions he had ' there will be first a race representing the 
supermind as man represents the mind', ' in what I am trying 
to do the spiritual realization is the first necessity, hut it cannot 
be complete without an outer realisation also in life, in men in 
this world, spiritual consciousness within but also spiritual life 
without'. About his Sadhana he says 'I began my Yoga in 
1904 My Sadhana was not founded upon hooks hut upon 

personal experiences that crowded on me from within It is 

a fact that I was hearing constantly the voice of Vivekananda 
speaking to me for a fortnight in the Jail' (p. 131 of Mr, 
Diwakar's book). 

In a letter to his brother Barindra dated 7th April 1920 
which is set out in full on pp 309-314 in the work * Shri Auro- 
bindo on himself and on the Mother' (1953), Aurobindo asserts 
•the main defect in the old Yogas consisted in the fact that they 
knew mind and intelligence and the Atman; they used to be 
satisfied with spiritual experience on the mental level ; hut the 
mind is capable of only partial knowledge and it can comprehend 
only parts and not the whole. The mind can know the infinite 
and the total reality only through Samadhi, Moksha or Nirvana 
and by no other means. Of course, some people do attain this 
kind of Moksha which may be said to be a blind alley. But 
t Am what tethe me of >( ? But what the Bhagwan intends to do 
with man is to enable him to realize God in life, in the in- 

Sm tL^S" *? thec ?t° tivesO0i6ty (to manifest God 
in life). The old systems of Yoga could not bring about a 
synthesis or nmty between spirituality and life ; they disposed of 
the world calling : it Maya or the transitory play of tSSrd 
The result is vitality and vigour in life have been sapped and 
India has decayed' I n this passage Aurobindo tries SbrS 
out the distinction between his integral Yoga and <L Yogaol 
ancient and medieval Indians. There is hardly anylhive^

word Maya at all nor did it say that the world was a play of God, 
It was the Vedanta-sutra H 1. 33 ( lokavat-tu Ulakaivalyara ) 
that said so by way of repelling an objection. In the Pataiijala 
yoga Isvara has nothing to do with the creation of the world 
(vide above pp. 1402-3 ) but it speaks of avidt/a by which the 
individual self is enmeshed ( Y. S. II. 3-5 and 24) and not God 
or the Supreme Self. Besides one is tempted to eoho the question 
of Aurobindo himself 'What is the use of integral Yoga, mind, 
overmind and supermind ? ' Can anybody point out even half a 
dozen men and disiiples of Aurobindo who have devoted all 
their energies to the regeneration of the country and of the 
human race on his lines ? The position of the Ashram itself is 
rather vague; anomalous and undefined. But it is unnecessary 
to say in this work anything further about it. 240B 

The writings of Shri Aurobindo are numerous and 
voluminous. For a list of his writings along with a few other 
works, vide the Bibliography ( pp. 267-269 ) given by Shri 
Dlwakar at the end of his work ' Mahayogl *. The present author 
has read only the following works of Shri Aurobindo 'Yoga and

said to be higher than Hathayoga and Bajayoga); 'The Mother' 
(1937), 'Essays on the Glta (5th ed. of 1949), 'The Synthesis of 
Yoga' (1948) which attempts to show that all three paths, vk 
of knowledge ( JfiSnayoga), of Devotion (Bhaktiyoga) and of

supermind, his precise meaning. Only one sentence is cited 

here for sample (from p. 345 of the big one volume edition); 

'Overmind, intuition, even supermind not only must be 

principles inherent and involved in the Inconsoience from which 

we arise in the evolution and inevitably destined to evolve, but 

are secretly present, occult actively with flashes of intuitive 

emergence in the cosmic activity of mind, life and matter.' The 

present author regards the book 'Foundations of Indian culture* 

as the best of the works of Shri Aurobindo which he has read. 

Prof. R. D. Banade in his Lectures on ' Bhagavadgita as a 

philosophy of God Realization' (Nagpur, 1959 pp 163-176) 

submits to examination Aurobindo's 'Essays on theGita' and 

disagrees with him on some points. While these pageB were 

passing through the press the present writer received a copy of 

'Integral Philosophy of Aurobindo ', a symposium edited by Dr. 

Haridas Chaudhuri and Dr. Erederic Spiegelberg ( and published 

by Allen and TJnwin, 1960 ), which contains 30 papers written 

by Indian and Western scholars on the Philosophy of Aurobindo, 

p. 32 defining the essence of integral Yoga and p. 44 

distinguishes between 'mind' and* supermind' (of Aurobindo's 
philosophy). 



CHAPTER XXXIII 
Tarka and Dharmasastra 

Tbo Yajnavalkyasmrti (1. 3) montions Nyaya (logic) 2105 as 
ono of the fourteen vidyCls and as ono of tho moans of knowing 
what Dharma is. Nyaya is rendored as 'tarkavidya* by the 
Mitaksara on Yaj. and tho Mit. atatos that tho fourteen vidyas 
are tho helu (moans) of (knowing) dharma. 

Both tho Nyayasutra and tho Vaisosikasutra of Kanada 
postulate that 'nihsroyasa* follows from tho correct knowledge 
of tho categories of tho two darsanas, ; "° 

Ono of tbo oarliost occurronces of tho word tat ha is in the 
Kathopanisad 2111 where it is declared ' This knowledge ( ahout 
tho Self ) cannot bo obtained by (more) ratiocination' and the 
previous vorso states that the Self is subtler than the subtlest 
and not capable of being understood by mere inference or 
reasoning. Tho word ' mantavyah ' in tho passage MU * AtraS va 
are drastavyah srotavyo mantavyo' (in Br. Up. H. 4. 5 and 
IV. 5. 6 ) is hold by the objector ( in bhasya on V. S. 1. 1. 2) and 
also by SankaTacfirya as referring to tarka on V. S.H. 1. 4. Tarka 
is accepted as an anga of Yoga in the MaitrayanI Up. (vide 
noto 2327 above ), which further quotes a passage stating that 
by the control of speech, mind and prana one apprehends brahman

with the help of tarka 2113 The Gautamadharmasutra 2414 remarks 
' tarka is the means for securing justice ( among contending 
parties)'. One of the replies given by Yudhisthira to the 
Yaksa guarding a lake is ' ratiocination is unstable ( leads to no 
certain conclusions), the Vedic tests differ (among themselves), 
there is no single sage whose opinion is held authoritative (by 
people or other sages); the essence of Dharma is placed in a cave 
( i. e is enveloped in darkness and cannot be seen clearly ), that 
is the path ( to be followed ) by which the majority of people • M1S 
proceed '. This appears to make man in the mass the ultimate 
tribunal on all questions of value. In its peroration at the end, 
the Manusmrti observes 'one who desires to secure the pure 
Dharma must know well the three viz. direct perception (or 
experience), inference, and sastra based on various traditions; 
none but that man who considers the sayings of sages ( i. e. the 
Veda), the instruction on Dharma (contained in the Smrtis) 
with the help of reasoning that does not ( directly) conflict with 
Veda and sastras knowa what Dharma is'. 2116 This is the 
position of most orthodox Sanskrit writers about Tarka. Their 
reasoning appears to have been this. If one were to rely on 
mere reason, the result would be uncertainty and anarchy. 
Every theorist states that his system is based on reason ; but the 
answers arrived at on the basis of reason as to questions of vital 
importance to ordinary men are bewilderingly different. Thinkere 
brought up in different environments and of different experiences 
have different logics and propound even different moral laws. 
Whom should an ordinary man follow ? The Vedas and Smrtis

years i o. ihoy ombody the exporionceB and the reasonings of 
numerous wiso mon. Thoroforo, if a modern man says that 
reason loads him to hold opinions opposed to the Veda, most 
people are not prepared to accept a singlo man's opinion pitted 
against the views of numerous ancient sagos. This point need 
not bo olaboratod further. On many important questions viz. 
whotbor thcro is God or a Supremo Intelligence guiding the 
univorso, or whether thoro is an individual self, or what the 
future of a man when lie dies is, the wisest among men have given 
widely differing answers 2 " 7 On such questions final answers 
acceptable to all or most people cannot be given by reason alone. 
Though tho orthodox position is as stated above, it has been 
Bhown above (o. g. on pp. 12G7-12G9 ) how Vedic practices have 
boon discarded by tho weight of popular opinion from time to 
time. It is laid down by Smrti writers thomselvos that blindly 
following tho words of Sastra would load to loss of Dharma and 
that in case of conflict between two Smrtis reasoning should be 
resorted to and popular opinions and practices should be con- 
Bidorod. Vido H. of Dh. vol III. pp. 866-868 for this. The 
Mahabharata enjoinB 2 " 8 ' one should not try to solve incompre- 
hensible matters by ratiocination.' In the dialogue between the 
famished sage Visvamitra (who desired to eat the tail of a dog) 
and a cSndala tho great Epic winds up by saying ' therefore a 
learned man whose soul is pure should act after relying on his 
intelligence in the matter of deciding what Dharma and 
adharma aro'. MW It should not be supposed that Sankaracarya 
and other great Indian writers wanted to throw reasoning over- 
board altogether. What they emphasized was that mere reason- 
ing of one or more men should not as a rule be followed if the

conclusions arrived at by reasoning are in direct conflict with 
Vedic and smrti texts. Sahkaraearya clearly states his position 
on V S II. 1. 1. and ll. 2420 Beliefs (such as those of Jains and 
Buddhists) were held to be heterodox, because they did not 
acknowledge the authority of the Veda and the sacred tradition, 
though they often observed Hindu practices and married with 
Hindus ; but within this limit there was room enough for an 
enormous and bewildering variety of convictions, rites and, 
practices that claimed to be orthodox. This may be illustrated 
by the attitude of some Upanisads Star example, the Mundaka 
Up. (I 1. 4-5 ) speaks of two vidyas, para and apara, includes 
under apara the four Vedas and the six ahgas and para (highest) 
■mdya is that by which the imperishable brahman is attained. In 
the Chan Up (VH. 1.1-5) when Narada approached Sanat- 
kumara for instruction, the fonner recounted what he had 
already learnt viz. the four Vedas, Itihasapurana and other 
lores ; then Sanatkumara tells him that all "that he has studied 
is mere name and then explains what is better than all those. 
Mundaka (1.2 7) condemns yajnas as leaky vessels. It is 
extremely surprising that the Chan. Up. in 1. 12. 3-5 compares the 
procedure of the five priests and the sacrificer touching each 
other and creeping from the satins towards the catvala where 1 
the Bahispavamana chant is to be sung with a procession of dogs, 
each dog holding the tail of the preceding dog in his mouth." 
Vide for the creeping of priests noiselessly and silently Tandya 
Brahmana VI. 7. 9-12 and Ap. Srauta-satra XH. 17. 1-4 and H 
of Dh. vol. H pp. 1166 and 1169. Though this is so, the Upal 
nisads are called Vedanta, are looked upon as orthodox and as 
the highest end of the Vedio religion and literature. Most 
ancuent Upamsads, however, quote Vedio Samhita texts as autho-

provides that brahmavidya is to be expounded to srotriyas (those 
who Lave studiod the Veda). Herein the UpanisadB rely upon 
the principle of adhikarabhoda. 

One of the oldest philosophical problems is Authority and 
Reason or to put it in different words, Faith and Season and 
there has been throughout the ages a constant struggle between 
theso two. Most men want to rely on some authority, on some 
one deemed higher than themselves. For vast numbers of people 
this authority or the something greater than themselves is Reve- 
lation and God. They have neither the leisure nor the inclina- 
tion nor the intellectual ability to think for themselves rationally 
on such abstruse questions as the existence of God or an in- 
dividual self, free will and determinism, the general principles 
of conduct, the final destiny of men after physioal death &c. 
In sociological matters human judgement is often warped hy 
prevailing dogmas and prejudices; on questions which are 
deemed to be religious (and in India the field of matters deemed 
to be religious has alwayB been very extensive) a frank discus- 
sion is almost impossible without creating anger and rancour. 
Several ethical questions such as divorce and birth control 
often assume the position of religious dogmas and when openly 
discussed create great heat. In several so-called democracies 
of the present day rational discussion comes last and vital 
questions are determined by party loyalties or by personality 
cults or by lust for power and self-aggrandisement, it should 
not be supposed that ancient and medieval India had no ration- 
alists nor atheists. As a matter of fact there were several 
rationalists. Vide the present author's note 875 pp. 358-«» 
inH ofDh. Vol. H, Vol. ICC. pp. 46-47 note 57 on Lokayatas 
and their views, «» and pp. 974-975 note 159G above for 
rationalistic criticism of sacrifices, sraddhas &c. Many ration- 
alists hold that there is no proof of the existence of l*oa. 
they deny an individual soul, they deny immortality ana 
the existence of any intelligence in the « ni ^ 8 %J 1 ^S 
man's, deny that there is any design or purpose m the Universe 
and they believe that in all religions there is some truth mn*d 
with a great deal of error. The case of the rational ist^^

he should not be called upon to prove that there is no God 
( which is a negative proposition ), that it is for theists to prove 
that God exists ( which is a positive proposition ) and that he is 
omnipotent and omniscient. They say that to attribute anger, 
love, pity to God is to implicitly negative God's omnipotence 
The problem of evil in the world is, according to rationalists, 
a great stumbling blook in accepting God as .good, kind, all- 
knowing and all-powerful. The rationalist might agree with 
the theist that man as an individual depends on something 
greater than himself that is able to give directions and to 
punish him for the disobedience of directions Por the rationa- 
list it is some kind of community or society in which men live 
and have their being that is greater than themselves This would 
be substituting the worship of the human community or of 
collective human power for the worship of God. What human 
community is to be in the place of God ? Is it to be the whole 
human race ( now having over two thousand million human 
beings ) or some big or small groups out of these ? There are 
now two well-defined blocks between whom there is a conflict 
of ideological ends, viz. the communist block represented by the 
TJ.&S.R. and China and the capitalistic block represented 
by U. S A., England and several other countries of Europe, and 
a third unorganized block of countries professing to have no 
alignment with anyone of the two blocks.

saviours of common man and women throughout the world and 
they cannot he charged with aggression since they mean to 
liberate people from tbe bonds of capitalism or colonialism &c. 
Their creed is one of fanaticism, of intolerance or hatred of 
others. The only experiment of a godless society on a large 
scale was made by the Sov.iet, but it does not appear to outsiders 
to have been a happy or successful one. The universal exhibi- 
tion of portraits of great Soviet leaders (some of whom were 
declared by successor leaders to be no better than murderers) 24E 
proclaims the necessity of worship even in a godless society. 
Dictators hare nationalized not only all the means of the produc 
tion of wealth but also all the labour in the country. They hare 
established themselves in the place of God and desire to have 
total control over the bodies and tbe minds ol all their subjects. 
The faith of tb.6 communists is that their country is a heaven on 
earth and one must accept their word for that without wanting 
to see for one self the real state of things. The Communhte 
have their own special versions of history, economics and 
science. These one must not question. 

The followers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam (all 
believing in one God and one Book) did not hesitate far centaioa 
to inculcate their doctrines and practices by terrible persecution 
and bloody wars. This spirit is very shocking to people brought 
up in Hinduism or Buddhism. If Eationalists substitute blooks 
of humanity or the leaders of such blocks for worship and 
authority, humanity itself would soon be wiped out. Conceding 
for argument that the existence of an omnipotent and omniscient 
Power cannot be proved to the satisfaction of the so-called 
rationalists, the present writer feels that it is for the good of most 
societies consisting of millions of common men and women %m 
they believe in God and the individual soul Most men a» 
influenced to keep to the path of virtue and right by the fear o 
God, by the prickings of conscience (which is the inner Ugw

Rationalists' arguments discussed 1475 

Santiparva quoted in H. of Dh. vol HI. p. 389 note 619 ). Those 
who reject the first of these would have to reject the 2nd also and 
would have to fall back upon hedonism (the greatest pleasure 
for themselves} or the idea of greatest good of the greatest 
number or progress towards some ideal state of society painted 
by imagination. The pursuit of purely secular or worldly happi- 
ness is incompatible with the precepts and ideals of Hinduism 
and all higher religions. Rationalism accepts the postulates 
which science finds convenient and useful. Though these 
postulates work well up to certain limits, it must he said that 
those limits are very narrow. Science aims at establishing 
general rules or laws. Ifrom those laws we know only the 
bshaviour of nature and how man can utilize natural forces for 
realizing human aims, but science does not tell us what those 
aims should be, it is amoral and not conoemed with morals or 
spirituality. Eationalism appears to smother many experiences 
of the human mind which are beyond the present machinery of 
science. When the scientific method is adopted in social studies, 
there is little to show that it leads to increased wisdom about 
the values that should be pursued. Rationalism insists that all 
our beliefs ought ultimately to be based on tangible and definite 
grounds and that modem scientific method is the only reliable 
method for acquiring knowledge of all kinds. But there are 
sub-conscious and non-rational impulses, beliefs and intuitions 
in men that are held by men to be truer or of a higher order 
than what is on the rationalistic level ( vide W. James' ' Varieties 
of religious experience' p. 74, ed. of 19S0). It should be the 
endeavour of leaders of thought in each generation to find out 
what is essential and vital in tradition ( without believing in 
the fallibility of all traditions) *nd to present reasoned

an image-worshipper, an agnoatoi, or atheist or an idealist philo- 
sopher holding 'nirgnna brahma* as the only reality, yot he 
may nevertheless be held to he a full Hindu, if ho conforms to 
the general attitude towards Veda and social usages. A moro 
radical tolerance than what our people showed throughout tho 
ageB is almost unthinkable. Western writers while admitting 
great tolerance in religions views and practices harp often on 
the requirements about observing caste rules in matters of food, 
marriage etc. But caste is more a social institution than a 
religious one and therefore just as in Western countries there 
were rules of etiquette and observance (such as tho number 13 
and the regulations against working on Sabbath and against 
theatre going, card playing and physical exercise oxcept walk- 
ing) that had to be observed meticulously, in India oasto rules 
had to he observed. Besides, even when caste rules were broken 
the offender had in a meeting of the caste people to admit his 
mistake, to pay a fine to the caste or village tomplo and then 
was restored to all privileges of the caste. As the Christian 
churches were extremely intolerant of the slightest departure 
from religious views held at particular times, there aroso in 
Europe the emphasiB on rationalism and freedom to hold 
opinions. Government could effectively mould the opinions 
of its subjects by controlling education, by censorship of hooka 
and by inflicting severe penalties on those who expressed 
opinions opposed to those espoused by them. Tho Eoman 
Church prepared an Index of forbidden books and an Index 
expurgatoriuB (a list of passages to he expunged from books 
that were otherwise permitted). The firBt Index Librorum 
ProhibrtoriuB in its latest edition (before 1949) contains 5000 
titles. Lecky in his ' History of the rise and influence of ration- 
alism in Europe' M23 points out to the extirpation of Christianity 
from Japan, of Protestantism from Spain, of tho Huguenots 
from France, of rnost Catholics from England. Tho Jesuits 
acted on the 2m principle that the end justifies tho means.

Their means included incitements to assassination and to war. 
It has been mentioned above (p. 483) how Galileo was per-

it may he pointed out that Aryabhata (born in 476 A, D. ) 
appears to have held the view that the stars did not revolve 
round the earth, but the latter revolved round itself and gave 
the illustration of a man sitting in a moving boat feeling that 
it is the stationary objects on the banks that rush past in the 
opposite direction. 2425 The Pancasiddhantika (13. 6) of 
Varahamihira refers to this view and rejects it, not on the 
ground that it is opposed to the Veda, but on the ground that, 
if that view were correct, hawks and other birds flying high up 
in the sky would not be able to come back to their nests without 
fail He did not know that the atmosphere also goes with the 
earth. This was more than eleven hundred years before Galileo 
and there is nothing to show that Aryabhata suffered in the 
least for his views. For Aryabhata's view vide ' Aryabhatlyam ' 
by W. E. Clark (Chicago, 1930 ) p 64. As observed by Archibald 
Robertson the history of the Rationalist movement in Europe 
is to a very great extent the history of a fight for the right to 
hold and propagate opinions unpopular for the time being and 
the growth of religious toleration in Europe has in fact gone 
hand m hand with the decay of traditional religious beliefs 
Reason arrives at different conclusions on the same matter in 
different ages and even in the same age what appears reasonable 
to one group or people is held to be unreasonable by another 
people .Vjde Robert Bridges' 'Testament of Beauty' Book I

1478 History of Dharmaiash a I Soo. YI1I, Ch. XXXIII 

Doubt lias been and is a frequent and legitimate attitude 
of the mind as recognised by the Br. TTp. (I 5. 3 ) ' Eamah 
sankalpo vicikitsa sraddha, asraddha, dhritir, adhritir hrlr-dhfr- 
bhlr-etyetat sarvam mana eva' (desire, fancy, doubt t faith, 
want of faith, steadiness, restlessness, shame, understanding, 
fear, all these are aspects of mind ). Even the Rgveda (H, 12. 5) 
refers to doubters about Indra ( utem ahur-naisostityenam '), In 
the Katha Up. Eaciketas says " when a man dies there is the 
doubt, some saying 'he (the self) exists", others saying 'he 
ceases to exist " and prays to Yama to resolve that doubt for 
him as the third boon. 

Descartes held that only one truth is beyond doubt viz. 
coqxto & go sum (I think, therefore I am ). In Europe the whole 
of the 18th and 19th centuries were dominated as far as thought- 
ful men were concerned by boundless faith in reason and 
progress. But owing to the two world wars (particularly the 
second), their aftermath and the rise of two powerful Communist 
countries have greatly weakened the faith in progress guided by 
reason and ethics, faith in the dignity of man and in equality is 
on the decline and is assailed in many regions and the view that 
might creates or is right is gaining ground. 

The Upanisads teach that a sound moral preparation must 
precede the acquisition of true vedantic view. The Br. Up- 
states ' therefore one who knows this, after securing quiesconco, 
restraining his senses, being free from all hankerings, bsarl "& 
with fortitude all pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold), 
having his mind concentrated, sees the Self in the self, looks 
upon everything as Atman '; the Katbopanisad II U says 'ono 
who has not ceased from doing evil actions, who is not quiescent, 
who has not concentrated his mind nor has made his rami 
quiescent would not realize this Self by correct knowledge ; 
Prasna 1 16 'those secure the pure world of biahman who aro 
free from crookedness, falsehood and deceitful conduct'; Sv.Up. 
VI 22 "this highly esoteric knowledge of Vedanta should not W 
imparted to one whose mind is not quiescent or who is not a son

Veddrda supports pure morality 14M 

that tapas, charity, straightforward conduct, ahimsa and truth- 
fulness are the daksina (sacrificial fees). 

This shows that Yedanta in its highest foTmisthe heat 
support of purs morality for individuals. It is on account of 
this teaching that many sages cultivated these virtues in 
hermitages and were honoured "by kings and common people in 
ancient times in India, but in medieval times the sages became 2426 
rate and as regards common people they were tied down by 
customs and caste and very few people made strenuous efforts 
for solidarity of all their countrymen, for meeting their common 
needs and safeguarding all peoples' interests , and by the side of 
sublime philosophical tenets our country witnessed abject 
poverty among large masses of people and political domination 
by alien or brutal invaders. The tendency to rely on the Vedas, 
to believe and to argue that what has been is the best, and to 
appeal to the past has been very strong throughtout our history 
for centuries. Our motto must not be 'back to the Vedas' but 
ratheT 'forward with the Vedas*. While giving due weight to the 
Veda and authority, we must not condemn all independence in 
thought. 

Some Western rationalists such as Bentham, James Mill 
and John S. Mill put forward the theory of utilitarianism which 
briefly comes to this that actions are to be judged by their 
consequences and are right in proportion as they tend to make 
for the greatest good or happiness of the community or of the 
greatest number. This theory has great drawbacks, the most 
important being that it is not really a moral theory at all as it 
does not tell us exactly what a man or community ought to do 

for IbMW good of the greatest number may not be so 
accepted by others and further it is difficult to define what the 
greatest number regards as good or happiness. Besld^a^

As a result of the two world warfl in which unspoakablo

Different virtues stressed in different ages 1481 

define what must be the content of the faith that would appeal 
to and secure the allegiance of most or all good, intellectual 
and educated modem men. At different times different virtues 
(such as monachism, charity, humility, patriotism, social 
service or philanthrophism ) weTe preached as of supreme import- 
ance. The growth of the virtue of patriotism and of the feeling of 
nationalism in Western countries was not due to Christianity's 
teachings but to various otheT causes in Europe's political and 
economic history. There are religious virtues, heroic virtues, 
amiable virtues &c. The Christian people of Europe and 
America during the last four centuries achieved great wealth 
and prosperity by throwing to the winds the virtues preached 
in the Sermon on the Mount, by extending their colonial empires 
for exploiting vast regions, by decimating millions of unoffend- 
ing backward races, by hunting human beings as if they were j 
beasts and forcing on them slavery and by preaching from the 
house tops the great need of competition in all spheres and 
worshipping it as if it were God. After the holooaust of the 
great wars, many eminent men, not only religious men, but 
even those that occupy positions in Government and political 
life, preach the necessity of the moral sense, of benevolence and 
kindness towards others, restraint, unselfishness and a desire to 
allow others to share in the good tbings of life, which virtues

of the Veda. To take only one example : though the Upanisads 
express Advaita in such Mabavakyas 'ahambrahmSsmi' (Ch. 
Up. HI. 14. 1 ), « tat-tvam-asi* (Cb. Up. VI. 8. 7 ), Madhvacarra 
could expound bis thorough-going diaita doctrine, could explain 
away by reasoning tbe above passages and claim to ba the only 
true expounder of Veda and denounce the adiaifa doctrine as 
Buddhism in disguise without any serious persecution on either 
side. Yajfiavalkya (II. 193) calls upon tbe king to safeguard 
the special usages of guilds and heretics and their modes of 
livelihood. This tolerance for multiplicity of forms and 
practices in religion and for diametrically opposed pbilosophio 
views has bad also its weakness viz it permitted the growth of 
endless variations in tbe formulation of faith, ritual and pbilo- 
sophio doctrines and led in great measure to several abuses, to 
some unhealthy and even revolting practices. 



SECTION IX 

CHAPTER XXXIV 

COSMOLOGY 

All writers on Dharmasastra are agreed on the existence of 
God. They rarely enter upon the task of adducing arguments 
for the existence of God. Christian theologians for hundreds of 
years put forward various arguments pointing to the existence 
of God. They are hriefly summarised in "William James' 
'Varieties of religious experience' p. 437 (ed. of 1920). The 
cosmological argument reasons from the ordered universe to a 
First Cause which must be conceived as God who must at least 
possess whatever perfection the universe itself contains The 
argument from purpose or design ( teleological argument) bases 
itself on the evidence of purpose or design in Nature and 
concludes that the First Cause (God) must be a creative intellect 
or mind. Then there are other arguments also such as the 
* moral argument ' (viz. the moral law presupposes a law-giver ), 
the argument ex consensu gentium (viz. there is widespread 
belief in God all over the worid and it should carry weight). 2 " 9

UU Ittalory of Dharmatastra t Sec. IX, Oh. XXX J.V 

The Upanisads speak of the Absolute brahman as the creator, 
preserver and destroyer of the bhulas (beings or elements or 
both ). For example, the Tai. Up. III. 1 { Bhrgu* 30 in instructed 
by his father Varuna) 'desire to know that from which all 
bhulas spring, by which, after being created, they live (are 
sustained) and to which they return and are absorbed therein; 
that is brahma '. This is the basic text on which V. S, 1. 1. 2 
(janmSdyasyayatah) is based. -This means 'from which the 
creation (sustenance and dissolution) of this (world) proceed ' 
( that is brahma). Another passage of the Tai. Up. (II. 1 ) states 
that 'from this Atman Akasa sprang, from akaSa Vayu, from 
Vayu Agni, from Agni waters, from waters the earth, from earth 
plants, from plants food, from food man '. A passage of the 
Chan. Up. states 2131 'all this, indeed, is brahma; a man, 
cultivating restraint of the mind, should meditate on that (world) 
as springing from, ending in and breathing on account of that 
(brahma)*. This is the basis of V. S. I. %. 1 (sarvalra prasiddho- 
padeiat). Here the three attributes of brahma are creator, 
preserver and destroyer of the universe. 

The Vedantasutra of Badarayana further says that iastras 
( sacred canon or texts) are the source of the correct knowledge

abandoned, since, according to him, these are preposterous absolutes. On 
the other hand Dr, F. W. Jones m bis work 'Design and purpose' (London, 
1942) puts forward the view that many people ar» in danger of losing sight 
of inc truth that the Cosmos is an ordered entity and that many have lost 
belief in the purpose of human life [p 13). The Ideological argument 
may strengthen the faith of a person who already believes m God, but it 
appears that it cannot create faith in God in the case of one who does ■* 
subscribe to that v.ew Abel Jones in 'In search of truth' (1945) holds 
that the three main arguments for the existence of God are cosmological, 
teleological and ontological,

their purport is to establish that brahma, which has been 

postulated (in V. S. 1 1. % ) as the creator, preserver and absorber 

of the world has that character and is omniscient and 

omnipotent. 

That the argument from design also was present to the 
minds of the propounders of Vedanta follows from the fact that 
the Tedantasutra (II. %. 1, racananupapattesca nanumanam ) 
denies that the Pradhana of the Sankhya ( that is postulated as 
acetana) can be inferred as the cause of the universe. 2433 

It may be noted hero that, according to j§ankaracarya, the 
detailed :B4 statements on the doctrine about creation contained 
in the Upanisads are not to be taken literally, that no special 
purpose dependent thereon can be found nor is such a purpose 
laid down by Sruti (Veda), but all those statements aTe intended

philosophers oscillate between the doctrine of the First Principle 
as immanent in the universe and the dootrine that God is the 
creator and is transcendent. The JRgveda and Upanisads appear 
to postulate the first doctrine according to which the Absolute 
enters into it when it creates the Universe (Tai. "Op. 1L6 Hat 
srslva tad-evanupravisat ' ), Ohan. Up. VI. 2. 1, VI 3.2, Br, 
Up. I. 4. 10. They also speak of God as ruling the Universe 
( antaryamin ) as in Br. Up. Ill 7. Kausitaki Up. III. 8. At that 
time there was no atomic theory. Eariy Greek thought also 
wavered between the two doctrines. Later on came the rival 
theory of cosmology in which atoms played a great part, that 
was adumbrated by Democritus ( died about 370 B. 0. aoc. to 
William James in ' Some Problems ', and explained by Lucretius. 
In India also the Vaisesikas put forward the theory that the 
world is paramanus (atoms). Kanada or Kanabhuk (lit. one who 
assumes or subsists on kanas, very subtle particles) is the reputed 
founder of the Vaisosika system. He does not expressly say 
anything about God. But later medieval writers on Nyaya- 
Vaisesika combined the two dootrines of God and atoms. .As the 
Tarkadlpikfi 3436 puts the theory it is as follows: when God desires 
to create, activity is produced among the atoms, two atoms join, 
dvyanuka ( dyad ) is produced, tryanuka is produced from threB 
dvyanukas and in the end the great earth is produced; of things 
created when God desires to bring about dissolution an aofivity 
is produced in the atoms. The atoms are eternal and infinite 
in number. 

Though there was almost universal agreement about the 

■ existence of God among the Dharmasastra writers, there was 

(as in the 2437 West) divergence about the names, nature an d

Nature and attributes of God 1487 

attributes of God. Most ware agreed that God is one without a 
second, iB spiritual (and not physical, though several people 
worshipped Him in the form of Siva or Visnu or Davl), im- 
mutable, omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, creator, holy, 
good and just &c. Difficult questions arise about belief in God. 
One or two may be mentioned r Is God omniscient in the com- 
pleted and strictest sense viz whether he could do anything what- 
ever as he likes or whether there are certain things which he 
cannot do. Another question is whether all existing things other 
than himself have been created by him or whether there are some 
things whose existence~is as ultimate as God's. All religions are 
faced with difficulties and therefore religion is a matter of faith. 

Though the Rgveda is full of the deeds of and prayers to 
individual Gods (such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Soma), 
the Rgveda contains several hymns and verses to the effect that 
the original Principle is only one, that it creates the world out of 
itself, enters into it and inspires it. In Rg. 1. 164 46 the sage says 
'the wise speak of the One existing (principle) under various 
names, they call it Agni, Yams, Mstarisvan ( wind god ) '. This 
is not a solitary verse. There are similar verses in the Rgveda. 
For example, Rgveda VIIL 58. 2 (a verse from the Vslakhilya 
bymns ) says 'The one fire is kindled in many places, the one Sun 
appears iu the whole wotW, the one Dawn shines over all this 
world and the One (Prinoiple, Spirit) beoame all this'. In Rg. 
2.90.2, it is declared 'all this universe is (in reality) the 
Purusa alone, (both) what has been and what will come into 
existence in future'. In Rg. II. 1. 3-7 Agni is identified with 
Indra, Visnu Brahma, Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, Tvastr, Budra, 
Dravmodas.Savitr and Bhaga. All these verses establish tha 
ultimately all plural ty is only a play of *ord Sj a mere name 
( Vacarambhanam vikaro namadheyam" as the Chan. Up VI 
Instates) and that unity is the only Reality and thaUhe

The mainpurpose of the hymn (X.72) is to describe the birth

Daksa was born from Aditi and Aditi from Daksa, that the gods 
were born after her (Aditi) and that from Aditi eight sons were

garbha (the Golden Egg) was born; and verse 10 identifies Win 
with Prajapati and verses 8 and 10 declare that waters were 
produced by him from which issues forth Hiranyagarhha(the 
Golden egg), which was Prajapati Himself. The second verse 
is quoted in n, 1440. Eg. X. 125 is a hymn placed in the mouth 
of Vak (speech), wherein speech is portrayed as a power even 
beyond the gods and as creative. Three (1,6,8) out of the 
eight verses may be rendered here *I move along with the 
Eudras and Vasus, with the Adityas and Visvedevas; I support 
both Mitra and Varuna, Indra and Agni and the two Asvins. 
I stretch the bow of Rudra in order to kill the enemy, the hater 
of brahma (sacred prayer); I cause war for men; I entered 
heaven and earth. I blow like the wind, producing all the 
worlds; 1 am beyond heaven and beyond this earth; by my 
greatness (power) I have become such a one'. Here one must 
liold that the sage is not referring to ordinary speech or language 
but to the conception that word has creative power and that it is 
one with God or was the thought uttered by brahman. 

Eg. X 129 (called Nasadlya-sukta from the opening words)

non-being) noT 'sat' (what is); there was no sky nor the 
heaven which is beyond ; what was it that covered all? Where 
was it and under whose shelter? Was there deep unfathomable 
abyss of waters?; (2) There was no death, hence nothing 
immortal ; there was no consciousness (distinction) of night and 
day ; that one breathed by its own nature ( power ) without there 
being any air, really nothing other than that existed ; ( 4 ) desire 
came into being, that was the first flow (seed, offspring) of the 
mind: (6) who knows directly, who can proclaim it here whence 
this oreation came into being , (7) He from whom arose this crea- 
tion, whether he made it or did not make it, the Highest seer in 
the highest heaven, he indeed knows or even he does not know ? 
It would be noticed that the sage, who was a poet and 
philosopher , proclaimed that there was that one Being, raised 
high above all gods, conditions and limitations ; he, the sage, 
gives expression to what he conceived to be the state before the 
creation of the universe. Night and day, death and immorta- ~ 
lity are opposites These exist only when there is manifesi- 
ness or creation and therefore he says ' there was no death, nor 
anything immortal' The hymn does not say that there was 
non-being out of which being grew. What he means is that 
That One alone breathed, the opposites, being and non-being, did 
not exist. For translations and remarks on this hymn, Vide

1492 History of Dharma&nstra [Seo.IXOh.XXirv' 

The creation hymns refer to a stags when there was no 
generally accepted theory about the origin of the world. But 
this much is clear that in the roost ancient times, at least some 
of the Vedic sages had arrived at the theory that there was only 
one Principle or Spirit, though called by various names and that 
it willed to create the world and created it from itself. 

Apart from the above-mentioned hymns that may be called 
creation hymns, the Rgveda contains many references to the 
creation or the support 2442 of heaven and earth by several gods 
and also creation of other things. In Jtg. X 89. 4 Indra is said 
to have made from heaven and earth on all sides as the axle does 
the wheels. 5g. I. IS 4. 4 refers to Visnu who single-handed 
supports the three, viz. the earth, the heaven (and antarifcsa) and 
all the worlds. Mitra is said to support heaven and earth ( Rg, 
HI 59. 1 ) and to bear all gods { ftg. IH 59. 8 J**' 3 . Brahmanas- 
pati (Lord of Prayer, Brhaspati) is said to have sent forth 
( blazed ) the births of gods like a blacksmith and that in the 
primeval times of the gods sat was born from asat. Soma is 
said ( Rg. VI. 47. 4 ) to have made the width of the earth 
and the loftiness of the heaven and supported the wide anta- 
riksa (mid regions) and in Eg. II. 40 (which is addressed 
jointly-to Soma-Pusan ) it is said that one of them (Soma) 
produced all worlds and the other (Pasan, the Sun ) goes over- 
seeing or marking, the doings of the whole world ( verse 5 ). 

In Rg. VH. 78. 3 dawns (plural) are said to have created 
the Sun, YajSa and Agni. This is metaphorical, since after 
each dawn the Sun rises, sacrificial fire is kindled into flames 
and sacrifice is offered. In $g. I 96. 2 Agni is said to be the 
progenitor of men. In Rg. H. 35. Z ( apam napat, grandson of 
waters i. e. Agni ) is said to have created all worlds. 

Heaven and earth ( as dual divinities ) have sis : hymns 
addressed to them in the *g. viz. I. 159-160 185, IV .56 , VI. 70 
VII. 53 ) and they are called 'rodasl' and sisters ( Rg. LM& » • 
They are al so called parents of the gods ( Bg. VHL OTLML&7).

Meaning of ' tisralj, prlhvih ' 1493 

The word ' antariksa' (atmospheric region) occurs at least a 
hundred times in the Rgveda. Sometimes we have phrases like 
( Usrah pHhwh ) meaning the three worlds including the earth 
( Rg I- 34, 8 ), while in other passages reference is made to 
lower, middle and highest prithivi as in Rg. 1. 108. 9 ( yad indra- 
gni avamasyam prthwyam madhyamasyam paramasyam uta sthah) 
meaning thereby the earth, antariksa and heaven. Antariksa is 
often called 'rajas' as the region of dust, mists and clouds 
in Rg. I 35. % and 9 ). 

In Rg. 1. 35. 6 is is said ' there are three dyaus (i. e. heaven, 
antariksa and earth), two are on the lap of Savitr (i. e. heaven 
and earth) and one (antariksa) is in the world of Yama. The 
sage explains in Rg. X 88 15 ' I have heard of two paths viz 
of the pitrs and of the gods and also of men ; the whole world that 
moves reaches that (region) which is between the father (heaven) 
and the mother ( the earth ) \ 

Varuna is said to have spread antariksa on forests, spread 
the Sun in heaven and Soma on mountains (Rg T. 85. 2). Even 
in the times of the Rgveda speculation had begun about the 
distance between heaven and earth. In Rg. 1. 155. 5 the poet 
says that no one dare soar up to the third step of Tisnu (i. e. 
heaven), not even the birds flying on their wings. In the 
Aitareya Brahmana the distance between the earth and heaven 
is put at one thousand days' journey for a horse iili 

In the Taittirlya Samhita Prajapati is frequently mentioned 
as creating the gods and asuras ( in. 3. 7. 1 ), as creating yajnas 
{1.6.9. 1), as creating people (II. 1. 2 1) andanimals (I. 5 9 7) 
and desmng to create praja and performing tapas for that 
(1H. 1.1.1). Tal .g. ( v. 6.4.2) states that all this in the 
beginning was water, a sea and that Prajapati becoming wind 
floated rapidly on a lotus leaf. 

The Atharvayeda has some hymns on creation. But they 
are verbose repetrtive and do not possess the depth, philosophy 
and terse style of the hymns of the Rgveda cited above In

forms of the highest, lowest and middling type that Prajapati 
created; how muoh is that in which he (Sfcambha) did not enter'? 
In Jig. IX. 86. 46 Soma made for sacrifice is spoken of as 
Skambha. Hymn 8 of kanda X (of Atharva veda) is styled 
' description of Jyestha-brahma ' ( the highest or oldest brahma ). 
Two verses from it may be cited ' Obeisance to that Jyestha 
Brahma that governs all, whether produced or to be produced, and 
' to whom alone heaven pertains. These two, heaven and earth, 
btand supported by Skambha; all this that has JUman, that 
breathes and blinks is Skambha Skambha literally means 
'support' or 'pillar'. The verbal form 'Skabhnati* occurs in 
Bg X 6. 3 and the word ' Skambha ' occurs Beveral times in the 
Bg. but not in the sense of 'creator'. In Atharva X. 8.2 
Skambha is mentioned twice, while in X. 7 M4S (of 44 verses) it 
occurs many times. Atharva X. 2 is called Brahmaprakasana 
hymn (of 33 verses). Numerous questions are asked in verses 
one to 19. In verses 20, 22, 24 questions are asked and verses 
21, 23, 25 give replies to them. One question and answer may 
be set out 'By whom was this earth made (or arranged), by 
whom was the high heaven placed, by whom was the sky placed 
above and crosswise and in various directions' 1 'Brahma made 
the earth, brahma is the heaven placed high, it is brahma that 
is the sky placed above, cross-wise and in various directions.' 
Verse 27 of Atharva X 8 is the same as Sv. Up. IV. 3 and identifies 
the creator with young and old, men and women and boy and 
girl. In Atharva X 8 several other deities also are mentioned 
but they are deemed to be comprehended in the Supreme Entity. 
In Atharva IX. % ( 25 verses) there is apotheosis of Kama, in the 
first eighteen verses of which there are prayers to Kama for 
vanquishing and driving away enemies, the last quarter of each 
of the verses 19 to 24 ends ' tasmai te Kama nama it krnomi 
(I offer obeisance to you, O Kama'). These six verses declare 
that Kama appeared first, that neither the gods, nor pitrs nor 
men reached Kama who is greater than heaven and earth, 
waters, Agni, the directions, all beingB that blink their eyes, tne 
sea- Vsta, Agni, the Sun and the Moon do not reach Kama.

Atharvaieda hymns on aeatum l* 9 ^ 

Atharva XIX 52 is a hymn 1 * 46 of five verses addressed to Kama, 
who is said to have appeared in the beginning and was the first 
flow of the mind, 

Atharvaveda XI. 4 (26 verses) is addressed to Prana, the 
fiTst verse being ' obeisance to Prana under whose domination is 
all this (world); he is the Lord of all and in him everything is 
centred (or established) 'and verse 13 3s * Prana is VirSj, PrSna 
is the directing poweT, all offer worship to Prana, Prana is 
indeed the Sun, the Moon and they (the sages) call him 
Prajapati'. 

In hymns 53 \ 10 verses ) and 54 ( 5 veTses ) of Kanda 19 the 
Atharvaveda appears to put forward Kala (time) as the first 
principle. Three of these are here translated. ' Tapas is placed 
in Kala, also the Jyestha Brahma, Kala is the Lord of all, he 
was the father of Prajapati; Kala created people, in the begin- 
ning Kala created Prajapati, Svayambhu (Brahma), Kasyapa 
and tapas sprang from Kala; from Kala were born waters, 
brahma, tapas and directions, sun-rise is due to Kala and it is 
merged in Kala ( at night ). ' 

The Sat. Br. in many places speaks of creation. A few 
passages only can be referred to here. The Sat Br. ( in "VI. 1, 1 ) 
starts by saying that 'in the beginning there was here the 
non-existent' and assarts that the non-existent was the sages, 
the vital airs and then it postulates Prajapati (made from seven 
vital airs) who desired 'May I be more, may I have progeny'. 
'He toiled and practised tapas, and being tired, he created first 
of all the Brahman, the triple lore (the ttaee Vedas), that Praja- 
pati then created waters from V"ak that is the world; that he 
(Prajapati) entered the waters with the triple lore and that 
thence an egg arose ; he touched it, then earth was produced 
and so on. 

In XI. 1. 6. 1 S. the Sat. Br. states "In the beginning this 
was water, only a sea The waters desired • How shall we have

progeny?* They toiled and practised austerities; while they 
were doing this a golden egg was produced, which floated for 
about a year, in about a year's time a Purusa, Prajapati, was 
born,; he broke ..open the egg; he created the Gods by (the 
breath of ) his mouth , he created Agni, India, Soma " &c. 

In XI. 2. 3. 1-2 the Sat Br. says — In the beginning this 
(universe ) was brahma, it created the gods, Agni, Vayu, Surya ; 
then a reference is made to name and form (nama rupe) by 
which he descends into the worlds and it is said 'these two 
( namarupe ) are the great manifestations of brahma*. 

This myth about a golden egg of the universe is developed 
from Bg. X 129 3 and X 121. 1 (Hiranyagarbhah sama- 
vartatagre) in the Ch Up. 1IL 19 1-2 'In the beginning this 
universe was asat (not unfolded), it became sat (began to 
unfold), it was born (i e it took form); then an egg was 
evolved, it lay (in waters) for the period of a year; then it broke 
up, the two halves were one of silver and the other of gold, the 
silver half is this earth and the golden half is heaven '. This is 
followed in Manusmrti as will be shown later on. 

It is stated in the Sat Br. X 4 2. 22-23 that Prajapati 
arranged the Bgveda in such a way that the number of syllables 
in the Bgveda come to 12000 BrhatI metres (each Brbatlhas 
36 syllables ). 

The Tai Br. states "Prajapati created Gods and asuras 
(II. 2. 3) hut he did not create Indra; the Gods said to him 
'create Indra for us'; just as I created you by means of tapas 
in the same way you create Indra, they practised tapas 
and they saw Indra (abiding) in themselves (i e in their hearts; 
they said to him «be born* ". In D.2.9 1 the Tai."« Br. states 
"this universe was nothing at all in the beginning; there was 
no heaven nor earth nor mid region; that non-existent created 
Mind with the thought 'let me be"*. In B. 6. .3 ! S the same 
Brahmana says " Prajapati created by the help of Veda the two 
forms 'sat* and «-*•". The Tai Br. in H. 8. 8 1 9-10 cries as 
Furonuvakya andYajya of purodasa and pnronuvakya of hav* 
as follows: 'Brahma prod uce d the Gods and all this worl d,

Creation from biahmun 1497 

the ksatriyas were produced from brahman and brahma trans- 
formed its form into brahmanas; (Yajya) 'these worlds abide 
inside brahman, similarly all this world is inside it; brahma is 
the best among all bhutas ; who vie or compete with it, brahman 
is thirty-three Gods, and all bhutas, all placed inside it as 
in a boat' 

In the Eausltaki Brahmana there aTe brief allusions to 
Prajapati. In VI. 1 it is stated * Prajapati, desirous of progeny, 
practised tapas ; while he was thus practising tapas five were 
born, viz. Agni, Vayu, Aditya, the Moon and TJsas as fifth; ' 
in VI 10 it is said 'Prajapati practised tapas; after having 
practised tapas, he produced this world (the earth) from praim, 
the mid regions from apana and the yonder world { heaven) from 
vijana; he then created Agni, Vayu and Aditya respectively 
from the earth, mid regions and heaven, and he produced rk 
verses from Agni, yajus tests from Vayu and saman tests from 
Aditya; in 53H. 1 it is asserted 'Prajapati is indeed yajfia, 
in which all desires, all immortality are centered ' ; in XXVIII. 
litis said 'Prajapati created yajna, the gods worshipped by 
means of yajfia, when it was created and thereby obtained all 
desired objects ' 214s 

The chief aim and purpose of the Brahmanas of the Veda 
are to prescribe the acts and parts of the ritual of various 
sacrifices, to set out some myths and legends for their origin 
and to postulate various rewards on the performance of nume- 
rous sacrifices. 

Prajapati, who is mentioned very rarely in the Rgveda 
(IV. 53 2 where Savitr is called Prajapati, IX 5 9 where Soma 
is called Prajapati, X 85 4 where in the marriage hymn Praja- 
pati is prayed to bestow offspring, X 169. 4 where Prajapati is 
invoked to bestow good cows, X 184 1 where Prajapati along 
with other gods and goddesses is invoked for the blessing of con-

to be' (koham-iti) and thereby Frajapati came to be called 
'Ka'. 2449 

The Ait. Br. states that Prajapati desiring to propagate and 
to be many and having practised tapas created the three worlds, 
earth, mid region and heaven from which arose three hghtB 
Oyotts"), Agni, Vayu and Aditya, from which arose the three 
Vedas &o. 

The Vedic Samhifcas and Brahmanas show that the popular 
belief about the individual self was that by good deeds the soul 
reaches heaven, becomes immortal and enjoys various joys and 
pleasures. Vide Rg. IX 113. 7-11, I. 125. 4-6, AtbarvalV. 34. 
2 and 5, VI. 120. 3. There was also the idea of retribution and 
recompense for evil or harmful acts done by one person to 
another. For example, the Sat Br. says (XJL 9. 1. 1 ) ' for what- 
ever food a man eats in this world, by the very same is he eaten 
again in the other world.' Vide also Sat. Br XI 6. 1 But when 
we come to the Upanisads, the whole intellectual atmosphere is 
changed The Upanisads frequently assert that Atman is the 
only reality, that there is nothing else and that the Atman can 
only be described as ' not this-not this ' i. e. the Atman is un- 
knowable. This is the firat and foremost aspect of Vedanta. 
But this lofty metaphysical conception clashed with the ideas 
of common people who thought that a real universe existed apart 
from the Creator. The higher philosophic minds had to concede 
the reality of the universe for common people. They were 
prepared to say that the universe exists, in truth, however.it 
is nothing but the Atman entered into the universe. They said 
that the world was phenomenal, not false or nothing, but the 
world had the Atman behind it This was the good aspect of 
the Vedanta viz. that the universe evolved from the first 
principle, biahma. They distinguished between sagum (quali- 
fied) biahman that was for prayer and worship (upasana), and 
for practical purposes (vyavaharavastha) and twgum { _un- 
qualified) brahma. But the higher thought also insisted that 
the highest truth (paramarthikasatya) is that brahman is one 
that everything in the world ( me n, animals, inorganic ma tter}

The Ait Up. quoted below is most emphatic about the identity MS0 
of the first principle with men, beasts, motionless beings and 
other passages do the same As regards the elements the Br. 
Up. has a long passage 24sl (HI. 7. 2-23) in which Yajnavalkya 
propounds to Uddalaka Aruni the sublime doctrine viz. that the 
Atman residing in the earth and other elements is inside them, 
whom they (the elements) do not know, whose body is the earth 
and other elements, who rules from within the earth and others, 
that that Atman is the soul of thee (and of mine and others), is 
the inner ruler and is immortal The last part of this passage 
is 'the ruler within is unseen but seeing, unheard but 
hearing, unperceived but perceiving, unknown but knowing, 
there is no other seer but he, there is no other hearer but he, 
that is no other perceiver but he, there is no other knower 
but he. This is the Self, the ruler within, the immortal

antaryami-brahmana has a parallel in Br. Up. II. 5 (Madhu- 
vidya). The ordinary man's conception of brahman as the 
creator was not, however, entirely given up by the thinkers in 
the Upanisads, though it was said that that concept was due 
to aviijiija ( ignorance about Reality ). Brahman conceived as 
creator was called Isvara (a personal God), though the worshipper 
might know that brahman in essence is above all conditions and 
limitations of personality. This is theism, which acknowledges 
three entities viz. a real world, the Paramatman (creative Stman ) 
and the individual self dependent on Paramatman. But the real 
thought of the Upanisads is centred round the non-difference 
of brahman and atman and the physical world. This thought 
that brahman entered into what are called individual souls and 
also the material universe is the third aspect of Vedanta. On 
Y.SH 3 43 Sankarscarya quotes passages from the Brahma- 
sukra belonging to the Atharvaveda 2452 -and from the Sv. Up. 
expressive of the identity with brahman of fishermen, slaves, 
gamblers, of men and women, of boys and girls and old men 
tottering on a staff The faith that the same Spirit animates 
the universe, from the stone, worms and beasts to man, is an 
elevating one, may make one feel that all creatures are brethren 
seeking the Creator and may, in a world dominated by 
egoism and urged to activities for individual prosperity and 
benefit, introduce some sweetness and consolation, Pausaen 
in 'The philosophy of the TJpanishads' {translated by A. S. 
Geden, Edinburgh, 1908) pays a glowing tribute to the sages of 
the Upanishada in the following eloquent passage 'It was here 
that for the first time the original thinkers of the Upanisbaos, 
to their immortal honour, found it (key) when they recognized 
our at man, our inmost individual being, as the Bialiman, the 
inmost being of universal nature and of all her phenomena

Upamsad passages en creation 1501 

about creation The Br "Op. 1. 4 ( in 3-4, 7 } has an original and 
significant passage on creation Some paTt of it is set out here 
'In the beginning this"was Atman alone in the form of Purusa ; 
He (being alone ) found no pleasure ; he desired to have a second 
(a companion) , he<became of the extent of a male and a female in 
close embrace , he made this very Atman fall aside in two parts 
that became husband and wife ; from them were born men and 
he produced lower-animals up to ants; this (universe) was then 
undeveloped (ot not unfolded), it was then developed in names 
and forms, that (Atman) entered into this up to the fingeT tips, 
just as a razor remains hidden in a sheath or just as the all 
supporting (fire) is not seen in wood*. In this passage the 
popular idea of the creation of the world is taken up and related 
to the one reality, Atman, and the emphasis appears to be placed 
on the theoiy that the sole leality is Atman, under the phantas- 
magoria of world phenomena. In Gh. Up VII. 10 1 it is said 
' this eatth, mid regions, heaven, gods and men, beasts and birds, 
grass and herbs, animals including insects, butterflies, ants. 
These aTe all nothing but waters in solid form.' The CMn. Up. 
( VL %. 3-4 and VL 3. 2-3 ) states " in the beginning Sat alone 
was existent, one without a second; it thought ' I shall become 
many, I shall have progeny"; it created heat (tejas), fromtejas 
waters were produced, from wateT food; that divinity proposed 
'I shall enter into these three divinities (heat, water and food ) 
with this living self and unfold name and form '. Here reference 
is made to three elements only viz teias, water, and earth 
( anna is produced from plants whicb spring from the earth ) It 
is not, however, proper to hold that only three were then 
recogmzed.these three were the most obvious and the other two 
Vayuand Akasa mentioned in Ait. and Tai. TJp. are elusive. 
The Ait. Up. (quoted in note 2451) begins "In the beginning 
there was here this Atman alone, there was nothing else that 
was active (lit. that opened and closed eyes); He reflected' I 
shall create worlds". He created these worlds, the ^t (water 

waters . Then the Up. proceeds: He created guardians of 

worlds and proposed to produce food for them. Thefhe reflected 

how can this frame subsist apart from me? Then he "fleeted 

by what way shall I enter into it * • Then ,t is stated S^f 



1502 Mistoru of marmaiaslra { Sec IX, Ch. XXXIY 

entered into it" and again in JX 7 ' in the beginning this \ras 
asat (not unfolded), then it became sat ( developed ), it unfolded 
itself'. This is the basis of V. S J. i. 26 (atmakrteh paria§mat) 
which establishes that brahman is both karlr (agent) and karmn 
(object) of creation. The same Up. in it 1 speaks of the 
creation of akasa from the .Stman, of Yayu from akasa, of Agni 
from Vayu, of waters from Agni and of the earth from waters 
Here we have five elements instead of three ( as in the Chan 
Up ), The Ait. Up. HX 3 names the five elements and calls 
them MahabhOtani (though the usual order is not followed }, 
so do Frasna VL 4, Sv. Up. U, IS, Eatha HL 15 (where the five 
gunas, sabda, sparsa, rfipa, rasa and gandha, each peculiar to the 
five elements from akasa to prfchvl, are mentioned). 21S3 

2453. Prof George Sarton in *A History of Science" (Hanard 
University Press, 1952 ) states (p. 247} that Empedocles born abont -!90 
B. C. (in Greece) postulated only fonr elements . fire, air, water and earth 
and that a £ftb, ether, was added by Plato and Aristotle. Vide also Introd- 
uction (p 11) to Plato's Timaeus { in Loeb's classical library. Vol. VII, cd 
of 19S2 ) translated by Rev K G. Bury. Plato's exuberant imagination 
constructed the physical -world on the pattern of geometrical figures most 
familiar to him and assigned the cnbe to earth and different kinds of triangles 
to fire, air and water (vide Jowett's translation of Timaeas, Vol III pp. 
638-639) The Greek philosophers relied on reason and not on ancient 
texts (as Indian sages did) and Plato's philosophy and cosmology were 
looked upon as the acme of wisdom even up to the 19th century, bnt Sarton 
( on p 420 of the above work ) remarks that modern men of science can 
regard it only as a monument of unwisdom and recklessness (rather a 
harsh judgment). Dr. W. M Smart in * Origin of the Earth ' remarks that 
in probing into the mystery of creation science has not been more secms. 
sf d1 than the poetic Hebrew expounders of cosmology ( pp S-9 ) Tor com- 
parison of ancient Indian ideas on cosmology with those of ancient Egyptians. 
Babylonians, Hebrews, and Greeks one may read a small book in the 
■ Corridors of Time' Series' Vol. I on 'Apes and men" by H. Peak and H J. «■ 
Fleare pp. 6-8 (Oxford. 1927) , on p 7 there is a figure of a Babjlomao 
tablet recording part of the creation story. On p 56 it slates that the 
probable place of the origin of man and the period at which human story 
Lean are matters of great speculation. The principal questions thit anse 
in cosmology are: (1) «hen were the earth and planets produced <2)*hat< S

Dissolution ofbhutas 1503 

"It has already been shown that in the Tai. Up and the 
Chan. Up (vide note 2430 ) it is stated that the bhfitas spring 
from and aie absorbed in brahman. The order of dissolution 
is the reverse of that of creation. This is stated by the 
Vedantasutra II 3 14 ( ' viparyayena tu krama$ta upapadyate ca ' ). 
Sankaracarya in his bhasya quotes a verse of the Santiparva in 
support of this. * iSi 

The theory of yugas, mahayugas, manvantaras and kalpas 
has already been dealt with in vol. HI. pp. 885-896 and above 
pp 686-692. The dissolution of the world was called pralaya 
wbioh was said to be of four kinds (vide above pp. 693-95 ), two 
of wbioh aTe runmtthka pralaya (which occurs at the end of a 
day of Brahma, that is equal to 1000 mahayugas) and Prakrtika 
(when everything including Praktti is dissolved in Paxamatman). 
The Gtt5( VIII. 17-18) and Manu I 73 state that the day of 
Brahma is equal to one thousand yuga3 and the night is also of 
the same duration, that all manifested things spring from the 
unmanifested (Pirst Principle) at the beginning of the day 
(of Brahma) and at the coming of the night (of Brahma) they 
merge in the same unmanifested (Principle). The -present 
author does not like the disagreeable task of comparing Sanskrit 
cosmology with the theories in other religious scriptures such as 
the Bible, but will only refer to some Western writers on that 
subject. About these ideas of creation and dissolution of the 
univem Rene Grousset in the work mentioned above observes 
(p. 96) 'the same power of synthesis appears in the ancient 
Indian cosmogonies which transcend in their breadth all that 
the Ionian philosophers or Lucreti us have left us. In them the

world alternates between periods of creation (which correspond 
to the activity of the Demiurge) and of dissolution (which 
correspond to the slumber of the God) '. Similarly, Gerald Heard 
remarks ( in ' Is God evident ' Faber and Faber, London, 1950 ) 
' Final and most helpful fact ib that Sanskrit cosmology not only 
gets rid of intellectual difficulties such, as the crude Hebrew 
Geology and Astronomy fossilized in the Christian dogmas, but 
it gets rid likewise of those more serious moral difficulties such 
as eternal damnation, pre-destination and that this life is man's 
only chance' (p. 51). 

The high metaphysical conception that in reality there is 
no universe outside biahman (i. e. brahman is one and is 
unqualified, mi guna) and the popular empirical conception that 
there iB a personal God who creates {saguna biahma) and real 
universe, often run together in the ITpanisads. The Prasna Up. 
V. 2 asserts that Om is both, pa? a (highest) brahma and apaia 
(other, lower) brahma. Sankaracarya on V S. I. 1. 12 
(anandamayosbhyasat) states that in the Upanisads brahman is 
described in two ways, (firstly ) as qualified by various adjuncts 
such as name and form and created objects and meant to be 
worshipped and (secondly) as devoid of all adjuncts (as meant 
to be mystically realized). As instances of the 2nd way 
( na upadliilca or nv qnna brahman ) he instances several passages 
viz. Br TJp. IV. 5. 15 ('where there is as it were duality, there 

one sees the other one touches the other or knows the other, 

hut wheie one has come to realize that all is only Atman, whom 
will one see, with what will one understand the knower himself). 
Br Up 111 9- 26 = IV. 4. 22 and IV. 5. 15 (this self is to be 
spoken of as 'not this, 'not this'), Br. Up. III. 8 8 (it is that 
imperishable one that the brahmanas speak about as neither 
coarse nor small, neither short nor long, neither red nor fluid, 
neither wind nor ether ..neither as having an inside nor outside 
&c); Chan. Up (VII. 24. 1 'where one sees nothing else, hears 
nothing else, understands nothing else that is the Infinite, 
where one sees something else, hears something else, understands 
something else, that is small (finite), the Infinite is immortal, 
the finite is mortal , the Infinite rests in its own greatness, or does 
not rest in greatness); Sv Up. VI. 19 (who is without parte, 
without activities, tranquil, faultless, without taint, the highest 
bridge to immortality, like a fire that has consumed its fuel ).

pasyati). The 4th aspect of Upanisadic thought is concerned 
with the destiny of the self after the death of the body and the 
matters that govern it ( i. e. Ethics and Eschatology). 

These passages emphasize that it is impossible to describe 
what brahman is and that we can only say what it is not, 
Sankaracarya 2455 on V. S. III. % 17 refers to the dialogue of 
Baskali and Badhva where Badhva declared the characteristic of 
brahman by his silence. Baskali said ' Sir, tell me about brahma '; 
then Badhva remained silent ; when Baskali asked a second and 
a third time Badhva replied * we have been telling yon indeed, but 
you don't understand; this self is still ( without any activity)'. 
J. Royce in 'The world and the individual' vol I. p. 148 is just 
like this^ episode of Baskali and Badhva "Believe not those 
prattlers' says one often quoted mystical work ' who boast that 
they knowGod" Who knows Him is silent". Sankaracarya 
puts the distinction between para-brahma and apara-brahma 
(personal God) as follows: Where texts reject the connection 
of brahma with names and forms that aTe the product of avidyS 
(nescience) and speak of brahma in negative expressions such 
as ' asthula' (not gross or big ), there it is parabrahma (that is 
meant), but where in such passages as 'He is mind, hasprana 
or body the form of light, whose thoughts are true, whose nature 
is like akasa (present everywhere), who creates everything ' &c 
brahma is mentioned for worship and it is apara. 2ts6

t»H « h ° des °^ tio ! 1 of the creati ° n * ;H» universe and its disso- 
lutJon are valid only on the practical plane. In AdvattavlZ^ 

(the highest the absolute, vyavaharikl (of practical life) aD d 
pratibhasikl (apparent or illusory). The first is the province of 
parg-vidya which teaches that only the Stman exists, that the 
cosmos exists within the Atman and nothing else has intrinsic 
reality apart from it. Brom this high metaphysical standpoint 
tHere is an reality no creation nor dissolution, the individual self 
is not really in bondage, therefore none is liberated. The 2nd 
kind of reality is empirical and practical and the dogmas of the 
creation and dissolution of the world, of the individual self, its 
bondage,_transmigaration and final liberation are valid only for 
the apara-vidya. Most religions postulate three fundamental' 
entities viz God, individual self and the external world. 
These three are true but only up to a certain limit ( only so long 
as a man holds his own ego as a separate reality) but these 
three are not the ultimate Truth. Even in this lower kind of 
reality, a man who is in deep sleep becomes (for a time) united 
with ( or absorbed in) the True as stated by the Ohan. Up. VI. 
8. 1 (yatraitat purusah svapiti nama sata somya tada sampanno 
bhavati). The third kind of reality pertains to dream state. 
One may have experience of pleasure and pain and misery from 
what one sees in a dream, which are real as long as the dream 
lasts, but all this that is seen in a dream vanishes the moment 
the man is awake. As stated above (p. 1485 and note Z434) the 
descriptions of the creation of the world have only this in view 
that there is non-difference between oause and effect and that 
they all lead to a correct understanding about brahman. 
Sankaracarya on V. S II. 3. 30 extends the same reasoning to 
individual selveB ( to be quoted later on under ' Karma and 
transmigration * ). 

In the Upanisads there is apparent discrepancy as regards 
what was created and the order of the things 2iS7 created. The 

2457. It may be noted that the creation of the universe is put in the 
Upanisads in the distant and dim past, not at a definite date as fixed by 
Biblical chronology ( 400+ B.C.). Vide Fringle-Pattison in " Idea of God ' 
(ed of 1917) p 299. H. D Anthony in 'Science and its background' 
(MacMillaa, 1948, p. 2 ) states that James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh, 
in the 17th century introduced into the Anglican Church theyear 4004 B.C. 
as the date of creation On the medieval Christian doctrine, creation is 
only an incident in God's existence and man is made in the image of God 
and it is by the breath of God that man became a living soul ( Genesis I 2? 
and II. 7 ). There is another point that distinguishes Christian doctrine 
about man from the Vedanta doctrine, according to the former man Is 
conceived and born in sin, according to the latter the human soul is divine. 



Upanisad passages on fa ah man 1507 

Br. Up. { V. 5. 1 ) states ' in the beginning there were only waters ; 
the waters created satya, which' is bralima, brahman created 
Prajapati, who created the gods'. Li Chan. Up. VI. 2. 3 the thing 
expressly mentioned as the first creation is terns ( heat ), akasa 
not being mentioned at all, while in the Tai. Up. 3X 1 akasa is 
said to have been first created and then Vayu ( was created from 
akasa), then Agni from Vayu. Similarly, in the Chan. Up. IV. 2 
where the creation of tejas, waters and food (i e. the earth ) is 
expressly mentioned, nothing is said about the creation of Vayu, 
which is set out in Tai. Up. IL I. This matter about the 
oreation of the elements and their order is discussed in V. S. II. 
3. 1-11. The reply of Sankaracarya is that a $ruti passage like 
the one in Ch. Up. is concerned only with the creation of some 
elements like fpjas and cannot he also interpreted as having a 
second purpose, viz showing that the creation of akasa in Tai. 
Up. is wrong and should be discarded. 24SS 

On the subject of creation, the question arises whether the 
individual Self is also a oreation like that of the earth, trees 
and shrubs. The Upanisads have a good deal to say on this. Here 
also two kinds of texts have to be considered In the first place, 
some texts seem to state that the individual selves spring from 
the Supreme Spirit A few passages that are sometimes relied 
upon for this last matter may be cited here 2 < 59 The Br. Up. 
states 'just as tiny sparks spring forth from fire, in the 
same way from this Atman spring up all pranas, all worlds all 
gods and all creatures'. The Mundaka Up. expands this same 
idea as follows • As from a well-kindled fire sparks of the same 
nature spring forth in thousands, so from the Imperishable 
various living beings issue and return into it. The Smrti of 
Yaj. cites the same illustration of fire and sparks Another and 
perhaps apter illustration is in the Katha Up 'just as pure water 
poured m (other) pure water becomes like it (i. e not distingui-

shable ), so the self of the wise sage becomes ( indistinguishable 
from the Supreme Essence). 1 On the other hand, there are 
numerous Upanisad 2 " passages which categorically state that 
the individual self is unborn, untiring, is not a product, that 
the Supreme Spirit enters as individual self, that there Jb non- 
difference between the one Supreme Spirit and the individual 
self. Some of these passages are set out in the note below. All 
those passages are cited by Sankaracarya on V, S II. 3, 17, 
which states two propositions viz the individual self is 
unproduced and that it is eternal according to Sruti passages 
(nstmSsruter-nltyatvacca tabhyah). How the one Supreme 
Spirit expands into and pervades the manifold universe of 
plurality is a great mystery and can only be explained by 
illustrations. The few passages in which the texts SBem to 
mention the creation or dissolution of individual selves are to be 
understood as referring to the Upadhis (such as body and mind) 
by which the self is affected. Yajnavalkya gives this answer 
in finally winding up his exposition to Maitreyl 2461 'this self 
is imperishable and indestructible; but (when one speaks of 
death what is meant is ) that the self has no longer any contact 
with material elements'. The Santiparva 2162 and the QM 
( II. 20, 21, 24, 25 ) say the same thing. 

The highest metaphysical standpoint can be realized by 
only a few. For millions of men, the empirical standpoint alone 
remains and it is for them that texts speak of a personal God, 
ritual and sacrifices; they are only on the first rung of the ladder

to enlightenment and are only dimly aware of God ; there is a 
much smaller class of people other than the preceding, who 
pray, seek God and come to realize that God is hoth immanent 
and transcendent; there is a third class of a very few people, 
the great sages and masters, the spiritual elite such as Sankara- 
carya. who reach the peak of pure monism, who lose the sense 
of the ego and who are ripe for entering into union with the 
One and they cannot and should not say that the individual soul 
and the physical world are all unreal (or Maya). Both 
Badarayana ( V. S II. Z 29 ' Vaidharmyao-ca na svapnadivat ' ) 
and Sankaracarya are agreed that the ordinary physical world 
is entirely different from dreams and that the impressions in the 
waking state are not independent of existing objects. Apart 
from the question whether the word 'Maya' used in V. S. Iff. 2. 
3 ( Maysmatram tu &c.) is used by Badarayana in the sense in 
which Sankaracarya understands it, it cannot be denied that 
Upanisad passages like Katha Up. II. 4 2, Prasna 1, 16, Chan 
Up. VI11. 3. 1-2, the prayer in Br. Up. I. 3. 28 (asato ma 
sadgamaya &c) could easily suggest the doctrine of Maya and 
lead to it as an intelligible development. Hence the proper 
language for almost all men is not to speak about the world as 
Maya ( illusion ). If the individual soul and the world are unreal, 
then it may be argued by one who does not subscribe to the 
doctrine of Maya as against those who hold it that you are 
teaching that an unreal soul has to escape from an unreal 
Samsara and secure what you call moksa by means which are 
themselves unresl (such as Upanisad study) and that therefore 
moksa itself is unreal. How the one Reality becomes many 
and expresses itself in the ever-changing physical world is 
really an inexplicable mystery, but that does not entitle all of 
us to say that the world is unreal or a dream. The few hfehlv 
phi osophical men may say that what is real is the one Absolute 
that all else is only an appearance of that Absolute. Common

world is non-difforont {ananya) from hrahman, what is meant in 
not that tho two are identical, but only this that the solves and 
the world aro not entirely different from hahman. When it is 
naid that Moksa results if one realises brahman, there is no 
quostion of the destruction of tho world but all that it comes to 
is that tho false idea or outlook in that case is displaced or 
sublated by a true one. How the finite world arises from the 
Infinite is a mystery, for which SankarScurya employs the word 
'Maya'. But ho is positive that till a person realizes tho one 
Atman all religious and worldly courses of life, real-unreal, 
go on unobstructed. Tho concept of Maya as postulated by 
Sanlcaracarya ( on V. S. IL 1. 14 and other places) is one of tho 
most misunderstood elements of Vedinta. Ifarther, it should not 
bo forgotton that a very large number of philosophically minded 
Hindus do not advocate the doctrine that the world is an illusion; 
all that is said by advaitins is that tho world is not as real as the 
Absolute is. Tho passages quoted bolow from Sankaraoarya's 
Ehasi/a clarify hiB position, which is this. There is the physical 
world with its manifold distinctions, but it must rest on some- 
thing else; that something is called tho absolute brahman. The 
relation between the two is inexplicable and therefore it is 
apokon of as Maya. In that way SankarScarya j"b agnostio, 
while other religious philosophers are not willing to admit the 
futility of theories or their helplessness to put forward a 
gonorally acceptable and reasonable theory of the relation of 
tho universe and the Eternal Spirit behind it. 

It should not be forgotton that, according to our sastras the 
goals of human life aro four, Dim ma (an ethical life of doing 
what is right), Artlia (a life of acquisition of wealth i. e. 
economic life based *on justioe), Kama (a life of the enjoyment 
of innocent pleasures and right desires) and Mok$a (liberation), 
this last being the highest goal to be attained only by a few 
people (it is called ParamapuinsaUha). Even in the ttgveda 
(I. 89. 8) the sage prays for physical healt h,""* happiness an d

to hear words of welfare ( i. e. we may not suffer deafness till our 
death), may .we see with our eyes pleasing sights, may we, 
engaged in praising you and possessing strong limbs and bodies, 
enjoy (long) life as fixed by God (i. e. 100, 116 or 1?0 years)'. 
Vide also Rg. VII. 66. 16. The Manusmrti, after referring to 
several views about th<3 number of the goals of human life, states 
its own final conclusion (in IL 224) that there are three goals 4635 
( Dharma, Artha and Kama ) for all men and condemns premature 
resort to sannyasa in the following words ( VI. 36-37 ) "Having 
studied the Vedas as laid down in sastras, having produced sons 
and having performed sacrifices according to one's ability, one 
should fix his mind on Moksa (liberation); if a man desires 
Moksa without having performed these duties he falls into hell'. 
Manu emphasizes that a man must discharge his duties ( i. e. 
pay off the three debts) as laid down in Tai. S.VL 3.10.5 
( quoted in H. of Dh. vol IL p. 270 n. 621 ) before he can renounce 
the world. The experience of sexual life and other pleasures not 
opposed to righteousness was not condemned by Manu and other 
Sastras and in the Bhagavadglta ( VH. 11) Lord Krsna identifies 
himself with Kama that is not in opposition to righteousness. 
Inthethree goals™* of ordinary human life there is hardly 
anything that should cause surprise. The Glta demands a life 
dedicated to active work and regards doing one's duty as worship 
(in. 8, 19, 20, 25, IV. 18, XVLTL 65-86 ). The 4th goal ( moksa ) 
is in a way opposed to the first three. But the first three goals 
enable a man to attain liberation, after he has discharged

as preparation ( Br. Up. IV. 4. 22). Because the Upanisads often 
employ the words "Brahma veda brahmaiva bhavati" (as in 
Mundaka III 2. 9 ) one should not run away with the idea 
that mere knowledge of brahma (from books or a teacher) is 
enough. Though the verb "vid" (to know) is employed, the 
Upanisads are emphatic that before one attains realization of 
brahma one must have lived a life of detachment, peace, self- 
restraint etc. For example, in Br, Up. IV*. 4. 23 Yajfiavalkya says 
to Janaka "Therefore, one who knows this (under tarka quoted 
above p. 1478 ) evil does not overcome him, he overcomes all evil 
and hence he becomes free from evil, free from rajas (desires), 
free from doubts, he becomes a (true) Brahmana. This is the 
Brahma-world. O king I you have been made to reach the world. 
So said Yajfiavalkya." This passage clearly emphasizes three 
stages, firstly, verbal knowledge about brahma (evam-vid), secondly 
he becomes santa, danta&n., thirdly, he realizes the non-difference 
of himself and the world from the Supreme Self. In this text 
the indeclinable past participle M « (bhutva) in "tva*. ace. to 
Panini III. 4. 21, is used and so cleariy conveys that (as Sanskrit 
grammar and usage require), in order that a person may realize 
the Self in his own self, he muBt have been already endowed with 
all that precedes the word " bhutva ". 

Similarly, in the Mundakopanisad it is provided iiela ' After 
carefully examining all the worlds that are collected (gained or 
brought about) by actions, a brahmana should reach a sense of 
disgust or disregard with the thought that by actions (which 
are all impermanent ) nothing that is imperishable (lit. unmade) 
can be attained, he should, for the special understanding of that, 
approach with fuel in hand a teacher who is learned m the 
Veda and who solely dwells in brahman, that wise (guru) declared 
brahma-mdya to the one who thus properly (respectfully) app- 
roaches and whose mind is quiescent (not perturbed by vanity 
&c. ) and whose mind has ceased to hanker after ^objects , o ! sense, 
whereby the disciple would realize the immutable Reality the 
Ma (Self).' Here also the word » pariksya^hows^ 
~1^7T,de Sahara on Jalmmt X. 3.48 • ktvaTivat purvaKla eva 



Moral p) eparatfon for brahmaoid 1513 

brahmavidyS can be attained only by him who already has 
become tired of the world of senses. It is further provided that 2468 
when a man becomes freed from all hankerings that clmg to the 
heart of man, he becomes immortal and attains brahma in this 
very life. The Br. Up ( iv. 4. 6 ) states that of him who does not 
desire, who, not desiring, is freed from desires, who feels that 
he has obtained all desires in that he desires only the Self, the 
life breaths do not depart towards higher worlds ( heaven etc. ) as 
he, being (in reality ) brahma only, becomes absorbed in brahma. 

The Katha "Op. ( 2 24) remarks 'He, who had not ceased 
from evil conduct, whose mind is not serene, who does not pra- 
ctise concentration, wonld not be able by mere knowledge to find 
the JLtman.' 

The unalloyed Upanisad doctrine appears to be that, even 
when a man does good actions, they produce good results, to 
enjoy which the soul would have to undergo the bondage of 
fresh good births and thus liberation will be put off. Therefore, 
complete renunciation of all actions and their rewards was in- 
culcated for the sannySsin, who was to give up all desires for 
wealth, progeny and higher worlds and beg for alms as long as 
the body lasts. As no other course of conduct for the sannyasin 
is specified here, it would have to be deemed that the Upani<=ad 
teaches only this mode of life for the sannyasin. This view' is 
further strengthened by other passages of the Upanisads, where it 
is sajd that the liberated are beyond sukrta ( good deeds and their 
consequences) and duskrta (evil deeds and their consequences). 
The Chandgoya says «« « the self is a hank ( a dike or ridge ) so

In this way tho Upanisads appear to inculcate that the 
sannyasin should completely give up all actions except living 
till the hody lasts. The Jabalopanisad 2 " (4) provides that the 
very day on which a person hecomes disgusted (with worldly 
life) he should become a wandering ascetic (a sannyasin). This 
emphasizes that not mere knowledge but disgust with worldly 
life is necessary before one becomes a sannyasin. Vide Katho. 
panisad (II. 24) quoted above in note 2467 a. The Frasnopanisad 
emphasizes ' to them alone comes the pure world of brahman, in 
whom there is no crookedness, no untruth and no duplicity ' 
(X 16 ). The Upanisads sometimes do say that ' one who knows 
brahma becomes brahma itself ( Mundaka II. S. 9 ), but the same 
Upanisads (e. g. Mundaka I. 2. 12-13 quoted in n. 2467a) require 
great moral and spiritual attainments besides mere knowlegde 
of brahma. 

It is not necessary to set out more Upanisad passages to 
exhibit the proper relation between mere knowledge of brahma 
and Realization of brahma. 2471 

In classical Sanskrit several words are employed to describe 
the state of liberation. The Amarakosa regards mukti, kaivalya, 
nirvana, sroyas, nihsreyasa, amrta, moksa and apavarga 
as synonyms. Mukti, moksa, and amrta (or amrtatva) are 
frequently employed in the Upanisads and the Glta. They refer 
to the state of Salvation or Liberation from different points of 
view. Man is liable to have hankerings and to birth and death, 
therefore when the soul becomes free from that cycle and realizes 
brahma it is said that he becomes immortal or secures immor- 
tality. Vide Br. Up. VX 4. 7 and 14, V. 15-17 ( Vidyayamrtam- 
asnute), Chan. Up. 11.23. 2 (he who is firmly grounded in 
brahma attains immortality), Katha Up. VI. 2 and 9, Svet. Up.

Sanskrit v)ords for Liberation 1515 

IV. 17 and 20, HL 1, 10, 13, Gita 13. 12, 14. 20. Mukti and 
moksa are both derived from the root 'roue' (to be free) and 
the verbal forma of ' imtc' are frequently used along with 
'immortality* as in Hatha Up. VI. « 8 (yam jfiatva raucyate 
jantur-amrtatvam ca gacchati) and 14, Br. "Up. IV. 4. 7, Sv. Up. 
1.8 and IV. 16 (jfiatva devam mnoyate sarvapSsaih). The 
word moksa occurs in Sv. Up. IV. 16 and Gita 5. 28, 7. 29, 18. 30. 
Nihsreyasa (moksa, than which there is nothing better) occurs in 
Kaus. Up IU. 2, Gita V. 2. Vide p. 1037 n 671 for ' nihireyasa '. 
The word ' sreyas' often means * better ' in the Upanisads ( Tai. 
Up. 1. 11 and Chan. Up. IV 6.5) and Gita 1X7,31, 13135, 
XVUI.47 &c.,but in Hatha Up H. 1 and 2 sreyas (as opposed to 
preyasi.e. pleasure) Teally means 'nihsreyasa* (salvation). 2472 
Kaivalya does not occur in the principal Upanisads, but kevalah 
( not affected by gunas ot isolated as pure consciousness ) occurs 
in Sv. Up. IV. 18 and VL 11 ( saksi ceta. kevalo nirgunasca ) 
Nirvana occurs in Gita VI. 15 (the yogin, that has subdued his 
mind and always practises yoga, secures peace, centred on me 
that is highest nirvana); in Gita 11.72 andV. 24-25 we find 
•brahmanirvanam' which means 'bliss inbrahma'. Apavarga 
occurs only in the Maltri Upanisad VL 30 and was the goal laid 
down by the very fast sutra of the Nyayadarsana. 

It should be noted that cosmology whether in the Upanisads 
or later works is based on the geocentric theory and is concerned 
mostly with the earth, the elements, the Sun, Moon, planets and 
stars in general (without details ). 

The Mannsmrti has several theories on creation. In I. 
5-19 we have the first theory: this (universe) existed in the 
form of darkness, was unperceived, destitute of distinctive signs 
not subject to reasoning, unknowable, immersed in deep sleep 
as it were. Then the divine Self-existent appeared with 
irresistible power, dispelling darkness and making all this 
including the great elements discernible; he shone forth of his

world. He is called Nar5yana, 31 *> since waters, designated as 
na, as ( offspring of tf ara ), were his first place of residence. From 
that first cause, not yet unfolded, which can neither be called sat 
nor asat, was produced a puiusa (a male) who is called by 
people Brahma. In that egg the divine one resided for one year, 
he divided the ogg into two parts after reflecting on that matter • 
out of those two hatveB { of the egg ) he created heaven and 
earth, between these two middle region, the eight directions and 
the abode of waters (the sea) From himself he drew forth mind 
which is neither sat nor asat, from mind Ahankara (self-con- 
soiousness), and the wiafcaf-atman, all products produced by the 
combinations of three gunas, the five organs of sense which 
perceive the objects of sense; He created all beings by joining 
the subtle particles of the six (ahankara and tanmatras) with 
portions of himself, the five great elements enter the framer of 
all beings. This theory combines the ideas contained in $g. 
X. 129 (particularly verses 1-3) with those in the Sat. Br. XL 
1. 6. 1 and Chan. Dp. III. 19. 1-2 (about the golden egg) and 
with the Sankhya theory of tattvas and gunas, though Mann 
differs from the standard Sankhya of the Karika as regards the 
order in which Mahat, Ahankara and the five subtle elements 
arise. In X 21 Manu states 2474 that Hiranyagarbha in the

beginning of creation assigned names, peculiar activities and 
conditions to all created beings by means of the words of Veda. 
In this it follows a sruti text ( explaining B.g. IX. 62. 1 ) quoted 
by Sankaiacarya (on V. S. 1. 3. 28 ) who quotes a verse in support 
from the Mahabharata and another verse also (the source of 
which is not mentioned hut which is found in some puranas). 

Another theory of creation is stated in Manusmrti L 32-41. 
Brahma divided his own body into two halves, one half a male 
and the other a female and from that female he created Viraj, 
who practised tapas and created a male who was no other than 
Manu ( promulgator of Manusmrti ). Manu desirous of produ- 
cing created beings, first created ten great sages as Prajapatis, 
who created seven Manus, Gods, classes of gods, great sages, 
yaksas Taksasas, gandharvas, apsarassa, snakes, birds classes of 
pitrs, lightning, clouds, large and small stars, monkeys, fishes, 
cattle, deer, men, liona, worms, insects, flies, immovable things 
(trees etc.). This account appears to be inspired by the 
Purusasukta (Bg. X 90), particularly verses 5, 8-10. 

A third theory of creation by Brahma after he awakes from 
his sleep is briefly noticed in Manusmrti J. 74-78, viz. he creates 
( or appoints ) his mind which impelled by Brahma's desire to 
create, produces akasa ( ether), of which sound is the (peculiar) 
quality; that ether modifying itself creates "Vayu possessing ine- 
quality of touch; from Vayu arises refulgent light, from which 
arises water and from water arises the earth of which the 
special quality is smell. This theory is a modification of the 
Sankhya doctrine, according to which (karika 35) all five ele- 
ments proceed from ahanlara and God Brahma is thrown in ( who 
has noplace in standard Sankhya). The Manusmrti is in the habit 
of stating opposing views on the same topic one after another; 
e. g note on the use of flesh in Manu V. 27-46 as compared 
with V. 48-56, Manu BX 13 as compared with Ht. 14-19 ( on 
brahmana having a siidra wife), Manu IX. 59-62 as opposed to 
IX 64-68 on the practice of Nujoga 

Accounts of creation occur frequently in the Mahabharata 
mostly in the Santiparva. All cannot be set out here, but a few 
would bo described. Chap. 175. 11-21 ( =Ch. ed, 182 11-21 \ 
states that from God known as Avuakta all beings were born he 
first created mahan also called akasa, from akasa wX was 
produced from water were produced fire and vayu from Z 
combination of these two the earth was produced ' Then h 



!Sl8 History of Dltarmainstra [ Seo. IX, Ch. XXXIV 

self-existent created a lotus, from which arose Brahma, known 
as Ahankara and he produced the whole world. In chap, 176 
(183 of Oh. ed.) it ia stated that Brahma first created water, 
from water arose Vayu, from the combination of water and Vayu 
arose Agni and earth was produced from the combination of 
Agni, Vayu and akasa. Chap. 177 ( =184, Oh. ed. ) explains that 
the Mahabhutas (great elements ) are five viz vayu, akasa, agni, 
water and earth, that all bodies are made of these five, that there 
are five mdrtyas, five objects of Bense and five qualities, sabda, 
sparsa (touch), rupa (colour), rasa (taste) and gandha (smell); 
subdivisions of each of these five are mentioned. Chap. 178 
( =189 of Oh. ed. ) speaks of the five pranas and the spheres of 
their activities. Ohap. 179-180 ( =186-187 of Ch. ed ) deal with 
jlva (individual self) and states at the end that the body is 
perishable, that the self passes from one body to another and 
that by yoga one can see the self in the Highest Self. Ohap. 200 
( =207 Oh. ed. ) states that Purusottama created the five elements, 
that he reclined on waters, that from his navel sprang a lotus 
brilliant like the sun, from which arose Brahma, who created 
from his mind seven sons, Daksa, Marlci, Atri, Angiras, 
Pulastya, Pulaha and Exatu. Daksa had many daughters (the 
eldest being Diti), from these daughters Daityas, AdityaB, the 
other gods, Kala and its parts, the earth, the four varnaa, all kinds 
of men, Andhras, Pulindas, Sabaras and others in Daksinapatha 
and in the Uttar&patha, Yauna ( Yavanas ), Kambojas, Gand- 
haras, Kiratas, Barbaras and others were produced. Chap. 224 
( =231 Oh. ed.) starts by saying that in the beginning there was 
brahma, beginningless and endless, unknowable and proceeds 
to divisions of time from mmesa to the yugas and their charac- 
teristics. Herein occur verses that are the same as in Manusmrti 
I. 65-67, 69-70, 75-77, 81-83, 85-86. It is difficult to say who 
borrow as even the Manusmrti ( in X. 44 ) ment ions Paundrakas, 
Odras, Dravidas, KSmbojas and Yavanas, Sakas, Paradas, 
Pahlavas, Oinas, Kiratas, Daradas and Khasas, as having been 
originally sub-divisions or sub-castes of Ksatriyas (Ksatriya- 
jatayah ) but reduced to the position of sudras, because of losing 
all contact with brahmanas (X. 43 ) and because of the cessation 
of religious rites ( like Upanayana &c. ). In ganti 311 ( =or. ed. 
299) creation is described in Sankhya terms with Brahma 
thrown in. Brahma (identified withmoAare) was born m H» 
golden egg, he remained inside the egg for a year, then W 
created within the two parts of the egg (heaven and jrfhj 
antariksa, from ahankara five elements were produced and tww

five qualities are mentioned. Isvamedhika (Chap. 40-42 is 
similar to Santi 311) states the order of creation as avyakta- 
mahat-ahankara-five elements, the only peculiarity being that 
in veTse fcrnahan is identified with Visnu, Sambhu, buddhi 
and several other words are given as synonyms thereof. 

The Smrti of Yaofiavalkya (HI. 67-70 ) states that from the 
one Self, many individual selves arise just as from a red-hot 
iron ball sparks go ont, that the unborn and imperishable 
Atman is said to be born when connected with body, that in the 
beginning of creation, Paramatman creates the five elements, 
ether, vSyu, tejas, water and earth, each succeeding one posses- 
sing a rising series of qualities and when appearing as indivi- 
dual self, it receives (for body) the same elements. Then after 
pointing out how a human being is conceived, how the foetus 
grows in the womb and describing the anatomy (with number 
of bones, veins, arteries, muscles &c.) of the human body, the 
Smrti avers that the whole world proceeds from the PaTamatman 
and the individual self appears from the elements (which form 
the body) The individual self is beginningless 2475 and is not 
born, but it comes in intimate contact with a body that is due 
to acts influenced by false ideas, hankerings and aversions 
(IH. 135) Prom the several parts (mouth, arms, thighs, feet 
&c ) of the First Principle that assumes numerous forma arise 
the four varnas in order, the earth, heaven, pranas, directions, 
Vayu, Agni, Moon (from mind), the Sun (from His eye), sky 
and the whole movable and immovable world (HI. 126-138). 
Here the Purusasukta (£g. X 90 1 and 12-14) is closely 
followed. 

The Puranas devote thousands of verses to the theories of 
cosmology and cosmography. Only a very brief summary is all 
that can be attempted from the contents of a few among the 
extant Puranas that have been shown above to be the earliest 
viz. Matsya, Vayu, BrahmSnda, Visnu and Markandeya. It has 
been stated above (pp, 838-840) that the topics with which 
Fuvanas were deemed to be concerned were according to th B 
Amarkosa five and that some of the Puranas themselves set out 
the five topics as creation (sarga), recreation after dissolution 
[prahsarga), dynasties (vamsa), the vast periods of time (called 
Manvantaras), an a history and deeds of the descendants of the 



1520 Htstot y of Dhai matush a [ Sec IX, Ch. XX5.1V 

aolar, lunar and other dynasties ( Vamsanucarita). Thus, many 
of the Puranas deal with creation at some length, A few 
striking theories and passages alone can be set out or cited. 

The Matsyapurana begins the topic of creation in the same 
way as the Manusmrti does and some of the verses of the former 
are identioal (or almost identical) with the verses of the 
Manusmrti. 2476 The Matsya (2 27) states; Narayaua alone 
appeared first and being desirous of creating the manifold world, 
produced from his body waters, cast the seed therein and a 
golden egg emerged ; inside that egg the Sun appeared, he is 
called iLdiiya as well as Brahma, he made the two halves of the 
egg into heaven and earth and produced all directions and the 
sky between the two (heaven and earth). Then the Mem and 
other mountains and the seven seas (of salt, sugarcane juice &c.) 
were produced. Narayana became Prajapati who created all 
this world including gods and asuras The 3rd chap, of the 
Matsya speaks of the Vedas, Puranas and Vidyas as proceeding 
from hia lips and states that he created from his mind ten sages, 
Marlci, Atri and others (3.5-8). Then the Matsya launohes on 
the Sankhya scheme of creation (in 3. 14-29 ), stating ttiat the 
three gw^as are sattva, rajas, tamas, and the state of their equili- 
brium is called Pralcrh, that some call it Piadhana, others call 
it Avyakta, that this Pradhana produces creation, that from the 
three gunas rose Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara; that from 
Pradhana arose Mahan, from the latter ahankara, then five 
JSanendriyas and five Karmendriyas and the mind as the 11th 
sense and the five tanmatras (subtle elements); that akasa was 
m-oducedfrom the sabda-tanmatra, vayu from akasa, tejasfrom 
Vayu and water from tejas, that thePurusa is the 25th ialtva_ 
Then the Matsya (3 30-44) tells a fantastic story that Brahma 
woduced a woman (called Satarupa, Savitrl, SarasvatI, Gayatri 
or Brahmanl) from himself, felt passion for her and had after 
a long time a son named Manu (called Svayambhuva) and 
Lr, Virai from her, then Brahma called upon his sons to create

chapters from five onwards describe the descendants of Daksa of 
Kasyapa, of Diti, the coronation of Prthu, the solar and lunar 
dynastie and various classes of pitrs. 

The Vayupurana devotes five chapters ( 4-9 } to creations of 
differents kinds (in over 600 verses}. In Chap. 4 verses 23-61 the 
Sankhya scheme of Pradhana, Mahat, Ahankara, Tanmatras is 
set out and is combined with the egg theory (verses 66ff). Chap. 
6 appears to ref er (verses 2-3) to the PurusasQkta (#g.X.9W. 
1-3), explains that Narayana is so oalled because he reclines 
on waters, refers to the Boar incarnation, to nine kinds of crea- 
tion, states a (different theory) that Brahma created in the 
beginning the mind-born sons and Sanandana and Sanaka (6. 65). 
Chapter 7 refers to re-creation, Chap. 8 (containing 198 verses ) 
refers to the Yugas, their durations, the creation of eight Deva- 
yonis, of animals, metres &c., and different sons of Brahma. 

The Brahmandapurana I (chapters 3-5) deal with the 
appearance of Hiranyagarbha and various kinds of creations 
and chapter 4 refers to Pradhana, the gunas and states that 
creation is due to the uneven mixture of gunas that constitute 
Pradhana but these work under Visnu. Chap. 5 speaks of 
various kinds of creations, and {the manasa sons of Brahma. 
Chapters 8, 11 of the Anusaugapada (2nd section of the PurSna) 
deal with the creation of gods, pitrs, men and of the great sages, 
Bhrgu &c. 

The first three chapters ( containing about 240 verses) of the 

Brahmapuiana deal with creation. Chap, 1 (verses 34 ff) puts 

forward Brahma as the creator of all bhvlas (beings) and as 

devotee of Narayana and then states that ahankara arose from 

mahat and from ahankara the elements were produced. The 

Brahma like the Matsya closely follows (in I. 37-41) Manu-,1. 

5-13. It refers to the creation of the seven sages Marlci, Atri 

and others who were seven Brahmanah, the creation of Sadhyas, 

gods, the Bgveda and other Vedas, birds and all sorts of beings; 

it also states (153) that Visnu created Yiraj, who created 

Purusa (this is based on the Purusasukta ("ftg. X. 90. 5) and 

that Purusa created people. Chapter 2 states that Purusa 

married Satarupa, that Purusa is called Svayambhuva Manu, 

that a son Ylra was born to Purusa and Satarupa and Vlra's two 

sons were Priyavrata and TJttanapada ; then their descendants 

are described, that Daksa had 50 daughters 10 of whom weTe 

married to Dharma, 13 to Kasyapa and 37 (the naksatras ) were 

a. D. 191

married to king Soma, Chapter 3 deals with the creation of 
gods and asuras. M77 

The VisnupurSna in Chapters 2, 4, 5, 7 of the firet aihia deals 
with several kinds of creation. Chapter 2 starts with Visnu 
and asserts that Pradhana and Furusa are his forms and in verses 
34-50 proclaims the details of the Ssnkhya system and verse 
54 refers to the production of the egg by Mahat and other 
tattvas. Chap. 3 deals with the question how brahman, whioh 
is free from gunas, inconceivable, pure and untainted, is the 
author of creation, the reply being that there are natural powers 
(Saktia) in all things that are inconceivable and so braliman 
has the power of creating the universe. Chap. 5 deals with nine 
kinds of oreationB viz. of Mahat, Tanmatras. bhutas, (elements), 
VaikSrika ( i. e. Aindrlyaka ), Mukhya (i. e. of immovable ohjeots), 
of lower animals, of urdhvaretas (i. e. divine beings), of human 
beings, of Kumaras ( i. e. Sanatkumara and others). 

The Markandeya-purana in Chap. 42 speaks of the creation 
of Pradhana, Mahat, Ahankara, Tanmatras under the aegis of 
Brahma. Chap, 44 speaks of the nine kinds of creation as in 
Visnu. Chapters 45, 46, 47 deal with the creations of Gods, 
pitrs, human beings, the four varnas, beasts, birds, trees and 
plants &o. Passages from other Puranas need not and cannot be 
quoted as they are in the same strain as above and as limita- 
tions of space preclude further elaboration. 

In the Upanisadsthe geographical details are very few and 
are limited to the territory between the Himalayas and Vinanya 
(the Kausitaki Up. H 13 speaks of two parvatas, the north ana 
south, the Br.Up.l. 1,1-8 alludes tothe eastern and western seas). 
Noble steeds were brought from Sindhu country (Br. Up vj. u

have been known and was at some distance from the place where 
the Upanisad was composed ; the country Madra is mentioned in 
Br. Up HI. 3. 1 and III 7. 1. Janaka was a king of Videha at 
whose court brahmanas from Kurus, Fancalya, gather together 
for argument with Tajnavalkya (Br. Up. JII 1. 1), king 
Ajatasatni of KasI (Banaras) humbled the vain Balaki 
Gargya (Br. Up. II 1.1), and Kausltaki IV. 1. 1, which latter 
mentions also the countries of Vasa, Usinara, Kuru. Pancala and 
Videha); Kuru country occurs in Chan. Up. L 10. 1. 377. 17. 10.

The Puranas devote thousands of verses to cosmography 2WS 
i. e. description of the divisions of the earth called dvlpas, varsas, 
the mountains, the oceans, the rivers and the countries therein 
and their extent, the motions of the sun, moon, planets, the 
yugas, manvantaras, and kalpas M79 and Dharmasastra works 
frequently rely on them. Jambudvlpa was known at least 
before 300 B. O. as Asoka mentions it in his Rupanatha Rock 
Inscription, quoted above on p 1016 n 1649. The word ' dvlpa' 
occurs in the RgvedaLl69. 3 and VII. 20. 4 <vi doipant pfipatan). 
Panini derives the word from dm and apah. (VL 3. 97). A bare out- 
line of these from some Puranas may be indicated here. The Mat- 
syapurana starts by saying (in chap. 113. 4-5) that there aTe thou- 
sands of dylpas, but as it is not possible to describe the whole of

Chapters 121-123 of the same Purana mention by name seven 
dvlpas viz Jambudvipa, Sakadvipa, Kusa, Kraufica, Salmala, 
Gomedaka and Puskara, each succeeding one being double of 
each preceding one andeach surrounded by a sea and each having 
Beven varsas, seven principal mountains, seven main rivers. 
The seven oceans surrounding the seven dvipas aTe stated to be 
respectively of salt 24sl water, milk, liquid ghee, curds, liquor, 
BUgar-oane juice, fresh water. The names and order of the 
dvlpas differ to some extant in different Fiiranas e. g. the Yisnu 
II. 1.13-14, II. 2 5, the Brahmapurana (18.11) mention them as 
Plaksa, Salmala, Kusa, Kraufioa, Saka and Puskara. The Vayu 
(33. 11-14), Kurma I. 45. 3, Mark, 50, 18-20 mention the same 
seven in the same order. 

The descriptions of Kalpa, Manvantara, Yuga in the 
Puranas have already been dealt with in H. of Dh. Vol. m p. 
890-91 and above pp. 686-693 and pralmja has been treated of 
in Vol. IH pp. 893-895 and pp. 693-695 above. The Puranas 
contain thousands of verses on these topics. 

The Visnu (H. 3. 13-34) mentions the varsas as Bhsrala (tie 
first among them ), Kimpurusa, Hari, Eamyaka, Hiranmaya, 
TJttara-Kuru, Ilavrta, Bhadrasva and Ketumala. The Vamatia 
( 13. 3-5) mentions the same except that it substitutes Campaka 
for Ramyaka. Visnu II. (1. 16-17) states, however, thatNabm, 
Kimpurusa, Harivarsa, Ilavrta, Ramya, Hiranvat, Kuru, 
Bhadrasva, Ketumala were the names of nine kings, sons of 
Agnldhra, son of Priyavrata, a son of Svayambhuva Manu ana 
that the varsas given to the nine sons of Agnldhra waw 
respectively Himahva (i. e. Bharata), Hemakuta, Naisadha, 
Ilavrta, Nflacala, Sveta, Srngavat, a varsa to east of Meru, Gan- 
dhamadana. ThuB there is a confusion of names of kings ano 
names of vaisas. Vayu (30. 38-40) states the same names «

TheYayu(45, 75-81) states that Bharatavaisa is to the 
north of the ocean and to the south of Hima-vat (Himalaya) and 
Mann was called Bharata because he supported his subjects and 
therefore this varsa is called Bharata. The Brahmanda (II. 16.7, 
says the same thing. The same ( Yayu ) Purana contradicts itself 
hyBtating(in 33. -50-52) that Nabhi's son was Usabha, whose 
son was Bharata after whom Bharata-varsa is so called. Br- 
ahmanda (II. 14.60-62) says the same thing; Vayu also stated 
(in 99. 134) that from Dusyanta and Sakuntala was born 
Bharata and Bharata is so called 2 * 83 after him. The seven

principal mountains of Bharatvarsa are Mahendra, Malaya, 
Sahya, Suktimat, Rksaparvata, Vindhya and Psriyatra. The 
Puranaa affirm that Bharata is the best in the varsas of Jambu. 
dvlpa { Brahma 19. 23-24, Visnu in. 3. 22, Brahmanda II. 16. 17 ). 
Some of them contain fine eulogies of Bharata (e. g. Brahma 37 
2.9 and 69-79,' Visnu II. 3. 33-26.). 

In several Puranaa nine divisons of Bharatavarsa are named 
viz. Indradvlpa, Kaseru, Tamraparna, Gabhastimat, Nagadvlpa, 
Sahys, Gandharva, Varuna and a ninth which is 1000 yojanas 
long from north to south, on the east of which are Kiratas and 
on the west Yavanas and the four varnas in the middle of it. 2484 . 
It may be noted that though Bharatavarsa is only one the 
divisions of Jambudvlpa, some of the nine divisions are 
themselves called Indradvlpa and Nagadvlpa. Another impor- 
tant matter is that Matsya 114. 10, Vayu 45. 81, Vamana 13. 11, 
and Brahmanda appear to call the 9th dvlpa Kumara or as 
extending from Kumarifcl to the sources of the Ganga. There-

fora, it appears that the 9th division of Bharatvarsa was held to 
be a country like modem India and the'other eight divisions seem 
to be countries and islandB lying to the south-east of present 
India. It is probable that early works identified Bharatvarsa 
with what is now modem India, but when Indian culture spread 
to South-Bast Asia, Bharatavarsa was used to denote India as 
well as Greater India. 

Sahara (bhasya on Jai. X. 1. 35) shows that" the language of 
cultured people from the Himavat to cape Comoiin was the same 
(prasiddhasca sthalyam carusabdah a Himavatah a ca Ku- 
marihhayah prajujyamano drstah). Vide also his bhasya on 
Jai. X. 1. 42 for the same words. The snow-capped mountains 
were known to the sages of the Rgveda (vide X. 121, 4'yas- 
yeme Himavanto mahitva yasya samudram rasaya sahahuh). 
'Yasya' in the verse quoted refers to HiranyagaTbha. The 
Atharvaveda (V. 4. 2 and 8) mentions Himavat in the singular. 
Parvatas (plural) occur several times in Rg. IU. 33. 1, IV. 54. 5 
and also pariata in the singular (5g. I. 37. 7, V. 56. 4). The 
Mahabharata, Sahara, Puranas and the Brhat-samhita show that 
ancient Indian people identified their culture with Bharata- 
varsa i. e. they identified country and culture, not race with 
oulture. 

The Brahmapurana and the Markandeya appear to confine 
Bharatvarsa substantially to what has been known for centuries 
as India when they describe it as 'to its south, west and east 
there is the great ocean, to its north is Himavat resembling 
the string of a bow.'*ss Vide H. of Dh. Vol II. pp 11-16 for 
discussion as to the limits of Aryavarta and pp. 17-18 for

CHAPTER XXXV 

The doctrine of Karma and Punarjanma 
(transmigration or metempsychosis) 

This is one of the most fundamental doctrines of the 

Indian system of religion and philosophy, iB an endeavour to 

answer the question that occurs to all thoughtful persons, viz, 

what happens to man after the death of the body and has 

influenced for thousands of years or at least from tiie times of 

the Upanisads all Indian thought and all Hindus, Jains ana* 

Buddhists. This is a vast subject and baa during the last 

few decades attracted the minds of numorours writers in tho 

West. There is now a voluminous literature in tho West 

on reincarnation. 2Wa Several countries in historical timeB 

believed in transmigration. Herodotus 2im states that some of 

the Greeks (whose names he knew but did not disclose) had 

used that doctrine as their own, but that the Egyptians were 

the first to teach that the human soul was immortal and that at 

the time of the death of the body it entered into some other living 

thing then coming to birth. Pythagoras appears to have 

believed in it and there are controversies whether he derived it 

from India. Prof. A. B. Keith (in J. B, A. S. for 1909 pp. 569- 

606) after a lengthy discussion holds that Pythagoras did not 

borrow it from India. The present writer does not express any 

opinion on that subject as it is irrelevant for the purpose ol 

this volume. Hopkins and Macdonnell accept the theory ol 

Indian Influence on Pythagoras, but Oldenberg and Koiw 

do not. 

Not only Pythagoras, but Empedocles (who is reported to 
have said that he was a boy, a girl, a bush, a bird and a W) 
and Plato believed in the pre-existence and post-existence « 
the soul, in the idea that the bodies which will accompany W 
soul in several births would bw similitude to thej livosjhat

Plato believed in tt aiismigi ation 1531 

they had led, that the happiest would he those who had practised 
the social and civil virtues called temperance and justice and 
that supersensible thinking would be the only "means of dis- 
engaging the soul from successive lives of sense. Vide Kenneth 
Walker's 'The circle of Life' p. 93 (where he says that the do- 
ctrine of metempsychosis was probably well-known in India at 
the time of Christ) and Gough's 'Philosophy of the Upanisada' 
(London 1882), pp 25-28, where he cites a long passage from 
Plato's Phaedon on this subject and pp. 29-31 for & long 
quotation from Hume's Dialogues concernig Natural Religion 
on the miseries and migration of the soul from body to body. 
Gough on p 25 of the above work opines that since in the Vedic 
literature prior to the Upanisads there is no reference to the 
belief in the passage of the soul into plants and human bodies, 
it is reasonable to suppose that the Hindus borrowed this 
doctrine from the indigenes in the course of their absorption 
of indigenous blood Vide also ' Studies in honour of Bloom- 
field' pp. 76-88 for G. W. Brown's views to the 8ame 
effect. This is a most gratuitous assumption, it is a pure con- 
jecture and without any evidence whatever. If belief in trans- 
migration could exist among Egyptians and many primitive 
tribes, there is no reason to assume that Indians did not them- 
selves arrive at the doctrine, particularly when there exists 
nowhere else in the whole world any theory of Karma and 
transmigration so detailed, so influential and so thorough as 
in Sanskrit Literature. One may dismiss the conjectures of 
^Srf?l G,W Brownas ^rbiage (the latter conjectures on 
pp. 87-88 that even the words Yoga, Sankhya and TTpanisad are 
C ,°.™ d . fr ° m " mll « ™ rlJs to some Dravidian tongue now lost).

this doctrine and the vicissitudes and modifications of it and 
the objections raised against it in modern times. It is a 
remarkable circumstance that, though the several darsanas 
(such as SSnkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisesika, Purvamlmamsa and 
Vedanta ) severely criticize some doctrines of each other, the 
doctrine of Karma and transmigration received almost un- 
animous support except among materialists (like Garyaka). 
Prof. Wilson in 'Religion of the Hindus' (London, ed. of 1862) 
vol H. p. 112 remarks 'metempsychosis is not only the one 
point on which all are agreed, it is the one point which none 
have ever disputed'. The Buddhists and Jains, though they 
differed on many matters from Vedic and Smrti literature, 
adopted this doctrine in their own way. There are some 
suppositions antecedent to all beliefs in Karma and trans- 
migration viz. (1 ) man has a soul, eternal and separate from the 
physical body, (2) that other organisms, animals, plants and 
probably inanimate objects possess souls, (3) that the souls of 
men and lower animals can pass from one kind of physical 
organism to another, (4) that the soul is both doer and sufferer. 

It has already been shown at some length (in Vol. TV pp. 
154-171) how ideas of Heaven and Hell were developed from 
ancient Vedic times and it has been stated (on p. 158 of that 
volume) that the doctrine of Karma and transmigration 
modified the doctrine of Heaven and Hell 

The word Jcarma occurs in the Rgveda over forty times. 
In some passages it appears to mean ' exploits' or 'valiant deeds 
as in the following : 'Observe the exploits of Visnu* ($g. 1. $• 
19 ) ' proclaim by your word ( or verses) the M!B ancient deeds ol 
Him (Indra) who is worthy of praise' ($g. 1.61. 13); •«» 
deed of his (of Indra), who is wonderful, is most worthy or 
worship, that deed is most beautiful, that he filled with sweet 
waters of four rivers' (Eg. L 62. 6); 'who is firm in each exploit 
($g I 101. 4); 'O Indra! four are your divine and unconauer- 
able'names,... under which you performed exploits' ($g. i »• 
4);'0 Asvins! frequent drinkers of delicious Soma .and Lords 
of splendour, you helped (or protected) Indra m^hisjxpkats

of praise' ^(Bg. 1. 148. 2);(OIndra), give your ear to (the

(the prayers of) Atri who performed religious works' (Bg« 

VIH. 36. 7), O pure Soma! with thy help our ancient and wise 

forefathers performed works' (Bg, IX. 96. 11). In very ancient 

times Heaven was believed to be the place for enjoying the 

rewards of most works. Howards of this world such as wealth, 

heroic sons were no doubt prayed for, but it was immortality 

(amrlatva) and the joys of heaven, that were highly valued In 

Eg. X. 16. 4 Agni is prayed to take the deceased to the world of 

those who performed good works (tsbhir-vahainam sukrtam 

ulokam). The words 'sukrtam lokam' occur in the Atharva- 

veda «»(III 28 6, XVUL. 3. 71 ) and in the Vaj. S. 18. 52. In Bg. 

IX. 113. 7-10 the sacrifioer who offers Soma to Indra prays that 

he may be placed in that world (heaven) as an immortal, where 

there is never-ending light, where Yama, the son of Vivasvat, 

is the King, where there are joys and delights and where there 

are desires and their fulfilment. The prayers for immortality 

are made in the Bgveda to all gods, e. g. to Agni in I. 31. 7, IV 

58. 1, V. 4. 10., Vi. 7. 4, to the Maruts in V. 55. 4, to Mitra and 

Varuna in V. 63. 2, to Visve-Devas in X 52. 5 and X 62. 1, to 

Soma in I. 91. 1, IX. 94. 4, IX 108. 3. But about the fate of 

evil-doers not much iB said in the Bgveda. In the Brahmana 

works greater details are offered as to rewards of good works and 

the retribution for evil deeds. Sat. Br. (XU. 9. 1. 1 ) puts forth 

the idea of retribution ( cited above ) .*« The same idea is set forth 

as to flesh-eating in Manu and Visnu-dhaTmasutra, which state

"that being whose flosh I eat here would eat me in the next world, 
the wise declare this to be the origin of the word 'mamsa'." The 
Sat. Br. in another passage refers to a strange legend im Bhrgu, 
who had become vain on account of his learning and thought 
himself more learned than his father Varuna, was asked by his 
father to go to the four quarters from east to north and report 
what he would see there. Horrible sights met him in all 
directions e. g. in the east he saw men dismembering men, 
bowing off their limbs one by one and saying ' this to yon, this 
to me'. He said ' this is horrible'. They replied 'these indeed 
dealt with us in yonder world and so we now deal with them in 
return '. Then in the north he saw that men crying aloud were 
being eaten by men crying aloud. When he said '.horrible &o'; 
they replied 'these indeed dealt with us...in return". This is a 
long story and it is not necessary to set out the whole. This 
story probably gives expression to the^ popular notion of ' tit for 
tat'. But one thing is clear that the Sat. Br. indicates by this 
story that a belief had then arisen that one who does evil in 
one life has to suffer for it in a later life from that being whom 
he treated badly. The Sat. Br and the Tai. Br. both several 
times speak of conquering or casting off 'punarmrtyu' {renewed 
death, liability to be born and die again and again). Two 
passages from the Sat, Br. and Tai Br. may be quoted. In' X. 
4. 4 the Sat. Br. tells the story that gods became, immortal by 
means of the proper performance of Agnioayana as Prajapati 
advised them viz by laying down 360 enclosing stones, 360 
Yajusmatl bricks and 36 more thereon, 10800 Lokamprna 
bricks. In X.4. 4. 9 it is said 'he .who is to become immortal 
through knowledge (vidya) 2493 and through sacred works [larman) 
shall become immortal after separating from the body', and then 
X 4. 4. 10 asserts that 'those who know this or those who do 
this holy work come to life again after dying and coming to 
life they secure immortal life ; but those who do not know

this or do not perform this sacred work come to life again when 
they die and they become the food of him (Death) time after time.' 
In the<Tai, Br. HI. 11. 8 the stay of Naciketas is narrated 3ust 
as in the Eathopanisad(some of the verses are the same in both). 
Death grants Naoiketas Jshree boons in the Tai. Br., the third 
being different in the Kathopanisad. The third boon asked by 
Uaeiketas in Tai. Br. is 'Declare to me how to cast off pwrnrmrlyu.' 
Death declared to him the Naciketa fire, thereby he ( Naciketas) 
cast off or kept off pimarmrtyu? m The words ' apa pnnarmrtynm 
jayati' occur in Kausitaki Br. 25.1 and several times in the 
Br. Dp. I. 2. 7., I. 5. 2, DX 2., 10, BX 3. 2. 

From the ancient popular idea of retribution for evil deeds 
probably arose the idea of the Betting of good deeds against the 
evil deeds of a person and weighing them as if in a balance. 
The Sat Br. states 2455 'Now this one is the balance, via. the 
right side of the vedi. M9S Let him sit down touching the right 
edge of the vedi, for indeed they place him on the balance in 
yonder world and whichever of two will rise he will follow, 
whether it be good or evil. And whosoever knows this mounts 
the balance even in this world and escapes being placed on the 
balance in yonder world, for it is good deed that rises and not 
his evil deed'. 

The Satapatha had arrived at the idea that man's will ( and 
corresponding deed) governs what worid he will reach after 
death. It says ' Let him meditate on truth as brahma. How 
man here is mostly will and, according as his will is when he 
departs from this world, does he on departing become of similar 
will in the yonder world'. «*> 

There is a curious passage in the Satapatha (XI. 5 4) 
about the powers conferred by sacrifices in the yonder world ' It 
states that he who had reg ularly performed Agnihotra eats food 

— -*. .**«*. v* is ^ SKL I iS£Z the

in the evening and morning in the yonder world, the performer of 
Darin and Purnamasa sacrifice eats food every half month; the 
performer of CaturmSsyas (seasonal sacrifices) eats food in the 
yonder worlds every four months, the performer of animal 
sacrifice every six months; the Soma sacrificer once a year; 
the builder of the fire after (agnicit) eats food every hundred 
years at his will or may not require it at all after once taking it, 
for a hundred years are as much as immortality, unending and 
everlasting. 

Tho Sat. Br. had arrived at the conclusion that every man 
is born in a world fashioned by himself. It also asserted that 
he who sacrifices to the gods does not win such a place as the 
one who sacrifices to the Stman and the latter frees himself 
from tho mortal body, from sin, as a snake frees itself from its 
slough 2W . 

It must be conceded that a clear statement about the doctrine 
of karma and punarjanma is absent from the whole of the Kgveda. 
Rg.VH. 33 is an important hymn. The first nine verses are spoken 
by Vasistha about his sons. Verse3 10-14 refer to Vasistha 2 " 8 
himself and are cither attributed to his sons or according to 
another view are part of a dialogue with Indra. The verses are 
mythological, mystical and rather difficult to explain. Veras 
10 refers to one birth of Vasistha when the gods Mitra and Varuna 
saw him reaching the refulgence of lightning and it is said that 
Agastya brought him (Vasistha) to the people. Here tiie 
words 'ekamjanma' indicate that another janma of Vasistha 
is intended in this hymn. Verse 11 refers to Vasistha as 
born of Mitra and Varuna from UrvasI and states that ah the 
gods placed him in puslara (either antariksa or lotus); verse 
12 is important for the metaphorical and mystical statement that

Prof E. D. Banade?* 95 in'his ' Constructive survey of the 
Upanishadic philosophy' (pp. 145-166) relies upon certain 
mantras of the Rgveda for stating that there iB evidence for 
holding that an approach to the idea of Transmigration was 
being made by the vedic sages (p. 147), though he concedes 
( on the same page ) that in the major part of the Bgveda the 
idea of transmigration is conspicuous by its absence. 

Among the texts on which he relies aTe Rg. 1. 164. 3, 4, 16, 
17, SO, 30, 31, 38. The whole hymn has several riddles, has 
highly imaginative descriptions of the year, the path of the Sun, 
questions and answers and is a late hymn, as he him self admits 
(p. 150). Verses 3 and 17 contain nothing suggestive of 
punarjanma. Verse 4 is really concerned with the first creation, 
as it literally means 'who saw that one that was first bemg born, 
when the boneless (prakrti) bears a body possessing bones-

self? Who ( a pupil ) approaohed a wise one (a guru) to ask 
this ?'. Verse 16 means ' they declare to me the women that 
exist and the men ; one possessing eyes ( the light of true 
knowledge ) may see ( the Reality ) ; the blind ( the ignorant ) 
will not know ; the wise son may know this; he who knows 
these would be the father's father '. Sayana gives several mea- 
nings of this verse. The present author fails to understand how 
the words ' father's father ' indicate any reference to transmig- 
ration in this verse, as Prof. Eanade asserts. Why he presses 
this verse of I. 164 into service the present author cannot 
understand. After referring to 1. 164. 32 ( which doubts whether 
he who created all this knows its real nature) he states 'it 
sets such a high price on the mystical knowledge which it glori- 
fies that any one who comes in possession of this knowledge 
may be said to be his father's father.' To whom does 'his' 
refer ?. 

The verse 20 ' dva suparna ' also occurs in the Mundako- 
panisad III.' 1. and SV. Up. IV. 6 and refers to the individual 
soul and the Supreme Self and tells us that the former is bhoktr 
(taster of worldly pleasures), while the latter simply looks on. 
But so far as the present writer can see there is absolutely 
nothing about a former or future life in the verse. Verse 30 
draws a snarp distinction between the self which is immortal 
and the body which is mortal and states that the two are bound 
together to the same place. Verse 31 is a description of tne 
movements of the Sun who is called 'gopa' (protector, guardian) 
and speaks of his coming to the worlds again and again. Froi. 
Eanade sees too much in the words 'gopam', which is applied 
to Agni (Eg. 1. 1. 8, 1. 96. 7 ), to Soma (in Eg. VI 52.3), to 
Varuna in Eg. VIII. 1% %), to Visnu in Eg. L 22. 18. In Eg. HI.

word ' dharmana ' in it which lie renders as ' his qualities '. Rg. 
X. 16 has 14 verses, is one of the funeral hymns and the cre- 
mation fire (as Agnior Jatavedas) is expressly mentioned in 
eleven verses. Verse 3 ( addressed to the deceased) may literally 
be translated as 'may thy eye goto the San, Stman (prana) to 
wind, go to heaven or the earth by dharman or go to the waters 
if you find your benefit in them; be firmly established in the 
plants with the limbs of the body.' The express mention of 
'heaven' shows that this is only one of the numerous verses of 
the Rgveda in which heaven is referred to as the abode of those 
who perform good works and that there is nothing more in it 
than that. Vide above pp. £0-21 for the meaning of dharman 
(which is the only form of the word employed in the Rgveda) 
viz. ' religious rites or sacrifices' ( in most Rgveda passages) or 
raTely ' fixed principles of conduct'. The very next verse ( X. 16. 
4 ) contains a prayer to Agni to carry the deceased to the world' 
of people of good deeds ( tabhirvahainam sukrtam-u lokam). 
There is no reason to suppose that in $g. X 16. 3 anything 
more is meant than what is prayed for in verse 4. Besides, the 
basic idea of punaTjanma is that future existence is regulated 
by the good or evil deeds of a person and he has no option 
whatever. In $g. X. 16. 3 the departed spirit is told that he may 
go to heaven or earth or waters or plants. This is not the doct- 
rine of punarjanma at all. In X. 16. 5 the cremation fire is

only to the other world (pitrs} and not to transmigration. 
Prof. Ballade refers (p. 148) to Bg. X. 58 and translates one of 
the verses as meaning that the sage will recall the soul and 
make it live again by his song. It is not clear what verae or 
verses he has in view. He has probably only the first verse in 
view. That hymn has twelve verses in eaoh of which a quarter 
is different but three quarters are the same. None of the verses 
contains any express word for song. Besides, mind is different 
from the soul even in the Ijtgveda (-vide Rg. X 57. 5 where both 
words 'manah' and 'jlvam' ooour ). Moreover, the man is not yet 
dead. The composer uses the present tense (a vartaySmasi) and 
means to say that he will try to prevent his dying. In the present 
author's opinion there is not even a distant reference to trans- 
migration in this hymn or in any of the four hymns ( Rg. X. 
57*-60) which ate assigned to brothers Bandhu, Srutabandlra 
and Vipra-bandhu, who are called GaupayanaB in the Anukra- 
manl. In B.g. X. 60. 7 Subandhu who appears to have been a 
brother of the three is addressed 'O Subandhu' here comes your 
mother, your father, your very life' etc., and in X. 60. 10 it is said 
' I have brought the mind of Subandhu from Yama Vaivasvata 
in order that he may live and not die.' 

InRg. X. 14. 8 there is no reference (as some suppose) 
to return to this world after enjoying the fruits of good deedB in 
the company of pitrs. The first half of the verse expresses that 
the newly departed spirit will be united with pitrs, with Yama 
and with his good deeds. The 2nd half asks the departed to 
leave behind his sons and be united in heaven with a new ana 
brilliant body. 

Rg. IV. 43 (in ten verses) is a hymn of a sage-like king 
Trasadasyu, son of Purukutsa, who identifies himself with 
Sand Varuna in verse 3 *« 'I who have become enlightened 
abot the worlds am Indra and Varuna and by «**-*- 
am the two worlds (heaven and earth) that are wide, tap 
(spacious) and well-fixed. I sent forth heaven and earth W» 
Kstr(pUpati) and support them.' Here by virtue , off te» 
Pledge ne identifies himself with ***?*?%££ 
there is no conception of transmigration. jStoik^Wmao^ 



Prof. Banade' a vieuis examined 1541 

having attained knowledge of Reality asserts 3501 'I have 
become Manu and the Sun, I am the wise sage Eakslvat; I 
reached Kutsa, the son of ArjunI, I am the seer Usanas ; look 
upon me (as identifiable with all)'. This veise is quoted 
in Br. Up. I. 4. 10 (which would be set out later on and explai- 
ned ). In this also there is no express reference to a past birth 
as Manu or as the Sun. In Rg. IV. 27. 1 Vamadeva declares 
* while still staying in the womb ( of ray mother) I learnt all the 
births of these gods ; if a hundred fortresses of ayas ( copper or 
iron) had guarded me, I would have still escaped like a hawk 
with swiftness' (another meaning is also possible which may be 
set out later). This is quoted in the Ait. Up IL 5 (to be quoted 
and explained later). Prof. B. D. Ranade understands (pp. 49, 
153 ) Rg. IV. 26. 1 as saying that Vamadeva makes an uncon- 
soious utterance that he was in a former life Manu or the Sun 
In that verse Vamadeva indentifles himself with five persons, 
Manu, Sfirya, sage Eakslvat, Eutsa and Usana3. There is no 
word like 'jannia' On Prof. Ranade's view Vamadeva would 
have to be held to state five previous births at least (and if so 
in a confused order). Besides, the following verses clearly 
show that Vamadeva makes a claim to be identical with the 
Supreme Principle by giving the earth to the Aryas, sending 
rain to those who give offerings, making the gods follow his 
desire or will. The utmost that can be said is that he claims 
identity with tte Godhead. Deussen in 'Philosophy of the 
Upanishads (p 318) holds that both the verses (Rg. Iv. «,. 1 and 
IV. 27 1.) nave nothing to do with the doctrine of the soul's 
.ransmrgration The present author respectfully agrees Sh 
Deussen and thinks that Prof.Ranade is wrong. Sankaracarya""

assertion indicates that correct knowledge of Eeality may 
arise in a succeeding life owing to the means (or efforts) made 
in a previous life or lives It may be noted that Sankaracarya 
draws a distinction between what Sruti (Veda) expressly 
declares ( vadanti ) and what it indicates or what is to be inferred 
from it ( darsayati ). ls0i 

Mr. J. S. Karandikar of Poona (a staunch disciple and 
follower of Lokanwnya Tilak ) m his learned work ' Glfcatattva- 
mfifijarl' ( in Marathi, Poona 1947) asserts (on pp. 775-776) 
that the doctrine of transmigration is as old as the Vedio age 
( i. e. the Sambitas ) and relies for this proposition on only four 
verseB of the Rgveda viz X 14. 8, X 16. 3 and 5 and X 135. 6. 
The first three of these four have been explained above in dealing 
with Prof. B. D. Ranade's views. Mr. Karandikar summarises 
Rg. X 16. 5 as a prayer to Agni that the latter should take the 
departed to the world of pitrs and should send him back to 
hiB relatives after endowing him with a new^brilliant body. 
There are no words for 'back to his relatives ' nor for ' brilliant ' 
in the verse at all. The word *punah* ooours in the first 
half and refers to the deceased's coming to pitrlolca after the 
body is burnt on the earth and the second half refers to the 
new body to be had in the world of pitrs (and not to relatives). 
Bg. X 14. 8 on which Mr. Karandikar relies has nothing to do 
with returning to the earth. After leaving his bad deeds (avadya) 
behind the deceased is asked to go to the home of the pita with 
a brilliant body. The brilliant body is not earthly but oi M*e 
pitr world Rg. X 135 6 is quoted in the note below. 2505 1M

Eg. X. 1S5 explained 1543 

The first verse of &g. X. 135 refers to Yama who is said to 
drink (Soma) along with the gods under a tree (i. e. in a garden) 
with fine foliage, where our (my) father, lord of people, desires 
to send (me) to the ancient fathers It is possible that this 
refers to Naciketas as Sayana, following the story of Naciketas 
in the Tai. Br. III. 11. 8 and in the Kathopanisad, holds. 
This verse may be taken as containing the words of Naciketas, 
sent by his angry father Vtjasravasa to the world of Yama as 
donation in the Visvajit sacrifice. The 2nd verse also contains 
what Naciketas said viz that he (at first) looked upon his 
father in anger, sines he (the father) desired to send him (the 
son ) to the ancient pitrs in that evil way, but that he (on 
further consideration) liked (what the father did). He liked 
the idea of facing Yama himself. Verses 3 and 4 are addressed 
by Yama to the boy Naciketas who approached Yama with 
prayer ( or metaphorically in a chariot) Verse 3 says ' O boy I 
the new wheel-less chariot (viz. rk prayer) with only one beam 
that you created by your intellect soars up in all directions and 
that you mount it without seeing (without considering the 
result of your action).' In Rg. a prayer to ( and a laud of ) gods 
is often compared to a chariot (as in V. 73. 10, VIII. 3.15), 
Therefore, verse 3 suggests two meanings viz. Naciketas went 
to Yama in a chariot or that he sent up a prayer to Yama. 
Verse 4 is spoken by Yama' O boy] that chariot (i.e. prayer 
which you sent up from the learned priests on the earth) was 
followed by Saman (a melody ) from this place ( the earth) as if 
it were placed in a boat.' Almost all the verses of the Samaveda 
except about 75 are taken from the Bgveda and therefore the 
Chan. Up says ** • therefore Saman is sung as resting on the 

S^i^nn- y ^ 5man) hsans <»»**«». the Saman 

is sam in this verse (4) as placed in a boat. Verse 4 may also 

andT/v? ermea f toB - Sta *^° means 'reconSion'

panying the large principal gift)?' Then follows the verse 
on which Mr. Karandikar relies as expressing Karma and 
rebirth. That verse literally means 'as it or he became an anudeyi, 
it stood in front ( or on top ); the bottom (or base) was spread in 
front (or first or to the east), the coming out (or end) was 
behind (or afterwards or to the west).' This conveys no olaar 
sense. But it is possible to explain it in this way, viz. though 
the boy was sent by his father as an anudeyi (as a subsidiary 
gift) still he came on top of all (in that Yama was pleased with 
him and bestowed on him three boons) ; he was in front of all 
though he (boy) was at the bottom of all giftB (i. e. though ho 
came last of all gifts) '. There is another possible way of explai- 
ning this verse. Each Saman in a stotra has five parts called 
Prastava, Udgltha, Pratihara, Upadrava and Nidhana (finale) , 
vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. p. 1169 note 2589. Naciketas (who was 
a subsidiary donation following the donation of all hia father's 
property and designated 'anudeyi') is deemed here to have 
chanted a Saman ; when he began that, the rk verse on which 
the Saman rests went forth. The bottom of a Saman is a rk 
verse. Therefore it is again said that the base or bottom went 
forward and the 'Nirayana' (i.e. the nidhana of the Saman) 
came last. Mr. Karandikar explains verse 6 as 'the cremation 
rite of the body of a deceased person shows the two-fold path; by 
the front path he should go to the highest world or by the hind 
path he should return to this world' (p. 776). It passes the 
present author's understanding how this translation follows 
from the words of verse 6. Verse 7 of the hymn presents no 
difficulty; it means 'this is the house of Yama that is oalled wis 
the palace of gods; here is played (or blown) the flute (or tube 
or trumpet) for him (Yama), he (Yama) js embellished with 
songs (of praise).' 

An interesting passage of the Taittirlya-samhitS^ may be 
cited here. " Whoever threatens a bwhmana, he shall atone lor

it with a hundred years; lis who strikes bim{ shall atone) with 
a thousand years; he who sheds the blood of a brahmana would 
not know the world of the Fathers for as many years as the 
number of the particles of du3t that would be moistened into a 
ball by the stream of blood. Therefore a person should not 
threaten a brahmana or strike him or draw blood from his body, 
since (in doing so) so much (sin) is involved." This doe3 not 
mean that only the world of Fathers had been conceived at the 
time of this passage (as Deussen supposes on p. 325 of his Ph. 
Up.). It will be shown below that even the Rgveda was well 
aware of both Devayana and Pitryana. Most men would go to 
pitrloka presided over by Yama according to the Rg. and only 
the blessed would go by the Davayana to the world of gods. 
This passage is important as conveying that for a very mortal 
sin the offender would have to suffer for a thousand years or 
even several thousand years and, therefore, would have to be born 
for several lives, since one human life was held to extend to one 
hundred years only (ftg. X. 161. 4 - Atharva HI. 11. 4, $g. 
1. 89. 9=Vaj. 8. 25. 22). Following the above Tal S. passage, 
the Gautama t»h. S. provided that threatening a brahmana in 
anger would bar going to heaven for a hundred years (or lead to 
hell for &c), striking him would bar for a thousand years and 
on drawing blood there would be bar for as many yearB as the 
number of the particles of dust that would be made into a ball 
by the stream of blood. Manu ( XL 206-7 ) understands that the 
several acts against a brahmana mentioned therein would lead 
to the offender being consigned to hell for 100, for 1000 or for 
SSH %? nr J**» fa i(nL4.17) discusses this passage 
and holds that the prohibition is not restricted only to Darsapa- 
rnamasa , but it applies to all brahmanas in all conditions It 
is possible to understand by the words « satena • and 'sahasrena' 
as a hundred or a thousand cows (or money). The TaXvS- 
t!ka refers to this meaning but seems to prefer the" del of 
connecting the two words withyears. Vide H of m Vol D " np

Desire, will and deeds fashion future life 1547 

(thelastresulls)of whatever deeds he doe3 in this world, he re- 
tarns again from that world (where he temporarily went by way 
of reward) to this world of action , so much with regard to him 
who is consumed by desires ; now concerning the man who has 
no desires (akarnayamana) ; he who is without desire, free from 
desire, in whose case desires are laid to rest, who is himself his 
own desire, his vital spirits do not withdraw elsewhere but 
he, being brahma itself (here), is absorbed into brahma (or attains 
to brahma). On this point there is a verae : "When all hanker- 
ings that found an abode in a man's heart vanish, then he who 
was liable to death becomes immortal, here (in this body itself) 
he attains to brahma." In the above passage the sequence is ; 
desire, will and act. 

About the grandeur of this passage it is enough to quote what 
Deussen (in 'Philosophy of the XJpanishads' p 348) says 'there 
follow words than which deeper, truer, more noble were never 
uttered by human lips.' Vide also remarks of Gerald Heard in 'Is 
god evident ' (Faber and Faber, London) p. 34 ' Here (in Vedanta 
andMahayana) is spirituality showing its full fruits; freedom 
from physical oraving, from economic possessiveness, from social 
desire for recognition and that triple freedom removing all fear' 
and he hopes that the Vedanta picture, far from being contra- 
dicted, is being increasingly confirmed by modern science. 

This sublime passage is preceded and followed by illus- 
trations two of which may be cited for explaining the conception 
of the passage of the soul from one body to another : * Just as 
the caterpillar, having reached the tip of one blade of grass, 
makes an approach to another blade, draws itself towards it and 
establishes itself thereon, so this ( individual ) self, casting down 
this body m death, dispelling avidya (ignorance) and making 
approach to another body draws itself to another body and esta- 
blishes (or identifies itself) therein.' This is Br. Up IV 4 3 
Another illustration ( iu Br. Up IV.4.7)is 'just as the 'skin 
plough) of a snake lies dead and castofi in an ant-hill fa «£ 
same way the body lies ( dead and cast-off) and then the self is 
bodiless, immortal spirit, is bia hma only and is light on^ 

This whole passage (Br. Un IV i. >i-7i ?„ «. ■, ,.

to a man when the tody dies) the Upanisad states 'what they 
said was Karma alone, what they praised was Karma alone 
viz. 2sW that a man becomes good by good works and evil by evil 
works.' These two are the fundamental passages which express 
the reason and motive that lie at the basis of the doctrine of 
transmigration. 

The gist of these two passages jra that works and conduot 
done in this life fashion a man's future life and that the present 
birth of a man depends on his actions and conduct in a paBt 
life or lives. But works and conduct are the result of volition 
or will and this last is due to desires. A man may have several 
desires, he may curb some of them, but may make a resolve to 
consummate some of hiB desires. Therefore, desires ( kama ) ate 
the root of volition, of workB and conduct and ultimately of the 
cycle of birth and deaths (that is called 'eamsara'). Hanae 
SankaTSoarya, following the idea of the verse 'yada sarve 
pramucyante kSma' (in Br. Up. IV. 5. 7) says * Kamo mulom 
eamsarasya* (Kama is the root of samssra). 

' ' Then there is another important passage in the Br, Up. VI. 
X There the story is told of Svetaketu, son of Sruni, who 
being proud of his learning, came to the assembly hall of the 
Paficalas and saw there Pravahana Jaivali (aksatriyaorprince) 
being waited upon by servants. When the prince saw him he 
asked Svetaketu 'have you been taught by your father r 
When Svetaketu replied ' yes ', the prince put to him five questions 
viz. (1) do you know how men when they depart from tins 
world go in separate (different) directions; (2) Do you know 
how they come back to this world j (3) Do you know_ how the 
yonder world does not become full with many men going there 
again and again ; (4) Do you know at the offering of whichoWj

and to the path called 'PitrySna' (i.e. the deeds by which men gain 

access to the paths called Devayana ans PitrySna), for we have 

heard the saying of a sage 'I heard two paths for men, one 

leading to the Fathers and the other leading to the Devas; on 

those two paths all the world that is active moves on, whatever 

exists between father (sky) and mother (earth).' To all these 

five questions Svetaketu replied that he did not know any one 

of them. The prince offered hospitality but Svetaketu ran to his 

father and demanded how the latter could say that he had been 

thoroughly taught by him and that he could not answer even 

one of the five questions that the fellow of a Rajanya asked. 

Then the father replied that he had taught all that he knew but 

he himself did not know the answers to those questions. He went 

to the prince (ksatriya) who honoured him with offeringa Sruni 

did not want wealth but the replies to those questions. The 

prince said ' come as pupil.' Aruni (Gautama) stated he came as 

a pupil. The prince stated that the vidya? 5 ™ that he would 

teach was never before with any brahmana. Then he propounds 

to Svetaketu the anwers to the five questions (to be brief) viz. 

that the five fires are (figuratively) heaven, god of rain, the 

earth, man and woman, and the five ahutts (oblations) are 

sraddha (faith), Soma (Moon), rain, food and seed. This answers 

the 4th question. The first and fifth questions are answered by the 

statement ' Some go by the path of Devas, others by that of 

pitrs and others (like flies and worms) know no path (they 

merely live and die )'; vide Br. Up. VI. 2. 15-16. The End and 3rd 

questions are answered by the same viz. those that go by the 

path of pitrs return to the earth and others that go to brahman 

do not return and therefore the world does not become full. 

In the Oh. Up. V. 3. 2 the questions are put in a slightly 
different form : (1) do you know to what place men go from here, 
(2) how they return, (3) do you know where the path of devas 
and the path of the fathers diverge, (4) why the world never 
becomes full, (5) why in the 5th oblation water is called 'man.* 
The answers to these in Br. Up and Chan. Up are not identical 
though very similar. A fire has five constituents, fuel' 
smoke, flame, live coals, sparks. In both Chan. Up. V.10 4-9 and' 
Br. Dp. VI. S. 9-13 the fires are the same, but the constituents of 

2SU This V.dyS is called PaHcagnividyS. ' RSjanj-a • in this TJpanfsad 



1850 History of Dharma&astra [See. IX, Oh. XXXV 

each of these five differ slightly; compare, for example, Br. Up. 
VI. 2. 11 with Chan. Up. V. 3. 6. The first question in the Oh. 
Up. is answered by the mention of the two paths. The 2nd is 
answered in Chan. Up. V. 10. 3-5. 2513 The paths diverge (3rd 
question ) after reaching the moon (Chan. Up. V. 10. 2 and 
4-5 ), the 4th is answered in Chan. V. 10. 8. The fifth is 
answered by means of the statement on pancagnividya. 

Before proceeding further some remarks are called for about 
what might possibly happen when a man's body dies. There 
are mainly three possibilities, viz. (1) annihilation, (2) endless 
retribution in heaven or hell and (3) punarjanma ( transmigra- 
tion Those who do not believe in an individual immortal self, 
including some most eminent lsU men such as G. B. Shaw, hold 
the first view and even in ancient India (as the Kathopanisad 
X 20 testifies ) there were people who had doubts about survival 
after death. Those who hold that there is no survival after 
death are not troubled by other questions. Therefore, the most 
vital question is the one about survival after death. The vary 
first verse of Sv. Up. puts forward four problems, is brahma the 
cause, whence do we come, what sustains us and whither we are 
going ? Many of those who believe in God, heaven and hell 
do not admit pre-existence of the soul but only post-existence. 
They believe that if a man leads a virtuous career in this life

Eternal life of bliss or damnation 1551 

of God as disclosed to their intellect in Kevelation such as the 
Bible or the Koran) he would have an eternal life of bliss in 
heaven and that if one led a life of sin and evil, he would after 
death remain for ever in helL Very few accept the firat possibility 
(annihilation) because it is in conflict with man's cherished 
desires and with deep-tooted emotional certitude that efforts 
made in a long life, the mental and spiritual equipment acquired 
cannot have been meant to be dissolved altogether without 
leaving any trace behind. The 2nd possibility also leads to the 
prospect of eternal reward ot eternal damnation for acts done 
during a life of a few yeara* span and becomes unacceptable to 
many by the unparalleled disproportion between deeds (as 
causes) and their endless rewards or retribution (as effects). 
Therefore, to many people the third possibility of transmigration 
appeals, since it allows continued existence of the soul after 
physical death in some other forms and environments. 

The above Upanisad passages are enough to show how the 
doctrine of transmigration was being moulded in the TJpanisad 
period. The Bgveda knows the two paths of Devayana and 
Pitryana and also that in heaven there were joys and delights 
but the ftgveda does not say how long the joys of Heaven were 
to last and makes no clear and,definite statement on the doctrine 
of transmigration. In the BrShmana period the two paths were 
often referred to and the conception had dawned upon the minds 
of thinkers that man might have to pass through death several 
times {punarmrtyu) But even then there is hardly any definite 
theory of punarjanma based on good or bad deeds. The clearest 
statements (and probably earliest) of the origin of the doctrine

and thoy may bo born from a mother's womb. 3515 This shows that 
a double retribution awaits those who perform sacrifices &c. viz. 
stay in the moon for a time and their rebirth on this earth. 
Other Upanisads follow the (Than. "Up. in the theory of double 
retribution e.g. the Frasna has the following passage in prose M!5 
" The year indeed is Prajapati, there are two parts thereof, the 
southern and the northern. Now those who believe in sacrifice 
and gifts for public utility as work that must be done, secure 
the moon only as their (future) world and it is they who return 
to this world. Therefore, the rsis who desire offspring resort to 
the southern (path). That path of the Fathers is indeed treasure 
(or wealth). But those who, after having sought the .Stnian by 
austerities, (sexual) abstinence, faith and knowledge go by the 
northern path to the Sun. This is the home of the vital spirits, 
it is immortal, free from fear, it is the highest ( or final ) end. 
Thence they do not return, that is a check to other things On 
this there is a verse (Bg L 164. 12) 'some call him the father 
with five feet (the five seasons) and with twelve forms (twelve 
months ), the giver of rain in the highest of heaven ; others again 
say that the sago is placed in the lower half, in the chariot with 
seven wheels (horses or rays of sun) and six spokes'". Thi3 
verse of the Bgveda is probably quoted here in support of the 
conception of the two paths symbolically represented as two 
tmrtoof the year, as the Eg. versa (first half) appears to refer 
to the Sun, placed in highest half of heaven and as the second 
half seems to refer to a lower ( npare) half of heaven with sis 
snokesCLo. the six months of Daksinayana). Paussen (Ph. Up.

Deussen on Jig. 1. 164. 12 criticised 1553 

with the subject (of the two paths). But what is there to prevent 
an ancient sage of the Upanisadic times from holding that the 
verse in its two halves refers (figuratively or symbolically) to two 
paths, particularly when even in the Ijtgveda times -paths called 
Devayana and Pitryana were well-known as shown below ? It 
should be noted that in the preceding Verse (1 164. 11) the 
wheel of rta (the year or the sun) is Dvadasara ( with twelve 
spokes, viz. months) and therefore when safare (with six spokes) 
is mentioned in 1. 164. 12 a period of sis months could well have 
been intended or could very well be got by interpretation. 

The KausitakiUp (I. 2-3), however, speaks only of Devaya- 
na and Pitryana and has no third place for worms and birds &c. 
and states (vide n 2520 below) that worms &c. also come to the same 
worid to which men return. Further, the stations of the Deva- 
yana path (Agni, bright half of the month etc.) had been given a 
counterpart in the Pitryana path in the Br. Up. and Chan. Up. 
which made the moon tbe point of divergence for the two paths. 
The Kausitaki Up. omits all the preliminary stations up to the 
moon and brings all transmigrating beings to the moon (in I. 2), 
There are some other variations also that need not be dwelt upon 
here. 

Deussen (in Ph. Up p.318) argues that in the $g verse {X 88. 
15) the two ways are really to be understood as day and night and 
he translates that verse as 'I have heard from my forefathers that 
there are two ways alike for gods and men', thus giving to the 
world pitwam tbe sense of tbe ablative and holding that -my ' is 
to beunderstood before pitrnam, though not to be understood before

night, whiob are hardly ever referred to in the Rgveda as paths. 
This verBe is explained iD the Sat. Br. XII. 8. 1. 31 »« (quoted 
below) which Bays that the two ways are those of the gods and 
pitrs and the commentary of Dyivedaganga explains the first half 
in the same way Vide also Sat. Br. I. 9. 3. 1-2 DevaySna is 
sometimes used in the plural in the Bgveda { as in III, 58. 5, 
V7I. 38. 8, VII. 76. Z, X. 51. 5, X. 98. 11). In Bg X. 15. 8 
Yama is said to enjoy offerings along with the ancient fore- 
fathers of the sage and in X. 154. 4 Tama is requested to be 
united with ancient pitrs, righteous and full of austerities. 
The Sat. Br. (XIII. 8 1. 5) states that the door to the world of 
the Fathers is in the southwest, while Northeast is the direction 
of Gods and men (I. 2. 5. 17 and XII. 4. %. 15). The Atham- 
veda (XV. 12. 5.) mentions both PitrySna and Devayana paths. 
Soma, rain, food, retas (semen) may be described as watery, but 
the question is how the first akutt 'sraddha' (faith) can be des- 
cribed as an ahuti offered in Agni (viz. the yonder world) by 
the Gods from which king Soma arises (in Chan. Up V.4. % 
and Br. Up. VI. %. 9 ). ThiB is answered by V. S 25W W. 1. 5 and 
(and at some length) in the Sankarabhasya thereon.

fcausUafa Up. doctrine of two paths 1^55 

by Citra Gargyayaui (v. 1. Gangyayni) to Svetaketu, son of 
S.runi. Tt is passed over here for reasons of space and as not of 
material importance except one passage which runs ' He { Gitra ) 
said that all those that depart from this worifl go to the moon; in 
the bright half the moon is increased by their spirits, in the dark 
half the moon sends them on to be born again. The moon is 
verily the door of the heavenly world. Now if a man disowns 
the moon ( i e is dissatisfied with life there ) the moon sets him 
free But if a man is not dissatisfied then the moon sends him 
down as rain here (on the earth). And according to his deeds 
and according to his knowledge he is born again here as a 
worm, a locust, a bird, a tiger or a lion or a fish, or a snake, as 
a man or as something else in different places.' Then I 3 begins 
by referring to Davayana and I 4 ends by saying, 'being freed 
from good deedB and from evil deed3, he, the knower of brahman, 
( neuter ) moves towards brahman alone ' 

IntheKathopanisad 2521 Tama tells Naciketas the secret 
about Brahmavidya and what the self becomes on the death ( of 
the body) viz some men go to a mother's womb for an 
embodied existence while others are transferred into stumps 
(of trees) according to their deeds and knowlege. 

The Br. Up VI 2 15-16 and Chan Up V. 3. 10 ff deal with 
the question of those who go by Davayana and by the Pitryana 
paths. First m» the Br. Up 'Those ( even householders ) who 
know this (Pancaguividyai and also those (hermits and ascetics ) 
who, in the forest being full of faith, worship Truth (Brahman 
HiranyagaTbha) go to aras (light), from arcis to day (ahan)

person born of the mind ( of Brahma ) comes to them andleads them 
to the worlds of Brahma. In these worlds they being exalted, 
dwell for ageB and there is no return (to samsara) for them. But 
they who conquer ( attain ) worlds by sacrifice, charity and aus- 
terities go to smoke, from smoke to night, from night to decrea- 
sing half (of the month), from decreasing half month to the six 
month during which the Sun moves in the south, from these 
months to the world of the fathers, from the world of the fathers 
to the Moon, having reached the Moon, they become food and 
then the Devas feed on them there as sacrificers feed on king 
Soma as it increases and decreases (in a sacrifice). But when 
this ( the result of their works done on earth ) is exhausted they 
return to either (akasa), from that to Vayu, from Vayu to 
rain, from rain to the earth; on reaching the earth they become 
food. They are then again offered into the fire called man, from 
that ( i. e. man) they are born in the fire called woman. These, 
making efforts to secure worlds (by sacrifices &o ), again and 
again repeat coming to this world. Those, however, who do not 
know both these paths, they become (are born as) worms, locusts 
(or birds) and flies. ' 

The Chan. TJp V. 10, 1-2 are almost in the same words as 
Br. Up. VI. 2 15 with a few slight changes via. Chan. Up. reads 
' Sraddha tapa ityupasate ' and ' from months in the north to the 
year, from year to the Sun, from the Sun to the Moon, from the 
Moon to lightning; there is a person who is not human (amsn- 
avah' for 'manasah' of Br. Up.) who leads him to brahman &a.\ 
then Chan. Up. V. 10. 3-4 are again the same as Br Up VI 2. 
16 except that Chan. Up. reads 'those who living ™ a village 
practise (a life of) sacrifices, works of public utility ( called jwrfa) 
and almsgiving, go to smoke', but adds 'these do not reach the 
year,' and proceeds 'from the months to the world of fatois, 
from that world to ether, from ether to the moon, this is king 
Soma that is the food of Gods ( i. e the gods like or love , ft m ).

Qlian. Up. on conduct moulding future lo57 

One of the most important passages in the Upanisads on 
conduofc fashioning the life that would follow is the Chan. Up. V. 
10. 7-8 which may ha rendered as follows: 8553 Those whose 
oonduct has been good will quickly attain some good birth, the 
birth of a brahmana, of a ksatriya or of a vaisya But those 
whose conduct has been evil will quikly attain an evil birth, the 
birth of a dog or a hog or a candala. Those that do not go by 
either of the two paths become those small creatures (worms, 
flies &o) that are continually returning and whose destiny may 
be said to be 'to live and die' Theirs is a third place (apart 
from the two paths). Therefore the yonder world does not become 
full. Hence one should be disgusted (with this Samsara). 

It may be stated here that the Bhagavadglta (VH1 23-27) 
also refers to the two paths following one of which a yogin does 
not return to this world and following the other of which he 
returns to this world. These are called sukla (bright) and 
krsna(dark) gati (inVm. 26) and srti (in VIII. 27). The 
former is fire, lights* day, the bright half of the month, the six 
months of the northern path of the sun; those men who have 
realized brahman when going from this world go to brahman 
(the absolute)'. The latter path is 'smoke, night, the dark half 
( of the month ), the sis months of the southern path of the Sun • 
the yogin reaching the moon-light by that path returns to 
this world. The S5ntiparva»* of the Mahabharata refers to the 
northern and southern paths, the latter of which is attained by 
gifts, stady of Veda and sacrifices (as in Br. Up VI 2.16 and 
Chan Up. V.1Q. 8). The YajSavalkya-smrti^ also refers to those

paths. In III. 195-196 it mentions the Pitryana path, which is 
very like the one described in Br. Up. VI. 2. 16 ( except that 
Yaj omits akasa ) "and Chan. Up. V. 10. 3-7 (which mentions 
more stages than in Br. Up.). Yaj III. 197 also states that 
those who do not know any one of these two paths ( l e. do not 
perform the acts peculiar to those who go hy these paths) bBtsome 
snakes, locusts, creeping insects or worms. 

The Vedantasutra frequently refers to the dootrine of trans- 
migration, but owing to the limits imposed by available spaoe 
only a few important sutras and their explanations will be set 
out here. The three sutras of V. S H. 1. 34-36 s17 are of great 
importance for the theory of transmigration. An objector says 
' to hold that God is the cause of the world does not stand to 
reason, for, if it be so, God would be liable to the charges of un- 
equal treatment (or dispensation) and cruelty. He creates 
some that enjoy extreme happiness (like gods and others), soma 
lead an extaemely miserable life such as beasts ( of burden &o.) 
and some like men, who enjoy an intermediate position, secure 
a modicum of enjoyment. So God may be charged with aoting 
through hatred and love (like ordinary men). God also 
produces misery and finally destroys all persons. This aspaofc 
(of great cruelty) appears abhorrent even to evil men. To this 
the reply is: if god had created inequality in the world at his 
sweet will and without regard to any other matter, he might 
have been liable to the two oharges of unequal treatment and 
cruelty. But God has regard to the righteousness (merit) or other- 
wise of beings when he produces inequalities among creator n.

exalted by good works nor degraded by evil works, but it is 
He indeed who inspires (a person) to do good works, whom be 
wishes to lead nigh over those worlds and it is he who in- 
spires one to do evil deedB whom he wishes to lead down from 
these worlds'. It will be noticed that the Kauslfcaki bases the 
attainment of a higher life ( or birth ) or a lower life on the 
quality of men's deeds (just as in Br Up. HL % 13, IV. 4. 5, 
Chan Up. V. 10 7, Prasna 3. 7 ). The Gits, states ' I treat them 
the same way (with appropriate fruits) in which they come 
to ( or approach) me.' 

Another objection is raised to the above proposition 
contained in V. S. IL 1. U. The Upanisads often state *In the 
beginning there was that only which is one without a second 
( Chan. Up. VI. 2. 1 sad-eva somyedam agra asld-ekam eva- 
dvitlyam). Therefore, before creation there was no difference 
between deeds and so there could have been no inequality among 
the first created beings dependent on difference in deeds. You 
may say that after difference in deeds arose God has regard to 
deeds of men, but all beings created in the beginning must 
have been alike. To thiB the reply is that samsara is without 
beginning (anadi) and that such a conception of the beginning- 
lessness of samsara stands to reason and is supported by (Sruti) 
tests.

receive the fruits of their good and bad actions through Isvara 
who does not aot at his sweet will but has regard to good or 
bad conduct. 

A few passages about kai ma and transmigration and stories 
illustrating how people's minds were affected by them in ancient 
times may be cited here. The Ap. Dh. 253(> S. provides 'Members 
of all varnas (classes) reap ( in heaven ) highest and measureless 
happiness by oarrying out their prescribed duties ; thereafter 
( i. e after enjoying happiness in heaven ) they return ( to this 
world ) on account of the ( unen joyed ) residue of the resultB of 
their actions and secure birth m an < appropriate ) caste ( or 
family ), beauty of form, charming oomplexion, power, mental 
ability, wisdom, wealth, the (blessing of the ) performance of 
duties and this results in happinesB only in both worlds like a 
wheel. A similar rule applies to the increase of the results of evil 
acts. The thief of gold, one guilty of brahmana murder, according 
as he belongs to the brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya class, after 
undergoing torments in hell for a limited time becomes respec- 
tively a canjala, paulkasa or vama ' The Gautama Dharma- 
sutra has a passage in very similar words: 'Members of the 
varnas ( brahmana and others ) and of asramas ( brahmaoarin 
&c) who are devoted to performing the appropriate duties ( of 
their class or stage in life ) enjoy the fruit (heaven) of their 
actions after death and then by virtue of the residue ( of their 
actions) they attain a (new) birth ( in this world ) endowed 
with a good country, caste, family, life, learning, character, 
wealth, mental ability and happiness Those who act ^ contrary

after a long time because it is hampered by the results of an 
evil deed and quotes a smrti ( Mababharata ) in support. 2531 

The principle of the doctrine of Karma is that every act, 
whether good or bad, produces a certain result or return which 
cannot be escaped. In tbe physical world there is the universal 
law of causation. The doctrine of Karma extends this inexorable 
law of causality to the mental and moral sphere. The doctrine of 
Karma is not a mechanical law; it is rather a moral or a spiri- 
tual necessity. It cannot, however, he said that this doctrine is an 
induction from observed facts nor can it be asserted that it is ex- 
perimentally verifiable, but it is only a hypothesis or supposition ; 
it is, however, far better than other naive and childlike theories. 
In the absense of the theory of karma and rebirth it would have 
to be assumed that the world is arbitrary, that the Creator is not 
bound to regard the nature of men's actions but may distribute 
rewards as he pleases or by oaprice. This doctrine of Karma em- 
phasizes three things, firstly it regards an existence as a sort of 
expiation for the doings of a previous existence or existences; 
secondly, an evil deed cannot be expiated by works of merit but its 
punishment must be borne; thirdly, the punishment for wrong 
is automatic and personal. Under the doctrine of Karma there 
is no sucb thing as ohance or luck. When we use those words 
they correspond to no reality and aTe a tacit confession of our 
ignorance or inability to state the cause or causes of what has 
happened. This doctrine of Karma leads on to the doctrine of 
transmigration. The results of a man's actions may not happen 
at once or in the present life. The Adiparva and Mann say 1 * 3 * 
an evil deed does not yield its retribution immediately like a 
a cow ( that yields plenty of milk immediately after she is well 
fed ) but returning slowly it cuts off the very roots of the perpe-

trator." Man's actions in past existences determine or fashion 
the nature of the present existence and the actions in the present 
existence taken along with the residue of past actions will deter- 
mine the future existence. This, in short, is the basis of the 
doctrine of punarjanma. The modifications introduced by texts 
or popular notions will be briefly dealt with later. The theory 
of rebirth is as logical as any of the hypotheses that hold the 
field about what happens after physical death of the body. It is 
certainly as satisfactory as (or rather more satisfactory than) 
the theory of absolute annihilation after physical death (held by 
atheists) or the theory of eternal reward or retribution in heaven 
or hell (for confirmed criminals of one life). The leaders or 
exponents of almost all religions hold that God is with tham 
and they generally have never seen ( up to at least the 19th 
century A. D. ) any ,good outside their respective Ob.uroheB. 
Hinduism of the Upanisads and Glta is the only religion and 
philosophy that proclaimed thousands of years ago that the man 
of good deeds iB nearest to God on account of his goodness and 
the man of evil deeds cannot secure divine grace and fellow- 
ship, whomsoever he may regard as a prophet or messiah sent 
by God. 

The Vedantasutra in III. 1 examines the passages of the 
Cbjin. Up. and of the Br. Up. dealing with Pancagnividya. It is 
not possible to set out in detail the discussions in the bhSsya of 
Sankara on the sutras in V. S IH. 1. Some of the important 
final conclusions are : The individual self, while passing from 
one body to another, is accompanied or surrounded by subtle 
elements (bhutasuksma), that the Shutis are spoken of as apah 
(in Chan. Up. V. 9 1 ) because the human body is full of flu "» 
in the form of chyle, blood &c, because saored works lite 
Agnihotra &c. are the causes of a new body after death and in 
those works the principal materials used ( such as Soma juice, 
ST «X) are mainly fluid. In the statement that those who 
Sform sacrifices ft* go to the moon by the Fitryana path an 
SSSi* IB offered as oblation from which Som. **» £ 
food of gods arises, the words 'food of go are used »

enjoyed on the earth. 5313 This combines the idea of a life beyond 
(often referred to in the Rgveda) with the notion of rebirth and 
offers two prizes for good deeds (viz reward in heaven and then 
a rehirth with material well-being and cultural environment, as 
in Gautama Dh. S. XI. 39 and Gita VL 37-45 and there ia a 
double penalty for evil deeds (viz. hell torture and then a 
despised or low life ). 

The V. S. (EX 1. 13-17) further explains that all men do not 
go to the moon, but only those that perform sacrifices &o. and 
those that do not perform sacrifices or works of public utility 
but are guilty of evil acts go to the abode of Tama for under- 
going tortures of hell 7SSA ( which are seven, according to V. S. 
III. 1. 15) and after that they come to the earth. Those who follow 
the path of faith and austerity go by the Devayana path (Chan. 
Up. V. 10. 1 and Mundak a I a. 11) and those who perform 
sacrifices, charity and works of public utility go by thepitryana 
path (Chan. Up. V. 10. 3 and Mundaka I 2. lO)**" 5 and "those 
that do not follow any one of the two have to go to a third place 
and be born as worms &c. (Chan. Up. V. 10. 8), that when a 
sruti test like Kausltaki Up. (1.2) states that all those that 
depart from this world go to the moon, what is meant by 'all' ia 
aU those that have the aihikara (capability or fitness) to go to 
the moon. 

_ There is one word, namely ' samsara \ which occurs frequently 
in the comparatively later literature on Vedanta and Dharma- 
sastra but rarely in the Upanisads It means 'passing through 
a Buoeeauon or a round or a cycle of births and deaths' The

Kathopanisad says ZS3S ' that poraon who has no understanding, 
Who Las not controlled his mind, who is always impure, does not 
attain that (highest) state and undergoes samsara (births and 
deaths)'. The St. tip. VI. 16 speaks of the Supreme Spirit 
as the ' creator and knower of the universe, as self-born, the 
knowor, the destroyer of time, possessing (all) qualities, know- 
ing everything, Lord of Pradhana, individual souls and the 
gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas) and as the cause of release from 
samsara, of sustaining it and of bondage.' The MaitrayanI Up. 
I 4. says ' such being the nature of samsara what is the use 
of the enjoyment (of pleasures)'. The Muktika Up. (II. 37) 
states ' mind is established as the root of the faee of samsara'. 
The word 'samsara' occurs in the Vedantasutra 2537 IV. %. 8. Tho 
Bbagavadglta mentions tho word several times e. g. ' men who 
have no faith in this way (of life) do not attain to me (Lord 
Krsna) and return to the path of death and transmigration 
(IX. 3); those whose minds are fixed on me I deliver in no tim» 
from the ocean of death and transmigration' (XII. 7). The 
Manusmrti employs the word samsara frequently e. g. in th« 
table of the subjects to be treated in the Smrti'the passing 
through samsara' is mentioned (in 1 117) and the 12th chap, 
uses the word often. It is said ( in XII. 51 ) ' the entire samara 
of three kinds due to three sorts of Karma affeoting all beings 
has been expounded'. After describing the various character- 
istics of the three gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas (in XU. 26-vft», 
and the effects of these gunas (XH. 30-38), Manu states that 
those in whom sattva, rajaB or tamas preponderates respectively 
become gods, men or lower animals and again divides each ot 
these three classes into lowest, middling and **>*«<*"• 
40-50). Manu uses the word 'samsSra'u .the ptaajl [in»J 
58,54 70) in the sense of gati' or W. In chap. VI .40-60 
Manu first dilates at length on the daily routine of one who has 
eXed on the stage of sannyasa, what he should wear _«d 
carry how he should maintain himself, how he should ^tram

What a sannyasm should ponder over 1565 

his senses and give up love and hate and practise ahimsa and 
then proceeds 'he should ponder over the destinies of men due 
to had deeds, falling in hell and the tortures of hell, separation 
from loved ones and contact with undesirable persons, the 
ravages of old age and the pains of diseases, the departing from 
the body and again lying in the womb and the passage of the 
soul through thousands of crores of births of all sorts.' It is 
entirely wrong to suppose (as done by Mr. Sanjana on p 10 of 
his ' Dogma of reincarnation ' ) that Manu prescribes that ' each 
ego has to go through ten thousand millions of existences.' 
Manu nowhere says so. All that he means is that the SannySsin 
desirous of liberation should revolve in his mind the possibility 
of some souls having to migrate through millions of births. Yaj 
(in in. 169) employs the verb 'samsarati' in the sense of 
'undergoes births* and states 'The fruition of actions done by 
some men results after death (in other bodies) or in this very 
life ( as in the case of Karlrl sacrifice) and in some cases either 
in this world or the next (i. e. there is no hard and fast sastra 
rule that fruits of actions result immediately after they are done) ; 
it also states in a fine simile :S3S ' just as an actor, when acting' 
different parts, colours his body in different colours (fair, dark, 
brown), so the soul assumes various forms (as short, hunchback, 
&c. ), assumes different bodies due to the various acts done by it. 
In Taj HI. 140 the word samsara itself occurs ' The soul affected 
by (or under the influence of) rajas and tamas, wandering in 
this world and coming in contact with undesirable object* 
(or mental attitudes) goes through transmigration ( i. e assumes 
various bodies) '. This is in reply to the question in Yaj. HE, 
189 ( IsvaTah sa katham bhavairanistaih samprayujyate ). The 
Suntiparva 25 " remarks ' there is no doubt that in life there is 
far more misery than happiness'. The Puranas often harp on 
the theme that samsara is impermanent, abounds in sorrows 
and is fragile like a plantain leaf ( «. g vi da the Brahmapurana 

™^*r amty i e duhkhaba1lu k kadalldalasannibhe' (178 
179) The present writer cannot help feeling that this view of 
the thorough miserableness of life has been so much apd so 
persistently dinned into the ears of common people not only by 

133. ica. *. ™ ds Cfi JKjrcss ^S IT m - 



1566 History of Dharmaiastra I Sec. t£, Oh. XXXV 

muoh of Sanskrit literature but also by medieval saints like 
Tukaratn (who says 'happiness is as little as a grain of barley 
while misery is as big as a mountain') that people have lost 
zest in lifo, are unable to put their heart and soul and serloua 
efforts for improving their own lot and the lot of others. It 
cannot be denied that in India the doctrine of Karma, instead 
of being a powerful means of urging all men to put great 
efforts in doing good deeds and a gospel of hope, became in the 
minds of many confused with fatalism, whioh led man to 
beoomo feeble, submissive and disinclined to work hard. 

All the above discussion in the Upanisads about transmi- 
gration of the individual self are valid and concerned with tho 
empirical or phenomenal world (samslravastha or vyavahsra- 
vastha) but considered from the highest metaphysical stand- 
point of thorough-going advaita ( the para vidya of Mundaka 
1. 1. 5-G or amurta biahma of Br. Up. II. 3. 5-6) it falls to the 
ground, since the individual self is non-different from the 
Absolute Bmhman. 6ankaraoarya on V. S. II. 3. 30 emphasizes 
this point. He states : As long as the individual self is in 
samsara state and has not attained perfect knowledge and 
brought the empirical or phenomenal state to an end, so long tho 
connection of the self with buddhi does not cease. As long as 
this connection with buddhi (a limiting adjunct) lastB, so long 
lasts the state of being an individual self merged in sa™ 51 *; 
But tho real truth is that there is no entity called jlea by ittffl 
except in so far as it is fictitiously hypostatic by buddfo, the 
limiting adjunct. For, when we determine the wal . meaning 
of Vedanta tests, we find no intelligent substance other to 
the one omniscient Lord whose nature is eternal fr^om Itm 
Sankaracarya cites certain texts (viz. Br. Up. I, A. ■ 7 .P' 7 "'J 
(Sin. pp. VI. 1.6, VI. 8. 7 »'° and remarks that the rejH

hundreds of such teste. Sankaracarya states that even 

that there is non-difference between the two. 

The theory of transmigration postulates that each life is the 
result or fruit of the actions of the preceding existence or 
existences. It follows from this that if we go backwards fin 
enough, no existence or birth can be the first. Therefore, the 
Vedantasfitra had to declare ( in II. 1.35 quoted in n. 2537 above) 
thatsamsaraisttnfftft(begimiingless). But this is in conflict 
with many passages of the Upanisads, which, m speaking of 
creation, employ the words ' in the beginning ' ( as in Chan. Up. 
VI. 2.1, Br. Up. L 4., 1, 10 and 17, V. 5.1, Tai. Up. II. 7. 1). In 
order to get over this confliot the conception of the recurring 
creation of the universe periodically from all eternity was 
postulated by means of the machinery of kalpas, 2542 which 
provides that the universe created by biahman persists through a 
vast period called Kalpa, after the lapse of which it is absorbed 
into brahman. Vide Santiparva 231. 29-32 { Oh. ed. = cr. ed. 224. 
28-31). It is stated in the Glta VHX 17-19 that the day of 
Brahma is equal to one thousand yugas ( four yugas make one 
unit or Mahayuga ) and the night of Brahma is also of the same 
duration. All objects spring up from Prakrti at the advent of 
the day of Brahma and at the advent of night are absorbed ( or 
merged ) in the Prakrti. Vide Bhagavadglta IX. 7 also ' at the 
end of a Kalpa all elements ( or beings ) pass into prakrti over 
which I preside , but when the nest Kalpa starts I send them 
forth". 

The reasoning is; just as we cannot decide which comes first, 
the seed or sprouting plant, so it is impossible to say which

comes first ( body or Karma ), since no body is possible without 
Karma ( deeds ) and no deeds are possible without a body. The 
Chan. Up. (7.13-2) states " that Being ( deity ) that bad produced 
fire, water, and earth thought ' let me enter those three beings (fire, 
water and earth ) with this living self and then develop names 
and forms," That shows that Jiva (the selE) was there at the 
time of creation and thereby indicates that samsara is beginning- 
less. The ftgveda in X. 190.3, expressly says 'the creator 
arranged ( or created ) as before.' 25 ' 20 Similarly, the GifcS ( 15.3 ) 
states ' the real form of it ( of the tree of samsara ) is not thus 
perceived, nor its end nor beginning nor its support; having out 
off this deeply rooted Aivattha ( pippala ) tree with the powerful 
sword of non-attachment, that place must be sought for from 
which, those who have reached it do not again return \ The 
Smrti verses relied upon by Sankaraoarya on V. S. 1.3.30 ore

2542a. It is possible that the words 'dhata yathapurvamalalpayat ' (In 
Eg. X. 190.3 ) simply mean that the Creator arranged the Sun, this Moon, 
Heaven, Earth and regions according to the priorities (or their proper order). 
But it cannot be gainsaid that these words are at least the germs ot the later 
doctrine of Kalpa. Manvantara & c Sankaracarya on V. S. I. 3.30 explains 
the Rgveda verse as -the creator created in the present Kalpa the universe 
mcluding the Sun and the Moon in the same way as in the prec eding Kal pa-

Wxerltons for perfection are not lost 1569 

The Bhagavadglta (VI 37-45) is very emphatio that no 
exertions'made by a man on the path of Yoga with faith are 
lost even if he does not quickly attain perfection. Lord Krsna 
replies (VI. 40 ff) that such a man failing to secure perfection 
does not come to an evil end, but he attains to the worlds of the 
righteous, dwells there for many years, is born in the houses of 
prosperous and pure men or is born in the family of wise yogins» 
where he regains the mental impressions of his past Uvea. He 
makes fresh efforts to gain perfection and is carried forward 
irresistibly by his practice in former lives and being free from all 
sins and perfecting himself through many lives attains the 
highest goal. In the GJta, Krsna says (in IV. 5) 'many are 
my lives that are past and thine also. All of them I know but 
thou knowest them not." In many places the Glta touches upon 
the doctrine of transmigration f such as in II. 12-13 and 22-27 
IV 8-9, YII 19, VEL6, 15-16, IS.. 21 ). 

In chapters 30-32 (of ch. ed.) of Vanaparva there is a 
dialogue between Draupadi and Yudhisthira, who, having lost 
his kingdom in gambling with the Kauravasj, was in exile and 
hard pressed Draupadi wonders how such a straightforward, 
mild, benevolent and truthful prince allowed his mind to be 
involved in gambling (30.19), that God does not act towards 
beings like a father or mother, but He appears to be irascible 
like a common man, when she sees that honourable men of high 
character have difficulties in maintaining themselves and dis- 
honourable men live in pleasures (30 38-39); she proceeds 
human beings, «« ignorant and having no control over happi- 
ness and misery, go to heaven or hell at the caprice of God" 
\udhisthua warns her that she talks like an atheist, that he 
performed no deed with the thought of seeking the reward 
thereof, that he made gifts and performed sacrifices because he 
held that it was his duty to do so.' He asked her to give up 
atbe»tao talk and not to disrespect Highest God. Then 
Draupam came round and replied that she did not mean to dis 
respect or censure Dharma, that it is far from her thoughts to 
show durwpect to God, but that, being stressed, sh talked

what people mean by dista (fate) or hatha (chance) or nature 
(svabhaia) and winds up by saying that whatever a peraon 
gains is all the result of deeds in past liveB. 

It is not necessary to say here anything about human effort 
(purusahura) and daiui. That topic has been dealt with and 
the different views of ancient and medieval writers about the 
respective spheres of these two have been pointed out in H, of 
Dh. vol. HI. pp. 168-170 and notes 214-216. 

When the Bon of GautamI, who was an old woman that had 
attained control of mind, died by snake-bite, a hunter caught 
the snake, brought it bound to GautamI and said that he would 
kill the snake for having bitten an innocent and unoffending 
boy. GautamI dissuades him from killing the snake by stating 
' by killing the snake my son would not bo brought back to life, 
I see no good in killing the snake.' Then Kfila came forward 
and explained ' Just as a potter moulds from a lump of olay 
whatever he desires, so man secures fruits of deeds dono hy 
himself ; the boy's death was due to his deeds in a former life ' 
and GautamI agreed that her son died by his own deads in a 
previous life and that her bereavement by the death of her son 
was due to her own former deeds. 2SW This story oocurs in tho

Karma follows the soul unerringly 1511 

its own mother from among thousands of cows, so ka.1 ma done 
in a previous life pursues the doer of it.' The Asvamedhika- 451 * 
parva asserts that there is no destruction of good and evil actions ; 
they ripen and produce results when the self passes from one 
body to another. The Santiyarva (or ed. 316. 25 and 35=ch.ed. 
339 25, 35 ) avers ' a man by performing good deeds secures the 
state of a god, he is reborn as a human being by actions of 
a mixed character (good and evil both) and he is bora as lower 
( than man) by evil deeds , when you (yourself ) start after death 
no one will follow you , only your good or evil deeds will follow 
you when you leave this world ' 

All strata of Hindu society were permeated by the theory 
of Karma and transmigration. Great Sanskrit poets often 
allude to it. In the Raghuvamsa XI. 22 describing the visit of 
Kama to the hermitage of Vamana pointed out by Visvamifcra, 
KalidSsa renmks 'Rama became restless (or disturbed) in 
mind, though not remembering his actions in the former 
existence as Vamana' (both Vamana and Elma being avataras of 
Visnu) Similarly, in Sakuntala (Act V) the poet remarks * when 
on seeing charming sights and hearing pleasing words, a person, 
though surrounded by pleasures, becomes restless (or sorrowful)' 
that is indeed due to this that his mind unconsciously has the 
impressions of loves and friendships of past lives presented to 
it . In the seventh Act of the same play w hen Dusyanta and 
Sakantala were re-united, she, referring to her previous rejection 
by the king, remarks «• 'indeed at that time some (bad) 
actions of mine da some former life) hampered my good deeds

Many questions naturally arise on tha doctrine of Karma 
and transmigration. One ol them is discussed by the bhasya of 
Vyasa on Yogasutra II. 13, In Yogasutra II. 3 five klelas 
(hindrances) such as avidya (nescience) are enumerated and it 
is stated (II. 13 ) that these Mesas lead on to fruition of actions 
by way of birth, life ( long or short ), kind of experience. Actions 
(Karma) are of four sorts according to Yogasutra (IV. 7)vk 
Icrsna (dark found in wicked people ), (2) iuklakrsna (white- 
dark) that are accomplished by external moans in whioh tboro 
is some injury to or benefit of others; (3) iukla (white) 
belonging to those who engage in tapas, svadhyayaf study of 
the sacred texts) and contemplation; because this kind of deed 
depends on the mind alone and does not depend on external 
means and does not involve injury to others ; (4) AsuMaltmna 
(neither white nor dark), whioh is found in sannySsins (ascetic 
saints) whose hindrances (avidya &o) have dwindled and whoso 
bodies are the last (they will have). Of these four kinds, the 
yogin alone haB non-white karma since he has renounced the 
fruit of all actions (even of good ones) and he has alcrsna since 
he will never resort to dark actions. The bhasya on Yogasutra 
II. 13 states four questions, (1) whether one Karma is the cauao 
of one birth, or (3) whether one Karma is the cause of more 
births than one; (3) whether more than one Karma brings 
about more births than one; (4) whether more than one Karma 
brings about one birth. The bhasya rawes objections to the first 
three and states that the fourth alternative alone is acceptable. 
Vide p. 1417 note 2335 for the text of the Yogabhssya on theBO 
four alternatives. The Santiparva (chap. 373. 33-34 of cr. «L 
=chap 280. 33-34 of oh. ed.) mentions individual souls as of six 
colours viz. krma ( dark ), dhutm a ( grey ), nila ( blue ), laUa (rod), 
hartdra (yellow) and iukla (white) in an ascending order, 
the dark being the lowest and kulda being the highest ana 
verses 36-46 describe these six in detail. 

There are several features of our present life Hurt can to 
more satisfactorily explained on the theory of t^gjg 
than on any other. Why do two people who have seen but liiu 
S^ne another feel friendship or hatred? The surm^e tha n

be shocked by the inequalities in the world, if such a doctrine 
were not there. The hypothesis and belief that all human 
volition and conduct will suitably be rewarded and punished 
in subsequent existences has an important bearing on present 
conduct, would act as an urge to continual effort for good- 
ness in this life and is likely to deter men from vice and 
cruelty This doctrine of karma not only offers an explana- 
tion about the varying degrees of happiness and unhappmess 
among human beings, but also accounts for differences in 
material well-being and unhealthy bodily conditions It offers 
a solution of the problem of evil in the world and explains 
precocious abilities in mathematics, music and arts among 
children and grown up men as in the case of Ramanujan about 
whom Prof. Hardy of Cambridge ( in ' Kamanujan,* Cambridge, 
1940 ) says that he was the most romantic figure in the recent 
mathematics. If rightly understood, it is not pessimistic or 
fatalist, but rather emphasizes all out human effort in this life. 
It will be seen how many of the works on DharmasSstra or 
connected with it a8 sources emphasize effort ( puxusakara ) as 
against views of various people that it is Daioa or Svahhava or 
time or the combination of all these that yield rewards or 
retribution in this life It also explains sudden accession of 
prosperity or high position such as, for example, a poor man's 
son being adopted by a prince or queen and then becoming an 
enlightened and famous ruler as was the case with the late 
Sayaurao Maharaj Gaikwad of Baroda. 

Even from Upanisadio times various views were held about 
the origin of the world and similar questions. The Sv Ud 
(II) asks the question 'Is brahma the cause? Whence ar.

good or bad results are due to daiut and pu, usakam and that the 
former is nothing but effort of former existences that has begun 
to manifest results. The Santiparva ( chap. 238. 4-5=cr. ed 230 
4-5) refers to the fact that there are three views -viz either 
human effort ot daua or svabham being the cause, but its own 
view appears to be that Purusakara and Daiva combino to 
produce fruits. The Matsyapurana {221. 8) asserts that daita, 
effort and lula working together produce the fruits of actions. 
The Brahmandapurana (21. 8. 61-62) refers to three views viz'. 
Daiva, effort and Svabhava are put forward as causes separately 
but its own view is that daiva and effort together yield fruits. 

It may be stated here that Karma is put in three groups viz. 
sancita, pi arabdha and ki tyamana ( or saficIyamSna ). The first 
is the total accumulated deeds of all past existsnces, the fruits of 
which have not been experienced. The pruiabdha Karma is 
that which was the strongest among the group of safiata deeds 
just before the present existence of a person begins and which is 
supposed to determine one's present existence. What a person 
accumulates during the present existence is called kriyamana (or 
sanciyamana, being collected ) and the next existence is 
determined by the strongest ( or the earliest according to some ) 
among the sancita and kriyamana deeds put together. As the 
Icarmans 25S * are of different characters and yield different 
consequences ( heaven m case of sultvika deeds, or the earth or 
mid-regions when they are mainly rujasa ), and places of 
tortures when deeds are mainly tamasa the existences ( or 
births or bodies ) differ and the Belf being affected by the body, 
the individual souls appear as different. The objection is raised 
that freedom of will is the basis of all ethical values and that 
if a man's Karma in p^ast lives determines the present life, then a 
man in the present life is merely a toy in the power of Karma 
and has no power to do as he sees best The question about a man's 
freedom of will is a most thorny one, on which the greatest thinkers 
from ancient times to the present day have differ ed 1551 and no

satisfactory xeply can be given. There are- numerous works on 
discussions on Free will and Determinism such, as RashdalFs 
' Theory of good and evil ' vol IT. pp. 302-355 ( 1907 ) on ' Free 
Will,' Bergsons's ' Time and Free will,' Viscount Samuel in 
1 Belief and action ' pp 303-320 , but the present author does not 
propose to recommend any of these books to the reader of this 
volume But if the reader wants a small book on the Free Will 
controversy he may read the book by M. Davidson ( London, 
1942 ) So far as the Indian doctrine of Karma is concerned, it 
appears that freedom of will is postulated for a man during the 
present existence to lead a good moral life and perform 
meritorious acts subject to the limitations caused by the 
environment in which the present existence is cast. The 
important working belief is that one ha3 free will and that one 
is free in the present existence to mould the future ( so far as he 
is concerned) by means of meritorious works This is the 
message of the Santiparva 2552 Lord Krsna, after a long discourse 
in the Bhagavadgita gives Ajjuna permission to do as the latter 
likes ( 18 63 ' yathecchasi tatha kuru ' ) In Glta 9.30 also Lord 
Krsnasays'if even a person of the vilest conduct worships me 
with undivided devotion, he must be held to be righteous, for ha 
has made a right resolve ' Similarly, in VL 5 the Gita provides 
' let a man lift himself higher by himself, let him not degrade 
himself; for the self alone is the friend of the self and the self 
alone is the enemy of the self. Vide notes below for Upanisad 
passages, V S. and SankarabhSsya. It is possible to accept on 
the ancient Indian doctrine, both predestination and free will 
the first so far as one's being born in a certain environment is' 
concerned and the 2nd so far as one's actions in the present life 
are concerned The Bhagavadgita ( VI 5-6 } holds out the hope 
even to a sinner that it is never too late to mend and (II 40)

Buddha and the doctrine of Karma IS?"? 

idea of transmigration as described in the Upanisads had become 
universal in India at the time of Buddha. Buddha rejected the 
reality of a permanent ego or self as an entity. He was not a 
metaphysical philosopher, but wanted to lay down a way or 
method by which mankind could be freed from ignorance and 
suffering and liberation could be achieved. Therefore, while 
rejecting a permanent ego he accepted the doctrine of rebirth. 

A side issue has been very much debated by some eminent 
scholars, viz whether the cherishera of the Vedanta thoughts 
were originally the Ksatriyas and not the Brahmanas, The 
present author dealt with that question in a brief compass in 
H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 105-107 and note 222. Deusaen in 'Das 
System des Vedanta' (1883 pp. 18-19) and Ph. Up. (tr. by 
Geden pp. 18-19 ) and Dr. R G. Bhandarkar in ' Vaisnavism and 
Saivism ' p 9 hold the view that the ksatriyas were the original 
possesseors of Vedanta doctrines Deussen relies mainly on sk 
passages and Dr. Bhandarkar on two only (Chan. V. 3 and 11) 
and besides Deussen ( in Ph. Up. p 19 ) admits that his conclu- 
sion is not absolute certainty but has a high degree of 
probability. Barth in 'Religions of India* p. 6S, Hopkins in 
'Ethics of India '(1934) p. 63, 'Vedic India' by Macdonelland 
Keith (vol. H. p. 206 ), and Tuxen on ' The religions of India ' 
(Copenhagen, 1949, p. 88) do not subscribe to this view 
Deussen went so far as to aver (p 19 ) ' this teaching with regard 
to the ,Ul man was studiously withheld from them { the brahmanas), 
that it was transmitted m a narrow circle among the ksatriyas 
to the exclusion of the brahmanas '. The present author had 
not set out the passages on which reliance was placed by Deussen 
and those who followed him. They will be set out here and will 
be examined as to the contest in which they appear and the 
ubjec with which they deal. But it must fiJt be emphasized

in Br. Up. Ill, 2. 13 ' He who does good is bora good' and in IV. 4. 
5 * He who does good is bora good, he who does evil is bom evil, he 
becomes righteous by righteous works &o." are declared by Pauasen 
himself (Ph. Up. p. 410) as 'the oldest in which a doctrine of 
transmigration is found'. Therefore, according to Deuasen 
himself, the original possessor of these two fundamental doctrines 
of the Upanisads is the brabmana YSjfiavalkya who in the sama 
Upanisad (Br. Up- II. 4. 1-14) propounda to his wife Maitreyl 
the identity of the self and elements and everything else with 
&ra/*?sa ( idem sarvam yadayamStma). Not only so, there ate 
other brahmana teachers of these. For example, Uddalaka Srani 
expounds at great length to his son Svetaketu the doctrine of 
identity in the famous words ' tat-tvamasi ' (Chan. Up. VI. 8-16). 

Now the examples on which Deussen (Ph. Up. pp. 17-19) 
bases his conclusions must be cited and examined. Chan. Up. 
(V. 11. 1 ) tells the story of five (named) wealthy householders 
and great students of Veda who came together and disonssefltha 
question 'what is our atman, what is brahma'. They proposed 
to go to Uddalaka Sruni who knew the self called Vaisv&naia. 
Uddalaka thought that he would not be able to explain all land 
therefore told them that Alvapati Eaikeya (king of Ketoya 
country) at that time knew the self called VaisvSnara anA all 
five together with Uddalaka went to that king, who said » 
would give an answer the next day. The next day _fijw j« 
went to him with fuel in hand (i«p»plfl)^« 
without performing further preparatory rites-asked each rfWJ 
what they medidated upon. When each replied I a»*»«J»*Jj 
meditated upon, such as heaven, M^'^V^nK 
earth (this last by Uddalaka Sruni), he ^ *hem *hat aU th - 
ate parts of Vaisvanara and he explamed to them how 
proper Agnihotra is to be performed.

S^haTt^ 



Whal is Vaiivanara'vidya 1579 

three different views viz. that Vaisvanara is lightning or 
Aditya or terrestrial fire. The Chan. Up. { V. 18. 2 ) winds up the 
description of Vaisvanara and brings it (V. 19-24) in line with 
the oblations to five breaths (as 'Pranaya' svaha &c.) and sets 
forth the results of the observance of Agnihotra with full know- 
ledge of its true purport. The Vedantasutra (I. 2. 24-32) deals 
with what is meant by Vaisvanara in Chan. V. 11 ff, and the 
conclusion is that it meanB paramalman (the highest Self) and 
not individual self or fire as an element or the digestive 
( stomach ) heat. 

Daussen then refers to the story of Gargya Balaki ( in Br. 
Up H. 1 ) who offered to expound brahma to Ajatasatru, king of 
KasI, who offered to give a thousand cows if he did so and 
remarked that people run exclaiming ' Janaka, Janaka ' ( mean- 
ing Janaka is donor and also listener to btahma exposition ). 2SSS 
Baiaki offered twelve objects of meditation on brahma such as 
the person in the sun, the person in the moon &c. Ajatasatru 
replied as to the twelve objects that he knew them already and 
brahma is different from them and cannot be understood by 
what he said Then Balaki remained silent Balaki offered to be 
his pupil. Then Ajatasatru said**? " this is top3y-turvy that a 
brahmana should approach a ksatriya as a pupil with the idea 
* the ksatriya would expound brahman to him ' I shall make 
known to you (brahma)." So saying he took hold of Bslaki's 
hand and got up ( from his seac ). Certain matters in this story 
must be carefully noted here This does not at all say that the 
class of brahmanas did not know brahmavidya and that 
ksatnyas alone were then the only possessors of it. On the 
contrary, Janaka is specially mentioned as a donor of cows and 
is eager to listen to brahmavidya and people ran to him desiring 
to accept large gifts of cows for impart ingbrahmavidva w!

know about Janaka from Br. Up. HI 1 ff. wherein Janaka king 
of Videha, offered a thousand cows and, when Yajnavalkya took 
away those cows, numerous persons present in Janaka's court 
such as bis hotr piiest Asvala, Artabhaga, GargI, Uddalaka 
Aruni, Vidagdha Sskalya ply him with questions. In Br. Up. 
IV. 4, 7 ( Janaka offers a thousand oows to Yajnavalkya, in IV. 
4.23 (Janaka offers to give his Videha kingdom to Yajnavalkya 
along with himself as a slave ). The story of Balaki only comes 
to this at the most that when Janaka had learnt brahmavidya, 
a brahmana Balaki did not know it though he professed to know 
it, and had to be instructed in it by king Ajatasatru of KasI, 
who knew it and who only stated that a brahmana did sot 
become a pupil of a ksafcriya. All brahmnas could never have been 
proficient in brahmavidys much less ksatriyas. One regrets to 
say that Deussen is guilty of making a sweeping generalisation 
without adequate data. It may be noted that in this story 
Ajatasatru of KasI does not say that the Vidya, was not known to 
any brabmanas before ( as Pravahana Jaivali claimed ), but, on 
the contrary, expressed surprise that a brahmana should come to 
him for learning the Vidya. 

The same Btory occurs in Kausltaki Upanisad 2538 IV.1-19 
often in the same words. Balaki offers 16 explanations about 
the objects of his meditation. The V. S. devotes three sutras 
( I 4. 16-18 ) to the passage in which Ajatasatru stated He who 
is the maker of those persons ( you mentioned), he rf whom all 
this is the work, he alone is to be known '. There is m Br. Op- 
n. 1 and Kausltaki Up. IV hardly anything about tran • 
migration. Both passages simply affirm that from the Atman all 
SSL, all worlds, all gods, all elements spring ^h(Br n. 
I 20 ). This is nothing more than what is stated m the fading 
tarf ( Br Up IV. 4. 7 ) of Yajnavalkya or in Chan. Up. VI. 1-16 
^ the oSepeated words of Aruni to his son dntt* 
( aitadatmyam idam sarvam...tattvamasi ). 

It is most surprising that Deussen should press into serrice 



Sanatfaimara and Narada in Chan, Up. 1581 

it is said that Narada approached Sanatkumara and prayed 
* Teach me, Sir.* Sanatkumara said to him ' tell me what you 
know; then I shall tell you what is heyond that*. Narada 
stated (in Chan. Up. VII. 1-2} that he had studied the four 
Vedas, 2SS > Itihasa-purana and gave a long list of lores includ- 
ing Devavidya, Brahmavidya (whatever that may mean), 
ksatravidya, Naksatravidya, admitted he knew mantras only 
and did not know Atman (the Self) and added 'I have heard 
from men like you that he who knows the Atman overcomes 
sorrow. lam in sorrow; bhagavan 1 do help me to cross (to 
get over ) my sorrow.' Sanatkumara replied ' whatever you 
have studied is mere name, there is something better than a 
name *. Then Sanatkumara teaches him to meditate on speech 
as better than name, then on manas as better than speech and 
several others as better than the preceding ( in "VII. 4-24) till he 
reaches bhutnan ( the Infinite, the Faramatman ) and describes 
bhutnan in VII. 25-26 ending with the words 'all this springs 
from the Self' and it is stated at the end (in VII. 26.2) 
'Bhagavan (venerable) Sanatkumara showed to Narada, all 
whose blemishes had been crushed (uprooted), what is beyond 
darkness (avidya); they call him (Sanatkumara) Skanda' 2560 

In all this long passage there is not a word whether Sanat- 
kumara and Narada belonged to a brahmana or ksatriya class. 
Skanda is known in classical Sanskrit as the God of War (as 
in Glta X 24 ' Senanlnam-aham Skandah' ) and in the Vana- 
parva 229. 22-23 he is mentioned as the commander of the armies 
of gods and the Santiparva mentions that Narada approached 
Devala for knowledge about the creation and dissolution of the 
world (chap. 275=267 of Gr. ed.). l?rom this Deussen at once 
draws the conclusion that Sanatkumara must have been a 
ksatriya and Narada a brahmana. In the Mahabharata, Manu- 
smrti and the Puranas both of them are semi-divine sages and 
beyond varna or caste. Glta X. 13 speaks of Narada as Devarsi, 
the %ayu-purana speaks of Parvata and Narada as sons of 
kasyapa and as included among Devarsis ( Vayu 61 85 ) Tha 
Mamismrti includes Narada among the first ten P rajapatis

Chan. Up 1.8 narrates timt thoro woro (in some part of 
India not montionod ) threo persons wo]] versed in (tho esoteric 
moaning of Udgltha i. o Om ), viz. Silaka Salavatya, 
Caikitayana Bilbhya and Pravahana Jaivali. They sat down 
for a discussion on Udgltha Tho firat two (who wore brahmanas) 
first put questions to each other and answered. Then Pravahana 
Jaivali told them that they were giving replies about matters 
that wore not pormanont Then Pravahana Jaivali told them 
that Akiisa was tho origin of this world, that beings owe their 
origin to Akasa and will roturn into it, that Akasa is Udgltha, 
gronter than tho groat and without end &c. Deusson relies on 
this passage also for supporting his theory. Udglthavidya is 
only one of several Uptttanus in the TJpanisads. Therefore, 
what would follow is that Pravahana Jaivali knew it and two 
brahmanas of some place not mentioned did not know it. It 
is not possible to see how this story lends any support to 
Deusson's sweeping thesis of all brahmanas being originally 
excluded from tho control doctrine of identity. In the same 
context ( Chan. Up. I. 9. 3 ) Pravahana mentions that one 
Atidhanvan Saunaka* 561 taught Udgltha-vidya to UdaTasSndiiya.

Deassen on UdgUhavidya criticized 1583 

Deussen without giving any reason asserts ' the nameg allow of 
the conjecture that in this case also a brahmana received 
instruction from a ksatriya ' ( p. 18 ). He probably connected the 
first name with ' dhanus ' (bow) which was the forte of ksatriyas. 
But he forgets that Saunaka and Sandilya aTe both brahmana 
names. This will illustrate how even the most profound scholar 
goes astray when he becomes over-enthusiastic about a theory of 
his. In this story Pravahana does not claim that the 
Udglthavidya was unknown among brahmanas On the contrary 
he himself states that Saunaka, a brahmana (called Atidhanvan) 
expounded that Vidya to Udarasandilya, another brahmana. 
Besides, Udglthavidya is only one among numerous upasanas 
and what Pravahana teaches is that all bhvias spring from Akasa 
and are absorbed in Skasa, the purport being that JLkasa here 
denotes brahman as the V. S. (1. 1, ZZ) establishes. This doctrine 
is the same as the one taught in Tat Up. EL 6 ( basis of V. S. I. 
1 2 ) and other texts. Moreover, there is nothing about 
transmigration in this passage of Chan. Up. 

The sheet anchor of the views of Deussen and Dr. 
Bhandarkar are the dialogue between Pravahana Jaivali and 
SvBtaketu(Br.Up.VL2,Chan.Up.V.3-10) about Pancagni- 
vidya and that between Asvapati Kaikeya and Uddalaka Aruni 
about Vaisvanara ( Chan. V. 11.34 ). The latter has been already 
dealt with. In the former occurs an important passage which 
has been made much of and misunderstood. Before proceeding 
to expound the Pancagnividya to Svetakatu and his father Aruni 
Gautama, Pravahana Jaivali remarks ( Chan. Up. V. 3. 7 ) « this 
vidya did not go to brahmanas before you; therefore in all worlds 
domination (or government) has remained with the ksatriya 
class alone In the corresponding Br. Up. passage the words 
are this yidva did not reside in any brahmana before this day 
but I shall expound it to you, for, who would like to refuse when

Pitryana is expounded to iLruni ( and his son Svetaketu ) by 
Citra Gargygyani ( v. 1. Gangyayani ), but the remarks about 
ksatriyas alone being the first possessors of the doctrine do not 
occur there at all and Gargyayani appears to be a brahmana 
teacher. The question is : what is meant by ' this vidya * in the 
above passages of Chan, and Br. TTpanisads ? In the Upanisads 
{ particularly in Ohandogya and Br. ) numerous vidyas for the 
upasana of brahman by men that are not yet far advanced on 
the path of brahmavidya are dilated upon, such as Udglthavidya 
(Chan. Up. 1. 8-9, Br. Up. I. 3), Daharavidya (Chan. YHL 1. 1-2, Br. 
Up. 1. 3, Vedantasutra 1. 3. 14-31), Madhuvidya ( Chan. Ill 1. 1 ff. , 
Br. Up. II. 5. 1-15), Samvargavidya ( Chan. IV. 3 ). In the same 
way Pancagni vidya is an Upasana Deussen and others admit ( as 
shown above ) that the great and original texts about the identity 
of the individual self with the Supreme Self and about 
transmigration of the soul based on works and conduct are those 
of Yajnavalkya in the Br. Up. The Pancagnividya expatiates 
upon and is concerned mainly with only one aspect of 
transmigration viz, the path of those who living in a village 
praotise a life of sacrifices, works of public utility and alms. 
The five fires and five offerings relate only to the pitryana path. 
It contains an esoteric and semi-physical explanation of the 
process by which persons come to be born again on the earth. 
At the most it may be argued that some ksatriya rulers or noble- 
men claimed to have given an esoteric or metaphorical 
explanation of the mode of the return of pious men from the 
moon to the earth again. Nothing positive is said as to whether 
Pravahana Jaivali was the ruler of a country or only a ksatriya 
(rajanya in Br. Up. VI. 2.3, Chan. Up. V. 3.5 ) but we are told 
that Asvapati was king of the Kekaya country ifl the extreme 
northwest of India, while the original proclaimer of the immorta- 
lity of the self and its identity with the supreme self was Yajna- 
valkya who was in Videha (Mithila, modern Bihar), which wasat 
least a thousand miles away from Kekaya. Yajnavalkya's philo- 
sophy must have taken a long time before it became well known in 
the distant Kekaya. Conceding for argument that a few rulers 
like Asvapati we re the first to propound an explana tion^^

Infei ences from Asuapatis words criticized 1585 

way of the transmigration of pious sacrifices and the like, it ,w a 
far cry from that to assume as Deussen does (Ph. Up. P. W ) **"« 
the doctrine of the Atoan as the first Principle of the universe 
was fostered and progressively developed by the ksatayas m 
opposition to the principles of the hrahmanical ritual and this 
assumption is contrary to what he himself states elsewhere in 
his own work ( pp 410, 381, 34S ) 

Before proceeding further a passage from the Br, Up. I. 4. 
10 and another from the Ait. Up. (IL4-5) would have to bB 
considered In Br Up. occurs the following passage : 2M1 " In 
the beginning brahman was there, it cognised itself as ' I am 
brahma*, therefore it became all; whoever from among the 
Gods perceived this (viz. 'I am brahman'), he became that 
(brahman), the same occurred to sages and men. The sage 
Vamadeva realizing this reached the conclusion ' I was ( or 
became) Manu and the Sun also.' Therefore, this (will occur) 
even now. Whoever ( even a man ) who realizes ' I am brahman 
he becomes (identical with) all this (universe); even the gods 
are not able to prevent that man's being one with brahman and 
with all, for he is the soul of all these." Deussen translates 
' aham Manurabhavam Bfiryasca ' as ' I was once Manu, I was 
once the Sun'. There is no word for 'once' and it is supplied 
by Deussen who remarks 'as a proof of his knowledge of 
brahman, (Vamadeva) alleged his acquaintance with his former 
biitbsasManuandSurya' (p. 317). The words can very well 
be construed as meaning that Vamadeva, having realized

brahman when he sang the hymn Kg. IV. 26, expressed his 
identrty with Manu and Surya (and toe whole univSse ! 

in^hisbhasyaon Br. Up. understands the passage in thfe 
sense and does not refer to former births. It cannot be said 
that the Br. Up. quotes Ug. IV. 26. 1 for supporting the concep- 
tion of transmigrate but it relies on it merely for the eoncep- 
tion of identity of the individual soul with the Supreme Self. 

Then there is a passage in the Ait. Up. which Deussen 
lefers to (pp. 317-318 of Ph. Up.). In the 2nd adhyaya that 
Upanisad refers to the conception of a person as the first birth; 
u-t? m ,° Mld iB aotuall y born tbat is described as the 2nd 
birth. Then it proceeds "He (the son) being the self of the 
father is placed in his (the father's) stead for the performance 
or all saored works; then his other self (the father) having 
performed all he has to do and having reached the span of bis 
life (having become very old) departs (from this world) and 
departing from this world is born again, that is his third birth. 
And this has been declared by a sage 'while dwelling in 
(mother's) womb I came to know all the births of the gods; 
a hundred strongholds of ayas ( copper or iron ) held me, but I 
escaped down with speed like a hawk.' Vsmadeva lying in his 
mother's womb declared this". In this passage the father and 
son are treated as identical, as elsewhere it is so said (vide 
note below). This Hgveda verse (the 2nd half) is liable to 
Beveral interpretations In the Rgveda (I. 80. 2, VIII. 95. 3, 
IX. 68. 6, X. 11. 4&c.) it is frequently stated that (syena) 
hawk brings Soma for Indra. Syena may also be interpreted as 
standing for the soul and the iron fortresses as the bodies 
through which the transmigrating soul wanders. The Bgveda 
sage might have only meant the mythical hawk of Indra. But 
as the word 'janimani' occurs in the first half the Upaniaadio 
sage ( in Ait. Up. ) might have used the verse to support his 
ideas about the three births. But even in the Ait. Up. passage 
the three births are not clearly of one person, unless we resort 
to a myth, viz. the conception of a son and the son's birth are

Upanisads lay down inexorable law 1587 

taken as the two births of the father himself on the ground that 
the Bon is the father himself horn again. 2566 

The Upanisads laid down an inexorable law that fruitB of 
all actions, good or evil, nraat be experienced and that a person's 
deeds and conduot determined the character of his succeeding 
existences. But from some passages in the Upanisads themselves 
it appears that they recognised some exceptions One exception 
was that when a pesron realized that he was one with brahman 
the actions both good and evil, if any, done by him after that 
Realization and before the physical death of the body produced 
no results. In Chan. Up. VI. 14. 3 Satyakama 2567 Jabala tells 
his pupil Upakosala that * Just as water does not cling to a lotus 
leaf, so no evil deed clings to one who knows (realizes) brahman' ; 
Chan Up. V 24 3 'just as the (soft) cottoulike fibres of the 
tsT/la reed when cast into fire aTe burnt out, so all evil deeds of 
him who knowing (the purport of) Vaisvanara (brahma) offers 
Agnihotra are burnt'. The Br. Up. states 'Him who knows 
these two do not overwhelm, whether he says that he did evil for 
some reason or that he did a good deed for some reason; he 
overcomes both these; neither what he has done nor what he haa 
omitted to do afflict (lit heat or burn ) him '. The Mundaka Up. 
provides ' when a person has seen ( realized ) the Highest (cause) 
and lowest (effect) his actions perish.' But this is only trUB as 
regards all actB before he attained Realization and all acts that 
his body may do after his attainment of Realization but he 
cannot rescind the prarabdha ha, ma which brought about that 
existence wherein he reached Realization of b> oilman. The idea 
is that the actions which led to a person's present embodiment 
must all be consumed by the body persisting till the appointed 
period for its death, and the n only he becomes free from the

physical body. The Chan. Up. states 236 * as to a man who has 
attained true knowledge of the Supreme Self from a teacher that 
'for him there is only delay so long as he is not delivered (from 
the body), then he will become perfect*. All these TJpanisad 
passages are relied upon in V. S. IV. 1. 13-15 and Sankaraearya 
explains their purpose concisely but very clearly. The Glta also 
says ( IV. 37 ) that the fire of knowledge reduces to ashes all 
deeds. Here all means only Saficita and SaKciyamana and 
excludes prarabdha-karma. About the acts during the period 
between the attainment of Vidya and the fall of the body 
Sankaraearya gives the instance of an arrow shot from a bow, 
which stops only after the initial impetus is exhausted in the 
flight of the arrow. Some works say that when the meritorious 
deed or the sinful deed done in the present life is of the extremest 
kind it may yield results in this very life. Z569 

The Upanisad theory is that one must bear the consequences 
of all actions, good or evil. But sometimes an evil action is 
done without any previous thought , as, for example, when a 
man's gun goes off by accident and somebody is killed or 
seriously injured. This led to a discussion in Dharmasutras 
and Smrtis and the doctrine of prayascittas (expiations) for 
sins was developed. From Vedic times some rites had been 
performed to counteract mishaps and irregularities in the course 
of religious ceremonies and for portentous phenomena or 
personal misfortunes such as a dog-bite. In these the idea was

Expiations on some phenomena thai were not sins 1589 

of ceremonial purity and the averting of evil results from such 
phenomena in which no question of sin as ordinarily understood 
entered. In the Gautama Dharmasutra there is a discussion on 
this, which is probably the earliest clear exposition on expia- 
tions for sins. Gautama states that there were two views on 
the efficacy of expiations against sins. One view was that 
expiations should not he performed as regards sins, because 
a sin is not destroyed unless its consequences ate experienced ; 
the other view was that 'one should perform expiations since 
there are Vedic passages indicative of this, such as 'after 
performing the sacrifice called Punahstoma one can come 
back ( i. e become fit for) Soma sacrifice (i. e for all Vedic rites 
in general ) '; ' after performing the Yratyastoma' ( one becomes 
fit for vedic sacrifices ), 'he who offers the Asvamedha sacrifice 
crosses beyond all sin, beyond (even) 2Sm brabmana murder.' 
Some held the view that only sins committed inadvertently 
were removed by expiations; 25H while others held the view that 
expiations were effioacious even against sins committed wil- 
fully as there are Vedic indications to that effect ( Manu XL 45 ). 
Mami, however, appears to have held that a man is relieved of 
the lapses inadvertently committed by means of the study of the 
Veda, but sins wilfully committed can be removed only by 
various prescribed expiations (XI 46) and that a man must 
always resort to expiations for sins, since those who have not 
done so have to undergo a double retribution viz. the tortures of 
horrible hells for long terms of yeais and also being born in 
other human existences with bodily deformities and diseases

So far aB rebirth for sinB !b concerned attention may be 
drawn here to the following authorities : Manusmrti XII. 54-69 
Yaj. Ill 131, 135-136, 207-215, VisnudharmasQtra, chap. 44*. 
Atrismrti 4.5-14, 17-44, Markandeya-purana 15. 1-41 (B I 
ed. ), Brahmapurana 217. 37-110, Garudapurana, Pretakandai 
chap 2. 60-88 (which incorporate almost word for word Yaj. 
III. 206-215 ) and also quotations from Sankha Dharmasutra 
collected by the present author in ABORI. vol. VIII, pp. 116-117 
items 375-378 culled from the Mitaksara on Yaj. HI. 216, the 
Madanaparijata pp. 701-702, the ParSsara-MsdhavIya, vol. IJ t 
part 2 pp. 246, 259, 263, 269. For reasons of spaca it is not 
possible to set out this whole mass but a few illustrative pass- 
ages will be cited. 

Manu states (XII. 54-69, with which Yaj. III. 206-208 and 
212-215 agree in many places; 'those guilty of mortal sins 
(Mahapatakas), having gone through terrible hells during a large 
numbers of yeaTB, come after the expiration ( of hell punishment) 
to the following births. The slayer of a Brahmana passes 
through thB births of dog, pig, ass, camel, cow (or ox), goat, 
sheep, deer, a bird, a c3ndala and apukkasa, a brahmana who 
drinks the liquor called Sura enterB the bodies of worms and 
(large) insects, of moths (or locusts), of birds feeding on ordure 
and of carnivorous animals ; a brahmana ( who steals gold of a 
brahmana) shall pass a thousand times through the births of 
spiderB, snakes, lizards, aquatic animals and of destructive 
goblins ; the violator of his guru's bed passes a hundred times 
through (the form of) grasses, shrubs, creepers, carnivorous 
animals and of beastB with fangs and of those (animals) like 
tigers doing cruel acts. Those men who are given to injuring 
others become animals that eat raw flesh, those who eat forbidden 
food become worms, those that thieve become creatures consum- 
ing their own kind (such as fishes) and those who have inter- 
course with women of the lowest classes become pi etas (ghostly 
Bpirits), one who has associated with outcasts (for certain 
specified periods), he who approaches the wives of other men and 
he who has deprived a brahmana of his property (other than 
gold) becomes Brahmaraksasa (an evil demon ) ; a man who has 
on account of greed stolen gems, pearls or coral or any of the 
other kinds of precious stones is born among goldsmiths; for 
stealing grain a brahmana becomes a rat, for stealing bell-mefcal 
a man becomes a hamsa bird, for depriving another of water ho 
becomes the bird called Plava, for stealing honey a stinging 



Successive vile births for mortal sins 1591 

insect, fOT stealing milk a cow, for stealing sweet juice 

(sugar-cane &c) a dog, for stealing clarified butter an 

ichneumon, for stealing meat a vulture, for stealing fat a 

cormorant, for stealing oil a bird called Tailapaka, for stealing 

salt a cricket, for stealing curds a bird called Balaka ( crane ) ; 

for stealing silk a partridge, for stealing linen a frog; for 

stealing clotb of cotton threads Kraufica bird, for stealing 

a cow an iguana, for stealing molasses a bird called vagguda 

(a bat?), for stealing fine perfume a musk-rat, for stealing 

vegetables consisting of leaves a peacock, for stealing cooked 

food of various kinds a porcupine and for stealing uncooked 

food a hedgehog ; for stealing fire a person becomes a heron, 

for stealing household utensils a mason-wasp, f ot stealing dyed 

garments a cakora bird; for stealing a deer or an elephant 

a wolf, for stealing a horse a tiger, for stealing fruits and roots 

a monkey, fOT stealing a woman a bear, for stealing drinking 

water a cataka, for stealing vehicles a camel, for stealing cattle 

a he-goat , that man who has forcibly taken away any kind of 

property belonging to another or who eats sacrificial food of 

which no part has been offered in sacrifice certainly becomes a 

lower animal, women also who in like manner committed theft 

shall incur guilt; they become the females of those same 

creatures (enumerated above). 

It may be noted that some of the births assigned to those 
guilty of thefts of various articles have some logic or reason 
behind those regulations e. g. when Manu XII. 62 and Yaj. 3H. 
214 prescribe that a thief of grains becomes a rat in the next 
birth or when Manu XII. 61 prescribes that a thief of jewels, 
pearls and coral is born among the class of goldsmiths, one can 
easily appreciate this retribution as appropriate or reasonable, 
but the same cannot be said of all others. It is noteworthy that 
in spite of what the bhasyaonY. S. quoted in note 3335 and 
PP 1417-18 above says, a single mortal sin like brahmana-murder 
might make the perpetrator pass through several vile births, as 
stated by Manu in XII. 55-58, Yaj. IE. 307-208 and by 
SankaracTiTya. 2572 

Once the strict rule of the original doctrine of Karma in 
the Upamsads w as loosened by the theory of prayascittas, a 



1592 History of DJiarmaiiistra I See. IX, Oh. XXXV 

quick pace was set even in early times for the removal or 
reduction of the effects of sins in other ways than by means of 
expiations. Gautama 2573 prescribes fire means for redeeming 
(or expiating) blamable acts viz. inaudible recitation of the 
Veda, austerities, sacrifice in fire, fasting, giving gifts. The 
history of DharmasSstra vol. IV deals at Borne length with japa 
(pp. 44-51), tapas (pp. 43-43), homa(pp. 43-44), dana(pp 51-53) 
and fasting (pp. 52-54). Therefore, it is not necessary to say 
here anything about them. But attention must be drawn to 
some special and far-reaching modifications of these and other 
means. Sudras and members of pratdoma castes were not 
authorized to study the Veda. Hence the authors of medieval 
works, particularly of PurSnas, went so far as to Bay that 
remembrance 2Sli of the name of Kxsna ia superior to all 
expiations and all forms of austerities and that if a man only 
remembers Narayana in the morning, noon, evening, at night 
and other times, he at once secures the destruction of (the 
consequences of) Bins. Other means were also provided for the 
removal of sins, one being pilgrimage to holy places. Vide H. of 
Dh. vol. IV. pp. 55-56 and 552-580. Another was the practice 
of prSnayama which has been dealt with on p. 42 of H. Ph. vol TV. 

Even in the earliest times open confeBBion of sin was in 
certain cases regarded as freeing the person from Bin. In the 
CaturmaBya called Varuna-praghasa, the wife who took part 
with her husband had to confess expressly or by some indirect 
ways whether she had at Borne time a paramour and if she did 
so she was purified and could take part in the sacred rites there- 
after. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 575-576 and 1098 for Vtafc 
Similarly, according to -5p, Dh. S. 1. 9. 24. 15, 1. 10.28. 19 and 
1, 10. 29. 1 it was neoessary when undergoing expiations for 
forsaking one's wife or for brahmana murder to confess ones 
sin. So also the brahmaoarin, if guilty of sexual intercourse

Repentance dnd sin 1593 

bad to proclaim hi3 lapse while begging at seven houses (vide 
Gautama and Manu quoted below ). 2S7S 

Repentance ( anutapa ) Manu ( XIL 327 and 330 ) provides 
that a sinner is relieved of the consequences of sin by proclaim- 
ing hie sin to people, by repentance, by austerities, by recitation 
of Vedic texts, by gifts in case of distress ( i e. if he is unable to 
undergo tapas ) ; a man after commiting a sin becomes free from 
it by f eeling remorse and if he makes a resolve 'I shall never 
again do so ' he is purified. The Yisnupurana provides that, 
when afer committing a sin the man feels remorse, the one high 
expiation that he has then to undergo is the remembrance of 
Eari. 236 MacNicol, a Scottish Missionary, wrote a work 
(in 1915) on 'Indian theism' in which he boldly asserts, after 
referring to the Upanisadic doctrine of Karma that ' there is no 
place for repentance in the Hiudn doctrine of KaTma ' (p 323 ). 
It has been shown above that confession was known in Vedio 
times and that repentance was valued in Dharmasaatra works 
either as removing sins or as making the repentant man fit foT 
receiving expiatory rites (vide H. of Dh. vol IV. pp. 41-43). 
The worthy missionary author probably thinks his Christian 
brand of remission of sins by confession and repentance better 
than the Upanisadic teaching. Ancient Indian authors were not 
prepared to accept mere confession and repentance as enough to 
absolve a man of all sins. The Biblical position that if one 
believes in Christ and his gospel, confesses his sins and says he 
repents (as required in Matthew 4. 17, Mark I, 15 and Luke 
24. 47) ls very likely to engender among common men a 
complacent attitude about sins. This complacent frame of mind, 
the ancient DharmasSstra writers wanted to prevent and 
therefore, they insisted upon a good deal more than repentance 
and confession of sms. They blended the old doctrine of con- 
fess,™ and repentance with retribution viz hell tortures and

read the relevant texts from PurSnas or he forgot them when ho 
made the assertion noted above. 

Long before MacNicol wrote and since his days numerous 
Western scholars brought up in Christian surroundings have 
expressed their view that the ancient Indian doctrine as 
regards man's destiny after death is far more preferable to 
Biblical ideas on the same subject. It is enough to refer to only 
two or three authors. Arberry in his 'Asiatic Jones' quotes 
(p. 37) from Sir William Jones' letter to Earl Spencer the 
following passage 'I am no Hindu, but I hold the doctrine of the 
Hindus concerning a future state to be incomparably more 
rational, more pious and more likely to deter men from vice, 
than the horrid opinions inculcated by Christians on punishments 
without end '. Lowes Dickinson in ' Religion and Immortality ' 
(Dent and Sons, 1911) observes (on p. 74) ' it is really a consoling 
idea that our present capacities are determined by our previous 
actions and that our present actions again will determine our 
future character '. Owen Butter, author of ' the scales of Karma ' 
(London, 1925) says that Christianity has failed to solve the 
intellectual and moral problems which beset those who live in 
the complexities of the modern world, that he began to study 
the doctrine of Karma and reincarnation seven years before he 
wrote the book, which is a personal statement rather than an 
essay on Karma (pp. 12-13 ). Many who have written against 
this doctrine, while conceding that the Upanisadic doctrine in an 
ancient and serious attempt to solve the problem of injustice 
and evil in the world, call it a weak one and beset with 
difficulties. One should like to ask, what systems of religion and 
philosophy are not beset with difficulties? One may take the 
Christian doctrines for example. To all non-Christians ( and to 
several Christians also in modern times) its doctrine of original 
sin, its damnation of unbaptized infants, of predestination 
deduced from 'the' belief that God is an Omniscient and 
Omnipotent Creator of heaven and earth appear strange ana 
unjustified. L.T.Hobhouse in 'Morals in Evolution pan u 
( 1906 ) pp. 130 ff points out how all systems with a personal uoa, 
particularly Christianity, are beset with difficulties such .m

Prof. Toynbee on a christian dogma 1595 

Christianity is unique and that Christians are God's chosen 
people are beliefs which would make God appear quite unjust and 
therefore some Christian writers like Prof. Toynbee in 
'Christianity among the religions of the world' (Oxford Un. 
Press, 1958 } have begun to urge that Christianity must be 
purged of such beliefs (pp. 13 and 95 ). 

The strict doctrine of Karma would require that there can be 
no transfer of good or bad kanw. from one man to another and 
a man cannot suffer for the sins of others. But in the Ptgveda 
there are allusions to the belief that God might inflict punish- 
ment on the sons for the sins of their fathers. For example, in 
Bg. VII. 86. 5 Vasistha 2577 prays to Varuna - ' cast away from us 
the transgressions of our fathers, and those that we committed 
in our own person'; 'May we not have to suffer for the sin 
committed by another, may we not do that for which you punish 
(this is addressed to Visve-devah). The Santiparva, however, 
asserts ' whatever deed a man does in four ways viz. with eye, 
with thought, speech or action, he receives ( in return ) that same 
kind of action; a man does not enjoy (i e experience the results 
of) the good deeds or evil deeds of another; man attains (a 
result) in consonance with the actions done by himself'. 2578 
Similarly, in the Grdhra-gomgyu-samvada, it is asserted 'the 
son does not have to go by the path due to the actions of the 
father, nor wee imsa, they being bound by their own respective 
good or evil deeds proceed each by a different path '. Whatever 
deed a man does, whether holy or very unholy (terrible), the 
consequences of that are experienced by the doer alone, what 
have the relatives to do with that' (Santiparva 153. 38' and 
41=cr. ed 149. 34 and 37).

varnas and airamas according to Sastra and if they swerve from 

their duties he should make them follow their duties, since he 

gets a share of the dharma (merit) observed by them. Manu 

provides (VIII. 304-305,308) that the king who protects his 

subjects secures the sixth part of the (spiritual ) merit of all (his 

subjects), but if he does not guard them he also shares in the 

sixth part of their adharma ( sin ) ; the king who proteots well is 

entitled to the sixth part of the merit of the Veda study, the 

sacrifices, the gifts, and of the worship of gods done by all 

subjects ; that king who takes as his one-sixth part of the crops 

and other produots, but fails to guard the subjects is declared 

(bysageB) aB receiving all the sins of all his subjects'. Manu 

says elsewhere (in IX. 301) that the king is the Yuga, that 

his actions may bring in Krta or any of the other Tugas. 

KalidaBa in Sakuntala echoes this idea. 2550 Manu ( in VIII. 316 ) 

provides that when a thief comes to a king, confesses his guilt 

and asks the king to punish him with a heavy staff or a sharp 

weapon and the king either punishes him or lets him off, the 

thief is freed from (the effects of) the sin, but the king incurs 

the guilt of the thief if he does not punish him. To the same 

effect is Vasistha 19. 46 and 30. 41. It was stated by Manu 

(III 100) that all the merit of even a man who lives a plain 

life by subsisting on grains left in the field after the crops are 

garnered and who performs homa in the five fires (to be kept by 

an householder) is taken away by a brahmaDa guest who sfcayB 

unhonoured by him. Santiparva, Visnu Dh. S. and several 

Paranas provide that » when a guest, being disappointed (in 

getting food), turns away from the house of a person, the guest 

goes away taking all the merit of the person and transfers to 

him all his own misdeeds. This was probably not meant to be 

taken literally. It is only an arthavada (in the language of he 

Mimamsa) and merely exhorts a househo Her to honour a guest

versa !582 : ' whatever good deeds you performed in hundreds of 
existences, all that will go to that party whose defeat you will 
bring about by your false evidence.' The Mit. and Apararka 
both say that this is meant only to frighten and quote a verse 
of Narada (raadana 200) in support ' he (the judge) should 
frighten them (from telling lies) by citing ancient dharma- 
astra texts, by recounting the greatness of truth and by censur- 
ing falsehood.' Manu (YUL 90), however, makes the exhorta- 
tion ran as follows ' Whatever good deeds you performed from 
your birth, the merit of all of them would go to dogs if you will 
depose falsely'. Manu XH. 81 says 2583 'with whatever dis- 
position of mind ( either sattmka ox » ajasa or tamasa ) a man 
does an act he reaps the fruits thereof ( in a future life ) in a 
body endowed with the same character.' 

The BfcagavadgHa, apart from the fact that knowledge of 
reality destroyed the effects of all deeds, emphasized at the end 
the path of singlaminded devotion ( bhakti ) to God and surrender- 
ing all one's acts and their fruits to Him ' giving up all the 
various paths, come to me alone as your refuge ; don't grieve, I 
shall release you from the consequences of all evil deeds, if anv 

Of yours '.K34 

As regards husband and wife, the Dharmasastra works say 
a good deal but all that is said should not be taken literally 
For example Manu (V. 164-166 ) states*® ' by playing false to 
her husband (i.e. by adultery) the wife is censured in this 
world, shebecomes ( after death) a female jackal and is tormented

husband, resides in the same world (heaven^ as her huBband, 
and is called a virtuous wife. A woman restrained in thought, 
word and deed, secures by such conduct ( as is laid down for hor } 
in this life highest renown and residence with her husband in 
the next world'. For hyperbolical descriptions of the power of a 
chaste wife (pahvrata) in the great epic and Puranas, ride H. of 
Dh. vol H pp. 567-568. A verse cited there may be repeated 
here 'just as a snake-charmer forcibly draws out from a hole a 
snake, bo a chaste wife snatches away hor husband's life from 
the messengers of death and reaches heaven with her husband '. 
This is also an arlhavada but it probably reflected the popular 
ideas of those times. 

The Mahabharata has certain interesting versos on the 

transference of the effects of Jcatma to one's descendants. Tho 

5.diparva states ' if the consequences of sin are not seen affecting 

the perpetrator, they will surely be seen in the sons or grandsons*. 

This again is an ai t!tavUda. 2SBS 

It was believed that punishment by the king for a sinful 
deed (like a theft &c) liquidated tho consequences of tho sin, 
made the offender pure and enabled him to reach heaven as men 
of good deeds do. 2587 

It is difficult to reconcile the doctrine of Karma and punar- 
janma with the system of Sraddhas in which balls of vico are 
offered to the three paternal ancestors of the performer of 
srSddha This subject has been dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. , IV. 
pp 335-339. The offering of balls of rice to the spirits of «io 
departed male ancestors was in vogue in the times of the Veda 
probably and even before the Vodas and the theory of Karma 
and Punar-janma arose later and as people were not prepared to 
give up the theory of sraddhas, they kept both.

Very few i egular Sansltrit works on Karma 1599 

above (pp, 972-973) -where it has been pointed out that that 
notion is not supported by the Bhagavadglta (Yin. 5-7 ), 

Apart from the TJpanisads ( and commentaries thereon), the 
Vedantasutras(and the bhasyas thereon) and the Bhagavad- 
glta, there aTe very few regular treatises on the doctrine of 
Karma and re-incarnation. One work comparatively early in' 
date is the Yijfianadipika of Padmapada (said to be the same as 
the favourite pupil of the first SankaraoSrya) in 71 verses 
(edited with a commentary and Introduction by M. M. Dr. 
Umesha Mishra, Allahabad, 1940 ) which deal with the means of 
achieving mofcsa by realizing the identity of the individual self 
and the Supreme Self (they being like the reflection and its 
original ) and by annihilating karma. Some of the important 
verses in it have been adduced above in the notes. That work 
(verae9)«ss compares sanclyamana-kaima to grain standing 
m the field, saftofo to grain stored in one's house and pr&Tabdha- 
karma to food put m one's stomach. The food put in one's 
stomach is exhausted by its being digested which takes some 
time Therefore, Karma of the saficita and sancSyamana types 
is annihilated by correct knowledge, while prSiabdha karma 
by undergoing its results for some time. It emphasizes that it 
is ImiuQua (extreme non-attachment to objects of sense) that 
leads to the rise of correct knowledge of Reality, to the elimina- 
tion o ««„,,«, (unconsciously working impressions), to the 
annihilation of Karma and to cessation of rebirth.

A\nandasakfci(blisB). There are six kancuJcas (sheaths, covers) 
viz. Maya, Kala, Suddha-vidya, Kaga, Kala and Niyantrana. 
On p. 15 it says that when the bodily machine is broken, 
consciousness, taking hold of pranana (breathing), is carried to 
another body by the Ativahika (subtle body ). 2OT This latter 
body becomes like a vehicle between the body that lies dead and 
the next physical body. The work then quotes from a 
Kosabhasya three verses which support the theory of the antara- 
bhavadeha (the intermediate body between the dead physical 
body and the future physical body) and also relies on Jig. X. 85. 
16. 2S91 It also quotes Bhagavadglta 14. 14-15 (yada sattve 
pravrddhe tu &c ) and sayB that those bodily states are referred 
to in such Vedic passages as 'Paficare.cakre &c ' ( Bg. X. 164. 13), 
in Kathopanisad 1. 6 (sasyam-iva martyah paoyate ), in ' Vasamsi 
jlrnani' (Glta H. 22). He further Bays that by God's grace a 
man becomes pure and by diksa and other means he understands 
his real character and reaches Siva. It states that all men do 
not attain liberation, while those who hate (discard) diksa, 
temples and correct knowledge go to hell. There is very little 
discussion about the kinds of Karma and the removal of the 
effects of these. 

There is another rather modern work called Prarabdha- 
dhvanta-sambrti (destruction of the darkness i.e. ignorance 
about prurabdha) composed in iaka 1741 (1819 A, D.) at 
Paficavatt near Nasik by Acyutaraya Modaka, a learned and 
prolific writer. The only kn own ms. is in the Mysore Government 
2390. V.S IV. 3.4. is ' aUvabikas-tallwgat ' and for 'antarabhavadeha'.

Oriental Library and is in Kannada script. The present author 
got a Davanagarl transcript of the Ms. through the kindness of 
the authorities of the Library. 

Dr. H. G. ST arahari ( in H". I. A. vol. V. pp. 115-118 ) furnishes 
an account of the ms., its date and a brief description of itB 
contents. In another paper the same scholar gives a tolerably 
full analysis of its contents ([in J. G. J. B. I. vol III. for 194546, 
PP.349-3&7). 

The author Acyutaraya states that the work really means 
'Prarabdha-vada-dhvantasamhrti'( destruction of the darkness 
caused by the doctrine of pratabdha ) and that all that he wants 
is to combat the false idea that all human acts from the moment 
of conception to death are governed by past deeds alone to the 
exclusion^ of everything else. He postulates that all human 
activity is due to praiabdha, to samskaras ( snb-conscious or 
latent impressions or tendencies) and prayatna (human effort). 
He explains : the moment after the body dies, all the accumulated 
good and bad deeds set in motion by God become ready to yield 
their retribution (results) and that a good or evil deed (or both) 
that is strongest begins a suitable body. The birth is that of a 
btahmana or the rest when there is mixed good and evil as the 
strongest karma, as a lower animal when sin is strongest, as a 
godly birth when a g 00 d deed is strongest. The duration of life

(as in sleep)]. This last he subdivides into three kinds (sattvika, 
rajasa and tatuasa) that are passed over. Pain (duhkha) Is 
divisible in the same way as sukba and the author illustrates the 
different kinds of pain, that are left out here. Then the author 
dilates upon the oauBe or causes of pleasure and pain (sukha 
and duhkha) that constitute man's experience on earth, which 
causes are prarabdha (past Jcarma that has begun to operate 
and determines the body the soul secures), samskara and 
prayalna. 2193 He states that the bliss that a man feels in 
meditation ( samadhi ) is due to prGrahdha, the pleasure he 
feels in deep sleep is due to samskaras 2594 and the pleasure 
on the fall of rain after the performance of the K5rM 
(sacrifice ) is due to human effort From the IFpanisad passage* 
it follows (says Aeyutaraya) that in deep sleep there is no 
desire, no karma and no fear and so the pleasure ( expressed on 
waking in the words ' sukham-ahamasvapsam ' (I had a happy 
sleep ) is not due to prarabdha but to samskaras. He relies on 
the Br. Up. 2595 (IV. 4. 2) for holding this view (i e. he take* 
' purvaprajfia ' in that'passage as equal to -basana ( 'latent impres- 
sions or reminiscences of past experiences). The activities of 
a person in past lives may be madhya 2S95 (middling or moderate),

Madhya, manda, tivra kinds of deeds 16<$ 

•pwo vai punyenakarmanabhavatipapah pgpana (Br Up 
IE 3. 13 quoted in note 2510 above), some writers held that rt 
ia only Karma that is the cause of a new birth and that vidya 
(knowledge of all kinds) and pfirvaprajSa have nothing to do 
with it, while others relying on Br. Up. IV. 4. 3 (to «*»*"* er- 
enoe is made in the SanksepasSrlraka III. 18) held that Vidya, 
Karma and Purvaprajna have all to do with the assumption of 
a new body by the soul. Achyutaraya agrees with this latter 
view. He divides and subdivides Karma, vidya and purva- 
prajna, so that ultimately the threefold apparatus for giving a 
new body comes to 96 varieties and remarks that these divisions 
are not of much use. 3SW To the objection that all this refutation 
of prS*abdhav£da is idle and serves no purpose he replies : men 
are of three sorts, mukta (liberated), mumuksu (desirous of 
liberation) and visayin (immersed in enjoying the objects of 
sense). As regards the first the Chan. Up. VI. 14. 2 says 'for 
him there is delay so long as he if? not delivered ( from the body ), 
then he will be perfect \ 2S9S The same is relied upon in V. S. IV. 
1. 19. The idea being that until prarabdhakarma that brought 
about the body in which Realisation was attained is done away 
with by the death of the body, the self is jlvanmukta, but his 
other karma that has not begun to yield fruit is done away with 
by Realisation, To the same effect is Bhagavadglta. 

Acyutaraya quotes thirteen verses from Vartikasara about 
Vssana (purvaprajfis), Karma and Vidya (pp. 31-33). Ho

viz. tatlvajflana (knowledge of the Reality as enunciated in

The present author has read either wholly or partially the 
following modern works, mostly written by Western scholars on 
Karma and rebirth, that either offer remarks for or against that 
doctrine. The space at the author's disposal precludes any 
detailed statement about the objections raised against this 
doctrine in some of them. But a few important objections will 
be Btated and will be briefly dealt with. The works read or 
consulted ares "Philosophy of the Upanishads" by Paul 
Deussen, translated by A. S. Geden ( 1906 ) pp. 313-338 ; J. R. A S. 
for 1906 pp. 586-593 and for 1907 pp. 665-72 on modifications 
of the doctrine of Karma by E. W. Hopkins ; ' Transmigration of 
souls ' by Alfred Berthelot, translated by H. J. Ghay tor { Harper, 
London, 1909) ; ' Karma and redemption ' by A. G- Hogg ( ed, of 
1910) *, ' Religion and immortality ' by G-. Lowes Dickinson ( Dent, 
1911 ) ; ' Re-incarnation ' by E.D. Walker (Rider and Co .London, 
1913 ); this book contains extracts from Western authors (22 in 
number) on re-incarnation (pp. 63--124); there is also a long 
chapter (pp. 127-191) of extracts from Western Poetry on the 
same subject; he also dealB with evidences of the dootrine in the 
Bible and early Christendom and a Bibliography on pp. 329-343; 
•Bate and free will' by Ardesar Borabji N. Wadia (Bant 
and Sons, London 1915 ). He states the problem to be 'whether 
fate by itself influences and directs the course of human evolu- 
tion or freewill by itself or both fate and freewill working

persistence after death and transmigration" to the Spiegel Com- 
memoration Volume edited by no less a Parai scholar than Dr. 
J. J. Modi (Bombay, 1908) pp. 99-124, in which he states 
(p. 124} 'that the Hindu doctrine of the transmigration of the 
Boul influenced the faith of the ancient Zoroastrians m all ttmes. 
Indeed the struggle between Good and Evil could not end in the 
triumph of the former if but one brief life was the only time 
given for the fight.' Vide also ' Philosophy of Zoroastrianism ' 
by Faredun K. Dadachanji ( Bombay, Times of India Press, 1941) 
pp. 108-133, particularly pp. 116 ff. Mr. Sanjana seems to have 
been much upset by the fact that some Parsis, who were scholars 
of Avesta and Sanskrit, became Theosophists and admirers of 
Mrs. Besant and other famous personageB in the Theosophist 
movement. Nearly half the main book of 129 pages iB con- 
cerned with the criticisms (sometimes extremely offensive) of 
the doings and writings of Madame Blavatsky (pp. 28-42), Mrs. 
Besant (pp. 43-51 ), O. W. Leadbeater (pp. 57-59), A. P. Sinnett 
and others (like Ool. Olcott and Mr. K. A. K. Iyer, author of 
•Vedanta), W. Q Judge and a Gujarati book of an unnamed 
scholar (pp. 59-73). On pp. 83-88 he deals with MoTaggart, 
G. L. DiokiMon and W. Lutosowski (Polish writer who claims 
that he remembers his many past lives ). Mr. Sanjana returns 
(pp. 89-103) to the charge against the Theosophists and the 
storms aud eruptions in the Theosophioal society and considers 
some works on Snfism also (pp. 106-115). He emphasises the 
good points of Zoroastrianism as certified by W. B. Kenning, 
J. W. Waterhouse and Hopkins. He does not devote much 
thought to the objections, more or less insuperable, against all 
monotheistic religions with a personal God in such worira as 
Hobhouse's « Morals in Evolution ' part 2, though in the appends 
(on p. 140) he has to admit that no satisfactory answer can n 
given to the question why an omnipotent and omniscient God 
should allow Evil to exist. He contrasts Zoroaster s religion 
and philosophy with Hinduism and Buddhism and winds up 
withttticle 7 by Wintemite ^m^V^.n^n

Mr. Sanjana's language about Tlieosophsts 1607 

on p. 64 he speaks of Blavatsky, Mrs. Besant, Sinnett and 
Leadbeater as "proved charlatans " and on p. 95 he writes about 
Mts. Besant's entry into Politics as "these later metamorphoses 
of the megalomaniac Mis. Besant". It appeals to the present 
writer that his study of original Sanskrit works is not deep and 
that he commits serious mistakes in the small portion of his 
work that he devotes to the ancient Indian view of the doctrine 
of re-incarnation. His wrong interpretation of Manu VI. 63 
(p. 10 of his hook) has been pointed out (on p. 1565). Some more 
cases of mistakes may be cited here. On p 11 of his book he relies 
on Thibaut for the statement that there is nothing in the sutraB 
(the VedSnta-sutras) to warrant the main doctrine of Sankara 
about two Vidyas, the higher [pat a) and the lower (aflarU), 
which respectively lead to the higher (para) brahma and the 
lower (apara) brahma. If he had carefully read only a few of 
the eleven principal Upanisads (thelsavasya, Kena, Katha, 
Mundaka, Prasna ) he>ould have found for himself that Thibaut 
is not a trustworthy guide in all cases The Mundaka Upanisad 
(*• J- i ~ 5 ) speaks of two vidyas, para and apara ' dve vidye 
veditavye para ca, apara ca, atha para yaya tadaksaram 
adnigamyate' and this Mundaka text is treated as the basis of 
Vedantasfitra 1 2. 31-33 by Sankara and Bamanuja. The Prasna 
Upamsad 3 states both paia and apara brahma 'etadvai 
SaiyakSma param caparam ca brahma yad-omkaiah". On 
PP. <a,181, 146 he alleges that the words "yadahareva virajet 
tadaharevapravrajet" (a man should become a sannyasin the 
wry day on which he feels disgust for this worldly life) are a 
dictum or saying f Sankara. Bat this text is taken from the 
Jabalopamsad 4. The whole passage of the Jabalopanisad 4 on 
the asramas is quoted by Sankara on Vedantasutra III. 4. 30 and

^V? ( J an ' I ?' anisa < 1 - Women of the higher classes could 
not study the Veda in medieval times but women of the three 
«Jgh« olasseB oo-operated with their husbands in all religious 
rites (including Vedic sacrifices.). Therefore, the Glta first 
mentions the worst case viz. that of Candalas and affirms that 
even Candalas (who belonged to the lowest class) would attain 
the highest goal if they surrendered themselves as devotees to 
God and then adds three more classes of people viz. women, 
vaisyas and sudras. A Sudra was never among untouchables; 
on the contrary, early Smrfcis like Manu VI. 353, Yajnavalkya 
1. 166, Parasara Xt. 19 provide that a brahmana could take food 
at the house of a sudra provided the latter was born of his slave 
woman or cultivated the brahmana's fields on the rent of half 
share of crops or was the friend of his family or tended his 
cattle or was his barber. In medieval times ( after the 5th or 
6th century AD.), however, the caste system became more rigid 
but even up to the 13th century A.D. a brahmana could take food 
at a sudra's house in extreme calamity ( vide History of Dharma. 
sastra, vol. in. pp. 953-53). Thereafter this was forbidden and 
was included among KalivaTJya acts. The vaisyas are probably 
equated with women and sudras beoause in their pursuit of 
wealth they never cared to study the Veda and TTpanisadB. 
Other passages of Mr. Sanjana's work are not cited for criticism 
for reasons of space. 

Some of the objections raiBed by Western thinkerB and 
writers against the doctrine of Karma and re-incarnation will 
now be mentioned and briefly dealt with. One or two prelimin- 
ary matters have to be emphasized. Many in the West regard 
our life after the death of the bodies as certain, but hardly any- 
one of them regards our life before our present bodies as a pos- 
sibility. The explanation of this attitude of many Western 
thinkers lies in the fact that in modern Western thought the 
great support of the belief in immortality of the soul has been 
the Christian religion, which is supposed not to recognize the 
pre-existence of the soul. Besides, Christian writers from 
Augustine onwards firmly believed that religious truths outside 
the revelation in the Bible as interpreted hy them were a work 
of the devil. McTaggart in ' Some Dogmas of religion ' ( London, 
1930 ) attacks this attitude. He holds (p. 113 ) that any evidence 
which will prove immortality will also prove pre-existence and 
that there is nothing in pre-existence that is incompatible witn 
any of the dogmas that are generally accepted as fundamental 



Objections against doctrine of Karma 1609 

to Christianity.' L. P. Jacks in 'Fear the brink' (Allen and 
Dnwin, London, 1952, pp. 10-11) holds the same opinion (at the 
age of 92 ) as MoTaggart's. Wordsworth in his famous Ode 
appears to agree that the present life is preceded by another 
existence when he says ' Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting, 
the sonl that rise3 with ns, our life's star, had elsewhere its 
setting and cometh from afar * L. P. Jacks in the work men- 
tioned above remarks (on p 9) that an endless punishment is not, 
strictly speaking, a punishment at all but an exercise of cruelty 
or vengeance and that the same is true of an endless reward. 

The first objection raised against the doctrine of Karma by 

Pringle-Pattison in 'Idea of immortality ' ( Oxford, 1922) is that 

absence of memory of the pre-existence is fatal to it (p. 112) 

and that immortality without recollection is quite useless. 

Miss Lily Dongall in * Immortality ' by Canon Streeter and others 

raises a similar objection (p. 29). This objection can be 

answered in various ways Does any one remember anything 

of what one did during the first two yeaTs of his life ? It is ako 

well-known that men do not correctly remember in old age even 

the names of their grand-children nor does a man remember 

what he did exactly ten years ago during his present life. It is 

rather merciful that there is no memory of past lives. K all the 

multifarious memories of many lives were to crowd on us in the 

present life, our minds would be confused and matters in the 

present life would be very much complicated. Kama is a 

cosmic law like the law of gravitation. The latter was not 

recognized by humanity for thousands of years but all the same 

it existed and worked. Several people claim to remember their 

past lives. The story of Stntidevlwas published as a case of

S. f ™L f • aD beheve in future eter nal punishment

pre-exstence merely on the ground of absence of memory? 

IJL T ° gmaS ** P - 13 °- *»**• s0ie ™ holds thj 
matter and energy are indestructible, they are only transformed 

™«° f u%T\ I t7 Bh ° uld ° ne regard i^s absurd if one 
were to hold that the soul (to which post-existence is granted 
by Christianity and some other religions) should be held to 
come into existence in the present life all at once and notbs 
held to have had previous existence hut only in a different form ? 
The continuity of the soul in past and future existences is 
merely a metaphysical question and cannot be affected by the 
loss of memory. The latter occurs in one life of many years as 
to numerous happenings and at least in that one life the soul 
is admittedly one throughout 

Another objection is on the ground of heredity. We often 
find a strong likeness between parents and children in body and 
sometimes in mental faculties also. How are we to explain 
this ? One answer may be that by some law not yet discovered 
the soul that has to undergo rebirth is born to parents suited 
to his condition. Besides, children are not exactly like their 
parents, some resemble in several physical features the mother 
or the father, but not in all and children of the same parents 
differ among themselves even as regards physical features. As 
regards mental qualities, children do not very often resemble 
their parents. What sort of mental equipment was possessed 
by the parents of such men of geniuB as Shakespeare, Newton, 
Bamanujan, Einstein ? Karma does not express what a man 
inherits from his ancestors, but it expresses that which he 
inherits from himself in some previous state or states of 
existence. 

Another objection is often raised that belief in the doctrine 
of Karma would make men callous to human misery and 
suffering and unwilling to help. This also is a perverse idea. 
From the ancient Vedic times charity and compassion have been 
inculcated as the duties of all men without distinction. The 
Rgveda (X 117. 6 ) sage declares 'that man who cooks food for 
himself and eats it himself alone simply incurs sin* (kevalagho 
bhavatikevaladl). The Br. Up.V. %. 3 prescribes for all men 
the three duties via. self-restraint, charity and compassion. If 



Objections against dodnne of Itarlna 1611 

a man having the means to help another does not offer help he 
would be failing in hia duty. It is possible that the result of 
the sufferer's Karma might have been meant to be mitigated by 
the kindness of helpers 

Another objection is sometimes raised as follows. The 
population of the earth is growing rapidly. The question is: 
where do the additional egoes come from (vide Berthelot's work, 
English tr. p, 127 and J. E. San jana's book on the ' Dogma of 
re-incarnation ' p. 81 ). Several answers are possible. Several 
species of lower animals have become extinct and the number 
of wild animals such as the lion is rapidly being reduced. It is 
possible for one who believes in Karma doctrine to argue that the 
selves that were masquerading as beasts now appear as human 
beings, because their Karma that reduced them to the state of 
beasts has been exhausted, 

Some of the Puranas declare that a man who is very sinful 
may reach lower and lower states e. g. the Vayupurana 25M 
(ohap. 14 verses 34-37) provides that a very sinful man may 
become pasu ( cattle or a beast ), then deer, then a bird, then 
a creeping insect and then a tree or other immobile object. 
Theosophiats and some modern scholars hold that once the 
human state ia reached there is no regression at all. It may be 
noted that the Kathopanisad expressly states (inV. 6-7) that 
after the death of the body the Bonis take up birth in other 
bodies, while some become tree-trunks according to their actions 
and knowledge. The Oh Up. V. 10. 7 says 'those whose conduct 
has been evil will quickly attain an evil birth, the birth of a dog 
or hog or candala.* Manu (XII. 9 ) avers that a man is reduced 
by bodily sins to the stage of a tree-trunk, by sins due to speech 
to being a bird or a beast and by mental sins to lowest births 
(of a candala etc.). In verses 63-68 of chapter XII, Manu 
describes the different births of various animals by the com- 
mission of thefts of various articles and in verses 52-59 the births

born in low births or dying prematurely or experiencing misery 
and suffering. 

It is rather difficult to regard all this body of authority as 
mere arthavadas ( not meant to be taken seriously but intended 
only to frighten intending sinners). Dr. Radhakrisbnan (in 
' An idealist view of life' ed. of 1932 ) suggests tbat it is possible 
that rebirth in animal form is a figure of speeoh for rebirtb as 
human beings with animal or beastly qualities (page 292).

The fundamental conceptions and characteristics of Hindu 
( Bharatiya ) culture and civilization from the Vedio times to 
about 1800 A. D and future trends 

CHAPTER XXXVI 

Fundamental and leading characteristics of Hindu 
culture and civilization 

It is necessary to gather together the threads scattered over 
six thousand pages of the History of Dharmaiastra and to 
emphasize the fundamental and leading characteristics and 
conceptions of Hindu culture and civilization. 

The word Hindu ( in the form ' Hidu ' ) appears to have 

been applied by the Persian 2500 EmpeTora Darius { 532-486 B. C. ) 

and Xerxes (486-465 B G. ) to the territory and people to the 

west and to the east of the great river Sindbu, while the Greeks 

referred to the people in the same region as * Indoi *, from which 

comes the word ' Indian '. Herodotus in his History ( Loeb 

series ) states that the Thracians were the biggest nation in the 

world nest to the Indians ( Book 5 para 3, vol. in p. 5 ) and that 

the Indians constituted the 20th province of the Persian Empire 

and paid 360 talents of gold dust as tribute. The word * Bindhu ' 

occurs more than two hundred times in the Egveda alone in the 

singular as well as in the plural The words ■ Sindhavah ' and 

Bapte Smdhun* occur more frequently than Sindhu "in the 

singular. Indra is often described as having let loose the seven 

Smdhus for flowmg ( Sg. 1. 32.12, n. 12.X2, IV. 28.1, VIII. 98.1,

Many passages of tho Rgvoda whoro tho singular is employed 
rofor to tho rivor Sindhu alono(ag in £g. 1L15.6, IV 3012 
V.4.9 &o). In Kg. 1L 15.G it is said that Indra made Sindhu 
flow northwards. Tim would obviously rofor to tho firat part of 
tho rivor flowing northward from tho Himalayas. Paninl uses

in lho30 days in tho rathor long aafihalpa ( declaration ) at tho 
beginning of a roligiouB net in Mab5r3stra, occur the words 
1 Jnmbudvlpo Bbaratavnrso BnuddhSvataro Qodlvarya daksine 
tiro ' &o. Thoroforo, the proper word to bo used by us for our 
country should bo Bharatavarsa. It may bo said that our culture 
and civilization had throughout tho past ages a geographical 
background. Tho Constitution of India has recognized this in 
its very first Articlo which runs ' India, that is Bharat, shall be 
a union of Stales '. In viow of tho faot, however, that the words 
' Hindu ' and ' Indian ' havo been omployed for centuries by 
foreign as well as our own writers, this work will employ those 
words instead of ' Bharatavarsa '. 

Tho words * culture ' and ' civilization ' are used as syno- 
nyms by some writers, while some others regard them as quite 
distinguishable. Those two aro defined in various ways by 
scholars. A few definitions aro set out here by way of Bampla 

Dr. Tylor statoB ( in « Primitive Culture » voL I p. 1, Murray, 
London, 1871) 'Culture or civilization is that complex whole 
whioh includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and

of this Inscription, Jnyaswal holding (.&,<*.?. 77) that it belongs to the 
first half of the Znd century B. C, whtle N. N. Ghosh in J G J. ^* 
VI PP. 97-106 opines that it belongs to the last quarter of the first century 
B.C.

aay other capabilities and habits acquired by man as* member 
of Lc ety '. Matthew Arnold's definition of culture in toto&X 
essay on 'Cutore and Anarchy' (1869 Preface p. VIII » 
S restricted in scope. He regards culture as a 'pursmtof 
our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the 
mat L wWch concern us, the best which has been though and 
B ald in the world, and through this knowledge turning a stream 
of fresh ana free thought upon our stock notions and habits 
which we know follow staunchly but mechanically, vainly 
imagining that there is a virtue in following them staunchly 
which makes up for the mischief of following them mechanically . 
Prof P. A. Sorokin in 'Social and Cultural Dynamics' il957,p.2) 
defines'human culture as «the sum total of everything which is 
created or modified by the conscious or unconscious activity of 
two or more individuals interacting with one another or condi- 
tioning one another's behaviour. 2602 Prof. Edgerton in Journal 
of American Oriental Society in a paper on the 'Dominant ideas 
in the formation of Indian Culture ' (vol. 62 for 1942 pp. 151-156) 
understands culture as a total way of life viewed as a norm and 
as such approved or at least tolerated by a people as a whole and 
by its articulate representatives generally. 

Prof. Toynbee in 'Civilizations on trial' (1948) states 
( p. 223 ) 'I mean by a civilization the smallest unit of historical 
study at which one arrives when one tries to understand the 
history of his own country, U. S. A., say, or U.K. ' Prof. Toynbee 
in his latest work ' Beconsiderations ' ( vol, XH pp. 76-77, of his 
Study of History) adopts Bagbey's definition of culture as 
meaning ' regularities in the behaviour, internal and external, 

2(302 Prof Sorokm {ibid pp 24-25) distinguishes two types of 
integrated cultures, one called ideational and the other sensate, None of 
the two has, according to him, existed in the purest form. In some cultures 
the first type prevails, in others the 2nd; while in still others both 
might mingle in equal proportions and on equal basis. This last he terms 
• idealistic type * (which is not to be confused with the ideational type), 
Dr G S. Ghmye's ' Culture and Society ' { University of Bombay Publi- 
cations, 1947) is a very useful book on culture and civilization and con- 
siders at length the \ie«s of eminent writers like Emerson, Arnold, Morley, 
Whitehead, Russell, Laslsi, Wells and others. Prof. Northrop in ■ Meeting of

are clearly hereditary in origin ' and addB that ' religious 
practicos and institutions and, by implication, also religious 
beliefs and exporionees bto certainly a part of culture as thUB 
dofined ' and mentions religion together with art, technology, 
social structuro as examples of the elements of which culture 
consists ( pp. 84, 95 ). Prof. Toynbee further says that in his 
volumes ho employed the word * culture ' in two different senses, 
viz. ( 1 ) tho comprehensive one in which it is used by Bagby 
and ( 3 ) in an exclusive senso in which the word has been 
current in contemporary English since tho time of Matthew 
Arnold ( tbtdu p. 272 ). As regards the word ' civilization ' he 
remarks ( p. 273 ) that civilization is a hybrid word of modern 
French coinago and Johnson refused to include it in his 
dictionary. 

Archibald Robertson ( in ' Rationalism in theory and 
practico', London, 1954 p. 62) says "when we use the word 
' civilization ', wo mean a society with onough command over 
nature to raise it above savagery or barbarism. Civilization prima- 
rily moans * civitas * city life, division of labour and consequent 
surplus production over and above mero animal needs.' Vide 
Prof. S. Levi's book ' L ' Jnde et le Monde ' p 63 translated in If 
ICraemor's * World cultures and world religions ' ( London 1960 ) 
p. 345 whero it is really a definition of Hindu civilization alone. 

It is unnecessary to cite further definitions. We may accept 
any one of those for a working hypothesis. If a distinction is 
to be made between the two words, one may say that the word 
' culture ', bomg neutral in meaning, is the bettor one to use 
than the word ' civilization '. The latter word is often employed 
for an advanced stage of social development and is contrast* 
with the stage of primitive or barbarian societies. People often 
speak of primitive culture, but rarely, if at all, of primitive 
civilization.

Toynbee on Indian culture criticised 1617 

not a militarist ) in Ms ' Study of History ' appears to arrive at 
conclusions not unlike those of Spengler, viz culture and societies 
have stages of childhood, maturity, senility and disintegration. 
On p. 758 of Volume IS of his ' Study of History ' he gives a 
table for nineteen civilizations with the dates of their Epiphany 
( manifestation }, of their breakdown and the span of growth 
phase in number of years. He puts down Indie civilization as 
starting in 1375 B C. and as breaking down in 725 B. C. and 
Hindu civilization as beginning in 775 A D. and its breakdown 
in 1175 A. D. This is, to say the least, most objectionable 2m The 
distinction between Indie and Hindu civilization is arbitrary 
and the dates also are so. Why the Hindu civilization is held by 
him as breaking down in 1175 A. D. is quite unconvincing and 
what was the nature or name of India's civilization between 725 
B. C. and 775 A D. is not stated by him. On the other hand, 
the whole metaphor of being born, growing, maturing and 
disintegrating is held inapplicable to civilizations by other 
distinguished writers, such as J. G. De Beus in the ' Future of 
the West' ( London, 1953 ), who remarks that civilizations are 
not born and they do not die ( p 60 ), but are transformed or 
absorbed. Prof. Sorokin asserts (in 'Social and Cultural Dynamics') 
that his theory has little in common with the age-old theories of 
the life cycle of culture and sooieties with stages of childhood, 
maturity, senility and decay (p. 627). Leonard Woolf in 
' Quack, quack ' mercilessly criticizes Spengler's theories ( pp 
139-160). A.L. Kroeber in 'Style and Civilizations' (New 
York 1957) agrees with Prof. Sorokin and disagrees with 
fcpengler and Toynbee and remarks that s the study of eivili. 
zatioracan hardly become truly soientihe or scholarly until it 
diyests itself of emotional concern about crisis, decay, collapse 
extinction and doom '( p. 160 ). ^ '

Greeks, Scythians, Huns, Turks and notwithstanding internal 
conflicts and convulsions, 2 ' 01 India absorbed such people and 
made many Greeks, Sakasand other foreigners adopt the spiritual 
ideologies of India and found for them a place in the Indian 
social fabric ( as has been and will be shown later ). Not only so, 
India could sproad it3 literature, relfgion, art and culture, not by 
invasions or annexations but mostly by peaceful means, viz- 
teaching, translations of Sanskiit works and persuasion, to 
Ceylon, Burma, Sumatra, Malaya, Java, Bali, Borneo, China, 
Tibet, Japan, Mongolia and Corea. 25,s The charming island 
of Bali is still Hindu with four varnas, priests being called 
Pedanda (Pandita ), consecrated water for worship being called 
Tom ( vide S. Levi's ' Sanskrit texts from Bah' Preface p. XIE 
G. O. S. ), priests still ropeating one quarter of Gayatrl, viz. 
'bhargo devasya dblmahi ' (ibid. p. XV) and repeating the 
yajuopavlta mantra (yajnopavJtam paramam etc. ) in a corrupt 
form. 

This persistence of Indian culture and civilization for 
several millennia requires an explanation and a consideration 
of the fundamental conceptions, values and characteristics 
of that civilization would enable us to offer a satisfactory one- 
Indian culture and civilization have a distinct personality and 
should not and could not be judged by pm-ely European 
standards.

Conceit of nations about their Mission 1<>19 

Various peoples during past centuries had the conceit that 
they were far superior to others and had a mission to propagate. 
When the British empire became so extensive that the ' Sun 
never set on it', many British imperialists claimed ( most hypo- 
critically ) that they were carrying on the ' white man's 
burden ' 260s *■ for the benefit and betterment of undeveloped and 
backward people ( when British Imperialism was impoverishing 
to the utmost the people whom they governed by their colonial 
policies as will be briefly indicated later on so far as India is 
concerned ). Hussia claims that it has the mission to liberate 
the proletariat from capitalism and to bring about a Paradise on 
Earth. The Germans under Hitler believed that they belonged 
to the superior Nordic race and that they would save the world 
from communism, Such a conceit is not confined to the West. 
The Chinese believed that they alone were civilized. The 
Japanese hold that their Emperor is the son of Heaven. In 
these days some Indians also claim that spirituality existed 
nowhere except in India. It ig quite correct to say that ancient 
Indian culture and civilization were based on great spiritual 
values. It would be entirely in the wrong to say that other 
people had no spirituality. All that we can at most say is that 
spirituality is more basic to Hinduism and was more diffused 
among Hindu people than anywhere else. The Manusmrti 
provides that only those usages of varnas and mixed castes that 
are traditionally prevalent in the country of Brahmavarfca, in 
Kuniksetra in the countries ofMatsya, Panoala (the country 
called Doab) and Surasena (round about Mathura) are snotom 
of as samara (H. 17-19) and that all men on the ear h shtld

might of) Indra, making the waters to fall (from the Bky), 
destroy hostile men coming to Indra, making all ( the whole 
environment ) noble they reach their proper sphere. ' There is 
here no reference whatever to Vedic people making the whole 
world Arya. At the moat these verses may be interpreted as 
suggesting that Soma sacrifices to Indra would make the world 
Arya. Then there is no message in it which modern Indians 
can give and spread. Soma plant itself became unavailable in 
Yedic times and substitutes had to be utilized. And hardly any 
solemn Vedic sacrifices have been performed for centuries in 
India and very rarely, if at all, Soma sacrifices. 

During the last four or five hundred years the Western 
nations professing Christianity started on a career of conquest, 
exploitation of undeveloped countries and peoples, colonial 
empires, use of the discoveries of science for competitive pur- 
poses, the amassing of wealth with such ideologies as those 
expressed in the words * everybody should be for himself and the 
devil take the hind-most. ' But the devastation and atrocities of 
the last two world wars and the possibility of the annihilation 
of the human race or a very large part of it by atomic warfare 
have now opened the eyes of many thoughtful leaders and people 
in the West that, if modern civilization is to be saved, Hhey 
must cultivate regard for spiritual values, love of righteousness 
and justice, sympathy with the oppressed, and active belief in 
the brotherhood of man. Though our ancient sages and lawgi- 
vers laid great emphasis on spiritul values, a very large 
majority of our people and so-called leaders have been wanting 
in the practice of those values For centuries. Instead of merely 
praising our past glories, the present author would humbly 
request all educated Indians to be introspective and to ponder 
over certain questions that are often asked and seek to find the 
reasons for the loss of our freedom from the 13th century 
onwards. (1) Why Hindus were generally found inferior to 
the invaders, Persian, Greek, Scythian, Turk, English, even 
though Indians far outnumbered and even though most invaders 
were impressed by the courage and perfect indifference to death 
g^jrto f India's soldiers; ( 3 ) Why Hindus could no ttom

a permanent organized State comprising the whole of India f or 
many centrales; (3) why did they fail to take advantage of 
the splendid natural resources of India to excel in manufactures, 
commerce and industry. We must enter upon a thoroughgoing 
and honest inquiry into our past to find our own defects 
( political and others ) that led to our fall for centuries and try 
to remove those defects as quickly as possible, now that Bharata 
has won independence after centuries. There was no political 
unity of the whole of India till the British began to rule over 
the whole of India. There were constant wars among Hindu 
kingdoms and princes. For example, because the Marathas 
invaded Bengal, the Bengalis hated Marathas and were jubilant 
over the defeat of the Marathas by the British. We Indians 
hardly had any deep-seated feeling of all Indians being one 
people or of nationalism till the 2nd half of the 19th century 
A D. This chapter cannot discuss at length the subject of the 
causes of the downfall of India, politically and in otheT respects. 
But a few remarks would not be altogether out of place here. 

Hinduism is a combination of many systems and religious 
ideologies including Vedic ritualism, Vedantic thought 
Vaisnavism.Saivism, Shaktism and primeval cults, adapted to 
the requirements of different types of men and communities with 
great disparities of intellectual and spiritual attainments There 
were only a few matters that would be said to have bound most 
of the Hindus to each other, viz the doctrine of Karma and 
Punarjanma, the unifying influence of the vast and venerated 
Sanskrit literature that gradually enriched the regional langu- 
ages the veneration in which the Vedas were held by all 
Hindus as the final authority in religious matters, though only 
a small minority could learn and understand them, the |eogra- 
phical unity of the country from the Himalaya to Cape Comorin

and downfall was the great disparity between the high meta- 
physical teaching of the whole world being one and the treatment 
meted out to lower classes and untouchables, owing to ideas of 
exclusiveness, of purity and pollution by touch &c. The 
eduoation of the'masses was greatly neglected 2607 and the higher 
classes did not seriously mind who ruled the country as long as 
their life was not much disturbed. The great patriot and revolu- 
tionary Savarkar, hammered on seven fetters by which Hindu 
society was bound for centuries, viz. untouchability, prohibitions 
of several kinds viz sea travel, of mutual dining among the 
hundreds of castes and subcastes, of intercaste marriages, of 
Veda study against several castes, prohibition against following 
certain occupations and prohibition against re-admission to 
Hinduism of people that were converted to other religious faiths 
by force, fraud or ignorance. 

Our cultural history shows some central features which may 

be mentioned in one place here. The first is that there has been 

an unbroken religious tradition from the Vedic times almost to 

the present day. Vedic mantras are still employed throughout 

the whole of India in religious rites and ceremonies by all 

brahmanaB and by a large number of the members of castes 

claiming to he Esatriyas and Vaisyas. The Vedic gooB btb not 

entirely forgotten. Kindling of Agni is still required at the 

beginning of all rites, Visnu ( though not so frequently praised 

as Indra, Agni 01 Varuna, yet often enough, is praised in $g 1.22 

16-21, 1. 154. 1-6, 1. 155. 1-6, VI. 69 1-8, both Indra and Visnu 

are praised in Rg. VII. 99. 1-7, Atharvaveda VII. 27.4-9) and 

Siva ( Rudra of the Bgveda, transformed a great deal yet Jiig&iy 

praised inRg.II 1.6, II 33,9, X. 92.9 where he is spoken of as Sjva) 

are even now the principal deities worshipped In the morning and 

evening Sandhya worship, brahmanas in many parts of India 

still repeat respectively verses addressed to Mitra ( Pg Oi. » ) 

and Varuna (Be 1.25 ). The second feature » «»*. *»J»

It makes one sad to find that not a single Hindu scholar 
resembling Alberuni came forward to inquire into the causes of 
the successful invasions of India by Mahmud of Gaani and later 
hordes Intellectuals were mostly engaged at least from the 
11th century onwards in composing works of thousands of pages on 
such topics as Vrata, Dana, Sraddha ( as the very learned minister 
HemSdri did) or in mental gymnastics about logic, Vedanta, 
Poetics and similar subjects and appear to have bestowed little 
thought on finding means of meeting the onslaught of foreigners 
or the remedies for removing their own weaknesses and defects- 
There were also other oauaes of the downfall of Hindus. Our 
intellectuals did not or could not pursue and make their own 
discoveries of science and technology made in the world from 
the 15th century A. D. Shahaji purchased firearms from 
foreigners. Neither he, nor his great son Shivaji, the founder of 
the Maratha empire, started factories for the manufacture of 
up-to-date firearms and cannon. Similarly, our people did not 
properly appreciate the role of a powerful navy. If the Hindus 
or their rulers had possessed a powerful navy they would have 
been able to nip in the bud the ambitions of the Portuguese, 
the French and the English. 

We must now set out the important characteristics of Hindu 
culture and civilization. 

1. The most striking conception even as early as the 
Bgveda is that there is only one Reality or Essence, in spite of 
the fact that people speak of it or worship it as Indra, Mitra, 
Vattina, Agni &c(Egl 164 46, VHI. 58. 1, X. 129. 2, q. above 
on p. 14S? ). In the Mahabharata, Puranas, in classical Sanskrit 
Poetry and even in medieval times, when there were various 
cults and schisms, such as the worship of Visnn or Siva or Sakti, 
almost all Hindus had an inner consciousness that God is one 
though called by various names; vide p 118 note 306, p 973 and 
noto 1593 above, and Harivamsa ( Vinnuparva 25. 31 ), Kumara- 
eambbava VII. 44. 



1624 Histai y of Dharma&asti a [ Sec. X, Oh. XXXVI 

2. From this conception arose the great toleranoe that 
Hinduism at all times showed to freedom of thought and 
worship, which has been dwelt upon by the present author in H. 
of Db. Vol. II p. 388 note 938, Vol. V. pp. 970-71, 1011-1018 
(references to Anoka's edicts and Yaj. I. 343 and numerous 
instances of Indian kings and donors of one persuasion making 
gifts to temples and institutions of other cults and persuasions ); 
vide also Glt5 7. 21-32 and 9 33. To hunt down heretics, real or 
supposed, has been a favourite business of some religions 2605 for 
centuries. This has been absent from Hinduism. Hindusim is 
not bound by any fixed creed nor does it rely on a single 
book 2608 or a prophet as its founder. All that it requires is that 
man shoud be God-fearing and what matters is not correct 
beliefs but moral conduct and social behaviour, Hindus do 
not deny the truth of any religion or reject the validity of 
another man's religiouB experience. A verse 2609 quoted below 
breathes a broad-minded approach to religious beliefs and 
worship ' May Hari, the Lord of the three worlds, bestow on you 
the desired reward, whom the Saivas worship as Siva, Vedantins 
as biahman, the Bauddhas as Buddha, the NaiySykas proficient 
in the means of knowledge as the Creator, those devoted to Jain 
teachings as Arhat and Mlmamaakas as Yajfia \ The great 
logician TJdayaua who composed his Laksanavali in iala 906 
( 984 A. D. ) breathes in his NySyakusumafijali the Bame spirit 
as is contained in the verse translated above Tolerance u thus 
of the essence of Hinduism and even an atheist is often met 
with amusement and not with persecution. 

HI Working on the doctrine that there is only one 
Essence or Godhead, the sages of the Upanisads arrived at the 



2608 For B.bhcal intolerance one may read Jerennab 29.8-9. Colossana 

II. 8, Galatians I 7-9 „ „

conclusion that the individual S6lf is non-different from the 
one Essence, that all manifoldness is only apparent, that 
even fishermen, slaves, gamblers and the inanimate world 
ate non-different from it This Vedanta doctrine is one of 
the most characteristic features of Hinduism and is India's 
great contribution to the spiritual development of man, though 
there are sporadic instances of this doctrine having been 
held by some ancient philosophers in other lands This idea 
of one in the many and many in one is the very core or centre 
of Vedanta. This has been dealt with above ( vide pp. 1499-1500 
notes 2451-52 and pp. 1509-10 ). In Europe the study of philo- 
sophy is an end in itself. In ancient India this idea of the 
unity in diversity was made the basis of education and 
sociology and it was held that the realization of this unity in 
one's life was the highegt freedom { moksa). 

The Upanisadic teaching is a universal doctrine in which all 
men of good will can meet and combine, in whatever religion 
they might have been brought up from their childhood. Many 
illustrations are adduced in the Upanisads to bring home 
non-difference to the inquirer about the Essence. But two are 
very apt. The Mundaka Upanisad ( IE. 2. 8 ) declares " just as 
rivers flowing (towards the ocean ) become merged in the ocean 
after giving up their names and forms, so the man who realizes 
(knows ), being free from name and form, attains the divine 
Person that is higher than the highest ". The Prasnopanisad has 
(Vi,5J the same illustration in prose. The Kathopanisad IV 15 
states' just as pure water poured into pure water assumes 'the 
same form ( appearance ), similarly the soul of the sage who has 
realized ( the Essence ) becomes the iLtman ( Self )/ Deussen in 
his address on 20th February 1893 before the Asiatic Society of 
Bombay (in J. B B. R. A. S. No. 18 for 1893 Art 20 pp. 330-34?

IV. From very ancient Vedie times one of the fundamental 
conceptions of our Indian culture has been the idea of three 
spiritual and religious debts owed by a person to the sages, gods 
and pxtrs, which he paid off by the study of the ancient lore, by 
sacrifices, and by having a son or sons respectively This 
subject has been dealt with at length in the H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 
270, 425, 560-61, 676, Vol. Ill p. 416 and above, p. 1318 note 2168. 
To these three debts the Mahabharata added a fourth viz. the debt 
owed to all men -paid off by goodness ( vide H. of Dh. Vol. HI p. 416 
n. 675 ). Sahara on Jaimini VI. 2.31 explains that thiB doctrine 
is not confined to brahruanas hut to all members of the three 
classes, the word ' brahmana ' used in the Tai S. and other 
Vedic texts being only illustrative 

V. Another set of values is contained in the conception of 
purusarthas ( ends or goals of human endeavour ) viz Dharma 
( right conduct ), Artha ( economics, politics and civics ), Xama 
( life of sex, of pleasures and aesthetics ), Moksa ( salvation, 
release or recovery by the self of its real nature and freedom 
from the bondage of low desires and aims ). Moksa is said to be 
the highest goal ( paramapurusartha ) and the first three are 
spoken of as « trivarga '. The concept of Dharma is a far-reaching 
one and has been emphasized from very ancient times and 
refers to the principles which men have to observe in their lives 
and in social relations. This subject of purusarthas ana ot 
dharma has been dealt with at some length in H of Dh. vol. u 
pp. 2-11 and Vol. HI pp 8-10 and 239-241 Therefore .only a 
few matters would be briefly emphasized here It has been 
shown above on pp. 1-21 how the Egveda had three , words v* 
rta (cosmic order), vrata (laws or ordinances deemed to ■* etoW 
down by a god or gods) and dharma (religious rites or sa enfice 
or fixed principles), how gradually rta *^^*£% 
ground and ■ satya ' took its place and Dharma became an 
Spacing conception and vrata came to be restricted to 
forTd vows and ruJof conduct. When a ^£*£*

jffdble prayers and virtues emphasized in Ztpanisads 162? 

unto life eternal '. The same Upaniaad in V. 2. 3 inculcates on 
all man the three cardinal virtues of self-restraint ( dama ), 
charity ( dana ) and compassion ( daya ). The Ghan. Up. V. 10 
quotes a verse ' the thief stealing gold, the drinker of liquor, one 
who dishonours his guru's bed and the murderer of a brahmana — 
these four fall ( into hell ) and the fifth is one who associates 
with them.' It would be noticed that this ancient verse contains 
some of the ten commandments of the Bible. In spite of these 
( noble ) Upanisadic teachings of Dharma and morality, Prof . Keith 
( in ' Heligion and Philosophy of the Yeda and Upanisads ', Yol. 
H. p. 584, ed. of 1925 ) makes the pontifical but perverse pro- 
nouncement that ' the ethical content of the Upanisads is 
negligible and valueless '. It is not necessary to combat here 
his views. Most scholars would rather follow Schopenhauer 
( quoted in S.B.E. Vol Ip.LXI) and Deussen ( quoted above 
in Vol n, p. 424 ) rather than Keith. The concept of Dharma 
began to occupy the highest position in the times of the 
Upanisads. The Br. Up 1. 4.14 states 'there is nothing higher 
than Dharma.' The Tai. 2 « Aranyaka avers 'Dharma is the 
support ( or prop ) of the whole world '. The Mahabharata and 
Manu repeatedly refer to the high value of Dharma. The 
Mahabharata claims that everything Concerning the four 
purusarthas is contained in it and that what is not contained 
in it about them would be found in no other work In 
Udyogaparva it is stated 'Dharma is so called because of 
its character as the sustainer of all beings.' Vanaparva and 
Manu both declare < DhaTma when violated kills the violator 
when preserved it preserves man, therefore, Dharma should not 
be violated lest Dharma might destroy us." Vyasa winds up the 
Mahabharata with the solemn appeal 'with arms up-raised I 
here raise a loud cry, but no one listens to me , from Dharma

sake of life itself. Dharma is eternal, pleasure and pain are 
impermanent, the individual self is eternal, but the conditions 
( under which self worka ) are impermanent.' The Mahabharata 
passages quoted in n. 18 p. 8 of H. of Dh. Vol. II say * the three 
( Dharma, Artha, Kama ) are meant for all men, that Dharma is 
the best of the three, that Artha is middling and Kama is the 
lowest and that if there be conflict then Dharma must be followed 
and the other two abandoned.' ThiB shows that Artha and 
Kama were made subservient to Dharma ( the ethical code ) and 
all three were subservient to the spiritual goal. Our Sastras do 
Hot at all prescribe asceticism for all, but they recognized a scale 
of values. The Manusmrti ( IV". 3 and 15 ) provides ' one should 
accumulate wealth for securing only his needs by actions proper 
for his station ( varna &c ) and without harm to Mb body. Ona 
should not desire to acquire wealth by excessive attachment nor 
by actions condemned by Sastra nor when he has already enough 
wealth nor from any kind of person ( a sinner or like ). even 
when he is in straightened circumstances.' 5.p. Dh. S. ( II. 8. 20 
22-23) declares that man should enjoy all such pleasures 
as are not against Dharma; by doing so he secures both 
worlds ( this life and life in the next world ). Gautama 
Dharmasutra 2611 IX. 46-47 and Ysj. 1. 115 practically say the 
same thing. In the Bhagavadglta ( VII. 11 ) Krsna identifies 
himself with Kama that is not in conflict with Dharma. 
The Atthasastra of Kautilya no doubt says ( I. 7 ) that « Artha is 
the chief among the three purusarthas', but he also provides that 
one should enjoy a life of pleasures in such a way as not to 
conflict with Dharma and Artha, that one should not lead a lift 
devoid of pleasures altogether. The AnusSsanaparva ( chap. 
III. 18-19 ) states that Dharma, Artha and Kama are the una 
prizes ( fruits } of human life, these three should be "£?»*£ 
but in such a way as not to cofhet with Dhar ma . The 
Manusmrti (V.56) declares that eati ng flesh JtataJ 
intoxicants and sexual intercourse are not sinful in themselves, 
SSS are naturally inclined to these, but abstention ( from 
SeseSs to great rewards (and ^^'^l 
abstention ) '. The Eamayana ( Aranyakanda 9.30 ) contains

Meaning of the words ' sanatana-dharma 1629 

When reforms ate suggested in these days, conservative 
people put forward the plea that ours is ' sanatana- dharma ' M12 
nd so no changes should be introduced. But the words ' sanatana 
dharma * do not mean that Dharma always stands still or is 
immutable; all that those words mean is that our culture is very 
ancient and has a long tradition behind it but they do not mean 
ihat Dharma permits no change. As a matter of fact funda- 
mental changes in conceptions, beliefs and practices have been 
made from ancient time3 to the medieval times by means of 
various devices. Attention may be drawn to a few Veda was 
all in all in very ancient times but in the Upanisads this was 
changed, the Mundaka I. 1. 5 designating the four Vedas as 
inferior knowledge (apara vidya) and the knowledge of the 
immutable brahman as the higher vidya; in the Chan. Up. VH 1.4, 
the four Vedas and several other branches of knowledge are called 
by SanatkumaTa (whom Narada approached for instruction) 
mere name ( riama ). Yajfias were the most important religious 
practice In the early Vedic period, but the Mundaka Up. 1. 2. ? 
designates them as leaky boats and regards those who hold them 
as the best thing to be fools. Vide above pp. 1265-72 about 
changes in the views on anuloma marriages, on the topic of 
whose food may be partaken even by a brahmana, the abrogation 
of many Vedic practices by the dootrine of Kalivarjya ( matters 
forbidden in Kali age) &c. Manu, Yaj , 'Visnudharmasutra, 
Vismi and other pux&naa expressly provide that one should not 
observe but give up what was once Dharma, if it has come to be 
hateful to the people and if it would end in unhappiness (vide 
£ 1270 n. 2071 above ). The Santiparva** expressly states that 
what was adharma (m one age) may become dharma in another

and that dharma and adhanna are both subject to the limitations 
of country and time. Kama also was not neglected, as the K5ma- 
sutra ( particularly its chapter on ' nSgaraka-vrtta ' 1. 4 ) will 
show. The extensive Hatyasastra of Bharata { containing about 
5000 verses) is a witness to the aesthetic enjoyment of dance, 
music and drama in ancient India by thousands of ordinary 
men and women. 

Hindu thought on the three goals of human life oame to 
this ' do your duty, do not fall into temptations, perform duties 
for their own sake ( Glta II. 47, III. 19 ), do unto others as you 
would be done by ( Glta VI. 33, Anusssanaparva 113. 8-9, Sanfci 
359. 30. - Or. ed 251. 19 ), earn wealth but without oonflict wift 
dharma and without injury to others and lead a chaste sexual 
life and enjoy aesthetic pleasures. These summarise the 
teachings underlying the conceptions of the three purusnrthas. 
There was hardly any real pessimism 2 " 4 in the prinoipal 
Dharmasastra works except perhaps here and therein the 
Mahabharata. They consider life to be worth living, provided 
all actions are informed by the dictates of Dharma Manu (XH. 
88-89 ) provides that Karma ( conduct or actions ) prescribed by 
the Veda is of two kinds, viz. pravrtla and mvrtta, the former 
leading to happiness in this world and to svmga, and the latter 
tonihsreyasa(moksa) and requiring complete absence of all 
hankerings preceded by realization of brahma. The AnusSsana- 
parvaCchap 1*6. 76-80 ) divides Dharma into pravrtti afcsana 
(characterized by persistent activity) and nivrttilaksana 
(oharaoterisedby abstention from worldly actfrities'aud desires], 
Uich latter is to be followed for moksa and lays down ^ certain 
tactical and salutary rules viz. one should constantly make 
gifts according to one's ability, constantly offer sacrifices i and 
perform rites to secure one's prosperity. One should col W 
WM following what is right and such wealth ^^ 
oUy should be divided into three parts; one should secure MJ 

for the king. The same parvan (Anusasan^chapOWj^ 



Provision* fot all or dinmy men 1631 

and 31-39 ) dwells at length upon those actions that lead men to 
heaven { the phrase ' te narah svarga-gaminah ' is repeated in 
each verse). These provisions are meant for all ordinary 
people. The RamSyana 261s quotes a popular verse that man is 
not condemned to never-ending misery but joy comes to a man 
even after a hundred years if he he alive. 

The 4th Purusartha Moksa can be obtained only by a few. 
It is not a bow which every man or any man can make strung. 
It was a very difficult path like a razor's edge (Katha Up III 14), 
far more difficult than the path of devotion to a Personal God 
( Bbagavadglta XII. 5 ) The Upanisadic doctrine of liberation 
comes to this that man's nature is really divine, that it is 
possible for a human being to know and become actually identi- 
fied with the Godhead, that this should be the ultimate goal of 
man's life, that this can be achieved by one's own efforts, but the 
way to achieve this goal is most difficult and requires the 
aspirant to give up egotism, selfishness and worldly attachments. 
Besides, there is another difficulty. The conceptions about 
moksa differ in the different schools of thought like NySya 
Sankbya, Vedanta. Even in the Vedanta the conception about 
Moksa on the part of the different Scaryas differs. Some declared 
that there were four stages in Mukti viz. Salokpa (place in 
Lord s world ), Samiptja ( prositmty ), Sarupya ( attaining same 
form as God) and BOmjya { absorption ). *»» These matters 
cannot be gone into here.

1632 History of Dharma&astm [ Sec. X,Ch. XXXVI 

i 

Dharma ia divided into different classes from different 

standpoints. One classification is into irauta ( based on the 

Vedas ) and Smai ta ( based on Smrtis ). There was another and a 

more comprebensive classification of Dharma into six classes 

viz. varnadharma ( duties and Tights of varnas ), asramadharma 

(rules about the asramas), varnairamadharma (rules enjoined 

because the person belongs to a certain class and was also in a 

certain asrama ( e. g. the rule tbat a brahmana brahmacarl 

should carry a staff of palaia tree ), gunadharma ( rules for one 

who holds or occupies a certain position, as in the case of a 

king ), naimittikadharma ( rules that bave to be observed only 

on certain occasions such as bath on an eclipse, expiation for a 

lapse and lastly Bamanyadharma ( duties common to all ( suoh 

as those described in pp. 10-11 of the H. of Dh. Vol. II). This 

leads on to tbe next important characteristic of Hindu culture 

and society, viz. varnas and castes. 

VI. Varna and caste. Tbe subject of the origin of 
varna classification, tbe caste system and the duties, privi- 
leges and disabilities of the four varnas have been dealt 
with at length in the History of Dharaasastra Vol. H. pp. 
19-164. It has been shown that the word 'varna' (colour) 
has been applied to Jryas and dasas in the Bgveda, that these 
two ( aryas and dasas ) were opposite camps, that brahmanas 
and ksatriyas are mentioned in the Rgveda, but the word 
varna has not been expressly connected with them. The 
words Vaisya and Sudra do not ocour in the Rgveda except in 
the PurusasQkta ( Rg X 90. 12 ) but even in that hymn the 
word ' varna ' is not employed with reference to them. That 
hymn is held to be comparatively a late one by most modern 
scholars. It may be conceded that at the time whence 
Purusasukta was composed tbe community was divided into 
four groups viz brahmanas (thinkers, learned men, priests J 
ksatriyas (rulers and warriors), vaisyas ( co ™ mon ..f/2 
following agriculture and crafts) and sudras ( those that did 
menTal work ). Such a division of people into four groups is v* 
unnatural and is found in many countries ^en now 
England there are aristocratic families, there as the M«ddto 
class and the workers in factories &c They arc , nol > nece -£* 
based on birth alone, though largely so based. It , ha M»

No evidence of pi ohtbitwn of mcunage among fom varnas 1633 

and prohibits a person of the tbree upper classes from marrying 
a sudra woman. There is no evidence to show that intermarriage 
or interdining among the four varnas was prohibited in the 
Vedio age. In the Vaj. S 30. 6-13, Kathaka S. XVII 13, Tai. 
Br, III 4 2-3 numerous artisans and craftsmen such as taksan, 
rathakara, kulala, karmara, nisada, suta and others are 
mentioned hut it is extremely doubtful whether they had become 
petrified castes at the period of these works Rathakara and 
karm&Ta and suta are mentioned in Atbarvaveda HL 5. 6-7. 
It is probable that by the time of the Chan. Up V. 10. 7 Candalas 
had become untouchables ( like dogs and hogs ) and Faulkasa 
seems to be equated with Candala in Br Up IV.3.22. Even in the 
times of Yajfiavalkya and Parasara ( 2nd to 6th century A. D. ) 
a brabmana was permitted to take food at the house of such 
sudras as his dasay cowherd, baiber, a tenant of his land on the 
rent of half share of crops (vide above p 1266). The varnas 
were only four, there was no fifth varna ( Manu X. 4 and 
Anusasanaparva, chap 48 30 ), though in modern times untou- 
ohables are often spoken of as pailcamas ( against Smrfci usage ), 
The woTd sati in the sense of caste hardly ever occurs in Vedio 
literature but it occurs in the Nirukta ( XII. 13 ) and in Panini 
( V. 4. 9 ), who explains * brahmanajatlya ' as meaning one who 
is a brabmana by caste '. Sometimes, Jati and Varna are 
differentiated in Smrtis (Yaj.II. 69,260), but from ancient 
times the word Jait is confounded with the word Varna. Manu 
(X 31) uses the word Varna in the sense of mixed castes; 
conversely the word Jati is employed in the sense of • Varna ' in 
Manu (VIII. 177, IX 85-86, X. 41)

onwards India was being invaded by Persians, Kambojns, 15 ' 7 
Greeks, Scythians ( generally held to be the same as Sakas }, and 
people like Paradas, Pablavas, Clnas, KirStas, Daradas ( Dards ) 
and Kbasas emigrated into India Manu (X. 43-44), after 
mentioning these and Paundrakas, Odras ( Orissa ), Dravida=, 
asserts that these were originally Ksatriyas but had bocorae 
Sudras because the sacraments like Upanayana had ceased 
among them and because they lost contact with brahnianos, 
Manu X. 45 shows that in his day there were mixed castes that 
spoke mleocha tongues and Arya languages but were treated ns 
dasyus ( sudras ). Gautama-dbarmasutra ( IV. 14-17 ), Manu X 
5-40, Yaj. I. 91-95 and many other works dilate upon tho ri'? 
of mixed castes from the marriages or unions of men and women 
of different varnas and declare how further castes and sub-castes 
arise from the marriages and unions of men and women belong- 
ing to different olasses and castes This was called Vain winhara 
or simply sahkata, about which Arjuna expressed concern (GltS 
I. 41-43 ) and against which the Bhagavad-glta ( III 24-25 ) 
inveighs bitterly. It was stated by Gautama (Dh. S. VIII 3) 
that the prosperity (of the castes and sub-castes ), protection 
and the non-mixture ( of varnas ) depend on the king mid 
learned brahmanas. The Nasik Inscription of king Snl

who are wise regaTd character as the principal and desirable

scheme of varnas was natural and based on the work that men 

put in for the community as a whole. It was not based on birth. 

The ideas underlying the original varna system made the nearest 

approach towards a society in which there was no attempt to 

secure a competitive equality hut in which the interest of all 

group3 were regarded as identical. In Vedic times there were only 

classes and ryot castes in the modern sense. "Even in the smrtis 

when many castes had arisen the greatest emphasis was laid 

on duties rather than on privileges and on high moral character 

and the value of the effort made by a man. It is therefore 

stated in the Git§ ( IV. 13 ) that the system of four varnas was 

created on the basis of quality ( or on the basis of satha, rajas 

and tamos ) and actions and ( in XVIII 42-44 ) it specifies the 

qualities and actions required in the four varnas as an ideal, viz. 

serenity of mind, self-control, austerity, purity, forbearance, 

straightforwardness, wisdom ( spiritual knowledge ), knowledge 

( of all kinds }, faith ( in God )-these are the natural actions 

(duties) for a brahmana, bravery, fury, energy, steadiness, 

capability, not running away in battle, charity and rulership- 

these are duties of a ksatriya, agriculture, keeping herds of 

cows (and cattle), trade and commerce-these are the natural 

duties of the Vaisya, work of the nature of service is the natural 

duty of the Sudra. These words of Gits cannot be used for 

supporting the present scheme of thousands of castes and

the nine Karmani specified as natural to brahmanas most are

birth. At the time of the Mahabharata there must bave been a 
great deal of ferment, some revolt and criticism about the

A. similar passage occurs in Vanaparva 216. 14-15 ( quoted above 
in note 1640 pp 1005-6 and compared to Dhammapada 393, 
translated on p. 1005 ). When the wrangles between Vaisnavas 
and others were at their highest the Bhagavatapurana (VIL 9. 10) 
avers that a candala who is a devotee of Vismi is superior to a 
brahmana who is not a devotee of Visnu. Apart from the 
specific qualities required to be possessed by the members of each 
of the four varnas, all Dharmasastra works attach the highest 
importance to certain moral qualities and enjoin them on all 
men Mami X 63, Ya] I 22, Gaut. Dh S. VI11. 23-25, Matsya 
52. ' -10 ( quoted above on p. 1023 n. 1652 } prescribe for all 
Varnas a brief code of morals, such as ahimsa, truthfulness, non- 
stealing ( i e. no wrongful taking of another's property ), purity 
and restraint of the senses. The MitaksarS on Yaj I 22 explains 
that the word ' saivesam ' therein states that these moral qualities 
if practised are the means of Dharma for all men from brahmanas 
tocandalas Vide H. of Dh. Vol II pp. 10-11 for different 
enumerations of dharmas common to all men. The Mamisrnrti 
( 1. 1 ) begins by saying that the great sages requested Manu to 
expound the dharmas of all varnas and of the intermediate 
oastes. This ( viz. the Dharmas of varnas, intermediate castes 
and asramas ) is the principal topic in most of the smrtis. 

A very high ideal was placed before brahmanas ( vide above 
pp 936-938 ) They were to study the Veda and its subsidiary 
lores as a duty ( to be discharged ), were to perform sacrifices and 
moke gifts also and their proper means of livelihood were only 
three viz. teaching the Veda and Sastras, officiating as priests in 
sacrifices and receiving religious and other gifts. How arduous 
learning the Veda was will be clear when it is remembered

the mind and memory. There ware thousands of Buob brahmanas 

in India up to the beginning of this century, and even now 

there are still hundreds of such men. They were to teach the 

Veda without demanding any fee ( demanding a fee to teaoh 

Veda was and is regarded as sinful even to this day). They were 

allowed to receive a fee if the pupil or somebody on his behalf 

paid something at the end of studenthood. Not only did they 

transmit the Veda free, but there were in the present author's 

youth in Konkana and Maharistra many Vaidik brahmanas who 

gave free board and lodging to several pupils (or arranged to feed 

them by turns at the houses of brahmana families in the village 

or town ). All this has now almost stopped owing to rationing 

during the world wars and present high prices So teaching hardly 

brought any regular and substantial amount of money ( vide 

H. of Dh. Vol II. pp 108-110 ). As regards officiating as priest9, 

that was a precarious and fitful source of income. Besides, in l$g. 

times at least, the scion of a royal family could be a pm ohta 

i. e. a priest ( vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. p. 109 ). It should be 

remembered that all brahmanas were not priests, they could bs 

so if they chose and if they were learned Further, many 

learned brahmanas refuse even now to act as priests in sraddlias 

for pitrs ( at least for three years after the man's death). Panini 

( V. %. 71 ) provides for the formation of the word ' Brahmanaka' 

meaning a province or country where ' brahmanas followed the 

profession of arms * and Kautilya ( IX 2 ) also refers to armieB of 

brahmanas, ksatriyas &o. The third source specially permitted 

to brahmanas was the privilege of receiving religious gifts from 

a worthy or unblemished person ( vide H. of Dh Vol. II pp 110. 

11). Brahmanas could follow other occupations in distress, 

but even then there were great restrictions imposed on them by 

sastras even when they took to other means of livelihood ( vide 

H. of Dh. Vol II pp 118-132). MM The ideal set before brahmanas 

was one of poverty, of plain living and high thinking, of 

forsaking a very active pursuit of wealth, of insisting on the 

necessity and high value to themselves and the Aryan society 

of studying, preserving, propagating and augmenting tuo 

ancient literature and culture. Kings, rich persons and oven

ordinary men made gifts of lands and houses to learned 
brahraanas ( which were deemed the most meritorious gifts ). 3M1 
The present author saw in his boyhood very learned Yaidika 
hrahmanas themselves ploughing their own lands, while 
repeating inaudibly the "Veda ( i e revising it, as otherwise it 
might slip from their memory ) and knew a middle class Vaidika 
brahmana family that for seven generations had taught Veda to 
a number of pupils and provided them with free board and 
lodging; ( out of these seven the present author personally knew 
three generations, the last of whom stopped a few years ago the 
Vaidika school owing to present high prices of food, decrease 
in gifts due to the increasing poverty of the people round about 
and their unconcern for Vedic studies ). Even in' the times of 
the early TTpanisads, the brahmana's first duty was to learn and 
teach the Veda and to take all knowledge for his province. 
Ajatasatru, king of KSsi, exclaimed, when the brahmana Balaki 
Gargya approached him for knowledge of brahman, ' this is 
against the natural usual course that a brahmana should approach 
a ksatriya to learn about brahman ' ( Br. Up. II 1. 15 ). That 
indicates that many brahmanas must have endeavoured to act 
up to the old ideal of learning in olden times They became 
the custodians of the vast literature that had accumulated and 
was growing every day and were expected to preserve that 
literature and propagate it Though every brahmana could 
not have lived up to the high ideals set up for brahmanas, a

Eicoopt in a few cases the brahmanas wore never rulers. It was 
the ksatriyoB and sudras that were rulers. Therefore a 
generalisation was made that birth in a particular group or 
family was a more or less sure indication of the possession of 
certain qualitios generally associated with the members of 
that group or family. The brahmanas were teachers with no 
salary, officiated as priests whan called and were given 
fees, but there was no assurance of a continuous and certain 
paymont. They had no church organization 2wa (such as 
Archbishops, bishops, priests, deacons in the Anglican church ) 
and monasteries for monks among Buddhists and in the 
Christian Church. The brahraanas were not monks but house, 
holders who had to maintain a family and bring up children 
and to make their sons learned and of high moral and 
spiritual worth. Thore is no oxamplo in the whole world of a 
small minority of the population of a country, that had no 
military strength bohind it, being revored for at leaBt thirty 
centuries without any serious challenge not only by the common 
people but by nobles and kings. What was the basis of the reve- 
rence shown to brahmanas as a class for at least three thousand 
years ? They were believed to be religious, moral and spiritual 
leaders and the possessors and representatives of an idoalistio 
culture ( ' ideational ' in the language of Prof. Sorokin ), The 
secret of the power of and regard for brahmanas had been the 
fact that as a class they performed well three of their appointed 
tasks of study, teaching and comparative renunciation ( in spite 
of the failings of some individual brahmanas ). The brahmanas 
had no army to support them and they could not, by devoting 
themselves to physical sciences, find new sources of inoome or 
well-being for themselves or for the whole community. 

Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in his Autobiography { p. 432 ) 
pays in passing a tribute to the Brahmana ideal as follows ' But 
the West also brings an antidote to the evils of this out-throat 
civilization - the principles of socialism, co-operation and service 
to the oommunity for the common good. This is not so unlike 
the old Brahmin ideal of service etc' The ancient Indian 
culture exalted the mind and soul over the body andhenoe arose 
an extra-ordinary development of asceticism. 

2622 The income of the See of the Archbishop of Canterbury, it it 
understood, has been fifteen thousand pounds a year ( vido Oxford 
Dictionary of the Christian Chur.h. ed. by F L. Cross, London 1957, P- 
232 ). Vide H, of Dh. Vol. II p. 138 for a sample of the actions of Popci 
and eulogies of the Nordic race by Spongier and others, 



Abolition of caste system lMi 

If in modern times the caste system has broken down and 
has become harmful and unpopular among all people, it may be 
scrapped and discarded (vide above p. 1270 note 2071 for 
provisions about this). But such, a huge and all-pervading 
system cannot be destroyed in a short time nor by legislation. 
What those who desire to destroy altogether the caste system 
want is not clear. Do they want complete westernization of the 
whole of India ? To the present author this appBaTS to be not 
only very difficult but almost impossible. Legislation may help 
a little, but it cannot eradicate within the foreseeable future the 
mental attitudes and outlook of millions of people. Oases 
have been reported where village kunbis and craftsmen thre- 
atened to beat untouchables that wanted to draw water from 
a village well in the presence of a magistrate. If this 
campaign against the whole caste system is carried on with 
force, there are sure to be widespread riots and disorders and 
the Independence of the country attained after two centuries of 
colonial rule may be jeopardized. Two matters must be carefully 
considered and strenuously worked for. Government must see 
to it that nationalism, the emotion of being one people, in spite 
of differences in aom© respects, must be instilled from childhood 
and among the masses. For that purpose free and compulsory 
education for all children on national lines must he achieved as 
quickly as possible. Merely inveighing against casteism by 
leaders would not do, when people often suspeot them as guilty 
of other ' isms' ( such as nepotism ). Universal primary and 
seoondary education, growing number of inter-caste marriages, a 

8r f^L S9nS60f8olidatityasto ess9I ^al3 of culture (though 
petty differences may exist) would be the first requisites in any

{ Vanaparva 207 ) possesed knowledge of brahmavtdm and that 
it is impossible to say that they were not able to Becure Moksa. 
Vide above pp. 921-22 and note 1468a for the discussion of the 
rolo vaut passages. It is noteworthy that even in early Vedio times 
the Eathakara ( a caste not belonging to any of the three higher 
classes) was allowed to sot up Vedio fires and could repeat 
certain Vodic mantras for that purpose and the Nisada (also not 
belonging to any of the three varnas, but being a sadra) was 
albwod to perform an isd to Rudra with Vedio mantras. Vide 
pp. 1290-91 ( for Eathakara } and pp. 1295-96 (for Nisada) 
above. These facts show that Vedio sacrifices had penetrated 
into certain sudra castes long before the sutras and smrtis 
The Bhagavatapurana ( VH. 9. 10 ) was prepared to hold that a 
candala ( by birth ) if he becomes a devotee of Visnu was 
superior to a brahmana who was not such a devotee. 

The disappearance of the caste system, when it comes 
about, will not at all imply the disappearance or destruction of 
all that for which Hinduism has stood up during several 
millennia. 

We should not be constantly harping on the caste system as 
the only or most basic cause of our downfall. The MoslemB 
have no caste Bystem and yet most of the Moslem countries in 
the world have been baokward and under the thumb of Western 
powers. China, Japan and the countries in S. E. Asia had 
hardly anything like the caste system of our country, but the 
first two about a hundred years ago were very backward and 
many of the countries in S E Asia were within the Colonial 
Empire of Holland, a small country the population of which is 
even now only about eleven millions. Sinoe 1818 when the 
British acquired the Decean, for about 130 years what littla 



Downfall due to lack of certain virtties 1643 

royal power remained in India was distributed among about 
600 princely States ruled by ksatriyas and others and hardly a 
teen brahmana States existed among those 600. mat 
little trade and commerce existed or was allowed by the British 
to Indians was in the hands of Parsis, Bhatias, Banias, 
Marvadis, Jains and Lingayats and the brahmanas had very 
little share ia trade and commerce. It was the brahmana politi- 
cians like Tilak that insisted on Swadeshi. Agriculture, money 
lending and Zamindari were mostly in the hands ofnon-brah- 
manas except in Bengal and contiguous territories where the 
Zamindari system supported by Lord Oornwallis prevailed. Our 
downfall for centuries was due to lack of certain virtues and 
idealogies among all our people, high or low. Let us, therefore, 
all Indians, stop blaming the caste system for our downfall and 
try to eradicate it or lessen its evils and cultivate virtues like 
duty for duty's sake, high endeavour, high moral character, 
nationalism, freedom and justice. 

VI. Asrarnas : Another important characteristic of our 
culture is the system of Asrarnas, which have been in existence 
for certainly several centuries before the Christian era. The word 
Asrama does not occur in the Vedio Samhitas or Brahmanas. In 
Sv. Up. VI 21 occurs the word ' atyasramibbyah ' ( to the beat of 
ascetics ) which indicates that the word ' a&rama ' had then been 
known. A generic word comprehending several matters ia 
coined long after the several words for the component parts have 
been current for centuries. The word Sraddba does not occur in 
any ancient Vedic passages, though the Pindapitryajna (per- 
formed by an agmhotnn on each Amavasya ), the Mahapitryajna 
( performed in the caturmasya rite Sakamedha ) and the AstakS 
rites ( all of which are rites in honour of pifcrs ) were known in early 
Vedic literature (vide H. of Dh. Vol IV. pp 349-50 ). Similarly, 
some of the asrarnas were certainly known from the times of 
the Bgveda. The Asrarnas Kzi long before the time of the sutra 
literature at least have been four viz. brahmacarya ( stage of 
studenthood), garhasthya {householder stage), vanaprasthya 
( stage of foTest hermit ) or vaikhanasa { Gaut. DX Z ), Sannyasa 
( stage of ascetic life ) or Mauna or Farivrajya or Pravrajya or 
Bhiksu ( Gaut III. 2 ). Asrarnas have been dealt with in H. of 
Dh. Vol II pp. 416-426, brahmacarya in H. of Dh. Vol. II pp 
349-3S2, forest hermit (inpp 919-929 ) and sannyasa in pp.

interpreted the word indavdl as meaning ' carrying three statta , 
while others like Manu XII. 10 and Daksa VII 30 provide that a 
person is called tridandi who observes threefold restraint, viz of 
speech, mind and body. The sannyasin was so highly esteemed 
that for deciding doubtful points of dharaa a single ascetic was 
allowed to do the work of a parisad and declare the proper 
decision (videH, of Eh. Vol.11 p. 969) Similarly, great 
emphasis was laid on inviting a Yati at a sraddha dinner 
(vide H. of Dh. Vol. IV pp. 388, 399). The Brhaj-jataka 
(chapter 15) deals with the question about the horoscopio 
indications for different kinds of ascetics being born on the 
conjunction of four or more powerful planets in the same sign 
of the zodiac in the horoscope and adds that according as Mars, 
Mercury, Jupiter, the Moon, Venus, Saturn, or the Sun is the 
most powerful of the four or more planets in one sign in a 
horoscope, the person whose nativity it is becomes respectively 
an ascetic of the types of Bauddha, ijlvika, 2624 abhiksu ( i. e. 
vedic ascetio ), Vrddha ( a Kapalika ), a caraka, a nirgrantha 
( a Jain ascetio ) or one subsisting on forest produce, fruits, 
roots &c. M23 This shows that long before Varabamihira 
( 6th century A. D ) so many kinds of ascetics flourished or were 
common in India. 

The iarna system classified the whole community and was 
addressed to people in the mass ; the Ssrama theory addresses 
itself to the individuals in a community and maps out for them

mation* characteristic of Christianity and as a side issue 
remarks (on p. 80) that 'the ahimsa commandment does not 
arise from a feeling of compassion but f 10m a feeling of keeping 
a person undented *. The learned author ignores several things; 
firstly, 2627 not a word is said about purity (sauca) in the 

2627 This is not the place to give a lengthy reply to Dr. Schweitzer's 

remarks. Dr. Schweitzer's compliment to Chnst, Christianity and the 

West was criticized by Dr. Radbaknshnan in ' Eastern Religion and 

Western thought' (1939 pp 76-110} and by Shrl D S. Sharzna in 

* Renaissance oi Hinduism 1 pp. 618-634. On p. 2 Dr. Schweitzer boldly 

asserts that world and life affirmation unceasingly urges men to serve their 

fellows, society, the nation, mankind and indeed all that lives with their 

ntmost will &e One shonld like to know the Biblical passages where all 

this grand thought is explicitly stated. On p 4 he contradicts himself 

■when he sajs ' Christianity also brought European thought into relation 

with world and lite negation ' The two great commandments of Jesus are 

first ' to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul ' and 

the second is ■ thonshalt love thy neighbour as thyseli ' I vide Matthew 22 37 

and 39 and Mark 12. 30-31 ) This is hardly anything lwe what Schweitzer 

ssys about Christianity's world and life affirmation. Not a word is said 

here about even loving all human beings, much less loving ' all that lives ', 

The world has had enough of the world and life affirmation of Christianity 

(or rather of Christian nations or people) Attention is invited to H, of 

Dh Vol II p. ISO, where Westerrnarck's remarks in his ' Origin and 

development of the moral ideas ' ( 1912 ) Vol I. p. 711 are cited on slavery 

The world knows what during the last fonr or five hnndred years the colonial 

empires of Christian countries like England, France, Holland, Belgium, 

Portugal and Spain did in India, Africa, S. E. Asia, the Congo and* 

America. On p. VII of his Preface he appears to contradict himself when 

he disagrees with the view of Schopenhauer and Denssen about Indian 

thought being completely governed by the ideal of world ana life negation 

and admits the fact that • world and life affirmation is present at the back 

of this thought (Indian thought) from the very dawn of its history, and life 

negation and world and life affirmation constitute Us chief characteristic 

and determine its development'. Both books { Dr. Sweitzer's and Dr 

Rodhakrishnan's) are reviewed in ' Hibbert Journal ' for 1953 pp 234-241 

and 355-365 byC.W.M.Gell who finds both works disappointing, holds 

tbit Schweitzer has misunderstood the Hindu ideal of supra-ethical man

Chandogya and other passagea about ahimsa. Secondly, the 
injunction about not giving pain to any being ( in Chan. Up. ) 
is immediately preceded by the words ' having concentrated all 
his senses on the Self '. That shows that one who knows and 
has come to realize that all is brakma should give no pain to 
others as all those also are brahma and not on the ground of purity 
or defilement. Further, in the Mahabharata and Smrtis some of 
which at least are not far removed in time from the Upanisads 
both ahimsa and sauca ( purity ) are separately mentioned 
along with other duties ( dharmas ) common to all varnaa. 
Gaut. ( 8. 23-24 ) lays down eight qualities of the soul for every 
dvija viz. compassion towards all beings, forbearance, freedom 
from jealousy, freedom from excessive harm ( to himself ), doing 
auspicious acts, absence of abjectness ( or miserliness ), absence 
of discontent '. The same eight are specified in the Matsya- 
purana 53 8-10, Atrismrti 34-41. Mann V. 46 ( = Visnu Dh. 
S 51. 69 ) provides 'he who does not desire to cage or kill or 
cause pain to living beings, thus desirous of doing good to all, 
secures highest ( or never ending ) happiness '. Sauca is external 
(of the body) and internal (of the mind). Manu V.106 
expressly says that he who is pure as to money matters is really 
pure and not one who washes himself with sand or water. Vide 
above pp. 1421-22 notes 2331 and 2333. It is worthy of note 
that the Santiparve (chapter 162. 4-5 = Or. ecL 156.4-5) 
contains an apotheosis of Satya as the an«ent Dharina and 
brahman itself and then in verses 7-9 Satya is stated _ta m J-J 
in thirteen aspects such as tyaga ( renunciation ,rf »«»^*f n * 
pleasures), samata ( being the same to all ), da ^(restraint ^o 
senses), feama ( forbearance ), hrl (being ashamed to boast of 
one's good deeds), anasutf ( absence of jealousy ), dm

It was recognised in India from very early times that in 
the matter of religious worship and philosophical doctrines, 
there are different grades among human beings. All are not 
competent to grasp and act upon abstruse metaphysical 
dootrines or to follow higher forms of worship This has been 
brought out in several places before. Vide above p. 973 note 
1593 and p. 1462. Abstruse metaphysical doctrines are likely to 
be misunderstood and therefore we find that there is an effort to 
keep such doctrines secret and frequent warnings are given in 
the TJpanisads not to impart the knowledge of brahman to all and 
sundry and to keep it secret. Vide p. 1071-72 and Chan. Up. 
III. 11. 5 set out above on p. 1460, Sv. Up. VI. 22, Katha Up. 
UL 17, Br. Up. HI. 2. 13 (Yajnavalkya and Artabhaga did not 
diBCuss&iaftman among people). The word Upanisad came to 
mean ' secret doctrine * ( vide Tai. Up. II. 9 and 111. 10 ). This 
tendency to keep abstruse doctrines secret obtained in other 
nations in antiquity (vide St. Mark 4. 11, 34-35). The 
Hatbayogapradrpika 3 "* k aa &a.\\ixt provisions ( vide p. 1460 
above). Many modern writers condemn people that engage in 
image worship. The reasons advanced for image worship by Indian 
works are given in note 1593 p. 973 above. The worshipper 
of an image of Ganesa ot Kail casts the image in water ( a 
river, sea &c. ) after a day or more ( when the period of 
the festival is over). So it is not as if he worshipped the 
wooden or earthen object but he has an emotional idea for 
the time being that God is enthroned in that object. 
These common people, if questioned, will say ' Cted i s 
everywhere, in you, in me and in the wooden image' The 
Nrsimhapurana 63. 5 (quoted by Apararka p. 140 on Yaj I 101 ) 
says that sages declare that the worship of Hari (GodVisnu 
may be performed in s5x ways, vis in water, in fire, in one's 
own heart m the sun's orb, on an altar or in an image 4" 
The V 1S nudharmott^apurana appears to have been conscious 
that image worship ca ffi e later i„ Kali age and was not £™

( XI ) Vast Sanskrit literature. 

India produced a vast amount of Sanskrit literature of 
a most varied character for at least three thousand years. There 
is no country in the world that can exhibit continuous creation 
of several departments of literature for such a long period. 
Sanskrit literature penetrated to countries like Tibet, China, 
Java and others. Its literature influenced the Moslem world and 
European world by means of the decimal place value system, 
its fable literature and system of VedSnta. Vide Winternitz'a 
* Some problems of Indian Literature ' ( the Readership Lectures 
in Calcutta University ) pp. 59-81 for a brief but instructive 
treatment of the influence of Sanskrit Literature in the West. 
Its study by Europeans at the end of the 18th century and in 
the 19th century laid the foundation of several sciences, such as 
the science of language, of comparative religion, of thongU and 
of mythology. There exist several Histories of Sanskrit Litera- 
ture by several scholars such as Weber, Max Muller, Winternitz, 
Keith, M. Krishnamaohariar, which will give an idea to any 
reader of the variety and vastness of Sanskrit literature. 

2630. Vide ' Hinduism and Buddhism ' by Sir Charles Elliot, Vol. I. 
Intro, j> L.XX, where a similar view is expressed by the learned writer who 
relies also on William James ' ' Varieties of religious experience i pp, 
525-521. Sir Oliver Lodge jn ' Man and the Universe ' ( London, 1908 ) 
pp. 246-247) says " There are plenty of good reasons against Idolatry among 
intellectual and ' chosen ' people but this ( God was jealous of idol worship) 
is not one of them: nor is »t to be supposed that the stock of a tree is 
ever really worshipped even when prostrated to. An idol, W Ignorant and 
undeveloped people, is a symbol of something which they are really worship- 
ping under a material form and embodiment, the sensuous presentation 
assists their infantile efforts towards abstract thought as material sacraments 
help people in a higher stage of religious development: but some of these 
helps should be outgrown *' 



Vast Sanskrit Literature 1651 

India has preserved for itself and for the world a vast literature 
in the best part of which the prinoipal theme is to ask men 
never to cease in their efforts to control the senses and to reach 
higher and higher heights of morality and spirituality. H. H. 
Gowen in ' A History of Indian Literature ' ( 1931 ) observes { on 
p. 8) 'Indian literature has an intrinsic value which no 
remoteness avails to destroy. For sacredness, variety and 
continuity, scarcely any other may compare with it, certainly 
none surpasses it. As for sacredness no other scripture, not 
even our Bible, may compete with the Veda in its continuity or 
in the matter of general acceptance '. He dilates also on the 
variety and remarkable continuity of Indian literature. Classical 
Sanskrit first blossoned at least before 500 B. C. Panini names at 
least ten predecessors and his sutras IV. 3. 87 and 88 clearly 
indicate that before his time there waB considerable non-vedic 
secular literature. 

XII. Toga : Yoga haB been treated of above ( pp. 1385- 
1462 ). In the whole world there exists hardly any well thought 
out and comprehensive system of psychical and mc-Tal discipline 
like Yoga. Mercea Eliade observes ( on p. 359 ) in ' Yoga, 
Itnmoitality and Freedom* (tr. by Willaid R. Trask, 1958) 
' Yoga constitutes a characteristic dimension of the Indian mind, 
is marked by reaction against metaphysical speculations and 
the excesses of a fossilized ritualism '. Western minds having 
experienced a surfeit of economic prosperity, but worried by the 
tensions and crises of these times are turning more and more to 
Yoga and to Indian philosophy such as the Vedanta. In recent 
years numerous books are being published that deal with 
' perennial philosophy ', Yoga ( including Tibetan Yoga ), 
meditation, concentration, mystical experience &c. Many of 
these books are written by honest people after reading a good 
deal of literature on these subjects but they are wanting in any 
personal yogic or mystic experience. There are some books that 
RTe written by persoas who want to take advantage of the popular 
erase for Yoga and similar mysticalpractices for the sake of wealth 
andfame. In" Vedantafor the Western World' edited by Christopher 
Isherwood (Allen and Unwin, London, 1948) the famous writer 
Mr. A dous Huxley sounds a note otwarning against the plethora 
of books on mysticism and Yoga in the market ( p 376 ).

be peeved, by which one knows what cannot be known;' and 
when Svetaketu asked for that instruction, ITddalaka expoHnds 
to him ( m VI. 1-16 ) the subject at length and winds up with 
the words 'tat-tvam-asi' (thou art that Self). An inquirer 
into philosophy will find in the various branches of Indian 
philosophy a vast mass of material, hardly surpassed by any 
other ancient country in the world. The word for philosophy is 
dariana and there is a famous work called ' Sarvadarsansangraha * 
in which fifteen different points of view apart from advaila 
Vedanta aTe summarised. The principal orthodox darsanas are 
six— Sankhya, Yoga, Hyaya, Vaisesika. PurvamlmarnBa and 
UttaiamlmamBa ' ( or Vedanta ), which have been treated above 
and their relation to and influence on Dharraasastra has been 
dwelt upon. The chief marks of Indian philosophy are 
that it concentrates on the spiritual, that philosophy has to be 
lived and not merely discussed, that it seeks the Eeality 
that for real philosophy great moral preparation is necessary, 
that reason has to be extensively used in arriving at the truth, 
that tradition and authority have to be accepted and not 
neglected. Almost all darsanas ( except that of Carvaka ) »T6 
concerned with Liberation { variously called Moksa, Xaivalya, 
Nirvana, Amrtatva, Nihsreyasa, Apavarga) and all (except 
C&rvaka ) aTe agreed on the doctrine of Karma and Punarjanma. 
It is not necessary to say more on Indian Philosophy in this 
Chapter. 

XIV. AHs. Architecture, Sculpture, Painting : 
Though the present author has travelled throughout India 
for over fifty years and seen most of the famous places rioh in 
ancient architecture, sculpture and painting, he lays no claim 
to being a connoisseur in these matters and cannot give his own 
valuation of these relics of ancient Indian Art. The number 
of workB on these is legion. A mere bibliography would not be 
of much use to the reader. Therefore, he will content himself 
with mentioning a few works on each of the above branches 
which he has read wholly or partly or which he consulted. 

Among the most remarkable ancient monuments of India 
are the stupa at SanchI, the paintings in the AjantS caves, the 



Puranas cm A ris 

iraiteBa temple at Mora, and the *a*W tW* in 
Orissa. 

Soma of the Puranas contain information on the aW 
topics. The Matsyapurana (chap, 252.2-4) names ,18 , «. 
Bounders of VastusSstra (architecture) such as Bhigu, AW, 
Vasistha, Visvakarman, Maya, tfarada, Hagnagit, Yis&laksa, 
Purandata, Brahma, , Kumara, NandSsa, Saunaka, Garga, 
Vasudeva, Aniruddha, Sukra and Brhaspati. Chapters 354-257 
deal with the conatiuction of mansions and houses, chap. 
258-263 with images of several deities The Vayupurana (8. 108 ff.) 
describes the founding of a capital. AgnipuiSDa, chapters 42, 
104-106 deal with the building of mansions, houses and laying 
out cities. The Visnudharmottara ( third section ) is called 
atrasutra M32 Because dancing is held to he the primary ait and 
painting rests on it. It is further said that painting is the bsst 
of arts { HI. 33. 38 ) and the foremost of auspicious things in a 
house, that the rules that apply to painting are applicable 
to the making of images of metals, stone and wood (111 43.31-32). 
Chapters 36-43 deal with painting, chapters 44-85 with the 
making of images of gods and goddesses and housebuilding is 
dilated upon in chap, 86 f£ The Brhafc-samhita ( ed. by M. M. 
SudhakaT Dvivedi, 1895 ) of VaTahamihira ( 500-550 A.D. } deals 
with palaces, mansions and houses of king, crown prince 
and others; in chap. 52 (123 verses) with temples of several gods, 
in chap. 53 (31 verses) with images of gods, in chap. 57 
( Kama, Visnu, Brahma, Indra, Siva, Buddha, Jina, the Sun,

kinds of men ( chap. 68 versa 30 ) called Hamsa, Sa§a, Bucaka,

There are several other works like the Yuktikalpatara of 
Bboja ( Calcutta ed. of 1927 ), the Abhilasitartbacintamani ( also 
called ManaBoIlasa ) K33 of king Somesvara, Silparatna (T,5S), 
Mayamata ( T. S. S. ) on these subjects. 

Paintings — The only famous ancient paintings are those in 
the caves of Ajanta, in tbe Bagh caves in the former Gwalior State 
and those in the caves at Sigiriya in Ceylon. For reasons of 
space it is not possible to quote the enthusiastic appreciations 
of Western writers on ancient Indian Art, particularly paintings 
and sculpture. The author would quote a few passages from 
Bene Grousset's 2634 works: ' India has given a mighty art or a 
complete Aesthetic equal in originality and power to the Greek 
and Chinese. It is marked by its naturalism in depicting 
animals'. The same writer says about Ajanta's immortal 
paintings ' they count among the most moving that have ever 
come within human vision '. * In civilizations of the East ' ( tr. 
by Mrs.C. A. Phillips, London, 1932 with 249 illustrations) the 
same author (after oiting paintings of the Jatakas of self- 
sacrifice) remarks 'these are but a few examples, the most 
poetic, tender and moving that could be imagined. Ho better 
example could be found of that purely Indian sentiment of 
universal brotherhood, that fervour of humanitarianism which 
extends even to animals and plants' ( p 79 ). For Ajanta there 
is a fine edition by Dr. G. Yazdani, the text in two parts { 19 « 
and 1933 ) and there aTe besides many coloured and monochrome 
plates with an Introduction by Lawrence Binyon There is also 
another small work prepared for the use of Lord Reading on hfa 
visit to Ajanta in 1934 in which Dr. Yasdam gives ten cote

Works on Paintings and Sculpture 1655 

A third book on Ajanta is in Marathi written and published in 
1929 by Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, Chief of Aundh State, with 
half-tone and coloured illustrations. Percy Brown on ' Indian 
Fainting' deals with BuddhiBt, Hindu and Mahomedan 
Fainting and covers a long period from 6th century A. D to 
19th Century A D. He gives two illustrations of Sigiriya 
paintings opposite pp. 33, 69, which are remarkably similar to 
some paintings in oaves 16 and 17 at Ajanta, In Ananda K. 
Coomaraswamy's 'History of Indian and Indonesian Art* illustra- 
tions No. 183 and No. 184 are respectively from Bagh and 
Sigiriya.

sculpture and painting or with two of them or with one only

these characteristics What is claimed is that there is no other 
single culture in the world where all these can be found now or 
existed in the past and that some of these characteristics such 
as the noble Vedanta concept of man, v lower animals and even 
inanimate things being one in Essence, the great tolerance 
throughout the ages for differing religious and philosophical 
views, the emphasis on satya and ahmsa are unique and not 
found elsewhere,

CHAPTER XXXVII 
Future Trends 

the three large provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa came under 
British rule from 1765. Prom 1818 when the last Peshwa 
Bajirao II was defeated and became a pensioner, the British 
were in control over the whole of India except Punjab, which 
was subdued in 1845. The British left India in 1947. There- 
fore, they were rulers over a large part of India for 180 years, 
over the whole of it except Punjab for about 130 years and over 
Punjab just about 100 years. The impact of British occupation 
during these periods on Hindu society was tremendous in all 
spheres, physical, mental and moral. The changes effected 
during these years of British rule were of Buch magnitude that 
they far exceeded the changes that occurred in hundreds of years 
before the coming of the British With the advent of British 
rule came a new system of Government on an all India basis, 
establishment of courts of justice on Western patterns, laws 
that applied to all Indians without distinction, modern indivi- 
dualistic liberty, Western pattern of living at least m towns 
and cities, an educational system placing all Indians on the 
same level, newspapers, better means of transport, study of 
modern science, English literature and arts &c. 

The present author has no intention of writing anything 
on the all round changes that have taken place in India under 
British rule. All that he proposes to do in this chapter ib to indicate 
briefly the effects that are likely to be produced on Hindu 
society, its ancient ideals and values in the near future, on 
account of science and modern ideas, the Constitution framed 
for Indian democracy, the idea of a secular State, socialistic 
pattern of society, economical planning, legislation, growth of 
population and means to check it. 

But before he deals with the above subjects, it is necessary 
to give a rapid review of the state of things before Independence 
was achieved. Lord Bipon as Viceroy of India in 1882 started 
a scheme of local self-government by means of municipal 
corporations in the oities and district and local Boards in the 
rural areas. Thus after about 120 years from 1765 when British 
rule was first established in a large part of India, the Bntisii 



British colonial ■policy and its effects 1659 

thought fit to associate the conquered people in managing some 
of their own { unimportant and petty ) affairs Colonialism on 
the part of the British had reached its peak by that time. The 
British imported raw materials like cotton from India, processed 
them in Manchester and exported the manufactured products 
back to India's immense market. At the instance of British 
manufacturers laws were passed in Britain forbidding the 
import of Indian silk and cotton goods. India was drained of 
wealth by that policy for over a hundred years and India became 
one of the poorest countries in the world Dadabhai Naoroji in 
his ' Poverty and un-British rule in India ' ( London, 1901, 675 
pages ) demonstrated this very ably. The main elements of the 
colonial rule of Britain were these, complete political subjection 
existed, the main economic activity was in the hands of 
foreigners, it was foreign capital that was employed in India 
and substantial dividends or interest on the capital were 
guaranteed in some cases like the Railways by the British 
rulers of India payable from the taxes imposed on Indian 
people, the control of large enterprises was in foreign hands and 
directed towards securing foreign interests, the land and people 
were used as instruments of the purposes of Britain. India 
got peace and political unity at the cost of enormous poverty 
and distress and many of the economic problems that beset 
present day India have to' be traced back to the disastrous 
colonial policies of Britain. 

The army of the Government of India was for over a 
century entirely officered by the British. There were in the 
20th century about 7000 officers (lieutenants, captains, majors 
colonels ) among whom not one Indian held the King's commission 
till after the first world war. Then a few were sent every vear

administration, as one great British Prime Minister was pleased 
to call it ) was held in England ( in spite of a Resolution of the 
House of Commons that the examination for appointment to the 
Indian Civil Servics in 1893 should be held simultaneously in 
India and England ). Only a few Indians in the last quarter of 
the 19th century could go to England and qualify for entry in 
that heaven-born service. District officers such as Colleotors, 
District Judges, Police Superintendents, Medical officers (of the 
Indian Medical Service ) were almost all British. Almost all 
Professors in colleges and the head masters of even some 
secondary schools were Englishmen. All the books to bB used 
in schools were prescribed by the Head of the Department of 
Public Instruction in the several provinces, all of whom were 
Westerners. Even primary education was being given only to 
a small fraction of the children of school-going age, even in 
1947 when the British left. The elements of colonial rule by 
Britain and the policies pursued by the British rulers are 
emphasized here solely as warnings to present warring elements 
in our country that if they pursue their quarrels to bitter 
ends the nation may again be plunged into a miserable state by 
invasions from powerful and hostile neighbours. 

Morley ( who was Secretary of State for India and who was 
believed by many Indians to be a man of liberal or even radical 
views ) introduced separate communal electorates for Moslems 
in the reforms of 1909 and he was firmly of opinion that a 
Parliamentary system in India should not be established in the 
foreseeable 2636 future It is unnecessary to refer in detail to 
Montagu's famous speech in 1917, characterizing the Indian 
Government as too wooden, too antediluvian for modern times, 
to his statement ( the reverse of Morley's views ) that ' the policy 
of the British Government is the gradual development of self- 
governing institutions with a view to the progressive realiza- 



2636. Virfe the volume of " Indian Speeches " by Viscount Morley 
( p. 92 ) where he says " If my existence, either officially or corporeally,

The introduction of education through English was espoused 
by Lord Macaulay in his 'Minute on Indian Education*. 
Why he insisted on the education of Indians through English 
is stated in the Minute as follows : ' We must at present do our 
best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the 
millions whom we govern, a class of persons Indian in blood 
and colour, but English in taste, in opinion, in morals and 
intellect '. !S37 English education caused great wastage of effort 
in learning all subjects (including even Sanskrit) through 
English and led to a disproportionate pursuit of literary studies 
and neglect of scientific and technological subjects and created 
a wide gulf between the educated and the uneducated masses; 
it glorified Western culture and did not help Indians to Btudy 
and appreciate their own culture Educated Indians, particularly 
in the earlier period of English education in India, came to 
entertain an exaggerated respect for Western institutions and 
unduly disparaged their own social and religious systems. 

The British Government's interest in Indian education 
( particularly higher education } was lukewarm. Three Univer- 
sities ( of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras ) were first established 
in 1857 for the whole of India, but they were merely examining 
bodies. In the whole of the Bombay Presidency there was no 
Science Institute entirely maintained by Government till about

1920. An Indian could pass the M. A. examination in Philo- 
sophy without knowing anything about ancient Indian 
philosophy till only a few years ago. However, English 
education by Government and missionaries produced a result 
exactly opposite of what was expected by them. The missiona- 
ries miserably failed in securing the Indians ( except a few 
among the lower castes and athvasiv ) for Christ and Government 
found that reading the classics of English literature and works 
of men like Burke, Spencer, Mill and others created among the 
educated emotions of nationalism and discontent with their own 
abject political Btatus. Political agitation daily increased. 
Lokamanya Tilak was called ' the father of Indian unrest ' by 
an English writer. He passed away in 1920. But his mantle 
fell on Mahatma Gandhi, who while agitating for political 
power and eventual freedom, adopted the technique of 
mtyagraha. 

It is not necessary to go into the freedom struggle from 
1919 to 1917 which culminated in the British leaving India but 
after dividing it into Pakistan and the present India The 
partition of India into two parts based on merely communal 
considerations let loose the most hideous conflicts, massacres 
and flights of millions of refugees which India had ever witness- 
ed during its long history. The giving up of a largB empire

C- nsttlvent Assembly and the Constitution 1663 

Parliament and Boyal assent -was given on 18th July 1947. ^ A 
Constituent Assembly had been set up by the cabinet mission 
(of three cabinet ministers, Pefchick Lawrence, Secretary of 
State foi India, Stafford Cripps and A. V. Alexander ) and it held 
its first meeting in December 1946. It re-assembled in August 
1947 as a sovereign body to frame a constitution for free India. 
Its work went on for over Wo years and the constitution con- 
sisting of 395 Articles and nine Schedules came into force on 
26th January 1950 (except 15 Articles that came into force at 
once ) ; ride Art. 394. 

The Preamble to the Constitution of India declares that 
India is a sovereign democratic Bepublic The extent of the 
Indian Republic even at present is vast. It was hardly ever 
under one Government, except possibly itnder Asoka. In 
ancient times India had some ganarSjyas or sangharajyas 
( oligarchic states, or republics as Jayaswal and some others 
prefer to call them ). This question of the existence of oligar- 
chies ( or republics ) in ancient India has been discussed at some 
length by the present author in Vol. Ill pp. 87-96 of the H. of 
Dh. He still adheres to the views there expressed. The Buddhist 
monks had a procedure for regulating the meetings of their 
sahgha ( as set out in the MahSvagga IX 3 in SBE Vol. XVII 
p. 264frandinCulIavaggaIV- 9, SBE Vol SXpp. 24-27 and 
pp. 53 ff ) and Jayaswal conjectures that the same procedure was 
followed in oligarchies (or republics ). 

There are substantial achievements to the credit of present 
India and its leaders during the last 14 years after Independence, 
borne of them may be very succinctly stated here: (l)The

adult suffrage, viz, every person 2B '» (male or female) who is 3 
citizen of India, is twenty-one years of age and not disqualified 
under the constitution or any other law, has a right to be 
registered as a voter at elections to the House of the people and 
to the Legislative Assemblies of States (Art 326); (8) 
Socialistic pattern of society as the goal ( Art. 38, 39 ), ( 7 ) Two 
five year plans have been carried out and a third Five Year Plan 
has been set on foot ( under Schedule VII, list HI, item 30 ). The 
creation of a democratic republic was something that India had 
not been acquainted with for at leaBt twelve centuries ( bvbt> if 
ganaiajyas were held to be republics and not merely 
oligarchies ). From Rgvedic times there was a hereditary 
monarchical form of rule. Vide Rg. VII. 33.3 and 5, VIL 83. 7-8, 
where the battle of ten kings ( dasa rajanah ) with king Sudas is 
mentioned; vide also the story of Devapi and Santanu in Rg. X, 
98 expanded in Nirukta II. 10-12. 

Some criticism may be offered against the Constitution, In 
the first place, it is extremely bulky and goes into too many 
details and is a hotchpotch of provisions from several sources. 
Some provisions are derived from England, the directive 
principles of State policy are derived from the constitutions of 
Ireland and other countries of Europe, some are borrowed from 
the Government of India Act of 1935. Several of these need not 
have been put in a Constitution but should have been left to 
ordinary legislation. In spite of such a lengthy constitution ttsera 
are many omissions. Nothing is expressly said about political 
parties, about industrial corporations, about relation of religions 
and the State. The Constitution makes a complete break with our 
traditional ideas. Dharmasutras and Smrtis begin witu m 
dharmas ( duties ) of the people ( varnas and Ssramas ). Prune 
Minister Pandit Nehru hrmself says in ,^ Bft ^ *fTJ 
Lectures on 'India to-day and to-morrow ( 1959 ) p. *& au

Common people feel that they have cnly lights and no duties 1665 

social, economical, intellectual and moral. The Constitution 
engenders a feeling among common people that they have rights 
and no obligations whatever and that the masses have the right 
to impose their will and to give the force of law and justice to 
their own ideas and norms formed in their own cottages and 
tea shop3. 

The Constitution of India has no chapter on the duties of 
the people to the country or to the people as a whole. Art 19 
confers the right to seven freedoms, one of which (c) is to form 
associations or unions and sub-article { 4 ) enables the State to 
make laws imposing, m the interest of public order or mo; ahly, 
reasonable restrictions. The framers of the Constitution forgot 
to include what Britain had, provided long before in 17 and 18 
Geo 5, Chapter 22, Article 1, part of which runs ' any strike is 
illegal if it is designed or calculated to coerce the Government 
directly or by inflicting hardship on the community '. The eyes 
of some of the framers of this constitution were opened by the 
strike of Government servants in the Railways, Posts and 
Telegraphs by which, if it had continued for even a fortnight, 
crores of people would have had to submit to incalculable hard- 
ships and the action of the strikers in essential services would 
have been like a rebellion by some lakhs of people against over 
forty crores of people. The right to strike by workers tacitly 
given in the constitution is in imitation of similar rights 
enjoyed in industrial countries like Britain only for the last few 
decades and the framers should have restricted the right to 
strikes betweenprivate employers and employees as anexperiment 
in the first instance

and smacks of spoliation and arbitrariness. In the Houaa of 
the People the quorum is only 50 and if SO persons aTe present 
and a majority of them ( say 26 ) decida that a certain amount 
of compensation should be paid for compulsory acquisition of 
several properties of a person and the compensation is felt to be 
ridiculously low he has no remedy in a court of law at all. 
Besides, the Welfare State is, if at all, foreshadowed in the 
Directive Principles of State Policy ( Art, 38, 39 etc. ), but these 
principles are not enforceable in a court of law and, therefore, 
they are inferior to fundamental rights, the breach of which can 
be examined by the High Court or Supreme Court, which is 
invested with the power of issuing writs. Parliament (Lokasabha) 
has over 500 members and the quorum is 50 and yet this small 
number is not often present and the Speaker has several times to 
reprimand the House of the People on this score. 

Another criticism my be offered as to the inolusion of 
Universities in list H ( of schedule 7, State List, No. 11 ) and 
not in the concurrent list. Vocational and technical training of 
labour is in the concurrent list (Item 25). Is not University 
education throughout India of as much importance as the 
training of labour ? Only items 63-66 ( of list I, Union list are 
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Central Government. 
There is hardly any weighty reason (except chance) why the 
Benares Hindu University, the Aligarh Muslim University, h 
Delhi University and Santiniketan should be treat* d « Hto 
exclusive concern of the Central Government and the other 
Universities be not placed even in the concurrent list.

Effect of makmg Hindi the only official language 166? 

in 1950 the population of India was about 36 croras. This 
sweeping decision to make Hindi the only official language 
instead of helping emotional integration of Indians produced great 
strife An official language is not the only means of emotional 
integration, nor even the chief one. The Govt, should begin with 
the children in the schools, should instil into their minds the 
fundamental cultural Unity of India, and that India has been 
looked upon as one by all foreign invaders, steps should be taken 
to make every Indian feel that he is the inheritor of the vast 
ancient wisdom and spiritual culture of India, that he must 
contribute to the conservation of that culture, and must add to its 
greatness in the future, and free and compulsory education for all 
children up to the age of 14 should have been achieved in ten 
years as foreshadowed in Art 45. 

A plan and programme to instil among all grown-up citizens 
the ideal of national integration must be prepared, insisting on 
our common past, common interests, common future aud on 
elements like the wisdom and thought embodied in Sanskrit and 
the regional languages, the tolerance shown by our people 
through the ages. 

The Constitution has also committed several mistakes in 
the allotment of subjects in the 7th Schedule as Union list State 
List and Concurrent list. For example, the production, manu- 
facture, possession, transport, purchase and sale of intoxicating 
liquors are put in the State List ( item 8 in List II, State List ) 

This has led to prohibition in some States, but also its absence 
in other States. 

The above discussion is enough to show that the Constitution 
framed after more than two years' cogitation is unsatisfactory 
m several ways. »wn«iy

was the prevailing form the ruler came to be so by succession or 
by conquest i, e. by breaking heads. Now, under democracy, the 
ruler or rulers are chosen by the mere counting of heads. As 
observed by Dr. Radhakrishnan in ' Kalkin or the future of 
civilization ' ( 4th ed. of 1956 ) ' Democracy in actual working 
rarely permits a country to be governed by its ablest. 
The opinions of the mass prevail over those of the thinking 
few. We must strive for some better way for conducting human 
affairs than the lottery of the ballot-box* ( pp. 20-22 ), Bona 
Guenon in ' Crisis of the modern world * ( translated by Arthur 
Odborne, London, 1932 ) remarks ' the law is supposed to be 
made by the opinion of the majority, but what is overlooked is 
that this opinion is something that can very easily be guided or 
modified i. e. opinion can be manufactured. The majority on 
whatever question it may be called on to give its opinion is 
always composed of the incompetent, whose number is vastly- 
greater than that of the men who can give an opinion based on 
a full knowledge of the subject * ( p. 108 ). 

These words of Rene Guenon refer to conditions in 

European countries in most of which there has been almost cent 

par cent literacy for some decades. Parliamentary democracy 

assumes that voters understand the policies and programmes of 

different parties and oast their votes accordingly. It presupposes 

some education, intelligence, respect for the rule of law, tolerance, 

a sense of brotherhood for at least one's countrymen, and a more 

or less homogeneous society. But when, as in India at present, 

the vast majority of voters are illiterate, the state of things 

becomes far v-orse. We can and must tolerate democracy in 

India as a first step towards better days, though at present it in 

mere shell and is ridiculed by some unsympathetic foreigners. 

The census of 1961 discloses that literacy which was only lb* 

percent in 1951 is 23-7 percent in 1961. Dean Inge in

Moral predicament of elected men in power 1669 

to his friends and associates. In our country also ministers and 
officials must be in a similaT predicament, particularly when 
there exist numerous rules and regulations about permits and 
licenses galore. 

The Directive Principles of state policy are contained in 
Articles 37 to 51 and it is provided in Article 37 that they shall 
not be enforceable by any court, but that they are fundamental 
in the governance of the country. Article 45 enacts that the 
State shall endeavour to provide within a period of ten years 
from the commencement of this constitution for free and 
compiilsory education for all children until thi-y complete the aqe 
of fourteen years. It is more than twelve years since the 
commencement of the Constitution. In spite of the fact that 
about 7000 crores of rupees were to be spent on grandiose 
schemes in the two 3?ive Year Plans, this fundamental provision 
was not implemented. Even free and compulsory primary 
education of all children up to the age of eleven years ( instead of 
14 as envisaged in Article 45 ) is not accomplished and it is 
promised that in the Third Five Year Plan ( which envisages an 
expenditure of over ten thousand crores of rupees ) this may be 
accomplished. But, if the huge sums for the third plan be not 
forthcoming, the first casualty will be education The education 
of the masses who are to be voter3 and indirectly rulers of the 
nation continues to be sadly neglected even after Independence. 

It is remarkable that the directive principles of state policy 

mostly contain provisions on the economic system for raising 

people's standard of living ( Art. 43, 47 &c. ), i e. it lays 

emphasis only on the material things for the people. It seems to 

be assumed that if material prosperity or benefits are assured 

for all, then there iB nothing more to be done by the State The 

present author feels that the Directive Principles should also have 

put equal or greater emphasis on moral and spiritual values and 

should have called upon the State to promote among the people 

high moral standards, self-discipline, co-operation, sense of 

responsibility, kindliness, high endeavour. Man is a many-sided 

boing. The satisfaction of mere physical needs is not enough 

Man has intellectual, spiritual, cultural and social aspirations 

also The socio-economic pattern for the future must be based 

on the foundation of the best part of our traditions, the rule of 

aharma, the duties common to all as declared by Manu X 63 

and Ya, L 152 A secular state should not and does not mean a 

godless state or a state that has nothing to do with moral and 



1670 History of DharmatSsti a [ Sec. X, Ch. XXXVII 

spiritual values. Prime Minister Nehru himself emphasizes this, 
■when ho says ' whether religion is necessary or not, a cei lamfailh 
in a worth-while ideal is einential to give substance to our lives 
nnd to hold ua together. We have to have a sense of purpose beyond 
the malm ial and physical deraandB of our daily lives' ( in 'Today 
and tomorrow' p. 8). It may bo stated that for most common men 
and womon it is roligion that sets worth-while ideals. 

The third item in Lincoln's definition is 'for tie 
pooplo '. That is, the Government must look to the good of the 
people as a whole and not to that of any class or a community 
in the country. Modern democracy has come to mean parties 
and it has to work on dscisions of the majority. It often 
happens tliat, there being several parties, no one party has an 
absolute majority over all other parties put together. It may 
often happen that one party secures 40% of the votes actually 
cast and the othor parties ( that differ in ideologies ) secure, say 
25, 20, 15, percent of the votes, then the first party with only 40 
percent of the total votes cast rules, though it does not represent 
the majority of the whole country. The party system generally 
loads to a struggle for power and lowers the moral standards of 
tho whole people, particularly when hardly one-fifth of the voters 
( both male and female ) can read and write their own regional 
language. The present author does not hold that illiteracy 
necessarily means absence of intelligence. But, unless a man 
can read for himself and ponder over what he reads, he can 
hardly be a good judge of the pros and cons in relation to a 
measure or policy placed before the voters. Besides, the 
emphasis laid on standards of living without any direct nfnujM 
to moral and spiritual values has already led to this result tnat 
in India the desire for material comforts and positions of P°w» 
dominates almost every one and there is no corresponding urge 
or even idea to do one's best for producing goods. The laws 
are drafted in the English language. Most of the speaker. > m

only a male couia be adopted ioi purposes of spiritual benefit to 
the adopter and the person to be adopted should be m age 
and other matters like a son. Women could not adopt to 
themselves but a widow could adopt a son for the spiritual 
benefit of her husband. These principles have been thrown to 
the winds as will be seen from the criticisms of the present 
author above on pp. 1337-1335. But one thing must be 
mentioned. In some enactments affecting Hindu Law, customs 
have been abrogated- vide Hindu Marriage let 25 of 1955, 
Section 4, Hindu Succession Act 30 of 1956, Section 4(1) The 
Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (78 of 1956) prescribes 
that the person to he adopted must not be more than 15 
years of age ( section 10 item IV ) and that there should be a 
difference of 21 yeaTS between a male adopter and a female 
adoptee and between a female adopter and a male adoptee ( sec. 
11 items iii and iv ). But the provision in Sec. 10 is mads 
subject to a custom to the contrary. It passes one's understanding 
why custom was allowed to prevail over the law in this case. 
The Hindu Mamage Act, 35 of 1955, has made sweeping 
changes of which the vast majority of Hindus are blissfully 
ignorant. Before the Act a Hindu could in theory ( and rarely 
in practice ) have two or more wives living at the same time and 
even an amloma marriage ( i. e. the marriage of a male of a 
higher varna with a woman born in a lower wrna ) was held to 
be invalid by some High Courts in India such as those of 
Allahabad and Madras Now under the present Hindu Marriage 
Act of 1955 the marriage is a monogamous marriage ( section 5 ) 
and a person belonging to any caste may marry a woman of 
any caste how highsover or lowsoever she may be by caste; and 
further marriages between spouses belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, 
Buddhist or Jaina religions are now declared valid. It was 
suggested, while the marriage Bill was in the Committee stage, 
that the provision as to monogamous marriages should become 
compulsory when a similar provision would he made applicable 
to Muslims ( who under the Koranic law can have four wives at 
the same time) But this was brushed aside through fear of 
antagonizing Muslims Other provisions about Buddhists, Jains 
and Sikhs being Hindus for the purposes of the Marriage Act, 
being a sweeping one at one stroke, is likely to be resented by 
almost all illiterate Hindus an d likely to lead to tension 
and bitterness in many rural families and to break-up of the 
family as a central and compact unit in Hindu society. The 
orthodox people do not like such mised marriages. Ifcis not 



1672 History of DharmaiSstra [ Sec. X, Ch. XXXVII 

unlikely that the orthodox sections in the country may join 
hands with the ignorant masses and set back the hands of the 
clock, when some years hence the ranks of the towering 
personalities of the Gandhi era whom people want to humour 
have become thin. 2640 

One of the outstanding characteristics of Hindu society 
for several millennia has been the joint family system of the 
Mitaksara type which prevails in the whole of India ( except in 
Bengal which is under the Dayabhaga system ). Its peculiarity 
is that all male members in the family form a coparcenary, that 
if any male of the family dies his interest devolves by survivor- 
ship on the remaining male members including his own male 
issue, if any, that females have no rights m the family property 
except marriage expenses and maintenance and no member of 
the joint family could transfer any part of the family property by 
will (not even the father) or by sale or mortgage except for certain 
recognised family necessities This joint family system and the 
caste system were the bulwarks that kept together Hindu Society 
for centuries, inspite of foreign invasions and misrule. The Hindu 
Succession Act ( 30 of 1956 ) makes two sweeping changes in the 
Mitaksara joint family system. The explanation to Section 30 of 
the Act provides that any male Hindu may dispose of by will Ms 
interest in the coparcenary property. This is one drastic change. 
A similar drastic change was made by section 6 its proviso and 
explanation read together. Briefly it comes to this, v H a Hindu 
"piceneTof the Sitaksara system dies after the Success^ 
Act comes into force, leaving him surviving no > .on hut a

type a mere shell. It was suggested when the Bill was before 
Parliament that Parliament should provide that the joint family 
system of the Mitaksara type has been abrogated and that all 
members of the joint family after the passing of the Act would 
be only tenants-in-oommon. But this was not done. Why the 
Minister in charge or the members of Parliament felt squeamish 
about ending the coparcenary system of the Mitaksara is not 
clear to the present author. It looks like straining at a gnat 
while swallowing a camel. These and other changes in the old 
Hindu Law are possibly motivated by the desire to do justice to 
the rights of women. But in some cases this is done with a 
vengeance. For reasons of space only one example of this type 
is cited. Under Section 8 of the Hindu Succession Act and the 
Schedule of heira in class I and clas3 II, if a man dies possessed 
of property leaving only his mother and father { and no sons or 
wife or other persons ) the mother will take the whole estate of 
her son absolutely to the entire exclusion of the father, since the 
mother is placed among heirs of class I., while the father is 
placed in class II and the rule in Sec 8 ( a and b ) is that heirs 
put in class n succeed only if there is no heir in class I. 
Under Yaj II 135 the order of heirs to a man dying without 
male issue is first the widow, then daughter, then daughter's 
son or sons, then parents ( pilarau, the dual is used ). Some 
commentators held that the mother is to be preferred as 
heir to the father, others held that the father is to be 
preferred to the mother, while still others held that both parents 
should sucked together. In the Council of States ( Rtjyasabta) 
the father was put m class I along with the mother, but in the 
House of the People the mother was put in class I and the father 
was put as hen- ,„ class II Article 15 of the Constitution 
prohibits discrimination on the ground of sex, religion, race &c 
mat difference can be made between the mother and &e fXer" 
of a man as heirs except on the ground of sex ? Probablv iZ

a deceased person's estate. The result would be that there would 

be great fragmentation of property and constant wrangles and 

litigation. This amounts to distribution of poverty. Under 

the Hindu Law before 1956 women as heirs to males took as a 

general rule a limited estate ( i, a, a life estate ) For example, if 

a man died leaving his wife and a brother or a brother's son 

( but no children ) his widow would take a limited estate i. e. on 

the widow's death, the estate would go to the brother ( if alive ) 

or to the latter's sons &c. Now ( after 1956 ) the widow would 

take an absolute estate and she would be able to dispose 

of it as she pleased (by sale, gift or will). Vide Section 

14 of the Hindu Succession Act of 1956. Kot only this, that 

section has retrospectively conferred an absolute estate on the 

widows who succeeded as limited owners before 1956. Suppose 

a person died in 1950, leaving a widow and a brother. The 

widow would take only a limited estate and she could not sell it 

or will it away , if she died before 1956 the husband's brother 

would have succeeded to the estate. But suppose she is alive 

and in possession of her husband's estate when the Aot of 1958 

was passed. Her estate is at once enlarged. She can donate it 

to any one or leave it by her will to her own brother and entirely 

destroy the expectanoy of the husband's brother to succeed to 

her husband's estate. This is equality of women with a vengeance 

The mass of people know nothing about this at present. But 

when many oases come before the courts and the common 

people come to know the present law whereby the expectancies 

of male members of her husband's family are set at naught by 

the widow transferring the property to persons that are strangere 

there is bound to be great trouble. Of all the revolutionary 

changes in India none will have more pervading influence and 

"ng than the drastic changes in the legal status of women 

made by the laws affecting Hindus passed from 19 W to JM.

of lands up to 48 acres or 24 aeies according as the land is 
ordinary or 6aoaif (irrigated). This is felt by common people 
as a great injustice, when there is no ceiling on the wealth of big 
merchants and the like. It may be aigued that these very rich 
people pay income-tax and other taxes. The agriculturists also 
say that they pay taxes and that inflation has made the price of 
bare necessities go up. 

Before leaving the subject of legislation vitally affecting 
Hindu society, some remarks will have to be made about the 
mentality of several Congressmen who appear to have great faith 
in making men moral by legislation. Article 47 provides that 
it is among the primary duties of the State to raise the level of 
nutrition, the standard of living of its people and the 
improvement of public health and that, in particular, the 
State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consump- 
tion of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious 
to health The Bombay State and a few other States in India 
embarked on a policy of total prohibition of intoxicating drinks. 
If there was to be a total prohibition of intoxicating drinks, it 
should have been an all India measure. Several States refused 
to have the prohibition law because there is loss of revenue in 
two ways, viz. the income from excise duties on liquors is lost 
and large sums of money have to be spent on establishments for 
preventing people from manufacturing illicit liquor. Art. 45 
about free and compulsory education of children of school-going 
age (up to 14 years) was not strenuously observed by the 
Bombay State but it wanted to enforce Art 47 at all costs 
Besides there being no prohibition on an all India basis, what 
is an offence under law in the Bombay State is not an offence 
m Delhi and some other States at all. That takes away the 
moral bas.s from the measure. Besides, prohibitionists forget 
human psycho ogy. When something is prohibited or becoS 
rare, many feel a fascination in breaking the law or trying to 
possess what is rare. Blieit liquor produced and kept unS the 
most unhygienic conditions is being sold on a W e scak

Minister's cook was found engaged in manufacturing illicit 
liquor. In the present author's opinion prohibition has turned 
out to be a dismal failure, it tends to corrupt the police, it 
reduces revenue much needed for development purposes, illicit 
distillation has become a cottage industry and boot-leggers have 
acquired a vested interst in prohibition. Why horse-racing and 
betting are not prohibited by law is inexplicable, except on the 
supposition that many people entertain that Government is 
afraid of displeasing rich people who indulge in it. Wine and 
gambling have been begetting sins from the times of the Rgveda. 
Vasistha pleads for forgiveness of sins from Varuna in Rgvoda 
VII. 86.6 saying that ' it is not one's own power that leads one to 
commit sin, it is fate, wine, anger, dice (gambling) and 
thoughtlessness '. In Rg. X 34 a gambler laments over his 
own frailty. Therefore, all that can be reasonably attempted 
is temperance and reducing the spread of the drinking habit; 
otherwise new and greater evils not contemplated in the ardour 
for suppression emerge. Vide p. 1338 above for the warning 
given against startling changes based on Mr. Aldous Huxley's 
words. Another faddist attempt at improving morals by 
legislation is the recent Act prohibiting dowries, which came into 
force on first July 1961. The giving or taking or abetting the 
giving or taking of'dowry or demanding a dowry directly or 
indirectly from the parents or guardians of a bride or bridegroom 
is punishable with imprisonment extending to six months or with 
fine extending to five thousand rupees or with both. The definition 
of dowry punishable 16 * 1 under the Act is rendered practically 
nugatory by the explanation that presents made at the time or 
a marriage to either party to the marriage in the form of cash, 
ornaments, clothes or other articles shall not be > deemed to ta 
dowry within the meaning of the section unless they are made 
as consideration for the marriage of the said parties. This, 
instead of relieving the parents of marriageable girta from b 
payment of a dowry, would give rise to blackmail on the part o 
W bodies in the town or the v.llage of the parties. If his latter

Starting of Village Panchayats 1677 

Article 40 of the Constitution calls upon the State to 
organize village Panchayats and to endow them with the powers 
and authority necessary to enable them to function as units of 
self-government In ancient and medieval times, village 
Panchayats played an important part Under the British this 
system ( which trained people in democratic functions on a small 
scale ) was practically done away with Now after about two 
hundred years the present Government wants to revive 
Panchayats. In the different States of India village Panchayat 
Acts have been passed Until a large percentage of village; s 
become educated, self-reliant and men of character, the village 
Panchayats cannot function as the foundations of real democracy. 
It is very likely that either the dominant castes or the leading 
families or the bullies ( gwndas ) in the village will capture 
the village Panchayats and use them for their own benefit 
A recent book ' Panchay t-i-raj ' by Shri S. A. Dey ( published 
by Asia Publishing House, 1961 ) paints a very roseate picture of 
Panchayats functioning in the 550 thousand villages of India. 
It all depends on disinterested workers of high character, other- 
wise this project will meet the same fate that overtook Brayne's 
work in Gurgaon after Brayne left. 

Some people took it into their heads to decide that agri- 
cultural land should belong to him who tilled it. Therefore in 
Bombay and some other States legislation was enacted, first 
holding that he who tilled another's land for six years was to be 
regarded as a ' protected tenant ' ( i. e. practically a permanent 
tenant ); later on the owner was prohibited from selling the land 
to a non-agriculturist and ultimately( by Bombay Act. LXVII of 
1948, sec 32 ) the tenant was made the owner, being liable to pay 
to the original owner tha price fixed by the Eevenue authorities 
spread over twelve yearly instalments. Whatever may be the 
case in Zamindaris, in the Deccan and some South Indian States 
the Ryotwari system prevails and persons belonging to the lower 
middle class purchased lands at high prices { not getting more 
than three or four percent as rent on the monev invested ) as 
land was deemed a stable investment. The present author 
having been a practising lawyer for forty-frve years known 
personally thousands of village people. In nLy ca^aittonS 
four or five years have passed away, the Revenue aulhoXs 
have no yet decided the prices of tfa elands over which ownershin 
of erstwh.le tenants has been declared. Most of the «stwS a 
tenant, ( now become owners ) have not paid a pie £ fffjS£ 



1678 History of Dluzrmalastra I Sec. X, Ch. XXXVil 

and the real owners have heen robbed of the benefit to be derived 
from the price, if paid. Supposing Government was solicitous of 
increasing production by making tenants owners tbere is no 
reason why Government should not have recovered the price or 
instalments as a revenue demand. There is no judicial probe in 
the ordinary courts of law, the appeal lies only to the Govt ( that 
means to the Collector ), no owner is entitled to engage a pleader 
( sec 80 A ) and very complicated provisions are made if the 
former tenant fails to pay each instalment But the present 
state of things is sheer spoliation and looks like robbing Peter to 
pay Paul and is a sample of what democracy might mean to 
people of the lower middle class. There is no evidence that by 
these measures production of food grains has greatly increased. 
But Congressmen are complacent because they know that in the 
elections the vast majority of illiterate agriculturists who are 
to benefit by such legislation will cast their votes in favour of 
' oxen * adopted as symbol by the Congress party. Many States 
have introduced by legislation ceilings in land holdings, viz no 
man or family is to hold more then 48 acres of dry land and no 
more than 24 acres of irrigated land. Even agriculturists have 
now begun to grumble and to ask why no ceilings are placed on 
the accumulation of wealth, when they see rich people flaunting 
their wealth in cars eighteen or twenty feet in length, obstructing 
narrow roads and causing serious casualties 2 " 2 Most people 
complain that the poor are getting poorer and the rich richer

What is Socialistic pattern of society 1679 

am quite convinced it would not be India, then it "would be 
something else. I do not want that to happen, even though I 
want India to take up modem scientific techniques, scientific 
theories, economic theories, economic organizations. I accept 
all that to the extent it is good for India. It is for us to choose. 
I do not rule out any-thing but I rule out being uprooted from 
India'. 

"What is ordinarily ment by ' Social ism ' is collective farming, 
tbe abolition of the private ownership of the means of production 
and State Industrialization. Merely saying that the land should 
go to the tiller and carrying out that by legislation is simply 
robbing one person to benefit another. It is a long way off from 
that to socialist farming which would make the ti'ler a landless 
worker on the collective farm. 

It is often said that ours is a ' Welfare State ' and that what 
is aimed at is ' a socialistic pattern of society '. The Constitution 
does not employ these very words. But Ait 38 appears in 
substance to mean that India would be a Welfare State, as it 
provides * The State shall stnve to promote the welfare of the 
peoplebj securing and protecting as effectively as it may a social 
order in which justice, social, economic, political, shall inform all 
the institutions of the national life.' In the report of the 
Planning Commission on the 2nd Five Year Plan ( which was 
accepted by the Government) the meaning of 'socialistic 
pattern of society * is set out as follows : 2S!4 

The task bafore an underdeveloped country is not merely to 
get better results within the existing framework of economic 
and social institutions, but to mould and refashion these so that 
they contribute effectively to the realisation of wider and deeper 
social values. These values or basic objectives have recently 
been summed up in the phrase 'socialist pattern of society' 
Essentially this means • that the basic criterion for determining 
™Vtw£ ad ^ ncemuEtnofcbB P^ate profit, but social gain 
and that the pattern of development and the structure of >=ocio- 

TnZZJ t t° n sbould be so planned that *»* ^ a°£3r

of peroemng and participating in the immense poSuSS 
growth through organized effort is enabled to put in C 
the interest of a higher standard of life for himself and Lris 3 
prosperiyfor the country'. It appears from this 2 1 fl 
what follows that 'socialist pattern of society' is not to be 
regarded as some rigid or fixed pattern. It is not rooted in any 
dootrme or dogma. 

A booklet published by Sriman Narayan for the All India 
Congress Committee ( 2nd ed. of 1956, New Delhi ) embodies the 
notable speeches of the Prime Minister pandit Jawaharlal 
.Nehru. He starts by saying that private enterprise is useful so 
far as our country is concerned, that we wish to encourage it, 
but the dominance which private enterprise had throughout the 
world during a certain period is no more and that for a planner 
it has now a secondary place. Later on ( p. 2 ) he states that he 
uses the word * socialistic picture of society ' as meaning lurqely 
that the means of production should be socially owned oi controlled 
for the benefit of society as a whcle. On p. 12 he says 
( at Avadi Session ) * we have laid down that certain basic 
industries must necessarily be state-owned and there are other 
industries we should try to encourage the State to start. Theplon 
is an integrated whole and in that integrated whole the publio 
and private sector must also be integrated. They are not rival 
shows,' On p. 19 he says ' The national aim is a welfai e state and 
a socialistic economy.' ' Finance is important, but not so 
much as people think ' ' What is important is trained personnel. 
The only thing we have to guard against is inflation. Inflation 
is avoided if there is production corresponding to the money 
thrown in '. ( p 20 ). ' Everyone in the country should have (ho 
primary things of life like food, clothing, housing, education, 
sanitation, medical help, employment, work ' ( p. 27 ). ' The 
objectives of India's Planning should be socialistic pattern of 
sooiety It cannot be achieved by mere legislation, but it is «l 
a question of planning' (pp. 30-31). 'Both Congress and 
Parliament have said that we want a socialistic pattern o 
societv. Why ham we used this vague language ? Tf e hive dem 



Vague language about Somaltstt c paltei n 1681 

so deliberately because we do not want to commit out selves to any 
rigid fo?rinda' (p. 55). 'India wants a social revolution by 
peaceful means, peaceful methods, by mutual agreement, by 
working together. Hard work is the only way to progress.' 
Russia had to use force to do in 20 ot 25 years what England did 
in 100 years (pp. 60-66). 

These quotations taken from the speeches of the Prime 
Minister clearly establish that he doe3 not want a totalitarian 
communism in India. He appears to favour a democratic 
socialistic pattern. But he himself admits that vague language 
about socialistic pattern has been deliberately used and that his 
idea is to build up in India by trial and error a soTt of democratic 
socialism. But there is great danger in this. The present 
author is not aware of any large country in the world where a 
democratic socialistic pattern purposely clothed in vague 
language has been tried and succeeded. The language being 
vague and no defininite procedure being chalked out, a 
socialistic pattern would mean all things to all men and the 
socialistic pattern of society is vague enough to allow diverse 
interpretations. 

Russia and China have been and aie under totalitarian 
socialism In Soviet Russia under Lenin and Stalin peasants, 
working men and intellectuals became statesmen and military 
commanders, the old economic principle of supply and demand 
was replaced by central control of all commercial relations, of 
all production and distribution among the large populations of 
Russia spread over vast areas, individualistic agriculture gave 
place to huge co-operative farms managed under the directives 
of the State, aristocracy and democracy were abolished and 
dictatorship of a party that monopolized all power emerged. Our 
loaders appear to have borrowed the ideas of co-operative farming 
and the State control of production and distribution of several 
commodities from the Russian example, but the present writer 
is afraid that without the coercive methods employed by 
dictators like Stalin, out experiments will not in a measurable 
pariod of time load to the results desired and expected by our 
loaders.

What appears to the present author 1b that our country is to 
have a mixed economy, in which private and publio enterprise 
are supposed to work together to narrow the disparity or gulf 
between a small minority of hares and a vast multitude of 
have-nots For example, Atomic energy, Railways, iron and 
steel, aircraft, ship-building are among Government industries, 
while the private sector is to be concerned with the manufacture 
of textiles, cement, alluminium, machine tools, chemicals and 
pharmaceuticals &o. 

The present writer does not think that he is competent 
enough to criticize the means and methods that are being 
adopted by the leaders of the country and to say whether they 
are enough to meet the high promises made and tlie hopes raised 
by certain Articles in the Constitution such as 39 ( part o of 
which declares that the citizens have the right to an adequate 
means of livelihood), 41 (providing for securing the right to 
work, to education and to public assistance in cases of un-emplw- 
merit, old age, siclcness and disablement), 43 (the State shall 
endeavour to secure to all workers, agricultural, industrial or 
otherwise, work, a hving wage, decent standard of life and full 
enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural opportum ties ); 
vide Articles 45 and 47 already quoted above (on pp. 1669, lb») 

But he will say a few words. The mass of ^""f** 

kept at a high level of self-sacrifice, great idea s and hard work 

for long. A dynamic and revered leader like Buddha may 

succeed for a time in securing this. But when He P~ "«* 

there is gradually a relapse into cond tions ™ ton wh

about Bhumidana at 'fifty million acres but he got only about five 
million acres, half of which are not arable. Now the emphasis 
has shifted to ' Sarvodaya \ Shri Jayaprakash Narayan, 
who was first a Marxist out and out, then joined the P. S. 
Party, is now advocating the principles of ' Sarvodaya ' in 26a 
' Towards a new society ' published by Mr. Prahhakar Padbye 
foT the Congress for cultural freedom ( New Delhi, 1958 ). 
Sarvodaya planning seems to be based on the assumption that 
a radical change in human behaviour and attitude to work and 
property will take place on a large scale without coercion. 
There is hardly any basis for any such assumption at present. 
The Prime Minister himself admits ( vide p 240 of Prof V. K. 
P.. V. Kao's paper in ' Changing India ' ) that adequate motives 
and inducements have to be provided. The Indian Government 
mora than any other purely democratic country in the world has 
extended the scope of public administration to embark oh 
the production and distribution of economic goods while keeping 
at the same time full Parliamentary democracy. Gandhiji also 
called upon the millionaires to hold their vast fortunes in 
trusteeship One should like to know the names of even a dozen 
millionaires in India that dealt with their wealth like trustees 
even in Gandhiji's lifetime.

objectives of the planners are stated on i. J 'ti^iA

margin of poverty, the claims of social justice, the right to work 
Of equal opportunity and of a minimum level of living h™ 
great urgency'. On p 48 the principal aims are further elabora! 
ted and it is stated on p. 49 that the first priority belongs to 
agriculture and therefore the total outlay provided is 1718 crores 
of rupees as against 950 crores in the Second Plan and fertilisers 
to the extent of 800,000 tons are provided for as against 110 000 
tons in the 2nd Plan. 

Our country's great handicap is population and food produc- 
tion. Statistics for the growth of population 26 " are ' (m 
millions ) . 1901 ( 235 5 ), 1911 ( 349 ), 1921 { 248.1 ), 1931 ( 275 5) 
1941 ( 314.8 ), 1951 ( 356.9 ), 1961 ( 438 ). This indicates that by 
about 1966-1967 the population of our country may be about 480 
millions. Article 39a ( referred to on p. 1666 ) requires the State 
to direct its policy towards securing that every citizen has the 
right to an adequate means of livelihood. Our country has been 
an agricultural country from time immemorial, yet we have to 
import millions of tons of wheat and other grain for feeding 
our large population The finance minister in his speech on 
the Budget for 1961-62 states ( p 79 para 36 ) that in May 1961 
an agreement under P. L 480 was signed by ludia's minister 
with the TJ. S A for the import in four years of 18 million tons 
of wheat, ona million tons of rice and also certain quantities of 
maize, cotton, tobacco and soya bean oil This is -the 
biggest agricultural commodities agreement ever Bigned between 
two countries. There were four previous agreements commencing 
fiom August 1956 but they were all on a lesser scale. The fifth 
agreement of May 1960 was for agricultural commodities worth 
1369.8 million dollars ( = 655.8 crores of rupees ). The average 
intake of food in India is below the nutritional standards laid 
down by scientists. Ours is one of the poorest countries in the

These figures show that in Ceylon the per capita income is 
double that of India, in Japan it is four times as much and in 
Germany over twelve times that of India. Both Germany and 
Japan were devastated by the 2nd World War and yet the 
people of both countries have in less than 15 yeaTS improved so 
much in production that both are giving substantial assistance 
to India. Our people and leaders should deeply ponder over 
this state of things and should strain every nerve in an all out 
effort to improve the country's lot instead of talking and mutual 
bickerings. 

While these pages weTe passing through the Press, the 
author got a copy of ' India *s Food Crisis and steps to meet it ' ' 
which is a report ( of 254 pages ) made in 1959 by a Ford 
"Foundation Team of thirteen American Technicians and 
agriculturist specialists at the invitation of two Indian Mini- 
sters of Food and Agriculture and Community Development and 
co-operation It is a very important document, discusses seventy

between supphes and target will be 28 million tons by 1985-66, 
this would ha 25 per cant shortfall in terms of need and that no 
conceivahle programme of imports or rationing would meet a 
crisis of this magnitude ( pp 3-4 ). The report suggests several 
emergency measures and measures to be carried on over a long 
period, which cannot be set out here. It stresses the need for 
research in agricultural economics. It recommends (p. 11) 
that the entire nation must be made aware of the impending 
food crisis and steps must be taken to meet it and wains that 
adequate supplies of food are essential to the survival of 
democracy. Two short-comings of the report may be pointed 
out. It does not tell us what funds would be required for 
research and for implementing the numerous other suggestions 
it makes. Besides, it says nothing about the birth rate in 
India and measures to curb the phenomenal rise in population. 

According to U. N. Demographic YeaT book (August 1960 ) 
there are about 2900 million people in the world. More than 
half of the world's inhabitants live in four countries viz. Ohina 
(669 millions), India (438 millions), Soviet Union (209 
millions ), TJ. S. A ( 178 millions ). Population growth depends 
upon the birth rate and the death rate. Owing to scientific 
discoveries, epidemics or such diseases as malaria, typhoid, 
cholera, influenza are either eliminated or brought under control 
and therefore the death rate tends to be lower and lower, it » 
the birth rate that has to be controlled. The following ; tab a 
for comparative birth rate and death rate m 195? for eight 
countries is interesting :

ComparcUhe bii ih rates and death rates 1687 

This table shows that the birth rate in our country is not 
very high or abnormal and the death rate is also similar to that 
of such progressive countries as France and "D. 31. Many 
Western countries have no definite population policy at Govt, 
level. But the case of our country is entirely different. Our 
country has already a huge population, most of which is on the 
margin of subsistence level. Supposing that by means of our 
two Five Tear Plans the national income in the ten years 
( 1951-1S61 ) increased 30 percent, the growth of population in 
the same period would come to about 32 percent, so that most 
of the additional wealth produced would be eaten up by the new 
mouths that have to be fed and the standard of living of the 
average Indian would practically remain the same. Therefore, 
the main problem that faces the Government, the planners and 
the people is how to oontiol the large growth of population. 
Population control will not solve all the problems of our country, 
but our other problems will not be solved without solving that 
problem. The Government of India and the Planners had no well 
thought policy about the control of population. Government 
appears to lay far more emphasis on industrialization and 
agricultural production than on population control. In the first 
Five Year Plan only 65 lakhs of rupees were allocated to the 
schemes of population control, in the 2nd Five Year Plan the 
allocation was raised to five crores The Planning Commission 
has now realized the gravity of the problem of the enormous 
growth of Indian population, has provided 50 crores of rupees m 
the Third Plan for the various schemes of population control 
( vide pp 676 ff of Third Five Year Plan ) In the whole world 
about 100 people are born every minute, about 6000 persons 
every hour, about 140,000 every day and about five crores every 
year This problem of the phenomenal growth of ' population 
overshadows m urgency and importance almost every problem 
of the contemporary world, much more so of India Very little 
is being done to control systematically the terrific growth of 
numbers. Sweden in the early 19th century was fpoverty!

some kindly soul took compassion on women and made the 
blessing to bo * of eight sons '. The Mahabharata said that a 
sonless man does not reach blessed worlds ( heaven &o ). By the 
birth of a son the father was deemed to have discharged his debt 
to his ancestors and the water and pindas ( balls of cooked rice ) 
offered by tbe son to his deceased father and other deceased 
ancestors were supposed to be of great efficacy for the peace of the 
departed souls. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 560-61, 799 and above 
p. 1626 This importance of a son or sons is believed to this day 
by almost all illiterate or educated people in India except a few 
men and women of advanced views Educated brides sometimes 
request that the old mode of blessing for eight sons should not be 
followed, Therefore, in such cases the formula has to be ohanged 
to ' may you have as many sons as you desire '. The Smrfcis lay- 
down that the husband has to cohabit with the wife after the 
first few days of her monthly illness and that he incurred the sin 
of embryo murder if he refused to do so without good cause. Vide 
H, of JDb. Vol. II pp. 570-71 and note 1327. The Markandeya 
Purana ( Chap 14. 5-6 ) goes a little further and gives a eloiy 
in which the husband who neglected this owing to his partiality 
for another charming wife had to undergo torments of hell. The 
present high prices of the neoessaries of life induce many people 
to limit families by various devices. The Planning Commission 
is going to try various measures such as intensive education, 
provision of facilities and advice on the largest scale possible, 
providing family planning services at 1864 rural and 330 urban 
medical and health centres, numbers of sterilization centres, 
opening 6100 clinics in rural areas and 2100 in urban areas ( in 
2nd Plan only 549 urban and 1100 rural clinics ), distribution of 
simple contraceptives, research programme to more effective 
contraceptives etc. The 3rd Plan reports that in the 2nd Han 
period 135000 sterilization operations were carried out (p. bTBor 
Third Plan). The present author is not an expert m these 
2£T«J so will content himself by V****£™

Birth control by contraceptives etc, 1689 

West Europe, North America, Japan exclusively by the well-to- 
do type of people. The same might happen in India. The most 
serious objection against contraceptives is that they will lead to 
immorality and encourage promiscuity in both sexes. Gandhiji 
in his ' Self-restraint versus self-indulgence ' ( 3rd. ed., 1928 ) 
Btatad that so faT as India is concerned there is no case for 
contraceptives ( p. 3 ) and advised self-restraint. But he might 
have changed his opinion if he had been alive today. To advise 
poor people to practise self restraint, when most of them live in 
hovels of one room or two rooms, who are uneducated and have 
no ambitions and pass life in abject poverty, sounds to them as 
a huge joke. The well-to-do have many interests in life and 
several outlets for their energy but for the poor there are very 
few. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister in his 
' Autobiography ' ( 1936 ) strongly criticizes Gandhiji's praise of 
poverty, suffering and ascetic life as utterly wrong, harmful 
and impossible of achievement ( p 510 ) and regards Gandhiji's 
attitude to sex as extraordinary ( p. 512 ). 

Dr. Radhakrishnan in * Religion and Society ' ( published 
in 1947 ) concedes (p. 189) that the use of contraceptives cannot 
be altogether forbidden, quotes Dawson to the effect that birth 
control by abstention is either ineffective or, if effective, 
pernicious (p. 90), that objections to birth control by contra^ 
captives are due to their abuse and that in the present conditions 
facilities for birth control must be available, especially to poorer 
classes (p. 191). Contraceptives would have to be harmless to 
use, cheap, easy to use and absolutely reliable. The anthor is 
not sure if there are contraceptives of this type. Japan, a small 
country of islands, was compelled by the rapid growth of popu- 
ation to legalise abortions. Vide « Aggression and Population • 
by F James Dawson (London, 1946) for a tLonghtful book on 
how to check worldwxde growth of population. A thoughtful and 
exhaustive work is 'Population and planned parenthood in

population studies, Madras ( revised Edition of 1961 ).

The two five year plans have given our leaders a certain 
mastery over the situation and some confidenoe abut the 
future. But Mr. Fanda has to admit that the produ- 
ctivity and level of efficiency aie very low. foreign aid raises 
difficult questions as to how to match it with an adequate 
mobilization of domestic resources. The mass of people are 
poverty-stricken, have a low standard of living and therefore 
can save little. High prices, which is a concomitant of develop- 
ment plans in all countries, are making common people 
discontented. 

Foreign assistance runs into thousands of croreB of rupees, 
nearly half of which comes from U. S. A. The United States 
Information Service has prepared a detailed statement of 
assistance to India for ten years from June 1951 to 4th August 
1961 and circulated it to many Indians from which some striking 
figures are quoted here. A statement brought up only to Juno 30 
of 1961 gives slightly smaller numbers as compared with the 
statement given below which brings up the figures up to 4tti 
August 1961,

exchange earnings or the export of goods from India. Eighty 
peroentofU.S loans to India up to Aug. 4,1961 (21921 million 
dollars) are repayable in rupaes i. e. that portion of the loans 
is not so inconvenient as the loans repayable m dollars are. 

On p 110 of Third Pive Year Plan the foreign exchange 
requirements are put down at 2030 crores of Es. for plan projects. 
But there are other general needs of the economy by way of raw 
materials, components, replacement machinery to be provided for. 
It is estimated that Rs. 3800 crores over the five years would 
be not too high. On p. 114 it is stated that the total assistance 
for the Third Plan assured by foreign countries is 3286 million 
dollars ( Es 1089 crores) out of which the USA has agreed to 
provide 1045 million dollars ( just under half of the total foreign 
assistance), West Germany 425 million dollars, TJ. K. 250 
million dollars, Japan 80 million dollars, and small sums by

It is not necessary to go into other details. The loans are 
repayable at different dateB, some being repayable in forty years 
and some carrying a very low rate of interest. It may, however, 
be noted that out of about 4000 million dollars aid to India since 
Independence over half has been in the form of P. L. 480 Pood 
for commodities. The Food Minister of India, Mr. S. K. Patil, 
assures us, however, that India would become completely self- 
sufficient in food by the end of the Third Five Year Plan and 
points out that during the last decade, f oodgrain production in 
India rose from 50 to 80 million tons a year, an increase of 60 
per cent. But it should not be forgotten that the population of 
India in the same ten years increased by about 22 per cent over 
the population in 1951. 

The Welfare State theoretically aims at (Sarvodaya) 
prosperity for all ( at least for the vast majority ). Up fc recent 
times, the main obligations of the State towards its people were

and its coast against aggression or invasion, maintenance of law

for the State and Government haB assumed power to regulate 
production, to control distribution and to fix even the prices of 
som© commodities absolutely necessary to all men in daily life. It 
has also established the State Trading Corporation. Taxation has 
become an ever-increasing instrument of economic polioyfor 
carrying out the plan projects. Apart from the income-Tax 
Act ( XI of 1922 recently consolidated by Act 43 of 1961 ) our 
democratic Government passed one after another four Acta, viz. 
the Estate Duty Act ( XXXIV of 1953 ), the Wealth Tax ( XXVT 
of 1957 ), the Expenditure Tax ( XXIX of 1957 ) and the Gift 
Tax (XVHI of 1958). There is no other country in the 
world that has all the above five taxes. Is India the only 
welfare country in the world ? There is a sense of uncertainty 
and fright in the middle olasses and tax dodging in the rich or 
influential seotions of the oommunity. Reasons of space prevent 
the citing of illustrations of the arbitrary oharaoter of the recent 
four Acts. In all these Acts the opinions of the Govt, offioera 
(viz. Gift Tax officer, expenditure tax officer, and wealth 
tax officer and higher officers ) in an executive ladder under 
the same Acts on questions of fact ( such as the value of 
a property ) are final and oannot be questioned in any court of 
justice ( i. e. in a subordinate judge's court or district judge's 
court or High Court ). If a creditor releases a debtor from his 
debts ( wholly or partly ) the creditor will have to pay gift tas 
on the debt released if the gift tax officer is of opinion that be 
could have recovered the debt by means of legal steps. No man 
can make a gift of more than 100 rupees at one time to a 
private person or even a near relative ( except to his wife ) and 
if he makes several gifts to the same person in one year 
exceeding five hundred rupees he will have to pay gift tax. In 
all oases of questions of fact one appeal should have been 
allowed bo a distriot court or where the amount conoerned was 
more than ten thousand rupees to the High Court. It should be 
recognized by policy-makers that our people have great faitb 
in the integrity of the High Courts and the distriot judges who 
are selected by the High Courts and whose promotion does not 
depend on the Executive. They have not muoh faith in Hj B 
fairness and integrity of Appellate Commissioners and Tribunate 
that are appointed by the Ministers, when the dispute is between 
private persons and taxing authorities on behalf of Government. 
Writers on the constitutions of countries have for many year 
emphasized two leading features viz. the *°™ ias »/i2 
Parliament and the rule of law. Parliaments are cajoled mw

Moat common pepople in India nave a very vague notion 
of ^socialism means. They believe ; that socalism ib based 
onMarcfem.** Mars holdB that revolution is the > weapon or 
„ by which the workers are to seize power, that his theory

IS he was no • Marxist ' ( vide • Naked God ' p. 3 by Howard

explained by Dr. Radhakrishnan as meaning that he was not 
pledged to the acceptance of a doctrine final, complete and 
oppressive { vide ' Religion and Society,' 1947, p. 35 ) This 
is not the place to discuss the premises and predictions^* Marx. 
But a few words may be said here. Mars had predicted that 
communism would prevail first in the most developed and 
industrialized nations. What happened is quite the opposite of 
this. Communism occurred in countries like Russia and, China 
that ware relatively very much less developed and industrialized. 
Another of his predictions was that the system of private 
ownership would make the rich richer and the poor poorer, would 

2652. Vide ' New Despotism * by Lord Chief Justice Hewart ( Earnest

R. S W. Pollard in « Conscience and liberty • ( Allen and TJnwin, London, 

1910) Vide also "Bureaucracy triumphant * by C. K, Allen ( London, 

1931 ). AH these taxing enactments have created a high ladder of officers 

appointed by the executive. For example, under the Wealth Tax Act there is, 

Erst the Wealth Tax Officer who decides -what tax is payable, then there 

is an appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner ( Sec. 23 }, then 

there is a further appeal to the Appellate Tribunal (Sec. 24), then there 

can be a reference to the High Court on a point of law (Sec. 27-28) 

and finally an appeal to the Supreme Court (Sec 29)/ This is 

sheer harassment and practical denial of justice. After a pr« ate person 

has run to three different officers or official bodies then only the High Court 

comes in, if at all, and that too on a point of law It should be remembered 

that the wealth tax officer has often to determine the value of properties 

worth lalhs of rupees and on points of fact there arc appeals only to the 

Erst officer's superiors and there is no provision for a probe of facts by a 

court or judicial officer independent of the executive. A similar procedure 

is provided in the Gift Tax, the Expenditure Tax and Estate Duty Tax.

breed ruinous depressions and in the end the angry proletariat 
would revolt, would overthrow the exploiting classes and 
establish a communist society. This second prophecy has not 
materialized in almost all highly industrialized nations. On 
the contrary, several democratic States have provided security 
against unemployment, sickness and old age and in some 
countries employers have admitted representatives of workera 
into the management of industries. The 'Communist Manifesto' 
is the official Bible in the U. S. S. E, A recent work ' The 
'Anatomy of the Soviet man ' by Glaus Mehnert, translated from 
German by Maurice Eosenbaum ( 1961 ), appears to the present 
author to contain a balanced and fair estimate of the working of 
Communism in U. S. S. E, He points out that the deBite to 
rise socially and amass wealth and power is as common to the 
Soviet Union as to the rest of the world ( p. 84 ), that the New 
Class does not constitute a bourgeoisie in the West European 
sense, that it is a State bourgeoisie, all members work for the 
State and are dependent on it ( p. 73 }, that social distinctions are 
greater in IT. S. S. E. than in U. S. A. ( p. 109 ), that the greatest 
disproportion prevails between the incomes of Academicians, 
artists and writers on the one hand and ordinary men and 
workers on the other. It appears to the present author that 
Communism has so far been the best means for the exploitation 
of the proletariat. 

No great Indian leader of the present day has offered a luoid

and non-violence are not mentioned in our Constitution, though 
these were the basic principles from Upanisad and Smiti times 
( as in Chandogya HL 17.4, Manu X 63, Yaj 1.123) and for 
Gandhiji by whom all Congressmen and their leaders swear. 
Lands of thousands of men of the middle class of small means 
were taken away from them by changing the fundamental right 
to property bestowed by Art 31 (as originally enacted), by 
preventing recourse to law courts and by giving illusory hopes of 
some compensation not yet even determined after several years. 
This may not be liquidation of opponents, yet it is a cruel thing 
all the same in the name of democracy and Welfare State. 2653 

Borrowing in the country itself and from foreign countries 
has been resorted to on an increasing scale. 

Table 3 above ( p. 1689-00 ) will convey some idea of the vast 
amounts of debts our country owes and will owe to U. S. A. and 
other countries. How and in how many years the nation will 
be able to pay back these debts with interest is to ordinary men a 
source of grave anxiety and an insoluble problem. Among the 
sources for the plan are included Provident Funds, Post Office 
savings bank accounts, National Flan Certificates &c. These 
are really debts, though not demandable on any one date or 
year. Dafioit financing which did not form part of the central 
budget in past years has now become a regular item. The 
budget of the central Govt, for 1961-63 exceeds 1023 crores. 
For 1963-63 the revenues are estimated at 1339.87 crore3 of

of the Planning Commission, Government of India, New Delhi, 1960. 
People are likely to make a confusion between • Welfare State • and 
* Social Welfare • The latter phrase refers to more specialized work for 
the weak or more vulnerable sections of the population ( snch as women

mentally retarded, scheduled castes and tribes and. backward classes ) A 
Welfare State wants to change the pattern of life of the whole community or

rupees and bbe expenditure at 1381.65 orores of rupees and it is 
announced that a total deficit of about 150 crores would have 
to be met partly by additional taxation of 60 crores and 80 
lakhs of rupees. It must be remembered that most of these 
taxes are indirect and the major part of the income from such* 
taxes iB due to levies on articles of everyday necessity to 
common people who are already groaning under high prices of 
absolutely necessary commodities. The Bombay Government's 
Budget for 19G2-63 intended to tax the poor man's bidts and gtir 
( jaggery). About 7000 crores were put in the State sector in the 
1st and 2nd Plan projects and 7500 crores are proposed to be spent 
in the Public sector in the 3rd plan period. Thus at the end of the 
3rd Plan ( in 1965-66 ) Government will have spent about 15000 
orores of rupees. Tremendous power will be concentrated in the 
hands of ministers and the official bureaucracy. It is not 
generally known how Government has dealt with or will deal 
with this vast amount, what projects have been undertaken, 
which of them are oompleted, the cost of the completed projeofcs, 
yearly yield from the projects that are completed, steps that are 
being taken to repay debts and to what extent. There are 
fervent appeals made by leaders to common people to co-operate 
with Govt, but the Govt, does not seem to be anxious to take 
people into confidence by widely circulating through newspapers, 
press-notes or otherwise information on the above mentioned 
matters. The vast suma spent on projects have caused inflation. 
Besides, during the two five year Plans population increased by 
77 millions. This accentuated the problem of unemployment 
and on p. 47 of the book above referred to it is admitted that at 
the end of 10 years the backlog of unemployment is estimated at 
nine millions,

Dangei s of recent public admtnislt ation 1699 

One last word before taking leave of the subjects of 
Democracy, Welfare State, Socialistic pattern, legislation, 
planning for social and economic reconstruction. In the new 
set-up public administrators have become the brains behind 
the production of economic goods. They have, however, to do 
in the new sphere work which is entirely different from their 
traditional work in the Government of former times. 
Production activity in modern days demands bringing together 
and co-ordinating various skills and complex tasks to which 
administrators in Gevt. offices are often strangers. How far 
they will be able to accomplish the new tasks undertaken by 
them is a matter which admits of no certain answer. But the 
most perplexing and baffling question is : Can all-comprehenBive 
national plans under which the State either owns or controls most 
aspects of economic activities in Agriculture, Industry and 
Trade be implemented democratically by Parliamentary control ? 
The present author is very much afraid that the combination 
of economic and political power in the hands of a few ministers, 
high ranking officials and politicians would be so overpowering 
as to reduce the present Parliament ( based on universal adult 
suffrage, only 23 percent of the population being literate) to a 
mere shadow and may in some respects at least narrow the 
liberties of men almost as much as the totalitarian State does. 

Let us now turn to the reform and reorganization of Hindu 
Society and religion. The Portuguese came to India towards 
the end of the 15th century and acquired some territory on the 
Western coast of India. But owing to religious intolerance 
and persecution by them not much impression was made by 
them on Hindu society. But the case was different with the 
British, who did not imitate the Portuguese in the matter of 
religion, but wanted trade, wealth and power. On account of 
the British rule established over a large part of India from 1765 
A. D. Indians came in contact with modern English literature 
and modern science. The earliest Indian reformer in modem 
times was a Bengali, Raja Bam Mohan Boy ( 1772-1833 ) He

Social Reform ' by S. Natarajan ( Asia Publishing House

India ' ( Macmillan, 1917 ), W. T. de Bary's ' Sources of Indian 
Tradition \ New York, 1958 ( pp. G04-659 ). 

There is a great ferment of ideas in India at present. Many 
of our countrymen, whether young or old, do not derive any 
inspiration from their religion. It is not the fault of religion, 
hut the fault lies with ua and our predecessors who did not ano 
do not exhibit to us the core of our culture and religion, do not 
sift the essentials and separate them from the unessential 
accretions due to superstitions and wrong emphasis. Ordinary 
men of to-day feel bewildered by the disagreements between 
scientific knowledge and the traditional beliefs. The result is 
that traditional values and codes of conduct are disintegrating 
and various views are being bandied about. There are now 
several distinct thought-forms on matters religious or spiritual. 
One class calls itself sanntaras whose view is that the traditional 
codes of conduct and beliefs were established by the all-wiBB 
sages of old and therefore modern half-baked reformers have no 
light at all to introduce changes in them. There is another 
class (allied to these) of those who have studied such 
modern sciences as eugenics and biology, who oppose change on 
the ground that our traditions embodied in the caste system and 
the restrictive rules about marriage are most scientific and no 
change should be made in them and if made disaster will follow. 
There is another class of people who say ' why do you quarrel 
with us ? Time will bring about all necessary changes . Inere 
are other people who go to the other extreme and deny the 
existence of any divine or spiritual realities and values i» * 
world Some believe in the efficacy of laws to introduce dasirea 
'-changes. There are people who say ' take the essential values 
of Indian culture as foundation and build thereon a structure , m 
keeping with the needs of the times'. Hinduism has atoys 
I Rowing and changing traditions ( vide for ****£%

Sent parts of India. India, being always divided into many 

kingdoms before the advent of the British, there did not exist any 

legislative authority that could pass laws for the whole of India. 

Ancient and medieval Dharmasastoa writers held the viewtuat 

the kinghad no authority to interfere with Sastric rules governing 

van*, and castes. Vide H. of Dh. vol. HI PP. 98-101 for the 

proposition that there was almost total absence of legislative 

power in the king according to Dharmasastra writers. Changes 

in practices andbelief s, however, did take place, but it was learned 

commentators that by various devices tried to support changes 

that had already taken place (vide pp. 1267-1273 above). There 

are really three well-marked classes of people, viz. Sanatams or 

no-ohangers, the iconoclasts and those who waat a synthesis of 

the old and the new. 

Thequestion is what should be conserved or discarded from the 
old practices and what new ideals or values should be added and 
assimilated. Reasons of space forbid saying much about values 
here. Values are largely moulded by environment. Only a 
century or two ago, slavery or racial inequality and pride, 
sweating children of tender age in factories were accepted in 
Christian countries as morally neutral or at least not disrepu- 
table. But at present some of these, if not all, are generally 
condemned as immoral. In Jndia also values have changed 
from time to time. At one time animal sacrifices were quite 
reputable and of high other-worldly value. Later in the Upanisad 
times Ahinisa came to the fore. But there are certain values 
of our culture that have endured for three thousand years, viz. 
the consciousness that the whole world is the manifestation of 
the Eternal Essence, restraint of senses, charity and kindness. 
Now we are in an age of democracy and the important values of 
democracy are justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. But 
unfortunately many of those who sing paeans of democracy in 
India hanker aftBr power and are in the grip of selfishness and 
hatred. Lord Acton wrote " All power corrupts and absolute 
power corrupts absolutely." Kautilya said more than two thou- 
sand years ago that power warp3 ( intoxicates ) the mind. Vide 
H. of Dh. vol. Ill p. 114 and n. 151 for quotations . 

Many young men have in these days hardly anything 
which Ihoy believe as worth striving for whatever the cost may 
bo, nrd hence they have nothing to practise as an ideal We

women, while getting rid of superstitions and beliefs 
opposed to all soienoe and common sense. It is not the age-old 
principles of Hindu religion that are at fault, it is modern 
Hindu society that has to be reorganized, particularly when 
ours is now a democratic republic; and our leaders must make 
supreme efforts for many years to preserve equality in the midat 
of very great economic inequality, liberty which is likely to bs 
overwhelmed by mighty parties and social groups and democracy 
against demagogues on the one hand and plutocrats on the other. 

We must not shut our eyes to the peculiar and 
formidable difficulties of our country. 2651 Even the present 
India ( i. e. BhSrat ) is a vast country. There are in present 
India adherents of eight great religious systems (Hindu, 
Buddhist, Jain, Sikh, Moslem, Parsi, Christianity and Judaism), 
besides some tribes following none of these, but their own 
primitive systems; there are different States based on U 
different languages ( mentioned in the 8th schedule to the 
Constitution of India ), besides six Union territories and about 
200 recognized dialects. These are likely to produce movements 
towards oomplete provincial autonomy and cultural separation. 
There are great contrasts among the inhabitants, at one end 
the primitive tribes and the people who were untouchables and at 
the other end highly educated men and, in between the two, 
groups of illiterate people numbering at present about 77 per 
cent of the whole population. After centuries of conquests by 
alien people our country Ms gained independen ce. This op ens

Our qreal oppcnlumttesfor creative Ihmlang and loork 1703 

for us a new vista of creative thinking and work. We need not 
give up the basic principles of Hinduism, but should 
reorientate them to meet new and more complex conditions and 
work out a ohanged social order. Everybody says that what is 
wanted is an emotional integration of Indians and some have 
suggested that the caste system should be destroyed. If the 
caste system were a tangible thing it could have been easily and 
quickly destroyed. But it is not tangible. Legislation cannot 
destroy it. Only a change of heart with appropriate remedies and 
vast efforts persistently made over a long period may accom- 
plish this Herculean task and not glib talk by people that 
hardly ever practise in their lives what they preach. In the 
present author's opinion States purely on linguistio basiB 
should not have been created at all, but once it was Tesolved 
to create them, that should have been strictly adhered to 
and cleaT definite principles should have been laid down 
by the Central Government about assigning border villages to 
oneState oranother. The Central Government leadership has been 
most vacillating in this respect. For exmple, there were at least 
five different proposals put forward on Bombay City alone viz. a 
bilingual state (in which Bombay City was merged), a city 
State for Bombay alone with separate states of Gujarat and 
Maharashtra, cenfaal administration for five years, a return to 
the bilingual formula, and lastly separate Maharashtra ( inclu- 
ding Bombay City, Berar andMaTathwada ) and a separate State 
of Gujarat, with about 200 villages taken over from the 
Khandesh and Thana districts that had been part of Maharashtra 
for over one hundred years. 

The caste system, the joint family system and the laws of 
succession and inheritance that are peculiar to Hindus are really 
social matters and not religious matters at all. Our Constitution 
and recent legation deal with all the three, holding that these 
are socwl matters. As shown above, the Constitution abolished 
untouchabihty, the Hindu Marriage Act has done away wiS all 
prohibitions against marriages between persons of different 
castes and a Hmdu can have marriage relations with any 
Hindu (mcludmg Buddhist, Jain and Sikh) and can take any 
Hindu woman as spouse subject only to the mlna „f „ / 
relationship and prohibited dUes /or rnaliage TteTnt

What is wanted is not more declamations against the caste 
system and fervent appeals for emotional integration of all 
TndianB but a comprehensive code or scheme of beliefs and day 
to day conduct. The present writer cannot enter here into a 
detailed code or scheme which might require a volume by itself 
but some concrete proposals if set out here may induce more 
competent writers to give better and more exhaustive patterns 
Let there bo churning of thoughts. It is possible that in the 
beginning one may meet with formidable and fearful difficulties 
as in the mythological churning of the ocean, but let us hope that, 
even after the emergence of frightful things, the final result 
would be blissful, as in the churning of the ocean poison 
emerged but the whole effort was crowned with the appearance 
of amtla at the end. 

We must not despair of solving our difficult problems. 
Despair means destruction and death. We must not lose courage 
by the condition of our country for the last few centuries. We 
should rather look to our achievements during about three 
thousand yearB and take to heart the following advice of ancient 
Bages of the Dharmsastras such as that of Manu. Manu says 
( IV.137 ) M5S * one should not despise oneself on account of 
previous failures ; one should seek ( make efforts for securing ) 
prosperity till one's death and should not regard prosperity as 
unattainable.' To the same effect is Yaj. when he says ' One 
should never despise a learned brahmana, a serpent, a ksatriya 
( a king ) or oneself; one should desire to secure prosperity till 
one's death and should not touch ( i. e. make public ) another's 
weak points ( misdeeds &c. ) * We are over 43 crores of people, 
we are proud of the achievements of our forefathers. If we work 
hard in a concerted and intelligent effort for years with the sole 
object of bringing about the highest development of the country 
and without ambitions of securing individual profit or fame 
there is no reason why out country should not outstrip or at 
least equal other countries in the world. The Isopanisad 2 
( Vsj. S. 40.2 ) ordains for all common men ' one should wish 
to live for a hundred years, always doing here ( in this world ) 
actions ( prescribed by the ssstra ).' The Ait. Br. ( chap, 33.3 ), 
in the Btory of Sunahsepa insists on men being always active 
and emphasizes that prosperity does not come to him who does

not work hard ( nanasrantaya silrastlti). So early as the 
Rgveda ( IV. 33.11 ) it is emphasized that Gods do not befriend 
anyone who has not become tired by hard work ( na rte 
srantasya sakhyaya devah ). 

In 1934 some persons under the guidance of SwSmI 
Kevalananda SaTasvatI of Wai ( Satara District ) started a 
society which later came to be named ' DhaTmanirnaya- 
niandala' 2655 ( society for arriving at definite conclusions on 
matters of Dhaima ). The Swarm was a very learned man and 
a Sannyasin, did not know English, but he held very modern 
views. There were fourteen original founder members of whom 
the present author is one From 1934 to 1959 eleven sessions 
attended by hundreds of people were held at Thana, Poona 
(twice), Lonavla (thrice), Ahmednagar, Badalapur (Dist. 
Thana), Vardha (inBerar), Akola (inBerar), Wai and 
Bombay. At the different sessions resolutions were passed ( in 
all 82 ) on several social and religious matters and a committee 
was appointed to prepare model pmyogas (procedures) for 
Sandhya, congregational {Samudayika) prayer, upcmmjana, 
marriage, aniyesU { funeral rites ), sraddha, remarriage ( of 
widows), Te-conversion to Hinduism &c That Committee 
prepared under the guidance of Swami Kevalananda such 
prayogas shorn of unnecessary details and with translations in 
Marathi, which can be had from Mr. Kokaje of Lonavla. Among 
the resolutions the following deserve special mention • usages have 
been changed from time to time by former learned men ( sistas ) 
and the learned men of the present day have the authority to 
introduce changes in usages as the present circumstances 
may require; that the untouchabihty of the people of certain castes

Bitting in the same row with other persons of different varnas 
provided vegetarians are served vegetarian eatables; that 
Hindus including untouchables are entitled to study the Veda 
and have upanayana performed with Vedio mantras and priests 
conversant with the upanayana procedure should be ready to do 
so, if invited; if any one takes to another religion owing to 
force or fraud or of his free will and wants to revert to the 
Hindu fold he should be allowed to come in after proper 
expiation and after undergoing a simple vidhi^ 1 ; marriages 
of spouses of the same gotra and pravara should be allowed 
provided there is no bar on the ground of sapinda relationship 
(vide Hindu Marriage Act, 25 of 1955, sec. 5 items 4 and 5); 
that divorce be allowed among the castes in which it is not 
allowed at present on the ground of conversion to another 
religion of one of the spouses &c. ( almost the same grounds as 
in sec. 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 ); a Hindu widow 
succeeding as heir to her husband takes an absolute estate 
except when any of the following relatives of the husband are 
alive, viz. daughter, daughter's son, mother, father, brothen 
brothers son, paternal grand-parents, paternal first cousin ( Tide 
Hindu Succession Act, 30 of 1956 sec. 14 which goes further by 
omitting the near relatives specified above ). Most of the 
decisions mentioned above were proclaimed from ten to twenty 
years before our Constitution came into operation. 

Among the standing complaints against brshmanas one has 
been that they debarred millions of people called 'Sudras ' from 
Vedio studies. Therefore, the Mandala announced that all 
Hindus I including the so called untouchables ) should observe 
the worship of the sun, repetition of the Gayatrl-mantra ( Bg. HI. 
62.10, Tai. S. I. 5. G. 4, Va}. S. HI. 35 ) and reading or recital of 
the BhagavadgJta (whole or part) every day, since these 
common observances would help in creating the sentiment of 



2657. Vide H. of Dh Vol IV pp. 828-830 where the ' HindukaranavuJhi', 
prepared by the Dharmanirnaya-roandala for re-admission to Hinduism is 
set out in Sanskrit. This re-admiision vidht ( m Sanskrit) has been trans- 
lated into Marathi and Hindi. 



Procedures for cultural equality among Hindus 1707 

cultural equality among all Hindus. The procedure of morning 
and evening ( sandhya ) worship is brief and is quoted below. 2558 

In order to cultivate a sense of unity among all Hindus 
( including the so-called untouchables ), the Mandala prepared a 
congregational prayer ( to he recited by all Hindus in a con- 
gregation once in a month ) consisting of the following eleven 
passages culled from the Vedic literature, viz. Atharvaveda X. 
8.1, Rg X 83.3, 1 164.16, Vaj. S. 25.21, $g. X 121. 10, Tai. St. 
4.42.5, the Gayatrlmantra, Br. Up. I 3 28 (asato ma sad-gamaya, 
tamaso ma jyatir-gamaya, mrtyor masmrfcam gamaya I, Bg. X. 
191.2-4. In many villages some people tried to introduce this 
congregational prayer, but after some time most people 
complained that they found it difficult to commit to memory 
and recite the Vedic passages and requested that similar con- 
gregational prayers be prepared in Hindi and therefore the 
Mandala prepared a brief prayeT of five verses in Hindi. 

The above lines would only briefly illustrate how we would 
have to proceed if we want an emotional integration of all our 
countrymen, particularly on the social and religious plane. But 
we must not forget what the foundation of our culture and 
civilization has been throughout the past ages. Ancient sages 
laid the foundation by insisting upon this that there is and 
must be harmony between man's spirit and the spirit of the 
world and man's endeavour should be to realize in his aotions and 
in his life this harmony and unity. 2659 The TTpanisads teach 
that man gains by giving up ( by renunciation ) and exhorts man 
not to covet another's wealth (Isopanisad I « tena tyaktena 
Mmnjith.5 ma grdhah.ka B ya svid dhanam ' ).

The Bhagavadglta emphasized doing one's duty without 
hankering for the rewards thereof. Science cannot answer suoh 
fundamental questions as occur to every thoughtful perBon viz. 
what is the ultimate cause, is it brahman, what iB our origin, by 
what are we sustained, what is our destiny (goal), being 
influenced by what do we persist in paths leading to pain and 
misery ( Sv. Up. 1. 1. ). They are answered by the ancient 2460 
Upanisads, but not by science so far. 

The chief aim of Indian culture and civilization was not to 

attain military and political power over other countries and 

peoples; it neglected to organize Indians for offensive and 

defensive purposes, nor encouraged the starting of immense 

corporations for the acquisition of wealth. But in these days of 

keen competition between nations and peoples we must not only 

keep a vigilant eye on the eternal principles of our culture but 

also on the worldly happiness of our countrymen in the midst of the 

warring elements in the world. Our people often took and take to 

premature vairagya (renunciation),while Western nations and men 

have been laying for the last few centuries great store by extreme 

activity. Now that our leaders are thinking of remodelling our 

society and spirituallife they must cultivate qualities whereby 

they at least will be sthitaprajna i. e. fully developed or ideal 

souls (Bhagavadglta 11.55-68) or men of God (GltaXUX 

13-18) Social reforms and politics have to be preached 

through our age-old religion and philosophy. 26 " If a large 

majority of our people and the leaders throw away or neglec t

religion and spirituality altogether, the probability is that we 
shall lose both spiritual life and Booial betterment. This is not the 
place to say more on this point. Vide pp. 1478-79 above for the 
sound moral preparation required before one realizes the pervasion 
of everything by hraliman and pp. 1623 ff. for the proposition 
that the One Principle is variously named by sages, which taken 
together lead to universal brotherhood, kindliness and tolerance. 
Prom time immemorial all religious cults in India ( except 
Buddhismand Jainism) recognized that there was One Principle 
( or Deity of some kind ) and in the immortality of the 
soul The tremendous march of science and mastery over some 
of the forces of nature has gone to the heads of many modern 
men and made them conceited. Science can disclose to us at the 
moat secondary causes ; but it has to be silent as to the ultimate 
cause and the ultimate destiny of man. It cannot tell us what the 
purpose of life is, it cannot tell us anything about moral values. 
The present and the following generations have to be trained 
in an environment where spiritual life, love of truth, sense of and 
belief in the brotherhood of man or at least of our own country- 
men, love of peace and sympathy for the oppressed would be held 
to ba supreme virtues to be attempted by all people. 

It is most difficult to suggest in a brief space a code of 
conduct for all the millions of India. But for men of limited 
education and busy life a few suggestions by way of illustra- 
tions may be set out. The idea of pollution by the touch of 
men belonging to certain castes must be given up and much 
more therefore the idea of pollution by the mere shadow of 
certain peoph^w Swami VivekSnanda ( Works Vol. Vpl 5 2)

soionoa should not be included in the religions creeds of these 
days and should he treated as mere myths and legends. Many 
Christiana even in these days ( and most Hindus and Moslems ) 
believe in a heaven above and a hell or hells below. But Sahara 2663 
( in the first centuries of the Christian era ) holds that heaven is 
not a place ( vide pp. 1211-1215 above ). Therefore, heaven and 
hell as described in ancient Sanskrit works cannot be made an 
article of faith for modern men. It is often said that myths 
may be represented as facts to simple people for the sake of 
beneficial results ( e. g. for inducing them to perform sacrifices 
or to observe rules of morality &c ). But this is not proper as 
there are dangers in this. Tn these days of growing popular 
education, when the myth becomes exposed, the men who once 
believed it not only give up that myth but also might give up 
everything contained in ancient works as unbelievable. Space 
doeB not permit any elaborate cataloguing of what should be 
given up and what striven for in these days. Values, aims and 
institutions that were accepted by almost all people only a few 
decades ago are now challenged and new patterns are in process 
of being moulded. The chief catalytic agencies are modern 
science and Western thought and literature. The old structure 
of beliefs is tottering and laxity in morals has made great 
headway. But whatever happens, we must so regulate Boeiety 
that the family as a social unit 3661 is preserved and safeguarded, 
every child of whatever class or race must have equal opportuni- 
ties of education, man's daily work must be held to be divine 
work and worship, great inequalities of wealth and possessions 
must be eliminated.

This volume (the last in the History of Dharmasastra ) may 
be brought to a close with a quotation from the Kathopanisad 2665 
and another from Rabindranath Tagore's Gltafijali : 

' Get up, awake and having secured highly gifted (teachers ) 
understand ( the Truth ), the sharp edge of a razor is diffioult to 
pass over, thus the wise say that the path ( to Realization ) of 
Self ) is hard ' ( Kathopanisad ), 

Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high ; 

Where knowledge is free ; 

Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by 

narrow domestic walls ; 
Where words come out from the depths of truth , 
Where tireless striving stretches its amis toward perfection; 
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into 

the dreary desert sand of dead habit ; 
Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening 

thought and action — 
Into that beaven of freedom, my Father, let my country 
awake.

EPILOGUE 

Many friends and well-wishers of the author and some readers 
of the volumes of the History of Dharmasastra have often ( personally 
and by correspondence) pressed him to furnish some biographical 
details about himself, about the circumstances in which he launched 
on this undertaking, about the preparations he made, about the time 
and labour that this undertaking cost him and also -what money it 
brought to mm ( a few asked even this ) . 

To -write an autobiography is a most difficult and delicate matter. 
In an autobiography one has often to use the -words ' I ', ' Me ', ' My' 
etc and the writer is hable to be charged with egotism. If he is very 
frank about his own failings and faults, he may be accused of exhi- 
bitionism. I do not propose to say much about my parents or my 
ancestors or about my marriage and family life or my likes and dis- 
likes I had my own share of anxieties, troubles and sorrows, but I 
shall not say much about them, since the blessings that were showered 
on me far outweighed the anxieties and sorrows A brief account of 
some aspects of my long life may, I hope, he of some interest and 
help to those -who have to face problems similar to those that I had 
to face. 

I was born on 7th May 1880 in a village called Bedherii or 
ParaSurama [ because it has a large and famous temple of Parasn- 
rama, an avatara of Yisnu and the patron saint of several brahmana 
sub-castes (such as the Citpavana ) ] near Chiplun in the Ratnagi'rl 
District at my maternal uncle's house My father belonged to a 
priestly family m a V iH age ca i led Murieni near Khed in the Eatna- 
gm District. My father had learnt by heart a great deal of the 
Rgveda and was bemg framed for priesthood till the age of 18 He 
did not hke the profession of a priest and left for Poona to learn 
English along wit h a friend of h,s boyhood, the late Shankar Bal- 
knshna Dm<, who later on became famous for his Marathi work on 
Indian As ronomy winch was admired by Dr. Thibaut. Mr. Dixit 
and my father passed the Matnculation Examination of the Bombav 

held in those days by the Bombay High Court, passed it and be-anto 

lt»*. B««* y. edic lore, my father studied the principal TTpanifads

and the Glta and had many of the former by heart. He practised as 
a lawyer for about forty years, then retired and passed away m 1926. 
We -were nine children, six brothers and three sisters. I was the 
eldest of the sons and one sister -was older than myself. In my early 
boyhood my father taught me some elements of astrology and advised 
me to commit to memory the verses of Amarakosa ( of which I had 
400 by heart before I was 12 years of age). In 1891 I joined the 
S. P. G. Mission's English High School at Dapoli and passed the 
Bombay University's Matriculation Examination in 1897 and stood 
high among the successful candidates. While at school, I began to 
suffer from hyper-acidity, consequent acute stomach pains and vomit- 
ing at the age of 16 and had to leave school for nearly a year. At 
the time when I passed the Matriculation there was an epidemic ol ■ 
Bubonic Plague in Bombay and Poona, -where there was high morta- 
lity. My father was not willing to send me ( whose health was 
already delicate ) to those places where alone College education could 
then be had. So he asked me to study law under him. I studied it 
for two weeks, but being repelled soon by the dry study of law, 1 
wrote a letter to Dr. Machichan, who was then Principal of the 
Wilson College m Bombay (and reputed to be very kind ), conducted 
by the Scottish Mission, asking him whether I could be enrolled as a 
student tn absentia. He asked me to send Bs 36/-, a term's fee, get 
myself registered as a student and stated that as the epidemic was at 
its height the University might condone absence The Bombay 
University later on did no. I did not attend College in the first 
term. The epidemic abated, I joined CoUege in June and appeored 
for the first year's examination of the Bombay University in Novem- 
ber 1898 (which was then called the Previous Exam.) and was 
awarded a scholarship of Bs. 1T5 and a prize of Bs. 100 for tang 
the first among the students whose second language was Sanskrit. 
This was the first lucky accident in my life. Life is a mysterioas 
business It is full of lucky incidents or chances and one must be 
able to take advantage of them by one's own efforts. There have 
been many such incidents and disinterested friendships in my U » 
and I have hardly ever had an enemy to my knowledge in the whok 

f my rather.long'life. The ailment of my boyhood P-^jJ 
oolleee pursues me even now v and has become worse, but I did no 

SL mvself to be much disturbed by it, controlled my diet and led 
: "US and strict hfe. At the second year's examina.cn i 
A r ( Id intermediate ) I was awarded a scholarship of B, 180

( lump sum ) for standing first among students taking Sanskrit as a 
second language. Two years afterwards I appeared for the B. A. 
examination m 1901 and -was awarded the Bhau Daji Prize for 
proficiency in Sanskrit and stood first among the students of the 
Wilson College An idea ahout how delicate I -was in 1901 when I 
was 21 years old may be had from the fact that, though I was 5 feet 
4 inches in height, I -weighed only 98 pounds. After the B A. exa- 
mination I -was a Daksina Fellow at the Wilson College for two 
years and lectured to the first two years' classes at the "Wilson 
College on Sanskrit ahout three hours a -week. In 1902, I passed 
the First LL. B. examination in the Firot class and in 1903 the M. A, 
examination and was awarded the Zala Tedanta Prize of Bs. 400. 
The peculiarity of this prize is that the paper set is in Sanskrit, the 
answers are to be written in Sanskrit in three hours, the chief exa- 
miner was to be a ^astri who was proficient in Sankara Vedanta and 
had studied it under the old traditional methods. As my father had 
yet to spend for the education of several sons he asked me either to 
enter the Education Department as a High School teacher or to 
hecotne a lawyer in a subordinate court. I did not like the latter 
idea and applied to the Director of Public Instruction, Poona, for 
appointment as a teacher in a Govt High School Here again Dr. 
Machiehan helped me by recommending me highly to the D. P. I. 
I was appointed a teacher m the Govt. High School at Batnagiri in 
August 1904 on a salary of Bs 60 per month raised to Bs. 65 per 
month after a few months ( having been an M. A. with five scholar- 
ships and prizes m Sanskrit). I T» as at the Batnagiri Govt. High 
School for three years I appeared for the S. T. C. ( Secondary 
Teacher's Certificate) Examination held by the Department in 1905 
ind stood first in the whole of the Bombay Presidency (including 
Sind m those days). In the same year I submitted an essay on 
' Aryan Manners and Morals as depicted in the Epics ' for the T 2f 
Mandhk Gold Medal of the Bombay University and was awarded a' 
pme of books worth Bs. 150 For this essay I read both the Mata- 
-hartfa and the Bamayana. Till now I have read the Mahabbarata 
thncc-u.dlhaveyetgot the notebooks of extensive extracts parti- 
cuariy from the Mahabharata In the next year I appeared for a

College ( on Rs. 125 p. m.) fell vacant and I apphed for the post. 
But I was ao t appointed and another person who was an M. A. m 
Sanskrit, but had won n prjze , scholarship or medal in Sanskrit at 
any examination from the Matriculation to the M. A. and who was 
9th Assistant m the Elphinstone High School ( where I was 5th 
assistant) was appointed to the post, because he was a favounte 
student of the D. P. L when the latter was Principal of the Decean 
College, t sent a protest through the Principal of the High School. 
1 was informed that a competent authority in Sanskrit had recom- 
mended that the person chosen was superior to me m Sanskrit and 
when I requested the D. P. I. to let me know the name of the com- 
petent authority I was informed that my letter was an impertinent 
one and deserved no reply. This added insult to injury. This 
happened m December 1907. I decided to appear for the 2nd LL. B. 
examination in November 1908 and then to leave Govt, service. 
My supersession created a great deal of criticism m the Department 
and almost all persons sympathised with me and helped me in 
various ways. I appeared for the 2nd LL. B. examination in Novem- 
ber 1908 and passed it. This created an impression in the Education 
Department that I meant serious business. Therefore, as a sop to my 
injured feelings, I was appointed to act as Professor of Sanskrit at 
the Elphinstone College from February to April 1909 in place of 
Prof. S. B. Bhandarkar who hod been deputed on some Govt. work. 
I reverted to the High School at the end of April 1909 and began 
to cast about where to practise as a lawyer I was not inclined to 
practise as a lawyer m subordinate courts and decided that, if I left 
service, I would practise on the Appellate side of the High court, 
wheie it is a battle of wits and of hard work and one had not to do 
what a lawyer practising in the subordinate courts had to do. At 
that time, the late Mr. Daji Abaji Khare was almost at the top of 
the Appellate side Bar ( called Vakils of the High Court ) . He had 
some large estates at Dapoli { my native place) and knew my father 
and myself, I approached him for advice. He told me that I must

hare with me at least two thousand rupees in cash, if I wanted to 
practise in the Higb Court and to slick to it. I had then not a pie 
■with me and my father -who was already sixty years old and had to 
educate other sons, declined to help. In less than two years from 
June 1909 I brought out two school books and one annotated book 
in Sanskrit ( the Sahityadarpana ) for College students and was also 
appointed an examiner in Sanskrit at the Previous and Intermediate 
Arts Examinations. I thus collected two thousand rupees, resigned 
from Govt, service at the end of June 1911 and applied for a Sanad 
( after paying Ks 500 as fee for enrolment as a Vakil of the High 
Court of Bombay ) with a certificate of good moral character from 
Mr. Khare and was enrolled as a Vakil of the High Court on 5th 
July 1911 when I was in my 32nd year. 

"Work was slow in coming and the first two years were rather 
bleak, Having not much to do, I appeared for the LL. M. examina- 
tion in Hindu and Mahomedan law m 1912 and passed it. From 
1911 to about 1918 I brought out every year some book or books 
such as the Kadambarl of Bana in three parts with ample notes, the 
Harsacarita in two parts, and the Httararamacanta. I also condue- 
ted a private law class for coaching students for the High Court 
Vakil's examination (m which 60 percent marks were required for 
passing). This brought m a steady income of about Bs. 100 per 
month for four years from 1913 to 1917 and, what was more impor- 
tant, this task of teaching single-handed the ^ast field of law made 
me proficient m all complicated legal topics. In the meantime, m 
1J13 I was appointed W.lson Philological Lecturer to deliver six 
lectures on Sanskrit, Prakrit and alhed languages Eor a lump sum 
of Bs ,„0. In 1913 I became an ordmary member of the Bombay

Law College at Bombay. This was again a case of an unexpected 
event. The Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court had recom- 
mended for a vacancy in the Jaw college two somes from among the 
Vakils on the Appellate side Bar of the High Court, one a very 
senior gentleman and myself who had less than six years' practice. 
The senior gentleman for some reason ( not given out ) refused at the 
last moment and on 20th J unc, the day on which the Law College 
was to open, I received a wire in the Vakil's room from Government 
stating that Govt, proposed to appoint me as a Professor of Law from 
that day and that if I agreed I should see the Principal. This was a 
comfortable job, the salary being Bs. 300 a month and the duties 
light vis! three or four hours per week in the evening from 5-45 p.m. 
to 6-45 p.m. I was Professor of Law for six years ( 1917-1923). 
Hardly any Vakil with less than six years' practice on the Appellate 
Side of the High Court had been appointed before me as Professor 
of Law. 

I had undertaken about 1911 an edition of the Vyavahara- 
mayukha with explanatory notes on the advice of Prof. S. B. Bhan- 
darkar who was one of the General Editors £ the Bombay Govt.'s 
Sanskrit Series. But, owing to fluctuations in my own fortunes, I had 
neglected the work and had almost decided to give up the under- 
taking altogether. The Bombay Govt.'s Sanskrit Series came to be 
transferred by Govt, to the Bhandarkar Oriental Besearch Institute 
that had been started in Poona in 1917. The axitbonfaes of the 
Institute pressed me to carry out my undertaking. I agreed and began 
to read the vast Dharmalastra Literature for that purpose. The 
edition of the VyavahSramayfikha of Nllakantba ( text based on 
three printed editions and eight mss., an Introduction of 47 p«g« 
and exhaustive notes) was published in 1926 by the Bhandarkar 
Oriental Besearch Institute, Poona. In the bne Preface to tha 
edition of 1926, I announced that I had undertaken to write 
History of Dharmabatra Literature 

D r b. G. Bhandarkar had expressed a desire to donate Ins 
Jarge hbrary of thousands of books to some InsUut* tha t jou.d 

B , 500 each for the purchase of •*"£*£% p ,ot for 
Poona and, after setting aside nearly half of the purchas

the Institute to be named after Dr. B. G. Bhandarkar, distributed 
the rest among the original contributors as plot-holders. The pubhc 
and Govt, supported the Institute and the famous Tatas donated 
money to construct a suitable building. The first project undertaken 
was the publication of the critical edition o! the Mahabbarata. Govt, 
made grants, transferred the Bombay Sanskrit Series to the Institute, 
the Chief of Aundh promised a lath of rupees for the Mahabharata 
edition with pictures and later the Nizam of Hyderabad contributed 
a large sum for building a guest-house for scholars from India and 
abroad 

The first volume of the History of Dharmasastra, which was 
published m 1930, deals with the chronology and relative importance 
of famous and less known writers and works and covers T60 pages. 
As I regarded myself as one of the original founders of the B. O. B. 
I. and as I was a successful lawyer on the Appellate side of the 
High Court, I offered the volume to that Institute for publication 
without any agreement about payment. The Preface to the first 
volume makes it clear that I intended to finish the whole history in 
two volumes and that even at that time I suffered from a painful 
complaint ( duodenal ulcer ) which has dogged my footsteps 
throughout up to this day. The second volume of the History of 
Dharmasastra covering 1368 pages (including about 300 pages 
on Srauta ritnal, not included in the original plan ) was published 
m June 1941 (i e. eleven years after the publication of the first 
volume ), when I was already 61 years old and pursued by an impla- 
cable ailment The third volume containing 1088 pages was published 
in October 1946 and deals with only three topics ' Bajadharma, 
Vyavah&ra, and Sadacara ' ( customs and customary law ) On 
account of the 2nd world war there was paper shortage and the 
finances of B O. B. I. weie at a low ebb I had therefore to 
advance three thousand rupees to the B O R. I. and had to 
purchase paper worth se\eral hundred rupees for expediting the 
printing, in view of the fact that I was m my 6Tth year and that my 
physical condition was causing anxiety. The 4th volume is spread 
oi er 926 pages, was published in October 1953 ( when I was in my 
74lh voir) and deals with Pfttaka (Mns), Prajascitta ( expiation ), 
KarmaupSlta ( fruition of evil deed*), Antyesti (rites on death) , 
Ainnc-i (impurity on death and birth), S>uddlu (purification), 
Srftddha, TirthayiilrR (pilgrimages to sacred places ). 



VIII History of Dharmaicistra 

The ( fifth and ) last volume deals with numerous topics, as the 
Table ot Contents will show The first part o£ 718 pages dealiDg 
■with Yrata ( sacred vows, observances and festivals ) and Kflla -was 
separately published m 1958 (as I had then an attack of heart 
trouble, and it was thought that I might not survive, being more 
than 78 years old at that time). The second part now printed 
deals with Mantis, Puranas in relation to Dharmasastra, causes of the 
disappearance of Buddhism from India, Tantras and Dharmasastra, 
Safikbya, Toga, Tarka and Dharmasastra, Purvamlmaibsa and 
Dharmasastra, Cosmology, doctrine of Karma and Punarjanma, 
dominant characteristics of our Indian culture and civilization and 
future trends This volume has been in the press for over five years 
and has involved an enormous amount of varied rea-ding and writing 
for over eight years from 1953. 

In describing how and in how many years the H. of Dh deve- 
loped, I have not said anything about the environment in which I 
had to work From about 1918 I began to have good work as a 
lawyer I not only conducted cases in the Bombay High Court, 
but I appeared before the District Comts of the mofussil in several 
districts such as Khandesh, Nagar, Poona, Sholapur, Satara, and 
Batnagiri I ovre a great deal to my college friends, to my students 
that passed the High Court Vakil's examination after attending my 
private law class and to Mr. M K Athavle of Sangh and Sir. C. M. 
Saptarishi of Ahmednager for sending me much legal work 

I took part in many of the intellectual activities in Bombay 
and Poona I was a member of the Senate of the Bombay Univer- 
sity from 1919 to 1928, I have been throughout a member of the 
Herniating Conncil of the Bhandarkar Institute and of its other 
badges I was closely connected for over 40 years with the Marathi 
Granthasangrahalaya of Bombay in various capacities and with the 
Brahmanasabha of Bombay in many capacities as Chairman of the 
Managing Committee, a Trustee for 21 years and Adviser from 
1918 to this day. 

I bad argued gratis several cases for some socaebes and mdivj- 
duals Mr. Javdekar, lawyer of Dhulia, espoused the cause of people 
^ho had grievances against the Indian Bailways. I conducted 
manv such railway cases and cases of poor and helpless people One of 
r l^t was that of a poor uninsured brabmana widow who had

from offering worship to the image by placing her head at the feet 
of the image ( because she -was untonsured ) as all Hindus, male or 
female, of all castes were allowed to do I had to go to Pandharpur 
thrice at my own expense and spent in all seven days in court. The 
court decided in favour of the widow The case is refeired to m 
the History of Dharmasastraj vol II p 593 and the arguments are 
set out on pp 587-593 of the volume. 

Another case that I conducted gratis is that of the Deccan 
College, Poena This College was started by Go-\t. but a Parsi 
Baronet, Sir Jarosetji, made in the early sixties of the 19th century 
a munificent donation of about two lakhs with the stipulation that 
it was to be maintained as an educational Institution for ever on the 
lines already laid down The British Govt on the suggestion of an 
Indian Minister wanted to close the College and made a contract for 
sale of the site and buildings for a Parsi Public School. Some of the 
Old Boys of the College such as Prof S. G. Sathe and Dr Belvalkar 
consulted me what to do, though I was not an old boy of the Deccan 
College. I first suggested that a member of the Bombay Legislative 
Council should ask a question whether the Deccan College was Dot 
an Institution held m trust by Go^ t. The Govt replied that it was 
a trust property, but that GoU. would approach the District Court of 
Poona for permission to jsell it for the purpose of a public school- 
Govt applied to the District Court at Poona for permission to sell 
it for the purpose of a public school I appeared for the old Boys' 
Association and requested that the Association should be made a 
party to Govt's application. The Court allowed the application I 
had agreed not to charge any fees. I suggested that Mr. M R. 
Jayakar, ,, ho had a great regard for me and was a very successful 
advocate jn Bombay (^bo later became a member of the Judical 
Committee of the Privy Counol ,n England), should be briefed m 
he matter The Association said that they had not money enough 
top,y Mr. Jayakar's heavy fees. I requested Mr. Jayakar not to

late Mr. B G. Kher as Chief Minister had come to power and 
compromised the matter by agreeing to conduot the Deccan College 
as a Research Institute for Vedic studies and classical Sanskrit, 
Ancient Indian History etc. The Association made Mr, Jayakar 
and myself Honorary members of the Old Boys' Association, I have 
been on the Managing Council of the Deccan College Research 
Institute since 1938 to this day. 

In 1944 I -was appointed by the Bombay University Sir 
Lallubhai Shah Lecturer and delivered four lectures on Hindu 
oustoms and modern laws. The lectures have been published m 
book form by the University 

In 1927 at the time of the Ganapati festival in Bombay, amda 
(party of worshippers) of the Mahar caste (held untouchable) 
approached the authorities of the Brahmanasabha for permission to 
come for darian of the image installed by the Sabha and 
stated that they would be content if they were allowed to come as 
near the image as Parsis, Christians and Moslems would be allowed 
to do. I -was then Chairman of the Managing Committee and called 
a meeting of the Committee to decide whether the request should be 
granted. In the Committee the voting was exactly half for and half 
against. I had to give a casting vote for granting permission, since 
I was of the opinion that the request was a very modest one and in 
view of the changing times should be aoceded to. A suit was 
filed m the Bombay High Court by certain orthodox people against 
the Brahmanasabha, against myself as Chairman of the Manag- 
ing Committee and the Secretary for a temporary injunction res- 
training us from bringing the Mahar Mela inside the building 
where the image was and for a declaration that the Sabha through 
its office-bearers had no right to do what had not been pre- 
viously done. It must be said to the credit of the members of the 
Sabha that in a meeting of the general body of members my action 
was supported by a very large majority Tnere was great 
excitement and it was feared that violence might result The Migfl 
Court refused to grant a temporary injunction and later the suit was 
wSdrawn by the members seeking legal relief Our Constitution

ment arose m 1927

of the editors of the Journal oE the Society for many years. I con- 
tributed many long articles to the Journal of the Society and to the 
Annals of the Bhandarkar Institute. In 1946 at my request Dr , 
B. C Law, a great scholar, -whom I had never seen but who had 
become an admirer of my books, donated Bs three thousand ( for 
purchase o! books for the Society ) and donated five thousand rupees 
for founding a medal called P. V. Kane Gold Medal to be awarded 
once every three years to a scholar -who had done substantial 
research in subjects in -which I -was interested. 

On 7th May 1941, m honour of my 61st birthday* A volume 
of studies in Indology ' -was presented to me edited by Dr. S. M. 
Katre and Prof P K. Gode and published by Dr. N. G Sardesai 
oE the Oriental Book Agency, Poona My friends and admirers 
had formed a Committee with Dr. V. S. Sukthankar as Chairman 
and invited papers Many contributions came in, of which 74 are 
contained m that work, mostly wutten by Indian scholars ( a few by 
scholars from abroad also ) . 

In 1942 the British Govt conferred on me the title of Maha- 
mahopadhyaya and the Allahabad University conferred on me the 
Honorary Degree oE D. Litt In 1946 I was asked to preside over 
the AU India Oriental Conference held at Nagpur. In 1947 Mr. 
B G. Kher, then Chief Minister of the Bombay State, pressed 
me to become Vice-Chancellor of the Bombay University for Wo 
years and I agreed after some hesitation owing to my age ( about 
6S ). There was no salary attached to the post nor was there any 
sumptuary allowance nor any other allowance In the years 1947 to 
1949 I had three matters on my hands, my legal practice, the 
History of Dharmasastra and the work as Vice-Chancellor ( which 
was heavy in those days, sometimes three hours a day ). Mr Kher 
pressed me to remain Vice-Chancellor for three years more offered 
to make it a salaried post of 2000 Rs per month and requested me 
to gne up praehce as Advocate. The then Governor of Bombay 
S.r Uatenj Singh, as Chancellor, also pressed me, but for various 
reasons ( the foremost being that the work on the History of Dharma- 
«.»(« *onld make slow progress if I spent five or more hours a day 
in the Universny ) I declmed. The Session of the All India Oriental 
Conference was held m Bombay in 1949. I ™ s Chairman of the 
Reeeplum Committee. On my request the Sakuntala of Kahdfisa 
»*• performed in Sanskrit „ lUl songs, the director be.ng Mr K C M

Bliatiivdekai who is a fine-looking and tall man, an excellent actor, 
a good Sanskritist and a singer. It was a great success Embolde- 
ned by this success I suggested that other Sanskrit dramas should 
be put tip on the stage. Mr. Bh&lav, dekar and Mr. P P. Josm, Wo 
enthusiastic workers of the Sanskrilie Sarniti ( Cultural Committee) of 
the Brahmanasabha at Bombay, worked hard and at different times 
and m different places ( Delhi, Bombay, Ujjain, Poona ) put up on the 
stage ten Sanskrit dramas, 6fikuntala, Mrccbakatika, Ratnavah, 
Venfsatiihnrs, UttararStnacarita, Mudraraksasa, Vikrainoivaslya, 
Miilavikagmmitra, Svapnavfisavadatta and Sangila Saubbadra ( tran- 
slated into Sanskrit by Mr.S B. Velankar, Indian Postal Service, from 
the original Marathi by Anna Kirloskar ). These performances became 
very popular. The sale of tickets yielded 150,000 Bs. out of winch 
about thirty thousand were saved after meeting all expenses as a 
fund to fall back upon when they performed one of these plays at 
different places 

The International Congress of Orientahsts was held in Pans in 
1948. The Indian Govt, sent a delegation of three, Dr, S. Badha- 
knshnan as leader and Dr. S. K. Chatteru and myself as two 
members. In 1951 the International Congress met m Istanbul and 
the Indian Govt sent a delegation consisting of myself ( as leader ), 
Dr. R. O. Majumdar and Prof. Siddiqui. At this conference 1 
sponsored a resolution that the Unesco should make a substantial 
grant to the project of a Sanskrit Dictionary on Historical Principles 
undertaken by the Deccan College and it was unanimously passed 
by the Conference and subsequently "Unesco made a grant of 5000 
dollars to the Deccan College. In 1954 the Session of the Inter- 
national Congress of Orientahsts was held at Cambridge to which 
the Govt of India sent a delegation consisting of myself ( as leader), 
Dr S K Chatter]! and Dr. B N. Dandekar. Prom Cambridge I 
went at my own expense to IT. S. A and visited the Library of the 
Confess in Washington for two days, the University of Princeton, 
Harvard University and the University of Rochester, where my 
younger son was studying for the Ph D degree m Atomic and 
Nuclear Physics. The Governing Body of the London School of 
Omental and African stndxes of the London University ™s pleased* 
nominate me as an Honorary Pellow, I being the only Indian amon 
the present 25 Honorary Fellows of the School In ^** "£ 
presided over the session of the Indian History Congress at TMU* 



Epilogue XIII 

In November 1953 the President of India was pleased to 
nominate me as a member of Parliament i e of the Rajyasabha, 
( Council of States ) and -when my term expired on 1-4-58 I -was 
again nominated for six years. While in Parliament I worked on 
several committees such as the Committees for considering the Hindu 
Adoption Act, the Hindu Marriage Act, the Hindu Succession Act. 
I pressed on the Govt, that they should start a Central Institute of 
Indian Studies This has been now accepted in principle and a 
committee has been appointed to suggest a constitution and other 
matters I have also been a member of the Central Sanskrit Board. 
On 15th August 1958 the President of India was pleased to grant 
me a certificate of merit and an annuity of Bs 1500 a year. In August 
1959 the President was pleased to nominate me as National Professor 
of Indology for five years on a substantial salary, the only condition 
being that I should carry on reseaich as I have been dow. I 
resigned from Parliament in September 1959, because as I held an 
office of profit under Govt , I had to do so according to law. In 1960 
the University of Poona confeired on me the Honorary Degree of 
Doctor of Letters. 

From the Beginning of 1955 I did not take any hesh legal work 
and by March 1956 I got all my cases disposed off. Since April 
1956 I have systematically refused all pressure to accept briefs. 
Since April 195G I have devoted my time to Parliamentary work 
(till September 1959 only) and to the last volume of the History 
of Dharaa«astra 

I had substantial legal work from 1919 to about 1949. For the 
benefit of those „ho made mqmries and of those who desire to pursue 
literary stadies while working as lawyers, I shall briefly state howl 
-ted tune for hterary t,«rk The High Court worked for five day, 
in the ,cek I akays utilized all holidays for hterary work, Saturday 
and Sunday have always been my busiest days. There were always 

of the High Court Often ten appeals were placed on the board for

lower down on the Board might be taken up by the Court if th 
lawyers therein were available. Most lawyers when free spent the 
time in chitchat m the Advocates' room. I spent such tune in th 
Library for preparing my briefs that -were hkely to be taken up h 
the next few weeks. I hardly ever read my briefs at home. Therefore 
I could devote every day some hours in the morning and evenin 
to my work on Sanskrit studies. I always worked for eight or nine 
hours a day and sometimes ten to twelve hours from 1911 to 1948, 
except when I was not in Bombay. I have never slept or even 
taken a nap by day from 1904 to 1958 ; even when I went to see 
a drama at night and came home at 2 A.M. I awoke at 6 A.M, 
and slept a little earlier on the following night. After the mild 
heart trouble in 1958, I tried sleeping a little by day, but not being 
used to such a thing I gave at up in a few months. For fifty years 
I have been taking morning walk for about one hour on the Chowpati 
sea face in Bombay and at the Hanging Gardens since 1912, but 
stopped going to the Hanging Gardens from about 1956. 

That I had duodenal ulcer was discovered by x-ray therapy 
about 1925. Some doctors advised an operation. Others opposed 
it. I consulted the then most eminent surgeon an Bombay, Dr. G. V. 
Deshmnkh, and he advised me not to go m for it. Again in 19S7 
when I undertook a trip in European countries for three months, I 
consulted in Vienna an eminent German doctor who advised me lo 
continue my dietetic methods and not to undergo an operation, 
when I was nearly 58 and the disease was of very long standing. 

A few words about my method of collecting materials for my 
History of DhannaSastra. I have about a hundred note-books, some 
of them subjectwise and some with pages marked fioin AtoZ, » 
which I noted important pages and passages extracted from 
works read. For example, I have a big oblong notebook < leather 
bound ) of about 500 pages devoted to Puranas only. 

As regards the writing of the History of DharmaS istr. > «7 
method was as follows: I wrote in my ™******£ 
collected a hundred pages or so and then carefully read « bos pa D es 
Sometimes I tore off several pages and prepared an-* «•

charges. I sent to the Press only the handwritten original of the 
first volume It was from the 2nd -volume onwards that I got one 
or two copies type-written ( Wo -when there -was danger of bombing 
Bombay in 1942 ) and sometime afterwards I read the typed copy 
myself and put in the diacritical marks. This -was sent to the Press 
in Poona. I examined three ( rarely four ) proofs of all forms myself, 
but the press had directions to send a copy of the third page proof 
to a good Sanskrit scholar m Poona -who -was to read it and make 
corrections ( not in the matter but only as to diacritical marks, 
spelling, stops etc. ) and to send the corrected proof to me and I 
incorporated his corrections ( if accepted by me ) m my own copy 
of the third proof, -which was sent to the Press as the final proof. 
The Indexes to all the five volumes were prepared by me. The 
Indexes to volumes I-IY alone come to 289 pages The total prin- 
ted pages of all works written and printed by me and of the numerous 
papers that I contributed to the Journal of the Bombay Asiatic 
Society, the Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute and to other 
Journals would come to at least twenty thousand pages. To the 
typewriters of vol. II to V, I paid about 2500 rupees out of my own 
pocket and about 600 rupees to the correctors of the page proofs ( of 
volume II to V ) . I went to places that had collections of Sanskrit 
Msssuchas Poona ( very often ), Baroda, Benares ( several times ), 
Madras (several times), Tanjore and Ujjam at my own expense 
for reading several mss and getting copies made of a few of them. 
In our country, there are no large libraries like those in Europe 
and U. S. A. So I had to spend money on securing micro-films of 
certain articles m foreign journals and copies of certain Mss I 
have no accounts of the travelhng charges but about making copies 
of some mss. and microfilms I can say that they came to about 200 
rupees. The Press was m Poona and I was m Bombay and the 
proofs (along with the ongmal copy at the time of the despatch of 
the first proof ) had to be sent by post for about 35 years ( sometxmes 
one form, sometimes two and rarely three at a time ) . Besides, the 
or.g.naims.had always to be sent » small packet, (of from 50 to

Epilogue XVII 

The usual method in India as regards Histories ot Encylo- 
poedias in several volumes ( running into thousands of pages ) is 
to appoint a Director or Chief Editor ( on a salary of Rs 1500 
per month ), an Assistant Editor ( on a salary of Rs 600 or 
Rs 750 per month) and to pay contributors at Rs five or so 
per page, beside an office and a staff of clerks and typists The 
Director's salary on the usual scale for one year alone would come 
to Rs. 18,000 The payments made and to be made to me for 
writing n. work of over six thousand pages spread over 37 years 
come practically to one year's salary for a Chief Editor ( or rather 
less by Rs 3700 -which were spent for typewriting, correction, and 
copies etc as stated above ) I do not like this distasteful task 
I had, however, to -write about tins matter because I -wanted to 
dispel the queer notions about ray profits that some people appear 
to entertain and made mquuies It is owing to one individual's 
■saori6ce th.it all the volumes ( containing over 60C0 pages ) can be 
■sold by the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute for only Rs ISO. If 
the usual method had been followed, these 6000 pages would have 
had to be priced at Rs 400 or more

XVIH History of Dharmaiastoa 

I shall try to mention in one place the Institutions, the series of 
books and individuals to whom I have been indebted. 

INSTITUTIONS 

Among Institutions the first place must be assigned to the 
Library of the Bombay Asiatic Society ( formerly called Bombay 
Branch of the Boyal Asiatic Sooiety ) . It was in this Library that 
I passed several hours almost every day ( except on holidays), 
when I was m Bombay. It has also a large collection of Sanskrit 
Mss. The materials for the first four volumes were collected mainly 
in the rooms of this Library. I owe a deep debt of gratitude to this 
Library and to all persons in the service of the Library from the 
highest to the lowest. I must next mention the Libraiy of the 
Bombay University, which was also of great use to me. The Library 
of the Bombay Asiatic Society is a circulating Library with a large 
membership, but the Bombay University Library permits only the 
members of the Senate to have books issued to them for reading fit 
home. I could secure books urgently needed by me from this 
Library, when I could not get them from the Asiatic Society's 
Library ( because some members had taken them ). Besides, rt 
possesses a large number of Sanskrit Mss. I tender my thanks to the 
Bombay University and its Library, to the staff of the Library and 
particularly to Mr. D. 1ST. Marshall, the present Librarian. Since 
November 1553 when I was nominated a member of Parliament 
(Rajyasabha) by the President of India, two more Libraries became 
available to me. One was the Library of Parliament which contains a 
large number of books on many subjects including Sanskrit Litera- 
ture, Ancient Indian History, and the Library of the Arohaeologwal 
Department in New Delh,. I thank the staff of the Parhamen 
Library. Dr. A. Ghosh, Dnector-General of the Archaeology! 
Survey of India, made special arrangements for seating me ip the 
Archaeological Library and made me a corresponding member. Dr 
Cbabbra, Joint Director of that Department, also was very kind and 
helpful.' I am under great obligations to these high Officer,. When 
at the end of 1953. I went to the Library of the Arohaeclogica 
Department, the Librarian was a young man, Shn L a P* A • 
double M. A. of the Bombay University, a B. T. and *J*« * 
Soma in Librananship. He is a very industrious and «tt£ 
ask young Librarian, who made great efforts to keep the Library 



kpitoglie XIX 

foil of Sanskrit books, full of "books both on ancient and medieval 
history of India and of other countries, and of books on all archaeo- 
logical studies, such as architecture, iconography and painting, kept 
the Library uptodate and took a keen interest in my -work and a great 
deal of trouble to accommodate me in various ways ( too many to 
mention ) from 1954 to the present day. Much of the material for 
this lengthy 5th volume -was collected in the Archaeological Library 
and a good deal of the text also was -written there. I am under 
a deep debt of gratitude to Mr Parab and also thank all his 
assistants, particularly Messrs. KLapur and Mr. A. S. Dhavle and his 
Jamadar, Bhagavat Sahai. 

Then I must mention certain Series of books and certain Presses 
that have printed and published a large number of books, such as 
the AnandasMuia series ( Poona ) , the Bibliotheca Indica Series 
the Bombay Sanskrit Series, the Kavyam&la and the Nirn&yasagar 
Press, Calcutta Oriental Series, Chowkhamba S. Series, Cultural 
Heritage of India, volumes I-IV (Calcutta), the Gujarat! Press and 
its Sanskrit Series, the Gaikwad Oriental Series ( Baroda ), Handas 
Sanskrit Series (Benaras), Harvard Oriental Series, Kashi Sanskrit 
Series, Jivanand Vidyasagar's numerous publications, Prajfiapatha- 
rala Mandala's volumes of Dharmakoia and Mim&insa-kosa { Wai ) 
Kashmir Sanskrit Series, the Marukyachandra Digainbar Jam 
Series, Jam Grantha-mala Series, Pah Texts Society's Series, Prince 
of Wales Sarasvattbhavana Series of texts and Studies, Pandit S D. 
Satavalekar's Seues of Vedic Sauihitas, Sacred Books of the East 
Series (50 valmnes including the valuable Index Volume), St. 
Petersburg Dictionary by Bohthlingk and Both, the Vaidika 
SasihSodbnna-inandal's volume of IS TJpamsads with valuable foot- 
notes and Index ( Poona ), Tnvandrum S. Senes, Vedic Index ( m< 
two Wnuies ) of Macdonell and Keith, Vijianagram S Series. 

Among penodicals I mnst mention, the Epigraphia Indica, the 
Tndian Anl.quary and those indexed under the word ' Journal '.

Devata : Discussion of question 
■what is meant by D. with 
reference to which an otter- 
ing is cast into fire leads to 
startling results in P. M. S 
1207-09 ; D. is a subordinate 
element m a sacrifice and 
hams is principal matter and 
in a conflict between the two 
decision rests on havis ( in 
PMS ) 1207 ; D. is a matter 
of words ( says Sahara ) and 
when an offering is directed 
by Veda to be made to Agm, 
one cannot use a synonym 
like Pavaka, 1207-8 ; Jaimim 
and Nirukta agree as to the 
nature and function of D. m 
a sacrifice, 1276 , phala (reward) 
is conferred by the sacrifice 
and not by D. (like Agm 
etc. ) 1208 , several opinions on 
who the Devatas are, to whom, 
a hymn is addressed or an 
havis is offered 1208 , though 
some Vedic passages speak of 
the body of D. and that it 
drinks and is lord of heaven 
and earth, they are ( merely ) 
laudatory 1208.

Dharma : ( vide under c change ', 
Purvamim&ihsa, Satya, Smiti) 
differs in each Yuga, 1266; 
investigation of D. has four 
aspects, viz its nature, the 
pramnnas of it ( such as "Veda, 
Smrh etc.), the means ( sa- 
dhana ) of knowing it, the fruit 
or reward, 1179n ; Jaimim 
holds tint iabda ( i. e. Veda. ) 



alone is the pramana for 
Dharma and no other, 1183, 
1185, 1265 ; Mahabharata says 
that Dharma is the one follow- 
ed by the great mass of people, 
1071 ; Mahabharata and Mann 
often refer to the high value 
of D. and make artha and 
Kama subservient to D. 1627- 
28 , Manu provides that as 
to matters not specifically pro- 
vided for m Veda and Smitis, 
whatever learned brahmanas 
declare to be the D. is un- 
doubtedly so, 1278 ; meaning 
of Dharma in P. M. S. 
1 1. 1 is * Vedartha ' ace. to 
Prabhakara school and ' Co- 
dana ' ace. to Kumarila, ( i. e. 
a religious act, a yaga ) 1179n, 
1184 ; D. is one of the puru- 
sarthas that has been a far* 
reaching one from UpaniSad 
times and concerns principles 
■which men should observe in 
their lives and social relations, 
1627, P. M. Sutra I. 1. 2 
defines Dharma as an act 
conducive to a man's highest 
good, that is characterized by 
an exhortative ( Vedic ) text, 
1183 , practice of black magic 
is adharma, as it is sinful and 
condemned, though it be re- 
ferred to in the Veda, 1183 ; 
Sahara holds, on account of 
Rg. X. 90. 16, that Veda ex- 
pressly declares that Dharma 
means' Yaga' 1184.

postulates which science finds 
convenient and useful but 
science -works within narrow 
limits, it is not concerned with 
morals or spirituality or values

emphasis on rationalism arose 
as the Christian churches, 
particularly Eoman Catholic, 
■were extremely intolerant of 
the slightest departure from

Mills put forward the theory

higher Intelligence than man's,

mortabty, and argue that in all 
religions there is some truth

gmrti (or Smrtis, aco. to context); 

. attitude of PMS and Sahara 

towards S. is that, m case of 

direct conflict with Veda, S. is 

to be discarded, but if there be 

'no conflict it may be inferred 



that S is based on some Vedic 
text 1277; is stronger than 
usages of 6stas 1058 , lay down 
many vidhis by employing 
optative verbal forms or parti- 
ciples in ' ya ', ' tavya' etc. as 
inManu IV. 25 and XI. 53, 
1228, S. like Gaut. and Mann 
( II. 7 ) do claim that they are 
based on Veda 1277 ;Maxim of 
' sarvasakhapratyayanyaya' was 
extended to S. by Visvarupa, 
Medhatithi and others 1173; 
often referred to as authorita- 
tive by Sahara for several 
reasons and as equal to Veda, 
1257-58 ; out of about 1000 
adhikaranas of P M. sutra 
barely a dozen are m any way 
concerned with S. 1277, 
principal subject of most S is 
dharmas of varnas and asraaas 
1637 , since mkalpa was liable 
to eight faults the tendency 
developed that all S passages 
on a topic were to be so inter- 
preted as to give rise to no 
conflict nor option by various 
devices 1273-74 ; six Vedangas 
and the DharmaSstras are 
comprehended under Smrti, 
ace. to Kumarila 1277; some 
S. provide that a brahmana 
could take food at the house of 
certain sudras, 1608; the obje- 
ction that smrtis being compo 
sed by men are not authorita- 
tive is met in Tantravartaka 
by several answers 1259-60,

Mahabharataand PurBnas)that

no evidence to show that inter-

Zero ( vide under PingnlA ) , 
escaped even the greatest 
Greeks, Pythagoras, Euclid 
and Archimedes 700, Egyp- 
tians had no sign for Zero and 
therefore no positional nota- 
tion 700 , it is difficult to say 
when a symbol foi zero was 
first discovered m India but the 
word Sunya for Z occurs in 
Pingala's work 700 , Prof. 
Neugebauer asserts that a pe- 
culiar sign was used for Z in 
Masopotumian cuneiform texts 
but answers are required to 
certain questions 700n , several 
Sanskrit words suggestive of 
zero, such as Sunya, pfirna,

scholars 566 ; Egyptians knew

Webb holds that Zodiac as

as referring to Z but it is most 
difficult to keep m view twelve
