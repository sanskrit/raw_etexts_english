We had a discussion with K, ST and R about some web sites they were
reading about obtaining the average facial type of a given population.
They pointed me to a great free morphing software that did it- SQIRLZ
MORPH. I decided to try my hand at creating the average Hindu young male
face. I am not sure if this is really an average for nothing statistical
has been done. My data set consisted mainly of cricketers whose mugshots
were available face on. To it was added a Middle aged Dravidian actor
provided by ST. There were a total of 11 distinct males in this data
set: 5 from South India, 5 from North India and one from Bengal. The new
face that emerges is reasonably clear but because I did not get properly
positioned mugshots and because they were of very different sizes, there
is some lack of clarity. In any case, this profile produces a reasonably
close approximation of the Hindu Caucasoid face, which we encounter with
some changes in our midst. The experiments on the average Hindu female
may prove too distracting to conduct for now.
