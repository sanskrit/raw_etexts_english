## CXIII

*To Mr. Sokanathan, Colombo*

ALMORA

*30th June 1897*.

MY DEAR FRIEND,

The bearer of this note, Swami Shivananda, is \[being\] sent to Ceylon,
as promised by me during my sojourn. He is quite fit for the work
entrusted to his care, of course, with your kind help.

I hope you will introduce him to other Ceylon friends.

Yours ever in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA
