## CLVIII

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

LOS ANGELES

*6 December 1899*

MY DEAR MOTHER,

A few lines to say my safe arrival and am going to resume my usual work
of lecturing here.

I am much better than I was in Chicago and hope soon to become well
again.

I cannot tell you how I enjoyed once more the little visit with my
American Mother and Sisters.

Harriet has scored a triumph really. I am charmed with Mr. Woolley —
only hope Mary will be equally fortunate. It gives me a new lease of
life to see people happy. May they all be happy.

Ever with love, your son,  
VIVEKANANDA
