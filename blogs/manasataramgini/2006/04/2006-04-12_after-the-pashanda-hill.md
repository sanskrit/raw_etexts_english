title = "After the pAShaNDa hill"

+++
We were trying to trace back the footsteps of besieger. We realized some
of the details of what happened immediately after the pAShaNDa hill. We
got out of pAShaNDa hill and were confronted by the second “born of
soma”. We brushed aside “born of soma-2” pretty easily. Shortly there
after an incantation followed. We believed that out pitA had taken care
of that, but it was only partly so. Shaken by the recent turn of events
for the first time he told us that there might have been a mistake at
that point and that he might acted on a mistaken track for a whole year.
Now realizing that it had gone way beyond his level, he dumped the whole
thing on us to take care of it our own. But somewhat ironically we are
like two incomplete men each having only one key half- he all those
brilliant strategies and us the theoretical knowledge of mantras.
