title = "The iconography of diverse goddesses"

+++
The Wodeyar of Mysore, kR^iShNa rAja, prepared a compendium of Hindu
iconography from diverse classical Hindu sources. This collation called
the shrI-tattva-nidhI (STN) has become a useful standard for upAsaka-s
in amongst educated Hindus, especially from Southern India. Sadly, the
full text is not easily accessible these days. It is useful to examine
the succinct descriptions of iconography that he provides in his text.  
The STN is divided into 9 chapters:  
1\) shakti nidhi 2) viShNu-nidhi including vaiShNava deities 3) shiva
nidhi including shaiva deities 4) brahma, indra and the devas 5)
planets, nakShatra-s, kR^ityA-s and others 6) shalagrAman-s 7) li\~Nga-s
8) Agamic and tantric issues 9) numbers, and scripts.

It begins with a long description of the iconography of chAmuNDA, who
was the patron deity of the Mysore region as chAmuNDeshvarI (At some
point I will summarize all the deities whose icons he describes). Some
are long while some are laconic. Some the less frequently encountered
ones are:

lopAmudrA:  
pAshA\~Nkushau sharaM chApaM dhArayantIM trilochanAm | sUryAbhAM
chandra-chUDAM cha lopAmudrAM bhaje shivAm || sindhUra-varNaH

shItalA (a terrifying female agent of The god, who is the deification of
variola. As described here on the chaNDikA hill near my regions of youth
I had noted an icon of the deity depicted riding a donkey, naked and
bearing a pot of cooling drugs and a winnowing fan and black in
color):  
dhyAyechcha shItalAM devIM rAsabhasthAM digambarAm |
mArjanI-kalashopetAM shUrpAlaMkr^ita-mastakAm || (kR^iShNavarNaH).

tulasI (It also provides the imagery for the demoness tulasI, who was
conquered by viShNu, there by allowing rudra to slay her husband, the
demon sha\~NkachUDa. But here she is caled a devI, worshiped as a deity
of the basil plant):  
dhyAyechcha tulasIM devIM shyAmAM kamala-lochanAm | prasannAM
padmakahlAra-varAbhaya-chatur-bhujAm ||1||  
kirITa-hAra-keyUra-kuNDalAdi-vibhUShitAm | dhavalAM shuka-saMyuktAM
padmAsana-niSheduShIm ||2|| (shyAma varNaH)

tiraskariNI (A simple but beautiful image is given of our
favor-bestowing goddess tiraskariNI, with whose hallowed mantra the
stambhana prayoga of ari-s is destroyed.):  
nIlavAji-samArUDhA nIlA\~NgI khaDga-dhAriNI |
nidra-nimIlad-bhuvananA-tiraskariNikAvatu || (nIla-varNaH)
