## CXCVIII

*To Mrs. Alice (Shanti) Hansbrough*

THE MATH  
HOWRAH DIST.,  
BENGAL, INDIA

*3rd June 1901*

DEAR MRS. HANSBROUGH —

The contribution of six pounds and three shillings to the Math by the
Los Angeles club has duly reached. Swami Brahmananda will write to you a
separate acknowledgement. But as I happen to be here just now and have
not had long any direct communication with you, I feel like having a
chat with you as of yore, even though it be through the post. Now how
are you and the Baby and the holy Trinity and the oldest who brings up
the rear?

How are all our Los Angeles friends? Poor Mrs. \[Emeline F.\] Bowler, I
hear, has passed away. She was an angel. Where is Miss Strickney? Please
tender her my sincerest love, gratitude and prayers when you meet her
next.

How are all the San Francisco friends? How is our Madam (Mrs. Benjamin
Aspinall.) — the noble, the unselfish? What is she doing now? Quietly
gone back to her Home of Truth work?

Are you pleased with Turiyananda and his work? Is the \[Shanti\] Ashrama
progressing?

With everlasting love and blessings,

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA
