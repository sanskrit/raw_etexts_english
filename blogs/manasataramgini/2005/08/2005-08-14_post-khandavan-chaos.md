We paused for a moment looking out from our high perch into the foggy
haze of the air around us. The joys of the world it appeared had
deserted us. The devas had sent the brief respite, but it was all over.
Why are we here we asked ourselves ?

Our mind raced back to the days of war between October-December of the
year 2004. It was a fairly decisive period, but little did we know what
the seizure of khANDAva had in store for us. Looking back at the
correspondence of our amAtya and shachiva, we realized our mistakes with
20/20 hindsight. It is now clear that we were slipping inexorably
towards a deadly trap. In this situation is not surprising that the mind
all recedes to the same period in theyear 2003. The smashing defeat we
faced on the slopes of the pAShaNDaâ€™s hill had sowed the seeds for the
future events. Our journey to the ruins of the ancient Jorwe cultures in
Nevasa had made us wonder who were those people. Then we observed
Mercury, low beside the horizon. At that point our shachiva was blinded
and made some mistakes, which embroiled us in the khANDava campaign. But
now we realized that the conquest of khANDava had brought us to a nadir
in our history. Everywhere the army was shaking from the multi-pronged
attacks, the state itself was in utter disarray. We felt that even
though we were a much better warrior, we were not a better king than our
sire.

We turn to indra for aid.
