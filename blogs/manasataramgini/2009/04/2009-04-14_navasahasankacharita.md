title = "navasAhasA~Nkacharita"

+++
Long ago the Acharya had said that we should study the
navasAhasA\~Nkacharita (NSC). But being truants we ignored his sage
words. Years later we felt that we should relieve the enactments of the
rAjpUt rulers we had played as kids and felt the need for authentic
material. That is when we turned back to the navasAhasA\~Nkacharita, but
with the AchArya no longer around we are not sure that we could extract
its sense in totality. The name of this kAvya is derived from
sAhasA\~Nka, who is chandragupta-II vikramAditya the pinnacle of gupta
glory. The new sAhasA\~Nka, the protagonist of this kAvya, is sindhurAja
the king of the paramAra rAjpUt, whose dynasty was to be adorned by the
great bhoja-deva. The author is a certain parimala padmagupta the son of
mR^igA\~Nkadatta. The epic is based on this historical character but
imitates the rAmAyaNa or the Illiad in its core motif. The king
sindhurAja with his minister ramA\~Ngada were on a hunt in the vicinity
of the narmada when the king shoots a deer of the nAginI shashiprabhA.
This leads him to making an acquaintance with her, but before he could
propose marriage to her, she vanishes on hearing an incorporeal voice
and returns to her father. He then pursues her by jumping into the
narmadA and passing through a subterranean grotto \[a very common Hindu
motif found in the rAmAyaNa – as the vAnara-s were searching for sItA
and also in the dashakumAra of daNDin\]. The goddess of the river tells
him that he can win the nAginI only if he can get the golden lotus from
the king of the asura-s, who is interestingly name vajrA\~Nkusha, and
give it to the father of shashiprabhA. The goddess also tells him to
meet a brAhmaNa named va\~Nku to get advice on his quest of the golden
lotus. The king sends a message to shashiprabhA of his intention to get
the using a parrot who is actually a nAga cursed by a student of kANva
to become a parrot. Then king goes on his quest by first reaching
va\~Nku’s domain. There he is given a pomegranate by an ape. As soon as
he accepts it’s the monkey becomes a vidyAdhara, shashikhaNDa the son of
shikhaNDaketu \[he had been cursed by va\~Nku to become an ape as he was
trying to seize a maiden in the brAhmaNa’s Ashrama\]. This shashikhaNDa
then summons his own army of vidyAdhara-s to aid the paramAra rAjan. He
also gives the king a vimAna that flies due to the vidyAdhara’s magic to
set forth for the campaign. The parrot on delivering the message to the
princess regains his form as the curse is lifted and returns to the king
as ratnachUDa, a nAga. The ratna on his crest illumines the path for the
army of sindhurAja to reach the asura capital of ratnavatI.

There the rAjan sent a message to the asura vajrA\~Nkusha via
ramA\~Ngada asking him to hand over the golden lily to the paramAra or
else face war. vajrA\~Nkusha refuses and states that he not the paramAra
would take shashiprabhA. Duly the war breaks out between the asura-s one
side and the vidyAdhara-s, nAga-s and paramAra-s on the other. In course
of the fierce fight ramA\~Ngada killed the asura’s son while
navasAhasA\~Nka himself killed vajrA\~Nkusha by cutting his head off
with a shara. Then he crowned ratnachUDa as the king of ratnavatI. With
his minister bearing the golden water lily the king went to bhogavati
the capital of the nAga-s. There he saw the temple of shiva known as
hATakeshvara and he performed his worship there. Then was married to
shashiprabhA to whom he gives the golden lotus. Before they return to
dhAra his father-in-law the nAga king gives him a sphaTika li\~Nga made
by tvaShTar. He takes the li\~Nga and first goes to ujjayini and
worships a li\~Nga of rudra there. Then he goes to dhAra his clan’s
capital and installs the li\~Nga received from the nAga-s there.

Who are the hUNa-s defeated by paramAra-s in this work? I wonder if the
conventional explanation is correct at all in this regard.

There are some motifs here that are reminiscent of daNDin’s novel. In
that work the feral brAhmaNa is educated in the tantra-s by a brAhmaNa
whose life he saves from savage kirATa-s. He then performs the worship
of shiva and is told of a sphaTika li\~Nga near which lies the entry to
a grotto leading to the netherworld. At the entrance to the cave he
finds a copper plate with a prayoga inscribed on it. He performs the
specified prayoga in the netherworld and acquires an asurakanyA as his
wife who gives him a jewel that he later gifts to his companion
rAjavAhana. Of course the overall similarity of themes to the
bR^ihat-katha is also quite obvious. Beyond the name “nava-sAhasA\~Nka”
the paramAra king is already identified with the vikramAditya in many
ways in this work: The return from the nAga world to ujjayini the
capital of the old gupta monarch is one such point. This trend was to
culminate in the legends around bhoja-deva the successor of sindhurAja
\[e.g.:  
asti kShitaUjjayinIti nAmnA purI vihAyasy amarAvatIva  
babandha yasyAM padam indrakalpaH shrIvikramAditya iti kShitIshaH ||  
or the statement:  
atIte vikramAditye gate .astaM sAtavAhane  
kavimitre vishashrAma yasmin devI sarasvatI ||  
I.e. after the death of vikramAditya and sAtavAhana sarasvatI was now
resting in sindhurAja, the protagonist of the novel.\]

Interestingly, when the minister narrates the tale of the agnikula
origins of the paramAra-s he places it in the context vasiShTha-s
struggle with the gAthina. He also states that vasiShTha makes the first
paramara using atharvanic spells:  
athAtharvavidAm AdyaH samantrAm AhutiM dadau  
vikasad-vikaTa-jvAlA-jaTile jAtavedasi ||

Thanks to the aid from paNDita somadeva we were able enjoy more aspects
of this kAvya. Reading the verses again underscored the pleasantness of
the dhvani of the vaidarbhi style to the years.
