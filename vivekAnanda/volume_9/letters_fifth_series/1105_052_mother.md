## LII

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

\[NEW YORK

*April 25, 1895*\]

DEAR MOTHER,

I was away a long time in the country. Came back day before yesterday.

I think the summer coat is in Chicago. If so, will you kindly send it
over c/o Miss Phillips, 19 W. 38 Str., New York? It is getting hot here
every day.

I will remain in New York till the end of May, at least.

Hoping you are all in perfect health. I remain yours truly,

VIVEKANANDA
