Hindu tradition posits that all living organisms have descended from a
common ancestor. The common ancestor of all birds is said to be tAmrA.
Her sisters like kadru or surasA are the ancestors of the reptiles. The
origin of birds from tAmrA is narrated in the pakShi sarga that is found
in both the itihAsa-s and many of the mahApurANa-s (see below).
Collation of the pakShi sarga-s from several major texts followed by
construction of a parsimony network allows us to follow its evolution
through these texts (see figure 1). The pakShi sarga in the epics states
that tAmrA spawned 5 branches, which in turn spawned several other
lineages of birds. The agni purANa preserves a degenerate version of
this account. The remaining purANa-s increase the number of lineages
emerging from tAmrA to 6. However, in the majority of them the
apparently zoologically-challenged sUta makes the sixth lineage one of
mammals- i.e. ungulates. However, the brahmANda purANa and padma purANa
correct this to make the 6th lineage additional avian lineages. The
Pauranic versions themselves can be divided into two categories: 1)
using the term sutA for the descendents of tAMrA and 2) using the term
kanyA for the same. The pakShi-sarga from all major texts with is given
below with a summary of their views on the avian “phylogeny” shown as a
network (Figure 2).

The word bhAsa is commonly translated as vulture or a bird of prey. It
is an old vedic word (e.g. bhAsa sAman). bhAsI is the founder of an
avian lineage according to 11 of the 12 texts. Included in the bhAsI
lineage (considering all the 12 texts) are various birds, such as the
bhAsa, mayUra (peacocks), kukkukTa (fowl), tittiri (patridge) and
several other birds. Occasionally ulUka-s (owls) and kAka-s (crows) are
included in the bhAsI clade but shyena-s and gR^idhra-s are not. Only
the padma and matsya purANa-s consider the bhasi as a lineage of
falconiform birds and place the kurara-s (osprey?) in it. From the view
point of Indo-European faunal elements we find that Greek and
Indo-Iranian share some specific isoglosses:  
1\) Grk: iktinos; Avs:saena; Skt: shyena =\> hawk  
2\) Grk: ortuks; Skt: vartaka =\> quail  
3\) Grk:kerkos; Avs: kahrka; Skt:kR^ikavAku =\>rooster  
In light of this one wonders if bhAsa and Greek phasianos/phasis are
cognates and bhAsa originally probably pheasant rather than a
falconiform in Old Indo-Aryan.

From the graph one can infer that the original Hindu system of avian
classification included the shyenI, bhAsI and gR^idhrI clades for
certain. Additionally, the shukI clade seems to have been most likely
present. The shuchI clade might have been created originally from a
mutation of the shukI clade, but it was intentionally reassigned to
remain largely distinct from shukI by most pauraNic authors. The
krau\~nchI, kAkI, bhAsI, shuchI, shukI and dhR^itharAShTrI clades show
overlap in contents, suggesting that they represented the major bulk of
the doubtful relationships – an attempt to fit the remaining bird groups
into the remaining 2-3 lineages. However, a large water-bird lineage and
the owl-nightjar lineage are frequently associated with them. Finally,
sugR^idhrI appears only in the padma purANa – an apparent attempt to
correct the zoological gaffe (i.e. sugrIvI) occurring in the ancestral
purANa sarga narrative.
