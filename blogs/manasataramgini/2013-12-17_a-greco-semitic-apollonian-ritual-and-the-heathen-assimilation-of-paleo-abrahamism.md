title = "A Greco-Semitic Apollonian ritual and the heathen assimilation of paleo-Abrahamism"

+++
Many turns of the sun ago, when we landed on the shores of the
krau\~ncha continent, we were politely informed by the mlechCha-s that
our Indian degrees were not really worth their name. While we were
arguing the case of our possession of genuine education that in the
least equaled the Americans, we were subject to the indignity of having
to take a course in genetics from a mlechCha professor who did know the
difference between a transcription factor and an enhancer\! Being
coerced into this course was galling, but it was not as bad as the
existential crisis it presented to a black African gentleman from
Botswana. The said gentleman had been a star in his country having
displayed his practical knowledge in goat-breeding. His government felt
he was a major hope of their future and felt he should advance beyond
his exploits in goat-breeding by acquiring a high education in the
wonders of modern genetics (the omics was not yet an in thing those
days). So they thought that it would appropriate if he returned home
with the booty of an exalted degree from a well-ranked US university.
Sadly, our Botswanan’s path to that destination was now being
jeopardized by the mlechCha gentlemen who was more Texan cowboy than
biology professor. He thunderously informed the Botswanan’s that he
stood really close to failing and not clearing that course would mean
that he would debarred from even qualifying to attempt the high degree
he aspired. At that time, in the heady rush of youthful arrogance and
frustration over life’s inequities, we had acquired for ourselves a
certain negative publicity by our pointed questioning of the mlechCha
professor’s understanding of the subject of the course, notwithstanding
our aunt’s warning that we should not question the mlechCha professors
too much. Now, this caught the attention of the Botswanan, who in his
predicament approached us to give him some lessons in genetics. We
acquiesced, mainly because we had little other motivation to do the
volleys of homework which the Texan fired routinely as though from a
six-shooter straight from his hip.

During one such lesson on which genes determine various human traits our
African pensively declared that the more one studied this science the
more it became clear that God had not made everyone equal as the church
father who had converted his family would say. We asked him if he really
took that seriously, to which he responded that he is becoming
increasingly uncertain of all the stuff that the padres filled him up
with in his youth. Then he looked up at us and said: “I guess you do not
follow any of this religion. Indeed, our padre had said how difficult it
was to convert Hindus and he was happy to leave India and come over to
Botswana. The padre said that he had best success in India with
urbanized students of pretavAdin schools or tribals/lower strata of
society but even that totally ‘sucked’. The former never came to church
again to hear more of the good news; the latter soon placed the preta as
one among their many gods with various animal faces. Soon a Hindu priest
would come and ask them to remove Jesus and with that all the pretavAda
was gone.” We asked him why his Africans did not do the same. It seemed
that this made sense to him and shaking his head he broke out in to a
song which ran something like the mlechCha-s taking away all the
resources from Africa leaving them with only the empty pretavAda.

This phenomenon narrated by the Botswanan regarding his padre’s failure
in bhArata is that of heathen assimilation and neutralization of
eka-rAkShasa-mata-s. It might be contrasted with phenomenon represented
by the likes of the faux romAka brAhmaNa where mimicry is used by the
eka-rAkShasa-mata to penetrate heathens. This was clearly articulated in
those days by Arun Shourie and culminates in what is described by the
arrogant but occasionally insightful malla rAjIva as “digestion” of the
heathen. There is a third phenomenon, which goes by the colorful moniker
of moron-svAmism (adopting a term coined by an internet interlocutor),
wherein a heathen religious teacher claims oneness between his deities
and the eka-rAkShasa thereby voluntarily opening a backdoor for the
eka-rAkShasa-mata to penetrate his system.

We used to teach the Botswanan in the library after dinner. After those
lessons we would wander among the books seeking new knowledge and it was
in course of one such wandering we fell upon the complete collection of
the Greek magical papyri (PGM) which till that point we only had a
limited knowledge of. This remarkable collection opened our eyes to how
the Hellenistic religion assimilated the paleo-Abrahamists and
neutralized their eka-rAkShasatvam. It was this understanding that
helped us distinguish the three above-noted phenomena, which are often
dangerously confused by modern Hindus. Indeed, it presented a case for
how a strong, well-defended polytheism can be more attractive than
eka-rAkShasatvam-s and regularly liberate followers from the latter
cults. This also explained why the prophets of paleo-Abrahamism had to
routinely harangue their flock about falling away from eka-rAkShasatvam
and following the polytheistic systems that were prevalent around them
in West Asia.

\-۩۞۩-۩۞۩-۩۞۩-

“And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus;
and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds. Many
of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and
burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and
found it fifty thousand pieces of silver… For a certain man named
Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana
\[Artemis\], brought no small gain unto the craftsmen; Whom he called
together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, you know
that by this craft we have our wealth. Moreover, you see and hear, that
not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath
persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods,
which are made with hands: So that not only this our craft is in danger
to be set at naught; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana
should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all
Asia and the world worships.” The Acts of the Apostles; chapter 19

This is just one excerpt to illustrate how the advance of the pretamata
resulted in a holocaust of books worth an enormous sum of money along
with the attack on worship of heathen deities. The books referred to
here as the “curious arts”, which were claimed to be ineffectual before
the miracles the preta, are indeed the corpus of the Greek rituals
(“witchcraft”) that were practiced by both the Greco-Romans and in a
syncretic form by the Judaists turning their back to eka-rAkShasatvam.
Despite the burnings, some of these papyri survived and were discovered
in Egypt by Mohammedan vendors in the early 1800s who sold them off to
an Armenian collector of antiquities Jean d’Anastasi. Some others were
found by a French collector in Egypt. They in turn auctioned them off to
the major museums in England, Holland, France and Germany where they
currently lie. The German scholar of Greek religion Albrecht Dieterich
made the first comprehensive study of all of these and his student
Preisendanz edited them. Their translations were published by a team
with Betz as an editor. These were supposed to be secret writings that
were only in circulation among initiates. Hence, the emperor Julian’s
statement provided by Betz applies to the spirit of the corpus:  
“Shall we write about the things not to be spoken of?  
Shall we divulge the things not to be divulged?  
Shall we pronounce the things not to be pronounced?”  
\-Julian, Hymn to the Mother of the Gods

We produce below a syncretic ritual to Apollo deployed by a Semitic
worshiper from the Betz collection translated by the American classicist
Edward N. O’Neil. We modify a few points of translation based on our own
heathen insider’s understanding of these matters (PGM 1.262-347):

Apollonian invocation: Take a seven-leafed sprig of laurel and hold it
in your right hand as you summon the heavenly gods and chthonic daimons.
Write on the sprig of laurel the seven characters for deliverance.

The characters are:  
[![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-x53dbr4MsiU/Uq_7seWYKNI/AAAAAAAACy4/jJxS0j4kwis/s288/Apollonian.jpg)](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/TL4bbFPewGijSQ1zFLFmgdMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite)

the first character onto the first leaf, then the second again in the
same way onto the second leaf until there is a matching up of the 7
characters and 7 leaves. But be careful not to lose a leaf \[and\] do
harm to yourself. For this is the body’s greatest protective charm, by
which all are made subject, and seas and rocks tremble, and daimons
\[avoid\] the characters’ magical powers which you are about to have.
For it is the greatest protective charm for the rite so that you fear
nothing.

Now this is the rite: Take a lamp which has not been colored red and fit
it with a piece of linen cloth and rose oil or oil of spikenard, and
dress yourself in a prophetic garment and hold an ebony staff in your
left hand and the protective charm in your right (i.e., the sprig of
laurel). But keep in readiness a wolf’s skull so that you can set the
lamp upon the skull of the wolf, and construct an altar of unburnt clay
near the skull and the lamp so that you may sacrifice on it to the god
\[Apollo\]. And immediately the divine spirit enters.

The burnt offering is a wolf’s eye, storax gum, cassia, balsam gum and
whatever is valued among the spices, and pour a libation of wine and
honey and milk and rainwater, \[and make\] 7 flat cakes and 7 round
cakes. These you are going to make completely \[near\] the lamp, robed
and refraining from all unclean things and from all eating of fish and
from all sexual intercourse, so that you may bring the god into the
greatest desire toward you.

Now these are the names, \[which\] you are going to write on the linen
cloth and which you will put as a wick into the lamp which has not been
colored red:  
“ABERAMENTHŌOULERTHEXANAXETHRENLYOŌTHNEMARAIBAI  
AEMINNAEBARŌTHERRETHŌBABEANIMEA.”

When you have completed all the instructions set out above, invoke the
god \[Apollo\] with this chant (in iambic pentameter and dactylic
hexameter):

*“O lord Apollo, come with Paian’*  
*Give answer to my questions, lord O master*  
*Leave Mount Parnassos and the Delphic Pytho*  
*Whenever my priestly lips voice secret words,*  
*First angel of great Zeus. IAŌ*  
*And you, MICHAĒL,who rule heaven’s realm,*  
*I call, and you, archangel GABRIEL,*  
*Down from Olympos, ABRASAX, delighting*  
*In dawns, come gracious who view sunset from*  
*The dawn, ADŌNAI. Father of the world,*  
*All nature quakes in fear of you, PAKERBĒTH.*  
*I request the god’s head, which is Olympos;*  
*I request god’s signet, which is vision;*  
*I adjure the right hand you held over the world;*  
*I adjure the god’s bowl containing wealth;*  
*I request the eternal god, ĀION of all;*  
*I entreat the self-growing Nature, mighty ADŌNAIOS;*  
*I adjure setting andrising ELŌAIOS:*  
*I adjure these holy and divine names that*  
*They send me the divine spirit and that it*  
*Fulfill what I havc in my heart and soul.*  
*Hear blessed one, I call you who rule heaven*  
*And earth and Chaos and Hades where dwell*  
*\[Daimons of men who once gazed on the light\]*  
*Send me this daimon at my sacred chants,*  
*Who moves by night to orders ‘neath your force,*  
*From whose own tent this comes, and let him tell me*  
*In total truth all that my mind designs,*  
*And send him gentle, gracious, pondering*  
*No thoughts opposed to me. And may you not*  
*Be angry at my sacred chants. But guard*  
*That my whole body come to light intact,*  
*For you yourself arranged these things among*  
*Mankind for them to learn. I call your name,*  
*In number equal to the very Moirai,*  
*ACHAIPHŌTHŌTHŌAIĒIAĒIA*  
*AIĒAIĒIAŌTHŌTHŌPHIACHA.”*

And when he comes, ask him about what you wish, about the art of
prophecy, about divination with epic verses, about the sending of
dreams, about obtaining revelations in dreams,about interpretations of
dreams, about causing disease, about everything that is a part of
magical knowledge.

Cover a throne and couch with a cloth of linen, but remain standing
while you sacrifice with the afore-mentioned burnt offering. And after
the inquiry, if you wish to release the god himself, shift the
aforementioned ebony staff, which you are holding in your left hand, to
your right hand; and shift the sprig of laurel which you are holding in
your right hand, to your left hand; and extinguish the burning lamp; and
use the same burnt offering while reciting \[in dactylic hexameter\]:  
*“Be gracious unto me, O primal god,*  
*O elder-born, self-generating god.*  
*I request the fire which first shone in the void;*  
*I adjure your power which is greatest over all;*  
*I adjure him who destroys even in Hades,*  
*That you depart, returning to your ship,*  
*And harm me not, but be forever kind.”*

Even to a casual observer, three distinct strands can be recognized in
this syncretic ritual. The first which forms the main body of the rite
is the Greek element of Indo-European vintage: The deity Apollo and the
general ritual structure is similar to purely Greek Apollonian rituals
with an altar of unbaked clay going back to the Indo-Greek period of
Indo-European or even earlier. Similarly, the fire ritual at the heart
of the rite and the invocation and releasing verses (AvAhanaM and
upasthAnaM) are essentially Indo-European in character. The
characterization of Apollo as the lord of ghosts of departed people is
again an archaic feature shared with his Hindu cognate rudra – indeed
rudra is the deity invoked in comparable vetAla prayoga-s in the Hindu
world.

Then there two distinct Afro-Asiatic elements. The first is in the form
of the archaic heathen tradition of Egypt, something entirely expected
given that these papyri were composed in Greco-Roman Egypt where some
form of the old religion was still thriving. These are apparent in the
magical incantation in a non-Greek tongue: The first beginning with the
phrase “ABERAMENTHŌ” is an Egyptian incantation to the falcon-headed god
Horus and the mysteriously therocephalic god Seth. The two deities were
often shown together in the unified Egyptian kingdoms as conferring
divine mandate to the pharaohs, and this incantation appears to be a
representation of the same divinities. The terminal palindromic
incantation with the word Thoth repeated twice means the god “Thoth is
great” and represents the other great avicephalic old Egyptian deity
Thoth with an ibis head. Then in the final incantation the phrase
“returning to your ship” is used which is clear allusion to the old
Egyptian solar deity returning to his ship. However, it should be noted
that the Indo-Aryan solar deity pUShaN is also supposed to have a ship
while traveling in the night sky \[Footnote 1\], suggesting that this
could be an old Eurasiatic motif. Finally we have another Afro-Asiatic
element that clearly emerges from a form of Semitism close to the
paleo-Abrahamism. This element sits as a patina on the underlying older
heathen traditions and is represented by the names such as Iao (Yahweh),
Adōnai, Elōaios (Elohim) and the angels Michael and Gabriel. Moreover
the use of the Semitic plurals Adonai and Elohim in a singular sense is
a clear marker that these epithets come from the the paleo-Abrahamists
rather than a para-Abrahamistic Semitic tradition.

At first sight it might seem something like what a moron svAmI would be
proud to produce. However, we posit that this is not the backdoor entry
of Abrahamism into the heathen realm but a heathen assimilation of the
paleo-Abrahamists. Importantly, the heathen deity is not cast in the
mold of an Abrahamistic eka-rAkShasa but the Abrahamistic deity is
placed within an entirely polytheistic heathen framework. Further, the
Abrahamistic angels are also elevated to impart a larger flavor of
polytheism. Thus, what this ritual and several others like this from the
PGM illustrate is the complete assimilation of the monotheistic
Abrahamist in a polytheistic heathen framework with the monotheism of
the former being entirely erased. Not surprisingly, the considerable
interest shown by their flock in the Greek religion greatly alarmed the
monotheistic paleo-Abrahamist orthodoxy and prophets who constantly
strove to get them back. For example, the paleo-Abrahamists greatly
praise one of their warrior-priests Mattathias who began the holy war
against the Greeks. But the first person he murdered was a fellow
paleo-Abrahamist because he had made offerings to Zeus at the altar.
Only thereafter he kills the Greek official who was guarding the altar.
Mattathias’ son Judah Maccabee who continued holy war also rounded up
several fellow paleo-Abrahamists, who were worshiping Greek deities, and
forcibly clipped off their foreskins. But once the Hasmonean clan of
Mattathias and Judah came to power, what happened was a civil war in
Israel between the orthodox and their cousins who followed Hellenistic
traditions to different degrees. Thus, it appears the success of the
Paleo-Abrahamistic orthodoxy in keep their flock de-paganized was not
great. However, given that the paleo-Abrahamist system is largely a
ethnocentric one \[Footnote 2\], they might have still retained their
distinct ethnicity albeit with a diluted the eka-rAkShasatvam, even as
modern science has done to them. Thus, a strong heathen tradition held
its own and could have very well attenuated eka-rAkShasatvam of the
paleo-Abrahamistic variety, which had relatively limited goals in its
holy war and saw it as a vehicle of its ethnic identity.

But why were west Asian, North African and European heathenism
eventually destroyed by the two neo-Abrahamisms? Some key points
include:  
1\) their relatively low content of ritualism. Complex and subtle
rituals generally attract the more intelligent and the educated. The
simple minded are simply overwhelmed by their complexity or are dead to
their subtlety. The great heathen thinker Celsus described the first
neo-Abrahamism as a movement of the dull-witted and the poorly educated.
The more intelligent and generally educated paleo-Abrahamists had their
own rituals and could hence be attracted by other complex ritual
systems. In contrast the first neo-Abrahamism worked well with the
simple-minded who could be easily convinced to become believing
rabble-rousers who would get martyred or destroy rituals of others. In
general the latter two Abrahmisms had great success in targeting the lay
with simple-minded arguments and enticements. Thus creating an altered
identity amongst them, which was in contrast with the elite who practice
heathen rituals in an understanding manner, the converted masses could
then be leveraged against the elite.

2\) The neo-Abrahamisms are universalizing religions which initially did
not respect any kind of preexisting ethnic boundaries. The
universalizing tendency also extended to the concept of the holy war;
much later formalized in the 3rd Abrahamism in the form of the Dar al
Harb and Dar al Islam. Thus, via the [viro-memetic form of
transmission](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/khilonmada-charcha/ "khilonmAda-charchA")
they were able to spread more widely and destroy their host
civilizations.

3\) Unlike paleo-Abrahamism who orthodoxy consciously wished to
differentiate themselves and stay away from all heathen traditions the
neo-Abrahamisms were more than willing to resort to their own digestion
of heathen traditions without letting polytheism or its subtler concepts
affect their dogmatic core. Thus, we see the emergence of the gnostic
and Sufi traditions among them.

In conclusion, we may however note the interesting phenomenon of how
eventually the first neo-Abrahamism came to become the pillar of the
identity of the leukosphere. This resulted in a “caste formation” with
the leukosphere being the higher proponents of the said Abrahamism and
the darker skinned converts placed below them as servants who have been
given the gift of civilization by the former. Of course this also led to
schisms like the various churches and their role in sub-identities
within the leukosphere and epiphenomena like the Chinese brother of
Jesus. Similar effects might be seen in the role of Shi’ism in
Islamo-Persian identity, the Ashraf/Ajlaf dichotomy and the false
Shaikhs of the sub-continent.

Footnote 2: A rare exception being the conversion of section of the
[Khazar Turks to their
religion](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/09/07/turning-of-the-turkic-wheel-the-khazar-khanate/ "Turning of the Turkic wheel: the Khazar Khanate").
But even in their midst it appears to have been muted for records
mention the continued presence of the Tengri-worshiping ritualists in
the Khazar court even after their conversion. However, this conversion
might have played a role in the antagonism between the Khazars and the
polytheistic Vikings of the incipient Kha’khanate of the Rus.
