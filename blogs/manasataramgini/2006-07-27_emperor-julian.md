title = "Emperor Julian"

+++
Many years ago when we were yapping away on the then latest production
of the socialist academic Jared Diamond, Guns Germs Steel Blah blah, we
turned our attention to two historical incidents which were reasonably
faithfully described by him. One was the destruction of the Native South
Americans by the Spanish conquistadors and the other was the
cannibalizing of one Austronesian tribe the Moriori by another the
Maori. Given his Marxist bent it is not at all surprising that he went
on to equate the two events, and try to explain them through his
universalist view of geographic contingency, which he repeats ad nauseum
in that long-winding tome. The point he missed was that, despite the
similarity in outcome, the Spanish destruction of the Native South
Americans and Mexicans was something different – the technological
difference was merely a sideshow- in reality it was the result of the
memetic infection of Isaism that had seized the European mind.

It was at this point that our mind went back to the one great Hero of
Rome, for whom we had the highest respect for long. There were a
some respectable emperors of Rome, like Julius Caesar, Augustos, Marcos
Aurelius and the like, but of all of them we could relate most to the
emperor Julian. He was the one man on whose fate the history of the
world rested and swung the bad way, as though drawn by the downward turn
of the wheel of the yuga-s. Isaism’s career and as a violent Abrahamism
that was to bring misery to the world began with the conversion of the
Roman emperor Constantine-I. His sons Constans, Constantius and
Contantine-II were even more fanatic proponents of Isaism, under whose
reigns, it began terrorizing and suppressing the old religion of the
gods. But most remarkably, the nephew of Constantine, Julian, was poised
to reverse this evil, when fate snatched his life away. His parents and
brothers, all had been killed by his cousin Constantius, and he was the
only survivor of their clan other than former. Julian had been forcibly
brought up as a Isaist, but right from an early age he repudiated this
barbarous evil, and was a secret worshiper of the gods. Secretly reading
the heathen literature he became a capable scholar and then was
initiated into several secret pagan rites like the worship of Mithra
(the Iranian cognate of our hallowed god mitra, whom we invoke daily
with the R^ik-s of vishvAmitra) and the mother of the gods. When he was
summoned by his cousin, most probably with the intention of killing him,
he paused at Athens, where the Isaists had descrated the ancient temples
and fire altars of the gods. But a cryptic heathen priest showed him
that he had actually protected the shrines and the sacrificial fires
still burned for the gods. This left a profound impression on him and he
decided to restore the old religion which was being destroyed by the
Isaists. After several victorious military campaigns against the Germans
where his cousin tried to downsize him, he was declared emperor by his
troops and restored the old rites to the gods. When finally he
challenged his cousin, who died before the battle, and Julian came to
power as the sole Roman emperor. In his short but remarkable reign he
more or less reversed the damage of the Isaistic madmen.

Julian then fatefully went to war against the Iranians thinking he was a
reincarnation of Alexander of Macedon. After initial successes in battle
against the powerful Iranian army of Shapur, he pushed deep into Iranian
territory like only one Roman emperor before him had done- Trajan. But
here he fell into the Iranian trap. Shapur’s troops cut off his
supplies, and suddenly attacked the Roman army. As his left-wing was
faltering he rushed to shore up the defenses, and in the hurry forgot to
strap his armor properly. He received a spear thrust that pierced his
ribs and punctured his liver and fell wounded. His physicians tried to
suture his wound and he feeling slightly better wanted to lead his
troops again, but his wound opened and he fell dead. With that the
Romans were beaten into an ignomious retreat by the Iranian army. Julian
was struck by an Isaist on the Roman side rather than an Iranian. At
that moment was unleased the first of the most dreaded plagues on the
world; the second was to start a few centuries later by taking down the
Iranians.

Luckily several of Julian’s writings survive and a person who is not
tainted by an Abrahamism can get glimpses of the man. A true heathen
alone today will immediately identify with Julian.

\*Firstly he realized that heathens needed name to call themselves in
order to fight the “non-self” distinguishing Isaists. Thus he coined
Hellenes, even as the only surviving heathens today, use Hindu to
describe themselves in face of the Abrahamistic attacks.

\*He developed some order for the heathens so that they could withstand
the attack of the well-organized Isaist predators.

\*He supported and developed Neo-Platonism as the philosophical
foundation of the heathen religion. This is most remarkable because
Neo-Platonism if correctly understood is remarkably parallel to the
development of the Astika darshana-s in the Indic world, with close
similarities to both sAmkhya and vedAnta. Importantly, it encompassed a
common philosophical frame work for Roman religious elements equivalent
to the temple-Agamic, tantro-yogic and vedic sacrificial religion of
India.

\*He identified himself with the both old sacrificial religion to the
old deities and the “mystery” rituals of Neo-Platonic provenance. Here
he was remarkably parallel to the highest brahmin savants of the
medieval period who was simultaneously comfortable with the shrauta and
tantric rituals.

\*He launched doctrinal attacks on the foundations of Isaism, rather
than merely terrorizing them with his state apparatus and was pretty
mild on them for all the vandalism of heathen temples and altars they
had engaged in.

We can see his far-reaching pagan visions in his works:  
  
“The Sun’s resplendent deity I sing,  
The beauteous offspring of almighty Jupiter,  
Who, through the vivifying solar fount  
Within his fabricative mind concealed,  
A triad formed of splendid solar gods;  
From whence the world’s all-various forms emerged”

\*offspring of the almighty Jupiter: nepot magnus Jovis and the famed
epithet “divo napAta” or “asuro mahodivaH” immediately resonate to one
linked to his cultural past.  
\* A triad formed of splendid solar gods: A heathen with an unbroken
link to his past can immediately see the link to that ancient motif– to
the 3 Aditya’s hymned by the R^iShi’s of yore: mitra, varuNa and
aryaman.

“Famed mystic bards of old, in sacred song,  
By thee inspired, as the arrow-darting god,  
Constant invoked thee, with resistless sway,  
Because thy vigorous beams like arrows pierce,  
And totally, whatever of measure void the world  
Inordinate or dark contains, destroy.”

\*Old sages praise the arrow-darting god: We will immediately recall the
praises of our ancestors to sharva who showers his arrows even as
Apollo– sharva=the arrow-darting god.

He was truly a great man with the true connection to the gods.
