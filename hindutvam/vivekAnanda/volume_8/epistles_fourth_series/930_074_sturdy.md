## LXXIV

WAVENEY MANSIONS,  
FAIRHAZEL GARDENS,  
LONDON N.W.  
*April, 1896*  
*Thursday Afternoon*.

DEAR STURDY,

I forgot to tell you in the morning that Prof. Max Müller also offered
in his letter to me to do everything he could if I went to lecture at
Oxford. 

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. Have you written for the *Artharva-Veda Samhita* edited by Shankara
Pandurang? 

V.
