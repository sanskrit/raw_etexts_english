piece](http://web.archive.org/web/20170304171651/http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/chhattisgarh-tirbals-development-big-companies-profits-umar-khalid-research-paper-ramjas-college-4551609/)
by Umar Khalid(note: I consider communist modes,philosophy and praxis to
be easier to analyze when you note their intellectual heritage and not
assume that these philosophies are true and universal).

Hope that Hindu organizations do something to help displaced tribals to
be closer to the Hindu mainstream,lest they be suckered in by the
śavārādhakas or the rudhiradhvajin-s. Some sort of economic-cum-social
arrangement,with a religious(dharma-centred) cement with a closely
linked network of jātis each functioning like a particular cog,with
minimal exploitation. So that the damage on both sides is minimized.

Otherwise,we know our future…

Similar things have been said by better people than me.

Also,as my friend [SV](https://twitter.com/SkandaVeera) remarked,the
role of Hindu nationalist organizations in protecting and saving these
traditions(let alone helping them spread) have been dismal(which is one
of the greatest limitations of gharwapsi programmes),instead using them
only as a means to an end(while it should be the reverse).

This and its parent cults should be battled at *all* levels-from the
lowest physical levels to the intellectual and spiritual levels. Sita
Ram Goel wrote his[analysis of Chinese
communism](http://www.voiceofin.com/pic/pdf/63.pdf)from Kolkata, but it
was Bal Thackeray’s followers who drove out the rudhiradhvajin-s from
Mumbai(and the memory of Shivaji and his successors was still fresh in
the public there), while Kolkata fell to them.
