## A HYMN TO THE DIVINITY OF SHRI RAMAKRISHNA

(*Rendered from [Bengali](khandana6205.pdf)* )

We salute Thee!  
Lord! Adored of the world,  
Samsâra's bondage breaker, taintless Thou,  
Embodiment of blessed qualities,  
Thou transcendest all Gunas: human form  
Thus bearest.  
Thee we salute and adore!

Refuge of mind and speech, Thou art beyond  
The reach of either. Radiance art Thou  
In all radiance that is. The heart's cave  
Is by Thy visitance resplendent made.  
Verily Thou art that which dispelleth  
The densest darkness of Tamas in man.

Lo! In variety of melody  
Forth-breaking in fine harmony most sweet,  
Hymns of Thy devotees, accompanied  
By Mridanga (A kind of drum) playing with music's grace,  
Fill the air, in evening worship to Thee.

One glancing vision at Thine eyes divine  
Cleared by the collyrium of Jnâna  
Defies delusion. O thou blotter-out  
Of all the taints of sin, Intelligence  
Pure, unmingled is Thy form. Of the world  
Thou art embellisher. Self-luminous  
Art Thou. O Ocean of feeling sublime,  
And of Love Divine, O God-maddened One,  
Devotees win Thy blessed feet and cross  
Safely the swelling sea of Samsara.

O Lord of the world, though Thy Yoga power  
Thou shinest as the Incarnation clear  
Of this our time. O thou of strict restraint,  
Only through Thine unstinted grace we see  
The mind in Samâdhi completely merged;  
Mercy Incarnate! austere are Thy deeds.

Thou dealest to the evil of Misery  
Destruction. Kali's (Of the Iron Age) binding cords  
Are cut by Thee asunder. Thine own life  
Thou gavest freely, O sweet Sacrifice,  
O best of men! O Saviour of the world!

Devoid wert Thou of the idea of sex,  
Thought of possession charmed Thee not. To Thee  
Obnoxious was all pleasure. Give to us,  
O greatest among Tyâgis, (Renouncers) love intense  
Unto Thy sacred feet; give, we implore!

Fearless art Thou, and past all gloom of doubt;  
Thy mind is wrapt in its own firm resolve;  
Thy lovers, whose devotion mounts above  
The realm of reason, who renounce the pride  
Of caste and parentage, of name and fame —  
Their safe refuge art Thou alone, O Lord!

My one true treasure is Thy blessed feet,  
Reaching which the whole universe itself  
Seems like a puddle in the hollow made  
By hoof of passing cow.  
O offering  
To Love! O Seer of equality  
In all! O verily, in Thee the pain  
And evil of this mortal world escapes,  
And vanishes, O cherished One.
