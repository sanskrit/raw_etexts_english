अव॑सृष्टा॒ परा॑ पत॒ शर॑व्ये॒ ब्रह्म॑संशिते  
गच्छा॒मित्रा॒न्प्र प॑द्यस्व॒ मामीषां॒ कं च॒नोच्छि॑षः  
  
” \[Once\] Released, fall on the others. O shower of arrows, O sharpened
by the sacred formulation. You go! you go assail the enemies! Of those
enemies \[nearby\] and whomever else, you shall not leave any remains.”

यत्र॑ बा॒णाः स॒म्पत॑न्ति कुमा॒रा वि॑शि॒खा इ॑व  
तत्रा॑ नो॒ ब्रह्म॑ण॒स्पति॒रदि॑तिः॒ शर्म॑ यच्छतु वि॒श्वाहा॒ शर्म॑
यच्छतु  
  
“Where the arrows fall together, like shorn lads. There, Let Bṛhaspati,
Let Aditi, give shelter to us. At all times, give shelter.”  
  
मर्मा॑णि ते॒ वर्म॑णा छादयामि॒ सोम॑स्त्वा॒ राजा॒मृते॒नानु॑ वस्ताम्  
उ॒रोर्वरी॑यो॒ वरु॑णस्ते कृणोतु॒ जय॑न्तं॒ त्वानु॑ दे॒वा म॑दन्तु  
  
“Your vulnerable spots I conceal with armor. Let King Soma, with
immortality conceal \[you\]. Let Varuṇa make your space broader from
broad. To you winning, the Gods rejoice”  
  
यो नः॒ स्वो अर॑णो॒ यश्च॒ निष्ट्यो॒ जिघां॑सति  
दे॒वास्तं सर्वे॑ धूर्वन्तु॒ ब्रह्म॒ वर्म॒ ममान्त॑रम्  
  
“He desiring to kill us– The traitor in our own kinsmen and the foreign
existing far across. Let all the Gods hurt him. This sacred formulation
is my inner armor.”

I took a good amount of liberty in the translation of the last verse.
Mostly went with Sāyana-s commentary where he makes clear that niṣṭyaḥ
is “tirobhuto dūre sthitaḥ”
