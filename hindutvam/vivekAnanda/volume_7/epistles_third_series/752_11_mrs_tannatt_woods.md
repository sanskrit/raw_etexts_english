## XI

CHICAGO,  
*10th October, 1893*.

DEAR MRS. TANNATT WOODS,

I received your letter yesterday. Just now I am lecturing about Chicago
— and am doing as I think very well; it is ranging from 30 to 80 dollars
a lecture, and just now I have been so well advertised in Chicago gratis
by the Parliament of Religions that it is not advisable to give up this
field now. To which *I am sure you will agree*. However I may come soon
to Boston, but when I cannot say. Yesterday I returned from Streator
where I got 87 dollars for a lecture. I have engagements every day this
week. And hope more will come by the end of the week. My love to Mr.
Woods and compliments to all our friends. 

Yours truly,

VIVEKANANDA.
