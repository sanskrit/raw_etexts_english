title = "The kR^ityAstra strike"

+++
We saw that kR^ityAstra course towards us and hit us even before we
could do much. The muniâ€™s efforts were blown to bits, the amAtya was
tossed aside like a twig in a storm, the shachiva simply ran away from
the scene. The effects are rather sapping- it just wears you out, and
tries to eat out and completely destroy your mantra bala. For sometime
we did not know what hit us, as though the deadly dhUmAvatI had been
sent to devour us. Our kavacha seemed to be fragmented to bits. Our
energy seemed to flow out of us like three rivers. It was indeed the
mahAyuddha as we had feared in the past.
