MURREE,  
*10th October, 1897*.

DEAR SARADA,

I am sorry to learn from your letter that you are not doing well. If you
can make an unpopular man popular, then I call you a clever fellow.
There is no prospect of work there in the future; it would have been
better had you gone rather to Dacca, or some other place. However, it is
a good thing that the work will close in November. If you get very badly
off in health, you should better come away. There is much field for work
in the Central Provinces; and even without famine, there is no lack of
poverty-stricken people in our country. Wherever it is, if you can
choose a site with an eye to prospect, you are sure to turn out good
work. However, be not sorry. What one does has no destruction — no,
never. Who knows, at that very place the future may reap golden results.

I shall very soon begin my work in the plains. I have now no need of
travelling over the mountains.

Keep watch over your health. 

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
