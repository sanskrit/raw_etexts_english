## CXLVIII

*To Sister Christine*

C/O F. H. LEGGETT, ESQ.,  
RIDGELY MANOR,  
STONE RIDGE, ULSTER CO., N.Y.

*25th October 1899*.

DEAR CHRISTINA,

What is the matter with you? Write me a line to tell me how you are and
what you are doing now.

I am tired of this place, and will come down to New York for a few days
soon. I start thence for Chicago and, if you like, will stop at Detroit
on my way to How-do-you-do. I am much better, indeed quite a different
man, though not completely cured — for that, time is necessary.

Yours,  
VIVEKANANDA.
