title = "06 The Bhrgus and the Bharata : A Text-Historical Study"

+++

The Bhrgus are unquestionably an interesting old clan.*^ Tempted by
the tantalizing affinity between the Sanskrit name Bhrgu and the Greek

in the name of ^Xevoas and of the ^Xsvvai, A. Weber^
postulated a genetic connection between the Indian and the Greek names,
and even ascribed Indo-germanic antiquity to a certain legend about Bhrgu
Vartuii preserved in the iSatapatha Brahmana (11. 6. 1), a legend of which
he thought he had discovered a parallel in Greek mythology. The facile
phonetic equation put up by Weber has not, however, commended itself to
other scholars, and we are not specially concerned with it either. But it
cannot be gainsaid that the clan is very ancient and that some of their legends
are of hoary antiquity. There are scattered notices about the Bhrgus to be
found from the Vedic Samhitas onwards through the Brahmana, Arapyaka
and Upani§ad literature up to the Epics and the Pur^as, steadily growing in
volume and importance.

£2} Not only is the clan ancient, its legends also are highly interesting.
So suggestive in fact are the early myths of this clan that they had in former
years engrossed the attention of many a student of Indian mythology, and
called forth a variety of interpretations. Thus, A. Bergagne^ looked upon
the Bhrgu myth of the Bgveda as merely a more developed form of the early
tradition about the descent of fire and identified Bhrgu with Agni. A. Kuhn^
and A. Barth® agreed in regarding the Bhrgus as personifications of the light-
ning flash, and Kuhn^ tried to harmonize the Greek myth regarding the des-
cent of fire with the Vedic. A. Weber, ^ as already remarked, saw in a legend
preserved in the' iSatapatha Brahmana a relic of primitive Indo-germanic
m 5 d:hology. But even the later legends of these people are not without a

certain amount of grandiosity and ostentation. Just consider the figure of
Parasurama : a matricide, annihilator of the K^atriyas and finally an avatdra
of Vii§jnLU (the “Preserver”) all in one.

The popularity of the Parasurama legend in India is attested by the
number of places, scattered all over India, which are associated with his name
and his exploits and held sacred to his memory.^ Near the Kangra
District‘d of the Punjab there is a very ancient temple dedicated to
Parasurama, (a name not yet applied to him in our epic), in which is depo-
sited a copper-plate grant recording the gift of a village to a Brahmin study-
ing the A. V. In the State of Udaipur^ there is a sacred pool called Mar-
kundiab where Rama is said to have bathed and atoned for his sins ;
likewise in Cape Comorin. In the Bijapur District^ of the Bombay
Presidency, an axe-shaped rock situated on a riverbank marks the spot
where Rama is represented as having washed his famous axe {para^u),
which has given him his nick-name Parasurama, Rama-with-the-Axe ; a stone
boulder situated in the river bed has preserved Parasurama’s foot-prints.
Even this irresistible axe of his has been deified, and there is in Mysore State^'^
a temple dedicated to it. Gokaijn^ shows a sacred pool dedicated to Maha-
deva, which is said to have been built by the son of Jamadagni. Even the
Lakhimpur District* of distant Assam has a pool to show to which, accord-
ing to popular belief, Parasurama had surrendered his dreaded axe, and
which attracts pilgrims from every part of India.

Notwithstanding the absorbing interest of the Bhargava myths, it is
primarily not their interpretation that is attempted here. {3} That is a task
fraught with difficulties and uncertainties, as also one which would call for a
range of knowledge and a compose of mind to which the present writer can
lay no claim. The modest aim of this paper is to collect and collate the
Bhargava references in the Mahabharata, in other words, to give a succinct
account of all that the Great Epic of India has to say about the Bhrgus. The
choice of the source-book is, I think, abundantly justified, because the Maha-
bharata, as I believe, is the richest mine for the exploration of the Bhargava
material, a veritable thesaurus of Bhargava legends, containing as it does
the largest number and the greatest variety of such legends. Even this
material is naturally not entirely new, having already attracted the attention
of scholars, but it seemed to me that it has not been studied with that degree
of attention to details which it deserves. It is a trite observation but never-

theless true that even what appears on the face of it to be a most insignificant
detail might yield a valuable clue if looked at from the correct angle, which
is often difficult to get.

My intention is to pass under review here all the important myths and
legends relating to the different Bhrgus, which occur in the Mahabharata,
subjecting them to a critical analysis : to study the manner in which they are
presented, to investigate their repetitions and even to examine their discre-
pancies. We shall find that there are many more Bhargavas mentioned in
our epic than commonly known and many more references to Bhargavas
than commonly suspected.

In essence, it must be admitted, this is merely a text-critical study, a
subject which, having engaged my attention for a number of years, has ac-
quired considerable fascination for me. But at the end of the paper it is
shown that the investigation might at the same time yield results which are
not without general value for a partial elucidation of the obscure history of
this venerable old text.

The BhargaVa references could have been presented here in many
different ways, but it appeared best to take them up for study in the sequence
in which they appear in our epic, to examine the material book by book and
chapter by chapter. The total number of passages of the Mahabharata in
which the Bhargavas are mentioned is astonishingly large. Exigencies of
space, {4} however, compelled the writer to restrict himself to the discussion
of only the more important of the references.

I add here a genealogical table which will enable the reader to follow
the legends of the Bhrgus and, the discussions about them with greater ease.
The table is made up from the data of the Mahabharata itself, but it is un-
doubtedly incomplete ; it appears to be very much abridged, lacking many
details and intermediate links.

ADIPARVANI

Strangely enough, already in the second chapter of the Adiparvan, the
Parvasarhgraha, which is in fact, for the greater part of it, something
like a Table of Contents, we make our acquaintance with one of the Bhar-
gavas, the most famous of them, Rama Jamadagnya,^ not yet a full-fledged
avatdra’^ a character which iri, reality has no connection whatsoever with the
action of the sublime tragedy which is going to be unfolded in the epic. That
comes about in this way. The place where the Mahabharata war was fought,
as everybody knows who knows anything at all about the war, was called
Kuruk^etra (Gita 1. 1) :

dharmaksetre Kuruk^etre samavetd yuyutsavah |
mdmakdh Pd};i4(wds caiva

But the Suta Ugratsravas, son of Lomahar§aoa, who recites the epic at
the twelve-year sacrificial session held in the Naimi^a Forest under the aus-
pices of Saunaka, gives the name of the place as Samantapancaka and is
careful enough to add that he had visited that sacred spot {punyam desam)
and was as a^matter of fact just returning from it (1. 1. 11 f.) :
Sammtapancakmi ndma punyam dvijanisevitam j
gatavdn asmi tarn desam yuddham yatrdbhavat pur a [|

Pdfidavdndm Kurund^h ca sarve^dih ca mxihlksitdm [
didrk^ur dgatas tasmdt samtparh bhavatdm iha ||

That obviously needed a little explication. Accordingly we find in the
beginning of the second chapter a query about this Samantapancaka from the
sages who formed the audience. They want to know all about this new place
of pilgrimage (1. 2. 1) :

Samantapancakam iti yad uktam sutanandma j
etat sarvam yathdnydyam srotum icchdmahe vayam ij
And from the story narrated by the Suta it proves to be a Bhargava place
of pilgrimage, situated probably somewhere in the neighbourhood of or with-
in the limits of Kuruk§etra.^ It was in fact, as the Suta proceeds to explain,

the sacred spot where the Bhargava Rama, the foremost of weapon-bearers
{sastrabhjt^ varalp^ 1. 2. 3), after extirpating the warrior race during the
interval between the Treta and the Dvapara Ages, had made five pools of
blood, probably forming a circle (hence obviously Samantapahcaka), and
standing in the middle of the pools the terrible man offered the uncanny
oblation of congealed blood to his forefathers, until the shades of the departed
ancestors appeared before him and pacified him, giving him the boon that
those sanguinary pools of his would become holy places of pilgrimage (1. 2,
3 ff.):

A few stanzas later we read that the Kuru-Paipdava war was also
fought at this Samantapancaka (1. 2. 9) :

antare caiva samprdpte Kali-Dvdparayor abhut 1
Samantapancake yuddham Kuru-Pdndavasenayob |j
Samantapahcaka is thus made out to be only another name of Kuruk§etra :
evidently a Bhargava name.^ The people of India have forgotten this Bhar-
gava synonym : they remember only Kuruk§etra, a name which has struck
deep root in the memory of the people. Even now at every solar eclipse
there is held at Kuruk§etra, a mammoth fair, which attracts hundreds of
thousands of devout pilgrims,'^ hailing from the different comers of India,
who reverently visit the spot hallowed by the blood of their beloved kings of
yore, those shining examples of knighthood and chivalry, who counting their
lives as straw fell fighting, waging a holy war (dharmayuddha), which has
made the Kumfc^etra a dharmaksetra.

In passing, it may be mentioned that this short account of the annihila-
tion of the K§atriyas by the Brahmin Rama Jamadagnya — a very popular
theme, as will be seen later on, with the redactors of our Mahabharata — has
been even amplified in later times by the interpolation of a short dialogue

^ Samantapancaka mentioned in Parvans 1, 3, 6, 7 and 9 only. That the war
took place at Samantapancaka is also mentioned in :

This p^assage, which is an abridged version of a dialogue occurring in the
TJrthayatraparvan, a sub-section of the Aranyakaparvan, is found at this
point only in certain Devanagaii MSS. (including those of the “ K '' Version),
and is missing in the Bengali MSS. as well as in the entire Southern recen-
sion, and therefore certainly suspect. We shall have occasion to mention
other similar enlargements of Bhargava anecdotes.

{7} The next reference to the Bhargava Rama occurs in adhy, 58 of
the Adi. and the theme is the same. The chapter, as a matter of fact, des-
cribes the circumstances which led to the incarnation of the gods and god-
desses of the Puraiiiic pantheon on this earth of ours. But the account
begins with an allusion to the great exploit of the Bhargava Rama, his total
extirpation of the bad old kings of yore (1, 58,. 4) :

trihsQptakrtvah, pfthivhh kfiva nihk^atriydm purd |

Jdmadagnyas tapas tepe Mahendre parvatottame || (I)

The first line of this stanza is worthy, of special note. It occurs, with slight
variations, over and over again in our Mahabharata, its exultant note ringing
like a distant echo in the remotest corners and crevices of this huge epos,
which was composed by Kr§na Dvaipayana to spread in this world the fame
of the high-souled P&indavas and of other puissant Ksafriyas (1. 56. 25 f.) :

Kr^na-Dvaipdyanenedam krtmh punyacikirswid 1 |
klrtim prathayatd loke Pdndavdndm mahdtmandm [
anye^dm k^atriyanam ca bhuridravinatejasdm 1 1

When the Bhargava Rama, after making a clean sweep of the K§atriyas,
retired to Mount Mahendra, on the eastern coast of India, to practise auster-
ities, there remained of the warrior caste only the females, and the I^§atriya
race was in imminent danger of becoming totally extinct (Adi. 58). When
the earth was thus bereft of K§atriya manhood, the K§atriya women, casting
aside their pride, approached the Brahmins for offspring. With these
Ki§atriya women cohabited the Brahmins of rigid vows of those times, in
pity for their sad plight. They cohabited with the K§atriya women, not
from passion, only in season, never out of season. Thus thousands of
Kj§atriya women conceived from their intercourse with pious Brahmins.
Their children were the virtuous K^atriyas, who ushered in again the Golden

Age. Thus sprang up a second K§atriya race from the surviving K§atriya
women, owing to their intercourse with ascetic Brahmins. The new genera-
tion, blessed with long life, throve in virtue. And there were again esta-
blished the four castes, having Brahmins at their head (1. 58. 8. 10) ;

Later the Asuras, defeated by the gods and expelled from heaven, in order
to continue their fight for supremacy, took birth in royal families, among
animals and elsewhere on this earth, and so again godless kings were bom
here on the earth. The goddess Earth, oppressed by this vicious and godless
creation, lodged a complaint with Brahma, who, with a view to freeing her
from the tyranny of her oppressors, ordains that the various gods and god-
desses, gandharvas and apsarases incarnate themselves, in different forms
and shapes, to wage war with the Asuras, and annihilate them.

In this legend, which is here skilfully interwoven with the much lauded
exploit of the Bhargava Rama, the Brahmin appears in the role of the
de jacto Creator of the Later K^atriyas. But in a variant version of the
same incident, which occurs in the santi (adhy. 48-49 of the Vulgate) and
which will be discussed in due course, the narrator, Sif-Kj^na himself, while
admitting that there was a general slaughter of the K?atriyas, allows that
some K§atriyas had escaped death at the hands of the Bhargava Rama and,
after his retirement to the forest, emerged from their places of concealment
and resumed sovereignty. But in this prologue to the Adiparvan, however,
VaiSampayana, as we have seen is quite certain that the K§atriyas were totally
annihilated by Rama and the race was entirely regenerated by Brahmins.

Another little digression, adhy. 60, which explains the origin and geneal-
ogy of the different orders of beings, from the gods downwards, contains also
a genealogy of the Bhargavas, the only Brahmanic genealogy, besides that
of the Angirasas^ (a clan closely connected with the Bhrgus) considered by
the epic bards worthy of inclusion in this chapter.

This confused cosmogonic account (1. 60. Iff.) begins with the enumera-
tion of the six mind-bom (mdnasa) sons of Brahma and the eleven sons
of Sthmiu, nan^ly, the eleven Rudras. The six mind-bom sons of Brahma
are : Marici, Angiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu, which list does
not include Bhrgu.® I>ak§a {9} was bom from the right thumb (angustha)

1 Even the Angirasas are shown scant courtesy. Only one generation of the
family is mentioned : the sons of Angirasas were Bfhaspati, Utathya and Samvarta ;
they had a (nameless) sister.

^ These ax “ mind-bom sons are mentioned again in 1. 59. 10.

of Brahma, and Dak§a's wife from his left thumb. Dafc^a begat fifty
daughters on his wife, of whom he gave away thirteen, in a lot, to Ka§yapa,
son of Martci. Kasyapa’s offspring were the gods and the titans.^ The
list of gods and demi-gods closes with the progeny of Kasyapa (L 60. 39) :

Immediately, after this list of celestials, come Bhygu and his descendants
(1. 60. 40) ;

BrahmOfiu) hjdayam bhittvd niksfio bhagavan BhrguJi \

The close proximity to the gods is perhaps intended to be an indication of
the high position of the Bhrgus in the Precedence List. The genealogy
given here is short and mentions only the well-known descendants of one
branch of the Bhargava clan, the branch made famous by Rama Jamadagnya.
The pedigree begins with Bhrgu, who also was a son of Brahma, being bom
by piercing his heart {hr day a).

But this ancestry of Bhrgu is in conflict with another account found in
the epic (Anusasalia 85 of the Vulgate), according to which Bhrgu was born
from the seed of Prajapati which had fallen in the fire.

The latter account has partial Vedic support, for we read in the Aitareya
Brahmaua (3. 34) that the seed of Prajapati became divided into three
parts, from which were born Aditya, Bhrgu and Ahgiras. On the other
hand, in tlie Pancavimsa Brahmaiia (18. 9. 1),^ the paternity of Bhrgu with
two others is attributed to Varuua. Further in the ^tapatha Brahmaua
(11. 6. 1. 1), Jaiminiya Brahmaoria (1. 42) Taittiriya Upani§ad (1. 3. 1. 1),
TaittirSya Arauyaka (9- 1) also, Bhrgu is said to be the son of Varui:ia ;
from Varuii^a, it is said, he obtained the knowledge of Brahma.

There seems to be partial synthesis of some of these divergent versions
in the confused Anu^sana account cited above, according tot which, while
Mahadeva, in the form of Varm,ia, was performing a sacrifice, Brahmd was
presiding and all the gods and the goddesses were present. Seeing that
assemblage of celestial damsels of exceeding beauty, desire sprang up in the
nund of Brahma, and he had an emission. As soon as the seed came out,
Brahma took it up with the sacrificial ladle and poured it, like a libation
of clarified butter, with the necessary mantras, on tlie burning fire. There-
upon £10} three beings emerged from the sacrificial fire. One arose from
the flames {bhjk) and hence he was called Bhrgu ; another came out of the
burning charcoals {ahgdra) and hence he passed by the name of Ahgiras ;
the third originated from a heap of extinguished coals and was called Kavi.
This tradition we find faintly reflected in a stanza (Adi. 216*), interpolated

Varnnasya kratau jdtah pdvakdd iti nah srutmn 1 1

Here we see that the great seer, “ Bhagavian ” Bhrgu is said to have been
produced by the self-create Lord Brahma during Varuna’s sacrifice from Fire.

However, to return to the pedigree of the Bhfgus given in Adi 60, we
lind the statement that Bhrgu had two sons, Kavi (whose son was Sukra)
and Cyavana. About both Sukra and Cyavana, we hear a great deal in our
Maliabharata. From Cyavana the short pedigree runs as follows : Cya-
vana-Aurva-IJcaka-Jamadagni-Riama. About Kavi and Rdka alone the epic
haS( not very much to narrate, but it is full of the amazing powers and the
wonderful exploits of the remaining Bhargavas mentioned here, for whom
our epic shows great predilection.

Thus we find, only a few chapters later, the epic relating at great length
the well-known story of Yayati (Yayat 3 mpiakhyana, Adi. 71-80), in which
Sukra, the Asura priest, and his haughty and ambitious daughter Devayani
play a prominent role, and which probably contains a solid substratum of
historic truth. Between Yayati and the P^^avas there intervene, according
to the computation of Pargiter, nearly ninety generations. And thus although
the connection of this episode with the main epic story is of most slender char-
acter, it possesses considerable Bhargava interest, which is probably the main
reason why it has been excerpted here from some Pur^ic source.^ The story
of Yayati is introduced in the epic in the following manner.

In adhy, 70, Vaisarhpayana briefly sketches the early history of the
Lunar Dynasty, incidentally mentioning Yayati and his five sons. Jana-
mejaya is not satisfied with this sketchy account and requests Vaisampayana
to relate in detail the story of Yayati, a remote ancestor of the Pi^'cjavas,
“tenth in descent from Prajapati ” {dasmna yah Prajdpateh 1. 71. 1). The
story of Yayati is as follows.

£11} Brhaspati, son of Angiras, was the preceptor of the Devas, the
Bhargava Sukra (Kavya U^as) that of the Asuras. Sukra, a powerful
sorcerer, like all the other Bhargavas, had the knowledge of the secret of
reviving the dead {samjlvam vidyd); not so Brhaspati. The Devas were
therefore handicapped in their wars with the Asuras. So at the instance
of the Devas Brhaspati’ s son Kaca goes to Sukra, who was then the priest
sorcerer of the Asura king ViT^parvan and lives with him as his disciple in
order to obta'in from him a knowledge of the art of reviving the dead.
Sukra*s beautiful daughter Devayani falls headlong in love with Kaca, son
of Brhaspati, and boldly proposes marriage, an honour which Kaca politely
but firmly declines. Subsequently one day when Devayani ahd Sarmi§tha,


1


It recurs almost verbatim in the Matsya Puraaja (adhy. 25-42).

the daughter of the Asura Vrsaparvan, are having a bath in a neighbour-
ing river, Indra tossed their clothes about, which had been left by the girls
on the river bank, so that Sarmii^thia by mistake took up the dress of Deva-
yanl. There ensues a hefty quarrel between the girls, and Sarmi§tba throws
her rival into a dry well overgrown with grass. And there she remains until
she is seen and pulled out of the well by the gallant king Yayati, whom she
promptly woos and who with the approval of her father, Sukra, marries her.
Previously, as a recompense for her overbearing conduct towards Devayani,
Sarmi^tha, the Asura princess, had become Devayani’s slave. She now ac-
companies Devayani to the capital of Yayati and the three people live in
happiness together for some time. Yayati has been warned beforehand by
the Asura priest Sukra that he must on no account call iSarmi^ha on to his
bed : she was only a slave-girl belonging to Devayani’s entourage. But
Sarmistha prevails upon the soft-hearted and indulgent Yayati, by dint of
importunity and feminine logic to act so that her menstrual period will not
be wasted, for the husband of one's friend is as good as one’s own hus-
band ”. Yayiati moved by her importunities admits the logic of ^armistha’s
requisition and begets on her secretly three sons, while Devayani has only
two. Devayani learns the truth of the whole affair one day by accident,
and goes in a huff to her father, complaining bitterly of the perfidy of her
husband. The enraged Asura priest Sukra curses Yayati that he would
instantly suffer the effects of premature decrepitude, and so it happens.
Sukra relents, however, and adds that, as Yayati had acted from pure
motives he might transfer his premature old age at will to any one who is
willing to take it on in his stead. Accordingly Yayati exchanged his de-
crepitude for the youth of his youngest son, £12} Puru scm of the Asura
princess tSatmi^tha, who was the only one of his five sons willing to take
on his old age and to whom he subsequently handed over his vast kingdom
as a reward for his filial affection.

In this version of the Yayaiti legend, the Bhargavi Devayani has it all
her own way and poor sarmistha, the Asura princess has been thrust in the
background except in the finale, which raises §armi^thia’s youngest son to
the throne and the tables are turned on Devayani, the daughter of the Asura
priest, Sukra. In spite of the Yayatyupakhyana, Indian traidition honours
Sarmii^ha as the pattern of a wife most honoured by her husband ; for in
Kalidasa’s famous drama, when Ka^yapa gives his parting blessing to his
beloved daughter, Sakuntalia, he could think of no better boon than to wish
that she might be like Samii#ia :

mention already for the third time in adhy. 98 of the Adi : this time in the
course of a conversation between Bhi§ma and SatyavatS. The continuance
of the royal family of Kurus was sorely jeopardized by the untimely death
of both the sons of iSamtanu, Citr^gada and Vicitravirya. Satyavati asks
Bhi§ma to marry the young and beautiful widows of his half-brother
VicitravJrya ahd beget children on them for the continuation of the race
of the Kurus, a proposal which Bhi§ma firmly rejects as that would mean
a deliberate breaking of his vow of celibacy. He proposes instead that a
Brahmin be called to officiate {niyoga) and do the job. He cites a prece-
dent for this apaddhmmu. It is po other than the story of the Bhargava
Rama and its sequel. To avenge the death of his father, Bh!§ma relates,
the Bhargava Rama slew Arjuna, the son of Krtavirya, king of the Haiha-
yas. Then he set out on his war chariot to conquer the world. And taking
up his bow, he hurled his mighty magical missiles {astras) and exterminated
the K^atriyas more than once. In days of yore this illustrious descendant
of Bhrgu annihilated the K!?atriyas thrice seven times (1. 98. 3) :

trihsaptakrtvab prthivl kfta nihksatriyd pmd\ (II)

Then from a high sense of duty, the virtuous Brahminsl of the £13} day,
skilled in the Vedas, co-habited with the widows of the Kai^triyas massacred
by the Bhargava Rama and begat on them offsprings and thus revived the
almost extinct race of the K§atriyas. Satyavati should unhesitatingly follow
this excellent precedent and arrange for the revival of the dying race of the
Kurus.

So far we have come across only legends of the past achievements of
the Bhargavas. The first reference to a direct contact between a Bhargava
and one of the epic characters occurs in adhy. 121 of the Adi, In this pseudo-
historical epic, the myth may not be properly regarded as concerned with
events in time. Therefore the Bhargava Rama, who only a few chapters
previously is said to have lived in the interval between the Treta and the
Dvapara Ages is here represented as the teacher {gum) of Acarya Dropa,
who lived in the interval ‘between the Dvapara and the Kali Ages. The pu-
pilship is only symbolical, but the basis of the symbolism is significant.
Acarya Dropa is the guru of the Kauravas and the Plapdvas and of all the
other valiant K^atriyas of the time, and he was also one of the greatest war-
riors on the side of the Kauravas in the Bharata War. But Acarya Dropa
must also have a guru. And who would be more suitable as guru than the
Bhargava Rama, who is the foremost of all weapon-bearers {sarvaiastrabhr-
tdnt verab) ?

Once the symbol has been accepted, it is treated as real, and the myth is
worked out in great detail. Thus we are told that when Dropa had finished
his studies and taken up the duties of a house-holder, he began to feel the
pinch of poverty. He then happened to hear that the Bhargava Rama was
bestowing wealth on Brahmins. No inconsistency or anachronism is fdt, be-

cause Rama is assumed to be “ever-living" {cirajivin). So Drorja presented
himself before the great Bhargava, who was about to start for the forest, and
asked for sofne wealth for himself. Rama ruefully confessed to him that
whatever wealth he at one time possessed he had freely presentai to the
Brahmins ; he had even presented the earth to Ka^yapa, his sacrificing priest.
And now he had nothing left except his mortal body and his weapons and
magical missiles (astras). He asked Droina to cho^ what he wanted.
Drona of course chose the famous missiles with which Rama had conquered
the whole earth. Rama accordingly gave all his £14} weapons to Droina,
instructing him at the same time fully in the science of arms.

This story of Droina and Rama was apparently popular, for we find it
repeated in an abridged form in adhy. 154, it being related there to the
davas by a Brahmin, who was urging them to proceed to the capital of Dru-
pada to attend the sv ay ark vara of Draupadi.

We learn another fragment of Bhargava history from adhy. 169 to 172
of the Adi, the Aurvopakhyana, which is, as a matter of fact, a digression
within a digression.

While the P^dava brothers were proceeding by slow stages to the capi-
tal of king Drupada to attend Draupadi s svayamvara, they are opposed on
the way by Citraratha Afigaraparna, king of the Gandharvas, whom Arjuna
after a brief fight overcomes. Citraratha and Arjuna soon become close
friends. This sudden friendship gives the necessary opportunity to the skil-
ful raconteur to smuggle in some stories. Citraratha, as a matter of fact,
relates to Arjuna a number of interesting but flimsily motivated anecdotes,
which are a pure and unadulterated digression, among them the well-known
story of Vasi^tha. It is related how Vi^vamitra, king of Kanyakubja, tried
to seize Vasi§tha’s sacred cow (kamadhemi) and, failing, turned ascetic and
in the end became a Brahmin ; how king Kalma^pada Saudasa was cursed
by Vasi^tha’s son Sakti (or Saktri) to become a cannibal and how he began
his career as a cannibal by devouring Vasi§tha’s own sons including §akti ; how
Vasii§.tha subsequently freed the king from the effects of the curse. Then
finally to dissuade his enraged grandson Para§ara, son of Sakti, from destroy-
ing the whole creation in his frenzy, Vasi^tha relates to him the story of the
Bhargava Aurva. It will thus be seen that the Bhargava legend is emboxed
within the Vatsi§itha l^end, which is itself an episode of the Caitraratha
section. This story of Aurva is as follows.

Once upon a time there was a king by name Krtavirya of the Haih-
yas, whose family priests were the Bhrgus. On them he bestowed great
wealth. After his death the princes of his family, for some reason or other,
demanded it back. The Bhrgus came out with some of it, but not all. It
then happened that one of the Ki?atriyas, accidentally digging the ground in
the settlement of the Bhrgus, came upon a large store of wealth buried under
{15} ground. Enraged at what they naturally considered deceitful conduct



290


EPIC STUDIES


on the part of the Bhrgus, the K^atriyas used violence to the Bhrgus, and
slew them all indiscriminately. The K^atriyas evai hunted down the women
of the Bhrgusi, and with a view to exterminating the race killed all those that
were pregnant. Pursued by the Ki§atriyas, some of the Bhtgu women took
shelter in the inaccessible fastnesses of the Himalayas. One of these womens
in order to perpetuate the race of the Bhargavas, had concealed her embryo
in her thigh. The K§atriyas, when they came to know of it, pursued her
with the intention of decimating her embryo ; when, lo and behold, the -child
was bom from his mother s thigh, blinding the Haihayas with his lustre.
Bereft of sight, they roamed about in the forest, and, meekly approaching
the faultless Brahmin lady, prostrated themselves before her, begging that
their eyesight might be restored. ‘‘ My good sirs ”, said the Brahmin lady,
“ I have not robbed you of your eyesight, nor am I angry with you. But
this scion of the Bhrgus seems certainly to be angry with you. Your eyesight
has no doubt been destroyed by this high-souled Bhargava, whose wrath has
been kindled by the massacre of his kinsmen. When you took to destroying
even the embryos of the Bhrgu race, the child was held by me concealed in
my thigh for one hundred years. That he may do good to the Bhrgu race,
the entire Veda with its six mgas revealed itself to him when he was still in
the womb. Being enraged at the slaughter of his kinsmen, he desires to kill
you. It is by his divine effulgence that your eyesight has been destroyed. Pray
therefore, my good sirs, to this excellent son of mine, bom of my thigh
{uru) ; and pacified by your humbly prostrating yourself before him, he
may restore your eyesight Thereupon all those Ksatriyas on their bended
knees said to that high-bom child, “Forgive us”, and the high-bom child
forgave them. But that descendant of the Bhargava race did not forget that
outrage and resolved in his mind upon destroying this wicked world. With
that object in view he started performing the most severe austerities. By
the intensity of his austerities he afflicted all the worlds. On learning what
Aurva was doing to avenge the wrong done to them by the Ksatriyas, the
shades of his ancestors came to him and addressed his as follows : [16} “0
Aurva, O child, the prowess of thy fierce austerities has been seen by us.
Control thy anger and forgive the people.” They explain to him that the
Ksatriyas were really not to blame for the slaughter of the Bhrgus ! How
could those puny Ksatriyas ever hope to kill the Bhargavas? That contre-
temps was a little contrivance of the Bhargavas themselves. The fact was
that the Bhargavas were tired of their lives and longed to die, but death dared
not touch them, those sinless effulgent specimens of humanity, and suicide
was a cowardly act and a sin. They had therefore staged that little quarrel
with those foolish and arrogant K§atriyas, so that the Ksatriyas might get en-

raged and kill them, as they did. Of what use could wealth be to those
emancipated souls, whose sole desire was to obtain heaven ? Aurva replies
that they may be all true, but he had made a vow to destroy the world in
order to calm his own anger and he must destroy it, or else he would be
destroyed himself by the fire of his uncontrollable wrath. And so the world
was in imminent danger of being totally destroyed ! But the ancestors of
Aurva show him a way out of the dilemma. They wisely advise him to
fling the fire of his wrath in the waters, which are the primeval source and
support of the world, and Aurva does so. And now, in the shape of horse s
head [hayasiras), his wrath dwells in the ocean, consuming its waters, which
are the world (lokd hy dpomaydh smrtdh. 1. 171. 19).

In the above legend we may notice some of the repeated motives of Bhai -
gava stories. There is first of all the feud with the K§atriyas, which finally
develops into the creation of the figure of the Bhargava Rama, “ the foremost
of all weapon-bearers, ” who single-handed, with the aid of his magical wea-
pons, the astras, conquers the whole earth, annihilating the Ki§atriyas thrice
seven times. Then there is the motif of the opportune birth of a miraculous
child, whose effulgent lustre either blinds the oppressor (as here) or con-
sumes him (as in the case of Cyavana) . There is, lastly, the appearance of
the shades of the ancestors, who step in to stop the carnage either contemplat-
ed (as here) or actually perpetrated (as in the case of Rama), to avenge
some private wrong done with reference to the family.

£17} Sabhaparvan

The short Sabha, which is a compact little book with 81 chapters and
about 2700 stanzas, (in the Vulgate), begins with the Erection of the Darbar
Hall and ends with the Second Gambling Match. Here the story marches
forward by rapid strides, consisting as it does mainly of spirited dialogue and
dramatic action. The digressions are few and far between, and of updkhyd-
nos as such there are none. The real important digressions, which occur early
in the beginning, are two : firstly,, the somewhat lengthy and imaginative
descriptions {dkhydnas) by Narada of the halls of the celestials Indra, Yama,
Varuoa, Kubera, and Brahma, preceded by a short Niti tractate (adhy. 5-12) ;
and, secondly, the previous history of Jarasaihdha, narrated by Ki^a (adhy.
17-19) . Consequently, in this parvan, the Bhargava material is extremely
scanty.

The Bhargavas are nevertheless briefly mentioned several times. Thus,
naturally, many of the Bhargavas, to wit, Blrrgu, Markaodeya, Rama, Ja-
madagnya, are several times mentioned as being present, along with other
famous sages and seers of the past, in the halls of the celestials mentioned
above, as also as a matter of course in the newly erected hall of Yudhi^thira.
In adhy. 8, Rama has been placed by mistake among the royal sages (rd-
jar^is). They are likewise present at the coronation of Yudhi§thira. These



292


EPIC STUDIES


Static figures are like tnural decorations, and of no special interest to us.
We shall therefore ignore them.

Rama’s extermination of the K§atriyas, which is really never quite for-
gotten by our bards, is mentioned in adhy. 14. KrsDa prefaces his long
reply to Yudhi§thira regarding the prerequisites of the Rajasuya sacrifice by
pointing out, quite irrelevantly, that the contemporary K^atriyas were far in-
ferior to that old race of Eu^triyas that was exterminated by the Bhargava
Rama (B. 2. 14. 2) :

Jdmadagnyena Rdmena k§atram yad avasesitam |
tasmdd <w<xrajmh loke yad idani k^atrasamjnitam 1|

It was mentioned above that the high esteem in which our epic bards
held Rama Jamadagnya had led to his being represented as the teacher of
Acarya Drona in the science of arms. The same ideology is responsible for
the sedulously fostered belief that Rama was the teacher of Bhi§ma also, an
idea which is taken hold of £18} and further developed in that late addition
to the Udyoga,, the Amba episode (Ambopakhyana). Rama is represented as
standing in the same relation to Kama, the protege and ally of Ehiryodhana.
So, in his denunciation of Kr§na, Sisupala mentions Karna’s pupilship under
Rama as one of Karna’s qualifications entitling him to receive the argha
(B. 2, 37. 15 f.) :

This book is a veritable thesaurqs of ancient Brahmanic myths and le-
gends. We accordingly find that a fair amount of Bhargava material has
been incorporated in it. We further find that one Bhargava takes a con-
siderable share in the story-telling that is done here.

The first important deference to the Bh^gus is in the Tirthayatra sec-
tion. The list of fiyikas given in adhy. 82 ff (of the Vulgate) is said to
have been first communicated^ by the sage Pulastya to Bhji^ma and then re-
peated by Narada to Yudhisthira. It is in reality a material compendium
of tirthas, which gives, in the space of a stanza or two, the necessary details
about the particular tirtha : the name of the tirtha, the ritual acts to be done
there, and finally the merit {purj^ya) accruing from these acts. Thus, for
example we read (B. 3. 83. 13 ff.):

‘‘O king, going to iSalukin! and bathing in the Dasasvamedha, the pil-
grim obtains the merit of performing 10 asvamedha sacrifices. — Then going to
Saipadevi, that excellent tirtha of the Nagas, one obtains the merit of per-
forming 1 agnktoma sacrifice and goes to the world of the Nagas.-— One
should then proceed, O virtuous man, to (the shrine of) Tarantuka, the gate-
keeper. Staying there only for one night, one obtains the merit of giving

293


away 1000 kine. — Then going to the Pahcanada, with regulated diet and sub-
dued soul, and bathing in the Kotitlrtha, one obtains the merit of perform-
ing 1 asvamedhu sacrifice. Going to the tirtha of the Asvins, a man is bom
handsome (in a future birth, of course). — One should then go, O virtuous
man, to the excellent £19} tirtha called Varaha, where Vi§iiu in times of yore
appeared in the form of a boar. Bathing there, O foremo^ of men, one
obtains the merit of performing 1 agnistoma sacrifice. — O king of kings, one
should then visit Somatirtha, situated in Jayanti. Bathing in it, one obtains
the merit of performing 1 rdjasuya sacrifice. — Bathing in Ekaharhsa, one ob-
tains the merit of giving away 1000 kine.-~0 ruler of men, going to the
Krtasauca, the pilgrim becomes purified, and obtains the merit of perform-
ing 1 pundartka sacrifice. — Then going to Munjavata, the place sacred to
Sthanu, and fasting for one night, one acquires the position of gdnapatya
And so on and so forth.

Only very rarely is this dreary enumeration intermpted by a brief ac-
count of some myth or legend connected with the place of pilgrimage in
question. Now we find embedded in this list the legend connected with the
Ramahradas (B. 3. 33. 26 ff.), which appears to have considerably roused
the interest of the compiler and to which he has devoted not less than 32
lines. The story is of course no other than that of the extirpation of the
Ksatriya race by the Bhargava Rama, of which this is already the jourth
repetition in some form or other. The story is as follows.

The greatly effulgent and heroic Rama, after exterminating the K^atri-
yas with great valour, formed five lakes filled with the blood of the slaughter-
ed warriors. And he offered that blood as oblation to his forefathers, who
were most gratified by this supreme act of filial piety. The shades of these
ancestors appeared before him and addressed him as follows : “ O Rama, O
Rama, O fortunate one ! We are pleased, O Bhargava, with thy filial piety
and with thy great valour.. Ask for a boon, O greatly effulgent one. What
dost thou wish to have ? Having been thus addressed by his ancestors,
Rama, that foremost of smiters {Rdmah pruharatdm varah B. 3. 83. 31),
thus spoke with joined hands to his ancestors : “ If you are pleased with me
and if I have deserved your favour then by your grace I desire that I may
again derive pleasure in asceticism. By your power, may I be freed
from the sin I have incurred by killing these K^atriyas in a fit of
wrath. Also may these sanguinary lakes become holy places of pilgrimage
celebrated throughout the world . Hearing these righteous words of Rama,
his ancestors were highly pleased, £20} and filled with joy they thus replied
to Rama : “ Let thy austerities prosper, especially by virtue of thy filial piety.
Forsooth thou hast exterminated the K§atriyas in a fit of wrath, but thou
art already freed from that sin, for they have fallen owing to their own mis-
deeds. These lakes of thine shall without doubt become places of pilgrimage.
He who will bathe in these lakes and offer here oblations to his ancestors will



294


EPIC STUDIES


please his manes and they will gratify all his heart’s desire, and lead him
to the eternal celestial regions”. Having granted these boons to Rama and
affectionately taken leave of him, the shades became invisible. It was thus
that the bloody lakes of that illustrious descendant of Bhrgu became sacred
places of pilgrimage. — Leading the life of a student of the sacred lore and
observing sacred vows, if a person bathes in the Lakes of Rama (Ramahra*
da) and worships Rama, he will obtain much gold.

The reader will easily recognize this as the story which was briefly re-
lated already in connection with Samantapaflcaka. In fact Ramahrada ap-
pears to be only another name of Samantapancaka, one of the Urthas explicit-
ly mentioned as having been visited by the Suta (that is, the putative narrator
of the Mahabharata), before he came to Saunaka’s sacrifice. It will be re-
called that some information was asked then about Samantapancaka in adhy.
2 of the Adi, and in that connection this story was briefly narrated by the
Suta to the sages of the Naimi^a Forest. There the story was originally
summarized in four stanzas, but some subsequent reviser, apparently not
satisfied with such a cursory allusion to this epoch-making feat of Rama, had
interpolated at that place the dialogue between Rama and his ancestors
(compressed into eight lines) made up mostly of bits and pieces of verses
borrowed from the present context, and like all interpolations proving itself
to be somewhat of a bad fit.

A few chapters later, we have a strange story of a conflict between two
different avataras of the same god, Visnu, between the Jamadagnya Rama
and the Da^rathi Rama, told in connection with a Bhrgutirtha, ” celebrated
in the three worlds, which Yudhi§thira and his party are said to have visited
(B. 3. 99. 34 ff). Once upon a time, the story goes, Rama Jamadagnya went
to Ayodhya to meet Rama Dasarathi and to test his strength. {21} Rama
D. was sent by his father to the boundary of his kingdom to receive Rama
J. hospitably, but was flagrantly insulted by the latter. Rama D. nevertheless
bends the bow given to him by Rama J. to test his strength and shoots an
arrow which convulses the whole world, astounding Rama J. Rama D. further
confounds Rama J. completely by showing him his cosmic form (visvmupa),
made popular by the Gita (adhy. 11), and rebukes him for his( overweening
conduct. Abashed, Rama J. returns to Mount Mahendra, having lost his
lustre {tejm), which he regains later at some tlrtha or other. Yudhi^thira is
asked to baithe in the same tlrtha that he might regain the lustre he had lost
in his conflict with Duryodhana.

This grotesque story, composed probably with the object of glorifying
the K§atriya Rama at the cost of the Brahmin Rama, must be quite a modem
interpolatiooi in the Mahabharata. Contextually it is an obvious mis-
fit, being incongmously wedged in between two halves of the Agastya legend,
with which it has absolutely no connection. Not only is this bizarre story
contextually a mi^t, it is a very poor piece of composition, and it strikes



EPIC STUDIES VI


295


moreover a discordant note, involving disrespect towards the Bhargava Rama,
who in our epic is otherwise throughout held up for air admirations as the^
foremost of weapon-bearers and fighters. Fortunately we are not left to
deduce the spuriousness of this passage merely from intrinsic arguments,
which are apt to be discredited ; for, the passage is missing entirely in the
Southern recension, an omission supported by the Kasmirl version and even
by some ancient Devanagari MSS. The story, which is narrated at some
length in the Ramayatna, is not even alluded to in the Ramopakhyana of our
epic and belongs evidently to a different complex of legends, quite inharmo-
nious with the Mahabharata context. It appears to have been smuggled into
the capacious folds of the Arajiyakaparvan in quite recent times by some
well-meaning but ignorant Northern interpolator anxious to vindicate the
claim of the epic to be a complete encyclopaedia of the Hindu legendary lore.^

But the next chapter (100) again contains a Bhargava story, the legend
of Dadhica. Lomasa relates how the Kalakeyas under the leadership of
Vrtra persecuted the celestials, who betook them-{22}-selves to Brahma ask-
ing for his protection. The latter advises them to go to the (Bhargava) Da-
dhica and ask for his bones. The sage magnanimously gives up his body
for the good of the three worlds. The celestials took the bones of Dadhica
to Visvalcarman, the architect of the gods, who fashioned out of his tones
the thunderbolt, with which Indra vanquished the enemies of the gods. The
story is repeated in the account of the pilgrimage of Baladeva (sSalya 51 in
the Vulgate), where it is said of Dadhica that he was the strongest of all
creatures, tall as the Himalayas and that Indra was always mightily afraid
of him on account of his lustre.

Yet again, a few chapters later, the arrival of Yudhisthira and his party
at Mount Mahendra, the headquarters of Rama, now a samnydsin, affords
a welcome opportunity to the bard for the presentation of a full-length por-
trait of the hero of the Bhargavas, Rama, son of Jamadagni (Arainyaka 115-
117 in the Vulgate) .

The Pandavas bathe at the mouth of the Ganges and proceed to the river
Vaitaraiii in Kalinga, where the altar of Kasyapa is. They rest on Mount
Mahendra and hear there from Akrtavrana, a disciple of the Bhargava Rama,
the well-known story of Rama, which may be summarized as follows.

Gadhi, king of Kanyakubja, had retired to the forest to practise reli-
gious austerities. There a most beautiful daughter was tom to him, Satya-
vati, whom the Bhargava Rcika wooed. Gadhi perhaps did not re-
lish his suit and tried to evade it by demanding a present of
a thousand peculiarly coloured horses, but Rcika supplied them
and gained her. Then a Bhrgu (perhaps, Aurva is meant), who
was a great sorcerer, visits the newly married couple and gives his young

daughter-in-law the boon that she would give birth to a gifted son, and so
would her mother. To fortify the boon, he prescribes that she should em-
brace an udumbara tree, her mother an asvattha, and both should partake of
different dishes of some special earn prepared by him with powerful incanta-
tions and endowed with magical potency. These good ladies go and ex-
change the trees as well as the dishes of earn which were apportioned to them
by the great sage, with the result that the daughter was about to give birtli
to a Brahmin son with K§atriyan qualities and the mother a K^atriya son
with {23} Brahmanic qualities. But the Bhrgu, who comes to know of this
interchange by occult means, comes rushing to the hermitage and tells his
daughter-in-law what was going to happen. Moved by her entreaties, he gives
a further boon to the young woman who had really been deceived by her mo-
ther, postponing the action of the potent charm. Thus her son Jamadagni
was saved from the taint of K)§atriyahood, which ultimately fell upon her
grandson Rama, who turned out to be, as prophesied, a revengeful and blood-
thirsty warrior, perpetrator of cruel and sanguinary deeds. Jamadagni,
though a peaceful Brahmin who excelled in the study of the Vedas, as de-
sired by his mother, was not without martial equipment, for “the entire
science of arms with the four kinds of magical missiles spontaneously came
to him, who rivalled the sun in lustre, without any instruction from any-
body” (B. 3. 115. 45). Jamadagni married Renuka, daughter of king Pra-
senajit. She gave birth to five sons : Rumanvat, Suseina, Vasu, Visvavasu,
and last but not least Rama, The family lived happily for some time. Then
one day when Reriuka of rigid vows happened to see Citraratha, the hand-
some king of Marttikavataka, sporting in water with his numerous wives,
her fortitude forsook her and she felt the pangs of desire. When she return-
ed to the hermitage, Jamadagni noticed her pollution and guessed her secret.
In a fit of rage he called in turn upon each of his sons to kill their unchaste
mother. Four of them refused to do the atrocious deed and were cursed
by the angry and disappointed father for their disobedience. Then came the
last of all that “ slayer of hostile heroes, ” Rama Jiamadagnya. A military
type, accustomed to receive and obey orders, Rama, when sternly command-
ed by his father to slay his mother, took his axe and without hesitation
chopped off his mother’s head ! Jamadagni, mightily pleased with the ins-
tant obedience of his son, granted Rama several boons, among thetn the boon
that the mother whom Rama had decapitated might be restored to life.
And the family lived again happily for some time. Then one day Arjuna
Kartavirya Sahasrab^u came to the hermitage and was hospitably received
by the Bhargavas. The ungrateful king, intoxicated with the pride of power,
not heeding the hospitality, seized and carried off by force from the hermit-
age the calf of the sacred cow of the sage (a variant of the kamadhem motif
of the Vasii^tfia-{24}-Vi4vSmitra legend), and spitefully broke the big tree
in the hermitage grounds. This was the beginning of a terrible feud. Rama

first slew the arrogant Arjuna Kartavirya, and Arjuna's sons then slew the
unresisting Jamadagni. Then Rama slaughtered the sons of Arjuna K. and
finally destroyed all K§atriyas off the earth thrice seven times and made five
pools of blood in Samantapancaka (B. 3. 117. 9) ;

triljLsaptakTtvah prthivim krtvd ni^k^atriydm prabhuh 1
Samontapancake pane a cakdra rudhirahraddn \\ (III)

Standing in the middle of these pools of blood — as has already been nar-
rated several times above — Riama offered oblations to the manes until at
last his ancestor R.lcka appeared and stopped him. Rama then performed
a great sacrifice to gratify Indra, in which he bestowed the earth upon Kas-
yapa, his priest. Then this annihilator of the Ksatriya race was at last satis-
fied and retired to Mount Mahendra, engaging himself in austerities of a
rather severe type. “ Thus did hostility arise between Rama and K§atriyas
of this earth, and the entire earth was conquered by Rama of immeasurable
lustre” (B. 3. 117. 15). It is then narrated that the Bhiargava Rama
appeared there in person on Mount Mahendra to meet the Piaiitjavas. He
was duly received and honoured by Yudhi§thira and his party, and he
honoured them in turn.

This account has been amplified in later times — like several other Bhar-
gava episodes — by the addition of a passage of 23 lines (B. 3. 115. 9-19),
which is prefixed to it and which is chiefly of interest on account of the vague
suggestion it contains to the effect that Bhiargava Rama was an avatdra of
Vi§j>u. This interpolation begins with the previous history of Arjuna Karta-
virya, king of Haihayas. He is represented here as a worshipper of DattS.-
treya, by whose favour he had obtained a golden vimdna and a wonderful
chariot. Intoxicated with the pride of power, Arjuna Kartavirya insulted
Indra, trampled upon the sages and even upon the celestials, and persecuted
all creatures. Thereupon the celestials and the sages met together and went
in a body to Vi^aju to ask for his protection. Then the exalted god (Vi§iiu)
held a consultation with Indra. The god of gods (Indra) told Vwu what
had to be done. Thereupon the exalted go4, promising to do the needful,
went to Badan, his £25} favourite retreat. — Here the introduction suddenly
breaks off, and the story narrated about Gadhi and Rcika begins (B. 3. 115-
20). The suggestion probably is that at the consultation between Indra
and Vi§!iTiu it was decided that Vi§iiu should incarnate himself on the earth
as the son of Jamadagni, as Riama Jamadagnya, who should, in the fulness
of time, slay Arjuna Kartavirya, but that is left unsaid. The passage is
missing in the entire Southern recension and in some Northern manuscripts
including those of the Kasmiii version. There can therefore be no doubt
about its being a comparatively recent interpolation.

As already remarked above, Rama Jamadagnya and the other BhSrgavas
such as Cyavana, IJdka and so on are generally used as static figures, along
with other ancient sages like Niarada, in the description of largely attended

and important meetings and state functions, and such treatment of these
characters is quite intelligible, if not natural. But the Bhargavas — and es-
pecially the Bhargava Rama — are accorded a somewhat different treatment ;
they are represented as taking part in the action more definitely and more
frequently. We have seen that the Bhargava Rama is said to have given all
his astras to Dro|na. He is also said to have taught Bhli^ma and Karpa.
Here he is represented as having shown himself to the P^davas, as a special
favour. In another context Rama is said to have fought with Bhl^ma,, a fight
which lasted for twenty-three days but was absolutely barren of any conse-
quence. Elsewhere also we shall find Rama and some of other Bhargavas re-
presented as taking some innocuous part in the action, which in no way
affects the course of events but which serves to establish and maintain con-
tact between the Bhargavas and the epic characters.

The above story of Rama, which is miscalled the Kartaviryopakhyana,
ends at adhy. 117 of the Vulgate. At adhy. 122, we have another Bhargava
story, which covers adhy. 122-124 and about half of adhy. 125 : the story
of the great wizard Cyavana, son of Bhrgu.

The Pl^davas reach the Payo^iii and the Narmada rivers and hear from
Lomasa the story {updkhydna) of Cyavana : how he demanded in marriage
a young princess, by name Sukanya, who £26} had innocently and unwit-
tingly blinded him ; how he recovered his sight by the grace of the Asvins
and how he gave them on that account that Soma libation, paralyzing the
arm of Indra, who would have prevented it. The story runs thus.

Cyavana, son of Bhrgu, practised austerities in a forest so long that an
ant-hill was formed round him. There came one day to that place king Siar-
yati, acompanied by his daughter Sukanya, with beautiful eyebrows and
tapering thighs. The sage imprisoned within the ant-hill gazed longingly at
the youthful princess, clad in a single garment ai>d adorned with costly orna-
ments, and addressed some words to her which sihe did not hear. Sukanya
saw, however, the gleaming eyes of the sage, engaged in self-mortification in
the ant-hill, and mistaking them for a species of glow-worm, in youthful
heedlessness, pierced the eyes of the sage with a thorn. Little did she think
of the dire consequences of her childish act. For through the anger of the
offended sage, smarting with the pain thoughtlessly inflicted on him by the
heedless princess, the king’s entire army suffered suddenly from a complete
stoppage of urine and excreta. The bewildered king inquired about the cause
of this strange mishap, but none of his soldiers and companions could en-
lighten him. The occurrence remained a mystery until the guilty princess
confessed her misdemeanour. ;8aryiati forthwith set out to pacify the irate
sage. The sage would relent only if the mischievous but fascinating princess
is given to him in marriage. Without reflecting, the king agreed to bestow
his beautiful daughter on the high-souled Cyavana and returned to his own
city. Some time later the Asvins saw the faultless Sukanya bathing in the

lake adjoining the hermitage of the sage. They also were smitten by her
ravishing beauty and asked her to accept one of them for her husband instead
of the blind old sage. As she would not consent, they propose that they would
rejuvenate Cyavana, and then she should choose. With the permission of
her husband she consents to the second proposal. Cyavana had to dip into
the waters of the lake, into the primordial dement,, the womb of all creation,
along with the A^ins (Fountain of Youth motif ).^ The three of £27} them
came out of the water, all looking exactly alike. Here is a diletnma (Nala-
Damayanti motif). By virtue of her unswerving loyalty to her husband,
Sukanya is however able to choose the right man. In gratefulness for the
gift of youth and beauty, Cyavana promises the Asvins a draught of the
Soma juice during a regular Sacrifice. Soon afterwards, saryiati comes to visit
his son-in-law Cyavana and the latter arranges a great sacrifice for isaryati,
at which he offers the first draught of Soma to the Asvins, who used to be
altogether excluded on these festive occasions on account of their being
medicine-men. Indra tries to stop the sacrilegious act ; but as Cyavana will
not heed, Indra then attempts to hurl the thunderbolt at him. But Cyavana
was toc ^quick for him. Instantly Cyavana paralyzed Indra’s arm and brought
him to his knees. At the same time the great sorcerer created by his magic
a terrible demon {kjtya) called Mada (Intoxication). When Mada rushes
towards Indra to slay him, Indra grants the wish of Cyavana, who triumph-
antly continues the sacrifice and gives the Asvins, the promised libation of
Soma. Since that time the Asvins participate regularly in the sacrificial
offerings on a basis of equality with the other gods. Indra at the same time
apologizes and explains that he had opposed Cyavana merely to spread the
fame of Cyavana and his father-in-law !§aryati throughout the world : a
significant and prophetic utterance.

Bhrgu, the father of Cyavana, had only cursed Agni, a minor god, in
fact, merely the “ mouth ” of the gods, to be sarvabhaksa, devourer of all
things, good and bad (1. 6, 13). Cyavana did even better. He thoroughly
humbled Indra, the king of gods, who had to submit to the will of Cyavana.

In the next chapter again we have a passing allusion to a Bhargava,
who remains unnamed. The background is a Bhargava hermitage, though
the main actors are not Bhrgus, The pious Yuvaniasva Saudyumni is
practising austerities for the sake of progeny. One night he became very
thirsty. Searching for water, he enters the hermitage of the Bhargava who
was engaged in performing some magical rites in order to make Yuvanasva’s
queen give birth to a son. This sorcerer had actually prepared a potion, en-
dov/ed with magical efficacy, for administering it to the queen and kept the
jar containing the dose in al corner* of the £28} hermitage. The thirsty king
found it, and, not knowing that the water was charmed and intended in fact

given by H. Zimmer in his Muyu, Der indische Mythos (Stuttgart 1936), pp. 42 ff.

for the queen, drained the potion to the dregs. Here was a mess. But the
potion prepared by a Bhrgu is infallible in its effect. Whoever drinks it must
give birth to a son. Cotislequently the king became himself pregnant, and a
son, Mandhatr, was bom to him, ripping open his left side, but owing to some
propitiatory rites performed by the Bhrgu, Yuvana^va himself escaped unhurt.

It is interesting to compare this version of the story of M^dhiatr with
the one which occurs in the Droioaparvan (adhy. 62 of the Vulgate). There
we are told that once upon a time king Yuvanasva, when out hunting, became
thirsty, and his steed was exhausted. Seeing at a distance a curl of smoke,
the monarch guided by it reached a sacrificial enclosure and found there
some sacrificial butter (djya), which he greedily swallowed. Thereupon the
king became pregnant and was delivered of a son (Mandhatr) by the Asvins.
The rest of the story is nearly the same.

In this version, king Yuvanasva was not practising austerities for secur-
ing the birth of a son, but had gone out hunting. Nor did he partake of the
magical preparation at night in the dark, but presumably in full daylight,
when the slmoke from the sacred hearth could yet be seen by him. The second
version moreover makes no mention of any Bhrgu, playing the role of the
officiating priest and saviour of Yuvanasva, like the first, which is an im-
portant discrepancy. The second story is sketchy and lacking in definition,
and appears to Be the older version. In the first the details are filled out,
by adding a Bhrgu as an officiating priest and generally making the picture
more vivid and realistic.

The next Bhargava of importance we meet with in the Aranyaka is the
sage Markandeya, whose discourses on the most divers topics extend over
51 Chapters (182-232) in the Vulgate, containing about 2200 stanzas (Mar-
kandeya-samasya), which he delivers for the delectation and edification of
the Pandavas. This is not his first visit to the Pandavas by any means. For
early in the beginning of their exile, when the Pandavas had settled in the
Dvaitavana Forest, Markaaideya had paid a flying visit {29} to them (adhy.
25). He turns up again, as a matter of fact, also towards the end of their
exile, without notice or warning, to console Yudhi§thira and relates to him
the Ramopakhyana, the popular story of Rama and Sta, as well as the
Savitryupakhyana, that immortal story of a wife's splendid devotion. These
two updkhydnas, narrated by Markaaideya, together comprise about 1060
stanzas. Thus the Miarkair?^^eya-sianilasya together with the two latter upa^
khyanas comprise 3260 stanzas, which is nearly one fourth of the entire
extent of this extensive parvan.

Markan^eya was one of the cirajivins : eternally youthful though many
thousand years old. How he was exactly connected with the two wdl-known
Bhrgu families of our Mahabharata (Bhrgu-Cyavana-Rama and Bhrgu—
Cyavana-Sunaka) is not exactly known ; but that he was a Bhargava is be-
yond doubt. He is referred to as Bhmgam in B. 3. 183. 60 ; 189. 97 ;

190. 2. 13. 22. 15 : as \BMrgava-sattama in B. 3. 201. 7 ; 217. 5 : as Bhr-
                gu-nandana in B. 3. 205. 4 : as Bhrgukula^irestha in B. 3. 205. 15. More-
                over MarkaiQda is' explicitly declared to be a gotra founder of the Bhtgu clan
                in the Matsya Parana (195. 20).

Some of the subjects of Markand^ya’s discourses to the Pao^avas are
the following : great power of Brahmins ; merit of benevolence to Brahmins ;
wife’s duty to her husband ; and different forms of Agni. He relates, among
others, stories of Manu, Yayati, Vrsadarbha, 'Sibi, Indradyumna (father of
Janaka), Kuvalasva and of Skanda Karttikeya. He is also responsible for
the famous story of the Righteous Hunter (dharma^vyddha) of Mithila.
Besides these, there is, as is well known, a whole Parana named after him,
the Markaipdeya Purana.

The most interesting of Markandeya's stories, however, is how he ac-
tually witnessed the act of creation and dissolution in progress. We have
here in fact in Markandeya a Brahmanic counterpart of the K^triya Manu,
that distant cousin of the Semitic Noah with his ark, seeds and so on.

The legend of Manu, like that of Noah, is a childish story. According
to this legend (Matsyopakhyana, also related by the same sage Mi^kaindeya,
Arainyaka 187 in the Vulgate), Manu, son of Vivasvat, while saying his
usual prayers on the bank of a river, sees a tiny little fish, which asks the sage
to protect it. £30} Manu rears the fish in a small earthem vessel, which the
fish soon outgrows. The fi^ keeps on growing larger and larger. Manu
places the fish successively in a tank, in the river Ganges, and in the ocean.
Before parting from Manu, the fish warns him of the impending catastrophe
and advises him to build an ark and keep carefully a store of seeds of all
kinds. When the deluge comes, Manu gets into the ark with the Seven Sages.
The ark is towed by the horned fish on the ocean, which during the deluge
flooded everything. The ship, “ like a drunken wench ”, staggered from side
to side on the bosom of the agitated ocean . In the end the ship is fastened on
to the peak of the Himalayas, called Naubandhana, which is projecting out of
the water. When the flood subsides, Manu quietly gets out of the ark and,
as he has all the necessary seeds with himself in the ark, there would be no
difficulty in creating the world anew. Before parting again from Manu and
the Seven Sages, the Fish saysi, ” I am Brahma, the lord of creatures. None
is greater than I. In the form of a fish I have saved you all from this pe-
ril. Manu will create all beings : gods, asuras and human beings, the mobile
and the immobile creation. ”

This story, which appears to belong to a different complex of m 3 dhs and
does not at all fit well in the Mahiabharata cycle, is, as has been surmised,
probably of Semitic origin.*^ If Manu creates all beings, Brahma is thrown

out of employment. The Purauic theory of creation is that there is a deluge ;

nothing remains of the universe except Vi§iiu-Narayaiiia, reclining on tlie

coils of the Eternal Serpent (iSe^a-Ananta) floating on the waters. Then
out of Narayana’s navel emerges Brahma, seated on a lotusi, tlie creative as-
pect of the deity. From Brahma are born his mind-bom sons {manasa-pu-
iras). Then other beings, male and female, emerge from his heart, breast,
thumbs and so on. These are the Prajapatis. They propagate this world
of oursi. The process is repeated at each dissolution : it is an eternal recur-
rence. In this complex there is clearly no roomi for the Semitic legend,

which would imply a parallel creation by Manu, a state of things

which is not at all what is intended by the legend. Since a £31} vaJriant
version of this legend is found even in the Satapatha Brahmaaja (1. 8. 1 ),
it should seem that the Semitic legend was introduced into India at a fairly
early date but has remained unassimilated. Its exotic character, however,
appears to me to be clearly betrayed by the phalasruti at the end of the chap-
ter, an addition which accompanies all late accretions to the Great Epic (B.
3. 187. 58 emended) :

ya idam sr^ydn nityam Memos caritam dditah |

sa sukhi sarvasiddhdrthah svargalokam iydn narah 1 1
The Indian Noah is a man of a very different character. He requires
neither boat nor homed fish to save him ; nor does he keep a store of
seeds with himself. The man who could live through the dissolution of the
world can only be a perfect Yogi ; and a perfect Yogi is deathless. “ There
is none equal to you in years save Brahma Paramesthin,” says Yudhistbira
to the Bhargava Markaiu^cya. But he requires neither food nor drink to live.
He can walk on water as easily as on land. So when the world was over-
whelmed with floods and the creation was gradually submerged, Markaijidoya
found himself alone, walking on the waters of the oceani. After some time
Markaindcya, being hunmn after all, begins to feel a little tired and lonely,
tramping about all by himself on the surface of the endless ocean. He also
felt inexpressibly sad at that awful destruction. Then all of a sudden he
noticed a little child resting on the extended branch of a huge banyan tree
{nyagrodha). Markaiijdeya could not at all imagine how that little helpless
child could have survived all that cataclysmal devastation, and he kept ponder-
ing over that matter, standing near the child. Seeing his confusion, the
child softly told him to go into his body and rest there, and the child opened
its little mouth and drew him gently inside. And, lo and behold, inside the
child he found the world whose destmction he had seen with his own eyes.
The sun, the moon and the stars, all the oceans, seas and rivers of the world,
all the men, women and children whom he had known, all animals, gods and
demons, — ^they were all there, inside the little stomach of that wonderful little
child. He wandered about inside for hundreds of years and still he could not
find the end of it all, when he suddenly found £32} himself outside the child,

blown out by his gentle exhalation. Then the child spoke to the sage, and
then it suddenly dawned on Markaodeya who the Child was. He sees and
recognizes God.^

As this Brahmin Noah had no need for the ark, he had no need for
any seeds. The ^eeds are there permanently. There had been in fact no
destruction at all : that destruction was an illusion. There was only an in-
volution : the world had been only withdrawn into the interior of God. Crea-
tion, moreover, was not Miarkajideya's concern : it was the business of
Brahmia. Like the seed which has been well planted, the universe will grow
of itself, putting forth in due time blossoms and fruits and other seeds. Mar-
kaitjd^ya, the Yogi, is interested only in knowing and understanding things.
He had seen God, but that is not sufficient for him. He wants to know God,
know about His nature and character. His Maya, that Maya which had not
been understood even by the gods themselves (B. 3. 188. 135) :

Jnatum icchami deva tvdm mdydm caitdm tavottamdm |

The divine Child declares itself to be Narayana,, the indestructible source
of the world, and reveals to Markandeya His real nature and character.

The Bhargava Markaindeya is, according to this account, the only man
who had survived the last deluge, witnessed the act of dissolution and crea-
tion in progress, stood in his own person face to face with Narayana in the
utter solitude of total annihilation, but it is nowhere made clear why Markan-
deya was singled out for this unique honour : it is an unmotivated theme.
It is left to us to infer that the Bhargava Markandeya is the only perfect
Yogi that ever lived.

A little later, as already mentioned, Markandeya relates to the PSijda'-
vas the famous Ramopakhyana (Aranyaka 273-292 in the Vulgate), an
abridgement of the Rama story in about 750 stanzas. The occasion for re-
lating the story arises in the following way.

Jayadratha, a near relative of the Kurus and the Ptandavas tries to carry
off Draupadi, but is defeated and captured, and ultimately pardoned and re-
leased. Yudhi§thira mourns his fate £33} and asks Markaindeya, who seems
to be rather abruptly introduced for the purpose of the story, if there is any
mortal more unfortunate than himself. Thereupon Markaindeya relates the
^ory of the Dasarathi Riarna. Now the entire story of the attempted rape
of Ehaupadi by Jayadratha is so ill conceived and unconvincing that it ap-
pears to have been invented solely for the purpose of introducing a sum-
mary of the Riamayana. Who could be now a better narrator of the story
of Rama than the Bhargava Markaipdeya, age-old and yet eternally young,
the only man who had witnessed the happenings in this world in all the dif-
ferent ages, witnessed even the dissolution and creation of the world?


^ An illuminating commentary on a different version of this same myth is
given by H. Zimmer, Maya, Der indische Mythos, pp. 52 ff.

EPIC STUDIES


After hearing the story of Rama, Yudhi^thira, the “dummy” of the
bard., says that he did not grieve so much on his own or his brotiiers’ ac-
count as he did on account of the daughter of Drupada ; and then asks Mar-
kaijd^ya if he had ever seen or heard of a woman as devoted to her husband
as Draupadi. To console Yudhi^thira, Markandeya then relates the well-
known story {updkhyana) of Savitri, who rescues her husband from death by
the insistent importunity of her pleading, by her deep feminine intuition
and by her unflinching devotion to her husband (Arainyaka 293-299 in the
Vulgate). And that is the last episode of the Aranyaka narrated by the
Bhargava Markandeya and in fact the last episode of this parvan in which a
Bhargava is concerned.

Virataparvan

In the short Virataparvan, as is in the Sabha, the narrative is plain and
straightforward, unembellished by any episodic enlargement, and the story
marches rapidly forward. This book contains consequently no updkhydnas
and there is no room for any Bhargava digression. The references to the
Bhiargavas are few and far between, and they are incidental allusions to the
greatness or heroism of the Bhargavas. One of these may be adduced for
the purpose of illustration. Addressing Duryodhana, BhJ§ma asks : “ Who is
superior to Drona except Rama, the son of Jamadagni ? ” {B. 4. 51. 10).^

[34} Udyogaparvan

The Udyogaparvan furnishes its quota of references to the Bhargavas,
at least to the Bhargava Rama. Here again Rama Jamadagnya emerges
from the obscurity of myth and legend, and we find him coming into direct
contact — and in one case, actual conflict — with some of the epic characters.

In adhy. 72 ff. of the Vulgate version of the Udyoga, we have an ac-
count of a council held by the Pandavas, where Ky^ina is commissioned to go
and treat with Dhrtar^tra, which is followed in adhy. 83 ff. by a descrip-
tion of Ki^na’s journey to Hastinapura. On the way he meets a com-
pany of ancient sages, whom he duly honours. On his asking them whither
they were bound, the Bhlargava Rama, who is apparently their spokesman,
explains that they were on their way to attend the council meeting which
was going to be held at Hastinapura in order to witness the proceedings and
listen to the discussion. The sages then take leave of him and proceed on
their way. Led by Rama Jamadagnya, they arrive in due course at the
capital of the Kurus and present themselves in the darbar hall, where they
are received with due honours by Bhi§ma (adhy. 94) . The proceedings be-
gin with a long peroration by Kp^ija, in which he announces that the Rapda-
vas were ready to obey implicitly the commands of Dhjtara^tra, provided


1 But this is 852* of our edition, and it was found only in Dn ; that is,
it was added perhaps within 3 or 4 centuries !

305


they were assured that they would be treated with fairness and given what
is theirs by right (adhy. 95) . The Bhiargava Rama, taking advantage of the
spell of silence which followed Krona's diplomatic speeclt, gets up and, advis-
ing peace, relates, unasked, the story of Dambhodbihava (adhy. 96) . TTie
foolish king Dambhodbhava, who wants to be acknowledged the unconquered
and unconquerable hero, challenges in his cupidity the sages Nara and Na-
rayaaia (who were then practising 'penance at Badari) to fight with him.
The ascetics meekly decline, but Dambhodbhava is importunate. So in the
end Nara takes up a handful of grass and, charging the blades in his hand
with mystic potency, flings them at the enemy. They change into deadly
missiles, overpowering the soldiers of Dambhodbhava, and compel him to
surrender and acknowledge his defeat. Nara reads Dambhodbhava a sermon
on selficontrol, on kindness to all creatures and humility towards Brahmins.
The Bhargava Rama appearing here in the role of a [35} peace-maker con-
cludes by advising conciliation and pointing out that Nara is Arjuna, while
Narayana is Kr§ina. The story is an unnecessary digression, with the
very obvious object of reiterating and emphasizing the identity between Nara-
Naraya;ia and Arjuna-Kpsna.

The Udyogaparvan closes with a story (Ambopakhyana), in which the
Bhargava Rama plays a very active and prominent part (adhy. 173-196 of
the Vulgate) . Bhisma explains to Duryodhana that, because of a vow he had
taken, he would not fight with Sikhandin, who at birth had been a girl, and
then relates the whole life history of sikhaindin, who in a previous birth was
Amha, the daughter of the king of Kaa. Bhisma narrates how Amba, hav-
ing been disappointed of marriage through Bhi^ma’s action, vowed to com-
pass his death and how the Bhargava Rama, having promised to help her,
fought with Bhisma at Kuruk§etra for twenty-three days, a fight which ends
in a stalemate. The story is developed in this way.

When Amba was repulsed by Salva, to whom she was engaged and who
subsequently refused to marry her on account of her abduction by Bhi§ma,
she left him and wandered about alone in a neighbouring forest, nursing her
grief and vowing vengeance. There she meets a company of ascetics, who
sympathize with her and devise means to help her. While the ascetics are
cogitating as to how they should help her, there comes along by chance Am-
ba’s grandfather, the royal sage Hotravahana, who advises her to seek the
help of his jriend Rama Jiamadagnya. While these deliberations are pro-
ceeding, Rama's disciple and faithful follower Akrtavrana appears on the
scene. Hotravahana tells him the previous history of Amba and also her
future plans. Akrtavraipa decides that Bhisma is certainly responsible for
Amba's misfortunes, and is the party deserving punishment. By a fortunate
accident Rama — on the war-path, armed with a bow and a sword and his
famous axe {parasu ) — comes there the following morning. Amba again re-
lates the whole story of her unfortunate life to the Bhargava Rama and be-



306

seeches him to slay the offending Bhfema. But since Rama has taken the
vow that he would on no account take up arms except at the bidding of the
twice-bom, he has to be persuaded by the sages to espouse Amba’s cause.
£36} He then proceeds with Amba and all the assembled sages to the banks
of the Sarasvati and from there sends a message to Bhl^rna, who meets him
at the boundary of the Kuru kingdom. Rama orders Bhisma to take back
Amba or failing that fight a duel with him. Since Bhi§ma cannot do the
former, he decides to fight, goes back to the city and returns, furnished with
all arms and accoutrements, in a chariot made of silver, drawn by white
horses. Bhl^ma’s mother Gang&devi (identified with the river Ganges) tries
to stop the impending fight but without success. The fight lasts for several
days, when at last Rama wounded by an arrow of Bhi§ma falls down in a
swoon. Bhisma stops fighting : it is a gentlemanly duel, following minutely
all the strict rules of chivalry, and unlike the deadly combats of the Bharata
war. The fight is continued on the following days, with varying luck. Even
after many days of constant fighting, in which millions and billions of ar-
rows are showered by each combatant and cut up by the opponent, various
magical missiles are flung by which alternately the combatants get wounded,
fall down, recover and resume the fight, the grim contest continues indecisive-
ly. Then one night Bhisma, who was one of the Vasus, saw in a dream a
group of eight Brahmins (the Eight Vasus), who had supported him and
encouraged him that same day while he was lying wounded and unconscious
on the battlefield. They remind him of a magical missile of his, by dis-
charging which he could put the Bhiargava Rama to sleep on the field of bat-
tle. Next day the fight began again and the combatants hurled at each other
simultaneously the terrific Brahma missile, which is capable shattering the
earth. The two missiles clash in the middle and neutralize each other.
During the commotion caused by these weapons, Bhisma thinks of the
sleep missile. As he is about to discharge that missile, the gpds intervene.
With BhJsma's mother, Ganga, the gods go from one to the other of the
combatants, trying to pacify them. Seeing that neither of them is prepared
to 5 deld and be the first to retire from the field of battle, the gods stand bet-
ween the combatants and make the fight impossible. Still the combatants are
not pacified and will not leave! the field. Finally the shades of his ancestors
persuade Rffma to lay aside his weapons, which he then reluctantly does.
That is sufficient for Bhisma. He puts down his bow and arrow, goes to
Rama, his guru, and prostrates £37} himself at his feet. They soon forget
their quarrel and become friends again,. Thus this titanic conflict between
Bhisma and the Bhargava Riama, which is said to have lasted foir three and
twenty days, is utterly barren of any result beyond adding a few hundred
lines to the text !

One peculiar thing we notice about this story is the sudden change of
heart on the part of the BhSrgava Rama. While in all other accounts of



EPIC STUDIES VI


307


him he is represented as the inveterate foe of the K§atriyas and the epic bards
are never weary of telling us that he had exterminated the K^atriyas thrice
seven times, here we find him befriending the royal sage Hotravahana and
championing the lost cause of an unhappy K§atriya damsel ! The episode
shows another inconsistency in the behaviour of Rama ; for, here
we are surprised with the statement that in Bhi§ma Riama had taken a
Ksatriya pupil and had apparently taught him so well that the pupil knew not
only as much as the guru but perhaps even more. This does not prevent him
subsequently from cursing Kama, who had learnt the secrets of the science
of arms from Rama in the guise of a Brahmin but later had to confess that
he was a Ksatriya. There Riama is reported to have said to Kanja that the
Brahma weapon can never be learnt by one who is not a Brahmin (B. 12.
3. 31), though Bhit^ma had used the Brahma missile successfully against
   Rama in the combat mentioned above.

Bhi§maparvan

With the Bhi§maparvan begin what may be called the “ battle books,”
which in some shape or other must have formed the kernel of the Mahabha-
rata, which kernel has served as a nucleus for the growth of a vast amount of
secondary material, cohering together so as to form a more or less harmo-
nious whole. A rough sketch of the original plan of the epic is preserved in
a stanza occurring in one of the chapters of the first book (1. 55. 43) :
evam etat purdvrttam tenant aklit^akarmandm |
bhedo rdjyavimsas ca jayas cu jayatdm vara 1 1

The Bharata, according to this statement, was a trilogy consisting of the story
of the dissension, loss of the kingdom, and victory, among some descendants
of Bharata.

{38} The Bhi^maparvan, according to the Vulgate, is divided into four
sections {upaparvms) , Of these the first two are mainly geographical trac-
tates : JambukhaiDdamirmi^a-parvan and Bhumi-parvan. The third is the
famous philosophical discourse, the Bhagavad^ta, which is, so to say, the
keystone of the whole new superstructure of the remodelled Bharata and
which has passed into world literature. The fourth and last section of this
book is a lengthy account in eighty chapters (or about 4300 stanzas) of the
fight of the first ten days of the Great War, up to the fall of Bhi§ma. After
the Bhagavadgita, the account of the fight runs on smoothly and is not allow-
ed to be interrupted by any digressions. Consequently this sub-section also
contains no Bhargava episode or for that matter any other episodic narra-
tive at all. But passing allusions to the Bhargavas are not by any means
wanting even in this final section of the Bhi^maparvan. They are, however,
for the most part trivial and confined to the glorification of Rama Jamadag-
nya, playing on the theme of his encounter with Bhi^ma. The Bhargava

EPIC STUDIES


Rama is subtly praised by saying that Bhi§txia was a hero whom even Rama
could not defeat.

But the Bhagavad^ta itself contains an interesting allusion to the Bhr-
gus and that is in the tenth chapter, in the enumeration of the so-called
vibhutis of iSri-Ktwa. The vibhutis are said to be infinite {nasty onto vis-
tarasya me, Gita 10. 19 in the Vulgate version), but about sixty of them have
been specifically enumerated and they are worthy of close study. Some of
these vibhutis are pure and simple gods, such as Indra, Vi§aju, Siva and so
on. Some are yet other supernatural beings, such as Kubera, Citraratha and
others. Some are celestial luminaries such as the Sun, and the Moon. Some
are merely terrestrial features such as mountains, rivers, the ocean and so
on. Some are even animals such as the serpent (^e§a), elephant (Ainavata),
eagle (Garuda) and so on. There are mentioned among these vibhutis
only nine human — or at least semi-human, that is, semi-divine — beings,
whom we may regard as historical or semi-historical personalities. Three
of them, Vasudeva, Arjuna and Vyasa, are well-known and important
epic characters, and as such their inclusion in this list is expected and
may be said £39} to be quite natural. They may therefore be ignored.
Then, further, of divine sages (devarsis), !Sri-Kr§3ia declares himself to be
Narada, the official messenger between the gods and the men. Of perfected
beings (Siddhas), Sn-Krsna says, he is Kapila, a celebrated sage, probably
the codifier of the Saatikhya, the system most popular with the
epic bards. Of household priests, iSfi-Kr^iha identifies himself, quite
naturally again, with Brhalspati, the priest of the gods, one of the An-
girases, a clan closely connected with the Bhrgus from very ancient times.
There remain three ; of these all—or at least two — are clearly Bhargavas.
Of Kavis, Sri-Kr^-tia says, he is isukra, the Bhiargava priest of the Asuras,
the asuric counterpart of Brhaspati. Of weapon-bearers {sastra-bhrt) , Sri-
Kr§(ha declares himself to be Rama, who is identified by sotne authorities
as Rama son of Dasaratha, but who in my opinion is meant to be no other
than the much lauded hero of the Mahabharata poets, Rama' son of Jama-
dagni, the Bhargava Rama. Lastly, of great sages (mahar^is), Sri-Rr§i)a
says he is Bhrgu {maharsindm Bhfgur ahum, Gata IQ. 25).^ All other vi-
bhutis are more or less intelligible ; for each vibhuti is or may be r^arded,
more or less, as the foremost or the first of a class ; but why Bhrgu should be
considered as the greatest io/ the great sages (Mahar^is) is somewhat enig-
matic. He is not reckoned among the Seven Sages (saptar^is). He is no
doubt said to be a son of Brahma, but Brahma had nearly a dozen sons of
that kind, who all became Prajapatis and founders of gotras. And about
Bhrgu’s greatness even the Mahabharata has nothing to narrate beyond the

^ C V. VArovA, Proc. S trams : 1st Or. Conf. (1922), p. 39 (''Gotra and Pra-
vara'" p.p. 34-45) explains it differently. He is of opinion that of all R§is Bhrgu
was actually considered as the foremost.

fact that his wife Puloma was abducted by a cannibal called Puloman (Adi)
or Darhsa (Santi), and that he had cursed various people.

Dronaparvan

The Droiiaparvan supplies what is for our purpose one of the most in-
teresting of Bhiargava references in the Mahabharata.

On the thirteenth day of the Great War during Arjuna’s temporary ab-
sence, Abhimanyu with a small following pierces the Kaurava ring-formation
(cakra-vyuha) , but Jayadratha intercepts his followers and isolates him, and
Abhimanyu is slain after a brave fight ; one of the most tragic episodes of
the Great Epic. {40} To console Yudhi$thira for the untimely death of Abhi-
manyu, Vyasa tells him many stories illustrating the transitoriness of human
life. At that time he relates how Narada comforted Srhjaya in a time of
bereavement by telling him of the sixteen kings of great merit, who never-
theless all died when their time came (adhy. 55-71 of the Vulgate) . These
kings were, as a matter of fact, all cakravartins, sovereigns who had con-
quered surrounding kingdoms or brought them under their sway and estab-
lished a. paramount position on more or less extensive regions around their
own kingdoms. The episode, which is known as the SodaiSarajaldya, re-
counts the heroic deeds and the meritorious actions of sixteen of such fa-
mous kings of antiquity. The sixteen kings are these : (1) Marutta, son
of Avik§it ; (2) Suhotra Atithina ; (3) Paurava (Brhadratha, king of Ahga);
(4) iSibi, son of Usinara : (5) Rama, son of Dasaratha ; (6) Bhagiratha,
son of Dillpa ; (7) Dilipa Ailavila ; (8) Mandhatr, son of Yuvanasva ; (9)
Yayati, soti of Nahu§a ; (10) Ambari§a, son of Nabhaga ; (11) Sasabindhu,
son of Citraratha ; (12) Gaya, son of Amurtarayas ; (13) Rantideva, son of
Sathkrti : (14) Bharata, son of DutB?anta ; (15) Prthu, son of Vena ; and,
last but not least, (16) the Bhargava Rama, son of Jamadagni.

Accordingly we have here a vivid and colourful description of that great
feat of the Bhargava Rama, the ectirpation of K§atriyas, an account which
courts mistrust by its appalling exaggeration and staggering figures (adhy.
70 of the Vulgate) . We are told how Rama took a vow to relieve the Earth
of her burden of Knatriyas. Thereafter he first ^ew Kaitavirya, who was
never before defeated in battle. Then of Ksatriyas he slaughtered 64,000,
cutting off their ears and noses and breaking their teeith, besides stifling in
smoke 70(X) Haihayas (the clan to which Arjuna Klartavirya belonged) and
torturing them, and butchering 10,0(X) with his own axe. . . .Then the puis-
sant sc«i of Jamadagni, marching against the Kasmiras, the Daradas, the Kun-
tis, the Ksudrakas and Malavas, the Angas, Vahgas and Kalingas, the Vide-
has, the Tamraliptakas, the Rakgovahas, the Vltihotras, the Trigartas, the
Marttikavatas, the Sibis and other warrior races, thousands in number, slew
them all with arrows of exceeding sharpness. Going from country to coun-
try, he slew {41} thousands aind hundreds of thousands of K§atriyas, creat-

ing a veritable deluge of blood and filling many lakes with it.... Then
bringing under his sway all the eighteen divisions of the earth, that descen-
dant of Bhrgu celebrated a hundred siacrifices, like a second Indra, when he
gave away costly gifts (dak^i^d) to Brahmins. The sacrificial altar, full eight
nalas high and made entirely of gold, embellished with hundreds of gems and
adorned with thousands of banners, as5 also this earth abounding in domestic
and wild animals, was accepted by Kasyapa from the Bhargava Rama as his
sacrificial fee for performing the sacrifice. Ri^a also gave him many thou-
sands of huge elephants adorned with golden ornaments. Freeing the earth
of robbers that infested her, making her full of rigliteous and amiable peo-
ple, Rama gave the earth to Kasyapa at his great horse sacrifice. Then
comes the Bhargava slogan (B. 7. 70. 20) :

triJ^saptakrtvak prthivlm krtvd nihksatiydm prabhuh | (IV)

Having cleared the earth of Ksatriyas thrice ^ven times, having cele-
brated a hundred sacrifices, Rama gave the earth to the Brahmins. When
the earth with her seven grand divisions was bestowed by him upon Kasyapa,
then the latter said to Rama, “ Go thou out of this earth at my command !”
Hearing these words of Kasyapa, that foremosit of weapon-bearers, obedient
to the command of a Brahmin, caused the ocean to roll hack and to give him
a new strip of land to live in, and Rama took up his abode on Mount Ma-
hendra.

It is instructive to compare this Story of Sixteen Kings with a variant
version of it in the iSanti (adhy. 29 of the Vulgate), as related td the same
Yudhi§thira by Sil-Kmna. After the battle the month of mourning is spent
outside the capital on the banks of the Ganges. Yudhi§thira, very dejected,
proposes to renounce the kingdom and retire to the forest. At Arjuna's re-
quest, Kr§na tries to console him and' so relates to him the Story of Sixteen
King^ which Narada had once related to king Sriijaya. The stories are na-
turally almost the same as those rdated to Yudhi'§thira by Vyasa after the
death of Abhimanyu. There is, however, one very striking difference. Fif-
teen of the kings in the list are the same ; the sixteenth “ king ” of the Drorja
list, namely, the Bhargava Rama, is conspicuous by his absence in the i&nti
{42} list ! He is replace^ by a real kihg. Sagara son of Ifc§vaku, who was
indeed a very famous king, fully deserving to be included in this list of the
celebrated sixteen kings of antiquity, whereas the Bhargava Rama was no
king at all and does not properly fall into this enumeration. His “ extermin-
ation of the Ksatriyas was merely an act of vendetta. And although he is
said to have conquered the whole earth, he never was crowned a king. There-
fore the propriety of including his exploits in the $oda4ariajakiya is more
than questiofiable. In fact it would never strike anybody except an unscru-
pulous Brahmin redactor— with strong Bhargava leanings— to perpetrate
such a tendentious perversion and father it upon Vyasa.



EPIC STUDIES VI


311


KARIsIAPARVAN

Kama is represented in our epic as a pupil of the Bhargava Rama, like
Bhl§ma and Drona. So there are several casual references — in his capacity
as the guru of Karina — ^to Rama Jamadagnya in the course of this parvan.

In adhy. 31 (of the Vulgate),, we have a reference to the bow (Vijaya)
which Kama had received from the Bhargava Rama, who in his' turn had
obtained it from Indra himself. Indra had used it in his fight with the
Daityas : Rama had used it in his campaign against the Ki^atriyas of the
earth, which he had conquered thrice seven times (B. 8. 31. 46) :

triijisaptakrtvah pjthivi dhanu^d yena nirjitd ] (V)

On the seventeenth day of the war, Ehiryodhana persuades' isalya to be
Kamja’s charioteer and to encourage him tells the story how Karina had be-
come possessed even of celestial weapons through the Bhargava Rama.

To emphasize further the great importance of Kania, Duryodhana then
narrates a story which shows the greatness of KariiTia’s guru, Rama Jamad-
agnya (adhy. 34 of the Vulgate). Rama is generally represented
in the !^fehabharata as a man — or rather a Superman — who had fought his
battles on this earth with other human beings like himself. Here we are
told that he had fought with and vanquished even the Daityas. The story is
this. To obtain celestial weapons from Mahadeva, Rama (like the P^ip^ava
Arjun^ later) was practising terrible austerities. At that time £43} the
Asuras had become so powerful that even all the gods together could not
subdue them, and so Mahadeva asks the Bhargava Rama to fight with them
(as Arjuna later fought with the Nivatakavacas and other demons). Rama
went up to the Asuras and said to them, Most invincible in battle as you
are, O Daityas, give me battle’'. Then the Daityas began to fight with
Rama. Then that delighter of the Bhargava clan slaughtered those Daityas,
on the battle-field by strokes that were like the strokes from Indra’s thunder-
bolt. After Rama had vanquished the invincible Asuras without the use of
any special weapons, then Mahadeva gave him those celestial missiles for
which Rama was practising the terrible austerities. Perhaps feeling that
the story might be disbelieved, Duryodhana hastens to add that he had heard
it himself from the lips of a pious and truthful Brahmin while the latter was
relating it to king Dhrtar^ra, Duryodhana’s father.

Then in adhy. 42 (of the Vulgate), Kaiina relates that under the guise
of a Brahmin he had been a disciple of the Bhargava Rama in order to learn
from him the secret of certain magical mi^les known to Rama alone. One
day while Rama was sleeping with his head resting in the lap of Kanja, the
thigh of the latter was bored through by Indra (Arjuna’s de facto father)
in the form of a ferocious centipede, and Kania was weltering in blood but
did not move a muscle, for fear of disturbing the sleep of his guru and thus
incurring his displeasure. When Rama woke up and saw this state of things,



312


EPIC STUDIES


he concluded that his disciple was no Brahmin, as only a Ksatriya could
suffer such agony and keep still. Then Karpa confesses his guilt and begs
Rama’s pardcwi. Rama pronounces a curse on Kanja, saying that at the
critical moment the magical missiles of which he had obtained knowledge
from Rama by such a dastardly trick — even the great Yogi could not see
through it — ^would fail him. Brahma could never reside firmly in one who is
not a Brahmin : abrahmoaie brahma no hi dhruvarii sydt (B. 8. 42. 9.) And
so it happened, needless to say.

In a variant version of this tale (iSanti 3 in the Vulgate) the worm
which had bored through Kaiiija’s thi^ is said to have been not Indra in
disguise, but a demon suffering the effects of a curse pronounced on him by
Bhrgu !

1:44} •Salyaparvan

In the Salyaparvan there are only stray references to the Bhargavas, es-
pecially in the account of Balarama's pilgrimage — another very obvious dig-
ression — during which Balarama visits of course all the places sacred to the
Bhargavas such as Ramatirtha, Samantapahcaka and so on, which lay on
his way.

At Ramatirtha we have a repetition of the story that Kasyapa officiated
at the sacrifice celebrated by Rama Bhargava after conquering the whole
earth and annihilating the K§atriyas (B. 9. 49. 7 f.) :

Sauptikaparvan

The Sauptika is one of the few books of the Mahabharata which are
entirely, or almost entirely, free from reference to the Bhargavas. The book
is short, consisting of 18 chapters and about 800 stanzas in the Vulgate ver-
sion, and comprises only two sub-parvans : the Sauptika and the Ai^ika. The
first sub-parvm describes the slaughter of the sleepers in the camp of the
Piaijdavas, while the second gives an account of the use of the worldijdesitroy-
ing dart Ai§ika by Asvatthaman.

STRiPARVAN

In the next book, the Striparvan, which like the former is short, con-
sisting of 27 chapters and about 800 stanzas in the Vulgate version, there are
only three incidental references to the Bhargavas. The pmvm ccMisists almost
wholly of the description of the obsequial ceremonies of the warriors killed in
the war and lamentations of women over their dead kinsfolk, which is fortu-
nately held free from digressions and interpolations. The tragedy also does



EPIC STUDIES VI

not permit the development of any other sentiment. The absence of reference
to the Bhargavas, who, as already remarked, had strictly Speaking no con-
nection whatsoever with the Kuru-Pancala heroes, is not only thoroughly
£45} appropriate, but is an omission for which we may be truly grateful to
the redactors of our Mahabhiarata.

ISANTIPARVAN

The iSanti, which is in esisence a manual of instruction in king-^raft
{rdjadhmma), conduct in time of calamity (dpaddharma) and emancipa-
tion {mok^<idharma) compiled in the peculiar pedagogic technique developed
by the redactors of the Great Epic for the edification of the people combined
with their entertainment, supplies its quota of Bhargava material, making up
in some measures for the deficiency of the last three books.

Already in adhy. 2 f. (of the Vulgate) we hear of the Bhargava Rama.
The month of mourning is spent by the Pandavas outside the capital on the
banks of the Ganges. There Narada relates to Yudhisthira the story of the
early career of Kama, which is here said to be a secret of the gods {deva-
guhya). Tn the course of the narrative Narada repeats with more details
the story we have already noticed as to how Karija had easily deceived the
Bhargava Rama and obtained from him the carefully guarded secret of the
famous Brahma missile (brahmdstra) under the false pretence of being a
Bramin, and a Bhfgu too. An interesting point of difference between this
version of the story and that given in the Karoaparvan is, as mentioned
already, that the worm which bites Kama and bores a hole through his leg
is not Indra but a demon called Damsa, who had tried to carry off Bhrgu’s
wife. If this wife be Puloma, then her ravisher's name was given as Puloman
in adhy. 4 of the Adi, where, however, there is no mention of Bhfgu’s curse ;
but we are told on the other hand that the ravisher of Puloma was reduced
to ashes by Bhrgu’s son Cyavana. But perhaps this demon Darhsa is some
other ravisher of Bhrgu’s wife.

In any event the happy result of this discourse of the sage was that
Yudhisthira, casting off grief, enters the capital in state, is installed on the
throne and performs the obsequial ceremonies of his departed kinsmen. Later
Kiima in an ecstatic trance communes with the distant Bhi§ma, who remains
lying on the battlefield on a bed of arrows and who in a long hymn of ado-
ration invokes Krmai. Krma then sets out with the Paajdava brothers and
his followers £46} to visit Bhfema on his death-bed. The arrival of the party
at the battle-field, which it will be remembered has been identified by the
redactors of the epic with the Bhargava tMka Samantapancaka, affords an
easy opportunity for another repetition of the legend of Rama's heroic exploit.
That was the very spot where the BMrgava Rama had established those
five lakes of blood. l§ii-K|Tma in passing points to those lakes and says
(B. 12. 48. 9) :

21

Yudhi^thira, the “dummy” of the rhapsode, has an insatiable longing to
hear all about the extermination of the Ki^triyas by the Bhargava Rama
though he had heard it all before from other story-tellers, and he has besides
some doubts which he forthwith refers to Kiwa (B, 12. 48. 10) :
trihsaptukUvab prthivi krtd nihksatriyd pure |

Rdme^eti tathattha tvt^m atra me samsayo maMn |1 (VII)

To solve this doubt of Yudhi§thira Kr^^oa gratuitously volunteers to re-
peat the whole story of Riama from the very beginning, a full-size account
of the birth of the Bhargava Rama, of the extirpation of the K)§atriyas and of
the subsequent regeneration of the race. Here we have now an attestation of
the entire story by iSri-Kn§tiia, a variant of the story told by Alqtavrafrja, a
disciple of Rama, to Yudhii^tbira himself in the Arapyaka. There are natu-
rally several discrepancies between the two versions, two of which are note-
worthy. In the first version it was Satyavati's father-in-law who prepares
the magical carus, which were subsequently exchanged by the good ladies who
were to partake of them ; here it is Satyavati’si husband himself, Rcika, who
prepares them. The other is a somewhat more serious discrepancy. In the
Araipyaka version, Jamadagni was robbed of his calf by Arjuna Kartavirya
himself, who is represented there as a perfect fiend. In the stbry as told
by (Sri-Kr^pa, Arjuna is a perfect angel of a man, always devoted to peace,
ever obedient to Brahmins and ready to protect all classes ; he had given
away the earth to Brahmins in a horse sacrifice which he had performed.
His sons on the other hand were “ proud and cruel ”, and it was they who
brought away the calf of Jamadagni s sacrificial £47} cow. As it is difficult,
at this distance of time, in the absence of independent evidence, to say whe-
ther Akrtavraipa or Sri-Kr$oa was more truthful, it must remain a moot point
whether the guilty party is Arjuna Kartavirya or his sons. Then Sri-Kr^pa
goes on to tell Yudhi^thira that the Ki§atriyas were annihilated by the Bhar-
gava Rama thrice seven times, speaking exactly like a Bhargava (B. 12. 49.
64) :

tribsaptakjtvab prthwlm kftvd nihk^atriydm pr€d>hub I
dak^ifj^m asvamedhdnte Kasyapdyddadat tatab || (VIII)

The matter being now attested by i§ri-Kiwa himself, it cannot be described
by revilers of Brahmins as a fabricaticm made by the Brahmins themselves.

It must always have been something of a puzzle to all thoughtful persons
where K^triyas like the Kauravas and the Paipdavas and even (Sri-<K|i§IOa
himself came from after the Rsatriya race had been wiped out thrice seven
times by the Bhargava Riama, and that was in fact Yudhi^hira's doubt,
which he had expresised to iSri-Krsipa. Various explanations of the ttiystery
have been propounded. In the earlier chapters of the epic, ab we have seen

several times, it was the pious Brahminsi who procreated children on the
widows of the K^atriyas slain by Rama and they became K^triyas by the
Vedic rule pariigrahasya tanayalp (1. 98. 5) : the child belongs to him who
has gone through the form of marriage with the mother. That was however
not the view of Sri-Kp^oa. His explanation was that the Earth had concealed
some K^atriyas.^ She had concealed some Haihayas among women, some
Pauravas among the bears of Mount Rk^vant. Some other K§atriyas were
brought up in the forest among the kine, some in the cowpens among the
calves. Some were protected by the Ocean, some by the wolves^ on Mount
Grdhrakuta. These had all escaped destruction at the hands of the formid-
able Bhlargava. And the old K]§atriya dynasties were resuscitated by Ka4-
yapa, who first ordered Rama to clear out from the earth which he had given
to Kasyapa as a part of the sacrificial fee and restored by and by those
scions of the old K^atriya families to their rightful heritage. iSri-Kr^na
evidently did not know anything about the procreation of K^atriyas by pious
Brahmins on the widows of the K§atriyas slaughtered by the bloodthirsty
Bhargava. He con-{48}-cludes by remarking that the present K§atriyas are
the legitimate offsprings of those ancient K§atriyas (B. 12. 49. 88 f.) :

At the beginning of the third great sub-division of the Santi, the Moksa-
dharma, we have a lengthy discourse attributed to Bhfgu, called the Bhrgu-
Bharadvaja-samvada (adhy. 182-192 of the Vulgate), which summarizes in
the form of questions and answers almost the entire Brahmanic teaching on
the subject of (1) the elements, (2) life and death, (3) caste distinctions,
(4) good and evil, (5) the four stages of life, and finally, (6) the other
world. It will be seen that it is a complete tractate on Hindu Ontology,
Sociology, Eschatology and Ethics that is here attributed to Bhrgu, the
eiX)nymou^ ancestor of the Bhargavas,

The oft-cited stanza B. 12. 339. 103 f. :

from the Mok^adharma is important as containing one of the two actual

in some Grantha MSS. and some old Devanagari MSS. which have been

collated by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute for a critical edition
of that book. The other reference is in the same chapter, a few stanzas
earlier (B. 12. 339. 84) :

Tretdyuge bhavi^ydmi Rdmo Bhfgukulodvalmlp [

K^atram cotsddayi^ydmi samrddhabaluvdhanam ] [

This stanza cannot be impugned on the score of documentary evidence,
which is unanimous in its favour. But both references occur in the Naraya-
Oiya section of the Mok§adharma, which is notoriously a late addition to
our Mahabharata. This shows that the theory of avatdtas is still develop-
ing in the epic and their number is not yet fixed, nor are the avatdras fully
canonized. It should thus seem that the Mahabharata does not £49} neces-
sarily presuppose the Bhargava Rama to be an avatdra of Vi§hu.

Anusasanaparvan

The Anu^Sana, for some reason that is not yet quite clear, is the richest
in Bhargava material.

Early in the beginning of this book (adhy. 4), we have the third repe-
tition of the legend of the birth of Jamadagni. The previous chapter (3)
relates the mighty deeds of the K§atriya Visvamitra, which led to his attain-
ing the coveted status of a Brahmin. In adhy. 4, BhJ^ma explains how it
came about that Visvamitra who was of mingled Brahmin and K§atriya
parentage was born in the K§atriya caste with Brahmanic qualities, while his
nephew Jamadagni, under" similar conditions, was born in the Brahmin caste
with K^atriyan qualities. We have here a repetition of the old story how
Bdka married Gadhi’s daughter Satyavati, who obtained some boons' for
herself and her mother. The mother and the daughter exchange the trees
they had to embrace and earns of which they had to partake. The wise
Rdka had purposely made the prescriptions differently. He had in fact put
the entire accumulated energy of Brahmanism in the earn of his wife, while
he had put the entire accumulated energy of K^atriyahood in the earn in-
tended for her mother. The consequence of the exchange slyly effected by
the mother was that the son of Gadhi’s wife turned out to be a man with
Brahmanic propensities, while the son of IJdka’s wife would have been a
model K§atriya ; but, owing to the pleadings of Satyavatl, the great sage
graciously gives his consent to the pc^tponement of the doom to Satyavati’s
grand-son.

This story we have had at Arainyaka 115 and Santi 49 of the Vulgate.
In passing it may be mentioned that the present version agrees with the
Santiparvan version in making IJdka the giver of the boons, whereas in the
Arainyaka version this person is some ancestor of IJdka, either Boka’s father
or perhaps Bhrgu himself.

The mere mention of Bhargava Rama in B. 13. 14 . 273 at once calls
forth the reaction :

In adhy. 30 (of the Vulgate) we are told how a K^atriya Vitahavya was
made a Brahmin by the mere word of a Bhrgu. The story isl as follows.

Vatsa, a descendant of Saryati had two sons, Haihaya and T&lajahgha.
The hundred sons of Haihaya attacked and killed Haryasva, king of Ka^,
whose son Sudeva succeeded him on the throne. Sudeva was) likewise de-
feated and killed by the Haihayas. Sudeva was succeeded by Divodasa, who
built Vara^a^, on the northern bank of Ganges and the southern bank of
the Gomati. Likewise defeated by the Haihayas, he fled to his priest Bharad-
vaja, who obtained for him, through sacrifice, a son Pratardana. The son
of Divodasa defeated in turn all the Haihayas, when Vitahavya pursued by
Pratardana, fled to the hermitage of Bhrgu. When ^Pratardana demanded
from Bhrgu the surrender of Vitahavya, who was hiding in Bhrgu’s hermit-
age, Bhrgu in order to save the life of Vitahavya said that there were only
Brahmins in the hermitage. Through that declaration of Bhrgu, who could
not tell a lie, Vitahavya actually became a Brahmin. His descendants are
set out for fifteen generations. His son was Grtsamada, whose eleventh des-
cendant was Pramati : his son was Ruru ; his son was Sunaka, from whom
came the Saunakas.

In adhy. 40, Bhi§ma expatiates on the fascination and frailty of wo-
men, the root of all evil, and to support his statement he relates the story
of Vipula, another Bhargava, an interesting story in which mesmerism or
hypnotism plays some part (Vipulopiakhylana, adhy. 40-43 in the Vulgate).

The sage Devasarman, the story goes, had a beautiful wife Ruci (Beau-
ty) by name, who had attracted the attention of the gay king of the gods,
Indra. Once upon a time it so happened that Devasarman had to go away
from his hermitage on some sacrificial business. Not feeling quite sure about
his little Ruci, the old sage taking into his confidence his disciple, the Bhai-
gava Vipula, told him to protect his slender-waisted wife, especially against
the amorous advances of Indra, who was an adept at assuming different forms
at will. Deva^rman pathetically en-{51}-joined his disciple to take every
care and see that the lascivious king of the celestials did not defile that frivol-
ous wife of his, like a wretched dog licking the havis placed near the sacrificial
altar. To protect the virtue of Ruci, who was peerless on earth in beauty,
Vipula decided to enter into her by his yogic power and live in her without
her being conscious of it, until the critical moment was passed. Indra comes
as expected and makes overtures to the beautiful Ruci, who had captivated his
mind. Ruci, though anxious to reciprocate, remains externally indifferent
to the blandishments of Indra, through the influence of Vipula, who was
living within her and guiding her actions. Indra, puzzled by the behaviour
of Ruci, reflects and realizes how matters stand. At that moment Vipula
leaves the body of Ruci and re-enters his own body. Then Vipula faces the

philanderer and soundly rebukes him, and Indra slinks away abashed. Only
one man had been able to protect a woman and that was the Bhargava Vi-
pula (B. 13. 43. 27) :

tenaikena tu rak§d vai Vipulena kftd striydip |
ndnyak saktas triloke 'smin rak^tum nrpa ya^itam 1 1

This story was told by the Bhargava Markao<3eya to Bh!§ma (B. 13.
43. 18) and repeated by the latter to Yudhii^thira.

A few chapters later we have again a Bhargava story, the Cyavanopa-
khyiana in seven chapters (50-56), which is divided into two parts : the first
two chapters (50-51) illustrate the sanctity of cows, the last five deal really
with that topic of perennial interest, the mingled Brahmin and K§atriya pa-
rentage of the Bhargava Rama.

The first story, in which a cow was found to be the only equivalent
possible for the ransom of the sage Cyavana, may be passed over.

In the second story (adhy. 52-56), we come back to the anecdote of
Rama Jtoadagnya, and we have here practically a repetition of the explana-
tion given above (in adhy. 4 of this very par van) of the circumstances under
which Vi^vamitra, who was of mixed Brahmin and K§atriya parentage was
born in the K§atriya caste with Brahmanic qualities, while Rama under simi-
lar conditions was bom in the Brahmin caste with the oppo-{52}-site quali-
ties. The repetition comes about in this way. Yudhi§thira, whose curiosity
about the Bhargava Rama is, as already remarked, never satisfied, says to
Bhi§ma (B. 13. 52. 1 ff.) : '‘I have a great curiosity, O Lord, about Ja-
madagni's son Rama, that foremost of all righteous persons. You should
satisfy that curiosity. How was Rtoia bom, that tmly valorous hero? He
belonged by birth to a family of Brahmin sages. How did he become a
follower of K§atriyan practices? Relate to me in detail the circumstances
of Rama’s birth. Also how did a man bom in the family of the Ku§ikas, who
was a Ksatriya, become a Brahmin? Great indeed was the power of the
high-souled Rama afe also that of Vi^vamitra ! ”

The answer is given by Bhi^ma by relating the prophecy which had been
made by Cyavana, an ancestor of the Bhargava Rama. Cyavana wants to
prevent the harm that will come to his clan by Rama’s adopting the practices
of the K§atriyas, a danger of which he has prophetic knowledge. He repairs
to Kusika, through whose descendant the harm was to happen, in order to
vex him, and, if he finds a favouraible opportunity to pronounce a maledic-
tion on Kuiika, damning him and his descendants to eternal perdition. When
the sage presents himself before the king and says that he wants to observe a
certain vow while living in the palace with the king, he is warmly welcomed
with unfeigned joy, and also served with meticulous care and obsequiousness
by the king and the queen. The sage has a meal and he then sleeps for
twenty-one days, during which the king and the queen wait upon him with-
out food or drink, gently massaging his 1^. Suddenly the sage wakes

up and goes out, followed with trepidation by the king and the queen, and
as suddenly vanishes ! The king looks for in vain, and, returning in a de-
jected mood to the room set apart for the sage, finds him again, stretched as
before on his luxurious bed ! The sage practises many tricks of this type,
calculated to try the patience of the unfortunate couple, and ultimately yokes
them to a heavily laden war-chariot. During the drive through the city,
the sage gives the royal couple vicious digs with a heavy iron goad, distri-
buting all the while in charity the entire wealth of the king. Still the sage
finds no change in their behaviour. So in the end he has to {53} express
himself as satisfied with their treatment of him and he goes back to the
forest, asking the royal couple to come there on the following day. The king
and queen take a little rest for the first time after forty-two days of trial and
spend the night happily in each other’s company. The next morning the
king and the queen go to the forest to pay their respects to the sage and see
there a magnificent palace standing in a big park, a fair imitation of Indra's
paradise. After a short while, the magical palace and the park vanish, and
there sits in the solitude of the forest the sage who had yoked them to the
chariot and ill-treated them in other ways. Then the king feels that Brah-
mic power was the summum bonum of life. When he approaches Cyavana,
the sage gives him a boon. Kuiika wants to know why Cyavana had come
to live with him and what all those incidents implied. Cyavana tells him
frankly what his intention was and also prophesies that Kusika’s wish would
be fulfilled in so far that a descendant of Ku^ika’s (Vi^vamitra) would be-
come a Brahmin. Through the lustre of the Bhrgus, Kusika’s grandson
(Vi^vamitra) would be an ascetic endowed with the splendour of fire (B.
13. 55. 32) :

Bhrgunam eva tejasd ]
pautras te bhavitd vipras tapasvi pdvakadyutih ||

Then follows in the final chapter Cyavana’s prophecy about the persecu-
tion of the Bhtgus, about Urva (or Aurva), about Rdka, and Jamadagni,
who will marry Gadhi’s daughter, that is, Kusika’s grand-daughter. Of the
boons that will be given to the two ladies by Bhrgu, the exchange of the trees
and the earns by the mother and the daughter, about Visvamitra, and so on
and so forth. Incidentally it may be mentioned that this is the fourth oc-
currence of this interesting story of the birth of the Bhargava Rama, it hav-
ing occurred already at adhy. 4 of this very parvan, and ibefore that in the
iSanti (adhy. 48) and the Aranyaka (adhy. 115-117).

Some chapters later we again meet with the Bhargava Rama when
Bhi§ma tells Yudhii§thira about the merit of the gift of gold. The shades of
his ancestors had appeared to Bhi§ma and told him that the gift of gold
purifies the giver. Now it happens that the same advice had been given to
the Bhargava Rama by Vasi^tha and other sages. In this connection we
have again an {54} allusion to the extirpation of the K^atriyas and the con^

quest of the earth by Rama (B. 13. 84. 31) :

trifisaptakrtvafji prthivi krtd nihksatriyd pum 1

tato jitvd mahim krtsndm Rdmo rdjtvalocanah || etc. (X)

The next chapter (85), a long rambling chapter with 168 stanzas, deals
with the mystery, already alluded to above, of the birth of Bhrgu, Ahgiras
and Kavi. They are said to be prajdpatis and progenitors of many tribes
and clans, in fact of the entire mankind .

It will be a surprise to many that our sandals and umbrellas we also owe
to a Bhrgu. Chapter 95 relates how the practice arose of giving umbrellas
and sandals to Brahmins at srdddhas and other religiousi rites. Once upon
a time Jamadagni was amusing himself by shooting arrows at a distant tar-
' get, and his wife Renuka was fetching the arrows shot by him. Sorely afflic-
ted by the scorching heat of the midday sun, she rested just for a moment
under the shade of an umbrageous tree. Being kept waiting, the irascible
Bhrgu scolded his wife for her tardiness, but on learning the real cause of
the delay, wanted to shoot down the offending sun from his high position
in the heavens. The frightened luminary comes to him in the guise of a
poor Brahmin, who tries to dissuade him from carrying out his terrible threat,
but is recognized by the Bhrgu and reprimanded. In the end Jamadagni
is pacified and receives from the stm the first umbrella and the first pair of
leather sandals. To make a gift of them to Brahmins is highly meritorious.
This account of the origin of shoes and sandals is, I believe, not found out-
side the Mahabharata.

In adhy. 98 (of the Vulgate) we have a report by Bhi§ma of a discus-
sion between the Bhargava Sukra and Bali about flowers, lamps, aromatics,
appropriate to be offered to gods on diverse occasions and the merit accruing
from the presentation.

Above, while discussing the Dronaparvan version of the §oda;sarajaldya,
I had referred to palpable evidence of the “ bhrguization ” of a legend. We
have another illuminating instance of the process in the next story (adhy.
99-l()0 of the £55} Vulgate) told by Bhi^ma to Yudhi§thira. It is another
version of the well-known legend of Nahu^a’s fall from heaven.

Nahu^a, when king of the gods, neglected the daily offerings to the
gods including the bali, losing thereby some of his spiritual power. Subse-
quently, having oppressed the sages, he was hurled down from heaven and
turned into a boa by the curse of a Brahmin sage, Bhrgu.

A similar version of this legend occurs in the Udyoga (adhy. 11-17)
and is again alluded to in the Santi (adhy. 342) . There it is related that
Nahu§a became extremely arrogant and caused the sages to carry his palan-
quin. While being carried about in this way, his foot touched the head of
Agastya, who by his curse turned him into a boa. The defect in the cons-
truction of this n^Ve story is very obvious and must have been early noticed
by the diaskeuasts themselves. Nahu^a, by the terms of the boon which



EPIC STUDIES VI


321


Brahma and the gods had foolishly given him, could absorb the power of
any being on whom he set his eyes. Under these circumstances, even the
resourceful Agastya could not effectively curse Nahu^a, because Agastya,.
when kicked by the tyrant, being in full view of the other, was ipso jacto
deprived of all his spiritual power, like all the gods and sages who had been
oppressed by Nahusa and were utterly powerless before him.

The revised version of the legend in the Anu4asana stages beforehand a
confabulation between Bhrgu and Agastya. Agastya wants to damn Nahu§a
but does not know how to. Bhrgu befriends him and gives him the assurance
that he (Bhrgu) would somehow bring about the downfall of the tyrant,
Bhrgu, who knows beforehand, by spiritual prevision, that Nahusa was go-
ing to kick Agastya, proposes to Agastya, in anticipation of it, that on a
certain day he would sit hidden inside the matted locks of the sage and from
that position he would curse Nahusa. So when the opportune moment came,
Bhrgu, possessed of great lustre, addressed Agastya as follows : ‘‘ Do you
shut your eyes, Agastya, while I enter into the matted hair of your head ” .
Having said this, Bhrgu of unfading glory and great energy entered into the
locks of Agastya, who stood still like a wooden post. Soon after, Nahu§a
saw Agastya approached for being yoked to his chariot. Bhrgu, who was sit-
ting in the matted locks of Agastya, took £56} care not to look at Nahu§a.
Fully acquainted with the power which the illustrious Nahusa had acquired
on account of the boon which Brahma had given him, Bhrgu had acted thus.
Agastya though thus treated by Nahu§a did not yield to anger. Then Nahu-
vsa urged Agastya with his goad. The pious sage Agastya still did not yield
to anger. The lord of celestials, himself enraged at this pusillanimity, then
struck Agastya on the head with his left foot. When the sage was thus
struck on the head, then Bhrgu, who was sitting within the matted locks of
Agastya, became incensed and cursed the sinful Nahusa saying, “ Thou hast
kicked the head of the great sage, fall down therefore on the earth, changed
into a boa ! '' Thus imprecated by Bhrgu, who had not been seen, Nahu§a
forthwith became transformed into a boa and in that form dropped down on
the earth.

Yudhi^thira, who had heard a different version of the story from Salya,
as narrated in the Udyoga, maintains naturally a discreet silence about these
discrepancies and proceeds to question Bhi!§ma about some other matters on
which he wanted information.

Next, in the course of a long passage devoted to the praise of Brahmins,
showing that the Brahmins are mightier than even the gods, the story of
Cyavana is repeated (adhy. 156) .

Cyavana, who had been rejuvenated and cured of blindness by the As-
vins, had, as we have seen, promised them that they should drink Soma with
Indra and the other gods. The gods were wavering in their mind, but Indra
was adamant. He refused to accept the Soma libation in Cyavana’s sacrifice,

' This Uttahkopakhyana contains the last important reference in the Maha-
bharata to the Bhargavas, linking up with that in adhy. 3 of the Adi.

There are still a few more Bhiargava stories in the Mahabharata, the
consideration of which I had intentionally postponed and to which we shall
now turn.

We run into a nest of Bhargava legends, as a matter of fact, already ir
the fourth sub-section of the Adi, the Paulomaparvan, which have not been
discussed above.

The Mahabharata, as is well known, has two variant openings. In the
first (Adi. 1), when the Suta (or, according to some editions, Sauti) Ugra-
sravas, who is to recite the Mahabharata, presents himself at the hermitage
of Kulapati '^aunaka, during the twelve-year sacrificial session inaugurated
by the sage in the sacred Naimi§a Forest and offers to recite stories for the
edification and entertainment of the guests, the sages assembled there express
their desdre to hear the celebrated Mahabharata (1. 1. 18 f.) :
Janamejayasya yam rdjno V aisampdyana uktavdn |
yathdvat sa r^is tuUy^ Dvcdpdyandjfiayd ||
vedais caturbhiff. samitdm Vydsasyddbhutakarmanah j
sathhitdm sTotum icchdmo dharmydfk pdpdbhaydpahdni 1 1
The Suta accordingly commences with some mangala stanzas (1. 1. 20) :

£60} ddyath puru^am tsdnam puruhutam purustutam j

rtam ekdksaram brahma vyaktdvyaktam sandtanam | j etc.,
which are followed by a sort of prologue, which latter languishes and breaks
off somewhere.

In adhy. 4 of the Adi, we come upon another opening, whidi totally
ignores the first ! The Suta is re-introduced. The scene is the same, but
the programme is changed. Here the assembled sages do not themselves order
the entertainment, but ask the Suta to wait until the Kulapati iSaunaka
comes. When in the next chapter (5), the Kulapati joins the company, after
having duly performed his round of daily duties, he instead of asking the Suta
to narrate the Mahabharata, as the sages in the first instance had done, tells
him, strange to say, to relate first the history of the Bhargavas (1. 5. 3).
tatra vamsam ahath purvam srotum icchdmi Bhdrgavam |
kathayasva hathdm etdih kalydii sma sravane tava | ]

The Suta obediently proceeds to relate the history of that “ most illus-
trious family of the Bhrgus, which is honoured even by the celestials with
Indra, Agni and the Maruts"' (1. 5. 5). Here the Bhargava interest is very
clear and unmistakable. Accordingly eight chapters (5-12), which form the
Paulomaparvan, are entirely consecrated to an account of the wonderful deeds
of some of the Bhargavas, an account which is not even remotely connected
in actual fact with the incidents or characters of our epic. It is a digression
pure and simple, introduced with the very obvious object of glorifying the
Bhargavas and giving a permanent form to some of the Bhirgava myths and



EPIC STUDIES VI


325


legends. These chapters .are a short history of one special branch of the
Bhargava clan, represented by : Bhfgu, Cyavana, Pramati, Rum and Sunaka.
The significance of this branch and its connection with our version of the
Mahabharata will become apparent presently.

Bhrgu, a sage of almost mythical character, the eponymous ancestor of
the family, is here said to have been created from Brahma from the sacri-
ficial fire during Vamiia’s sacrifice (216*) :

Bhrgur mahar^ir bhagavan Brahmmd vai svayamhhuvd ]

Va^unasya kratau jdtah pdvQkdd iti nah srutam\\

£61} This interpolated stanza (found only in N) contradicts the statetnent
in the main body of the text (documented jointly by N and S) to the effect
that Bhrgu was born by piercing the heart of Brahma (1. 60. 40) :

Brahmaru) hjdayam bhittvd nihsrto bhagavdn Bhjguh 1
While Bhrgu’s wife Puloma was pregnant, the story continues (adhy. 5-6),
there came to Bhrgu’s hermitage, during his absence, a demon {rdksasa),
Puloman, who became enamoured of her and wanted to carry her off. To
make sure of his facts, however, the demon asked Agni whether she was
really Bhrgu’s wife. The fact was that this Puloma was first betrothed to
Puloman and afterwards given by her father to Bhrgu, and Puloman wanted
to have his Puloma back. On getting from Agni an answer in the affirma-
tive, the demon, assuming the form of a boar, carried her off. On the
way Cyavana is born. His lustre instantly reduces to ashes the demonic
ravisher of his mother and saves her from a very awkward predicament.
Puloma returns home safely with the baby. Bhrgu only learns of this inci-
dent after his return to the hermitage. Incensed at the outrage, he curses the
god Agni, whom he regards as the prime cause of the disaster, saying that
Agni would be an eater of all things, good and bad {sarva-bhaksa) .

There follows in adhy, 8 the story of Ruru, son of Pramati. Menaka
an apsaras, abandons her beautiful daughter near the hermitage of the sage
Sthulake§a. She is called Pramadvara. Pramati arranges her marriage with
his son Ruru, who has fallen in love with her. Shortly before the celebration
of their marriage Pramadvara is bitten by a venemous snake and dies, leav-
ing Ruru disconsolate. By the miraculous powers of his austere penance,
this Bhargava gives up half of his life to Pramadvara and revives her, and
ultimately marries her. Ruru takes a vow to destroy all the snakes in the
world, like Janamejaya before him, whose father Pariksit had died as the
result of a snake-bite. One day Ruru cotnes across a harmless old snake of
the variety known as 4m4ubha (adhy, 9), The snake begs to be spared and
so Ruru does not kill it. The serpent body only concealed the metamor-
phosed soul of a sage, who was suffering the effects of a curse pronounced on
him in a previous birth (adhy. 10). The £62} sage declares akimsd to be
the highest duty of a Brahmin. Janamejaya had once tried to destroy the
race of snakes by performing a snake sacrifice ; they were saved by the Brah-



326


EPIC STUDIES


min Astika (adhy. 11). Ruru subsequently hears the story of Janamejaya’s
snake sacrifice from his father Pranvati (adhy. 12). This story of the snake
sacrifice as told by Pramati to his son Ruru was repeated verbatim by the
Suta to saunaka and forms in our version of the Mahabhiirata the Astika-
parvan, the fifth sub-section of the Adi. (adhy. 13-53).

It will be noticed that from adhy. 4 to adhy. 12 of the Adi. a section
which, as already mentioned, is entirely concerned with the history of a
branch of the Bhargava clan, there is no mention of the Mahiabharata at all.
Nor is there, as a matter of fact, any mention of the epic in the immediate
sequel up to adhy. 53 of the Adi ! Only in adhy. 53, after having heard first
the Bhargava legends and then the story of the snake sacrifice (which had
been previously related by the Bhargava Pramati to his son Ruru), ^unaka
at last expresses the desire to hear the Mahabharata of Kr^ia Dvaipayana,
which v^as narrated to king Janamejaya by Vaisampayana in the intervals
of that snake sacrifice (1. 53. 32 f.) :

Mahdbhdratam dkyhdnnm Pdn^vdndm yasasharam j
Janamejayena yat prstah Krsna-Dvaipdyanos tada \ \
srdvaydmdse vidhivat tadd karmdntaresu sah |
tdm >aham vidhivat punydni srotum icchdmi vai kathdm j [

This completes our survey of the Bhargava, material in the Mahabha-
rata.^ But even this analysis does not give an adequate idea of the total
number of Bhargava references in the Great £63} Epic. The Bhargavas
regularly occur as static figures, along with other ancient sages, in the des*
criptions of martial combats, festive gatherings, state functions, council meet-
ings and all important assemblies. Outstanding incidents of their history
are frequently alluded to, briefly, even in the course of other narratives. The
names of their heroes are habitually introduced in similes and metaphors :
they are the standards of comparison iupamdna), to which everybody else
is compared, especially the epic heroes. Thus a man is praised by saying
that his intelligence is like that of Sukra. A waiTior is eulogized by saying
that in heroism he was the equal of the Bhargava Rama. Bhisma is once
praised by saying that he could not be defeated even by Rama. In other
places the valour and effulgence of Cyavana and Aurva are utilized for the
sake of a passing comparison. The devotion of Sukanya to her husband

1 The following sages should probably further be included among the Bhfgus :
( 1 ) a sage, mentioned several times in the Araijyaka ; a legend is told

about him in the Baladeva-tirthayStra (5alyaparvan) ; (2) G/tsamada, mentioned
briefly in the Anu^asana ; (3) Veda, who was the teacher of Uttahka and chaplain
of Janamejaya and Pau§ya ; (4) Paila, one of the pupils of Vyasa ; and (5) Math
davyay who curses Dharma in the celebrated story (updkhydm) of Animaijidavya
in the Adi. The part they play in our epic is small, and therefore they have been
ignored in this paper. Moreover, none of them, except Grtsamada, is actually called
a Bhargava in our epic. Sii-Kr^pa himstelf was distantly connected with the Bhar-
gavas, being a desteendant of Yadu, the son of Yayati by the Bhargava Devay-ani.

Cyavana has been made proverbial by constant citation. These details could
not be considered in the present paper for want of space.^

Retrospect

From the legends preserved in our epic it should seem that the Bhar-
gavas were a Brahmin clan, perhaps more intimately associated with the
ancient K§atriyas than most of the other Brahmin clans, being largely con-
nected with them by matrimonial ties. Thus Cyavana is said to have married
Sukanya, the daughter of king saryMi. Rqika had married Satyavati, the
daughter of king Gadhi of Kanyakubja and sister of the famous Visvamitra.
Jamadagni’s wife Renuka is likewise said to have been a princess by birth,
being a daughter of king Prasenajit of Ayodhya. The Bhargavi Dev^ayani
was moreover married to king Yayati : one of the very few pratiloma mar-
riages on record in Brahmanical literature." King Vitahavya had been adopt-
ed and made a Brahmin by a Bhrgu, and his descendants became Bhargavas.^
On the other hand some of the ancient Bhargavas seem to have come seri-
ously into conflict with the K§atriyas. The relations of Rama Jamadagnya
with the Ksatriyas are so well known and have been repeated above so often
that it is £64} unnecessary to dilate upon them here. But even in the case
of Aurva and Jamadagni, the epic has to relate conflicts with the Ksatriyas,
which have been alluded to above.

In these conflicts the Bhargavas are represented in our epic as irascible
sages, domineering, arrogant, unbending and revengeful. To our epic bards
they are at the same time omniscient and omnipotent. Supermen, who had
become so chiefly by virtue of their rigid austerities and the magical or spi-
ritual powers acquired by them. Owing to these occult powers, the Bharga-
vas were like gods walking on earth, or rather greater than mere gods.
Thus Bhrgu pronounces a curse on Agni — a god fervently lauded
and worshipped by the simple Aryans-— for no faults of his. He also cursed
(according to one version) Nahu:§a, who had been elected king of gods and
who had become arrogant and irreligious owing to this sudden elevation to
IX)wer. The wizard Cyavana paralyzed the arm of the recalcitrant Indra,
a high god of the Vedic Aryans. Jamadagni would shoot down the Sun,
another Aryan god. The Bhargava Uttahka, when about to curse 'Sri-Kr§'na,
the supreme god of the Bhagavatas or Vai^navas, was gently pacified by
the avdlara. The kings of the earth are of course like vermin before these
Bhargavas. The mighty Haihayas tremble before the infant Aurva, who
blinds them by his effulgence, and they have to beg for mercy on their bended
knees. King Kusika grovels at the feet of Cyavana and meekly submits to
all varieties of indignities for fear that the great sage might curse him.

1 Even these may be considered later, if a suitable opportunity presents itself.

EPIC STUDIES


Bhrgu, the eponymous ancestor of the Bhargavas, was one of the pra-
japatis. While the other prajapatis like Dak^a are said to have issued from
different limbs of Brahma, Bhfgu is represented as having sprung from
Brahma's heart, the noblest of the internal organs of man of god.^ In an-
other context in our epic, it is implied that Bhrgu was the greatest of the ma-
karris, though his name is not included even in the list of the famous Seven
Sages.

But the Bhargava most popular with our bards is surely Rama Jama-
dagnya. The bards love to dwell on his martial exploits, repeating them
whenever the slightest opportunity for it presents itself. The shadow of
this colossus overspreads the entire epic, excepting the short tale at the end
of the poem. In our epic he is not yet a full-fledged avatdra, but on the
high way to be ele-£65}-vated to that rank, surreptitious efforts being made
to make the epic document his divinity. He conquers the whole world, alone
and unaided ; such is the prowess of his fierce austerities. He frees the
earth of the burden of K§atriyas thrice seven times and makes the gift of
the earth to Kasyai>a, his priest, who divides it among Brahmins. Rama
fights even the enemies of the gods, with the same assurance and success,
enemies whom the gods themselves could not subdue. As the Bhargava
Rama is the perfect warrior {smvas^astrabhrtdm varah a phrase the bards
love to apply to him), three of the leading warriors of the Kaurava army—
Bhi§ma, Drona and Karoa — are said to have been initiated into the science
of arms by Rama Jamadagnya, though the latter according to the epic itself,
lived at the end of the Treta Age and the Kuru P^i>dava war took place at
the end of the Dvapara.

The epic contains a number of episodes {updkhydnas) relating to the
Bhargavas, such as, the Aurvopakhyma (Adi), Kartaviryopakhyana (Arai.i-
yaka), Ambopakhyana (Udyoga), Vipulopakhyana (;^nti), and Uttankopa-
khyana (Asvamedha), and so on. The entire Pauloma and a large section
of the Pau^ya two independent sub-parvans of the epic, are also devoted to
the legends of the Bhargavas. Besides these there are important discussions
and discourses attributed to some of the celebrated Bhargavas, such as the
Bhrgu-Bharadvaja-samvada, the Cyavana-Kusika-samvada and the Mar-
kai>deya-|samasya.

Another striking feature of these Bhargava legends in our Mahabh.^ 4 -
rata is the frequent repetition of these legends on different occasions in the
course of the epic. Thus the legend of Uttafika, the myth of the alterca-
tion between Cyavana and Indra, the story of Dropa’s obtaining weapons
from the Bhargava Rama, and the account of Karna’s pupilship under him,
is each told twice, in different contexts. The legend of the birth of Jama-
dagni and Rama is related in all four times. That the Bhargava Rama ex-
terminated the K§atriyas thrice seven times is mentioned ten times, in nearly

identical form {trihsaptakrtvali pjthivl krtd nif^kscUriyd purd, which appears
to have been a slogan of the bards) ; but the humiliation of the pride of
the K)§atriyas by the Bhargava Rama is mentioned about a score of times.

It is to be noted that the Bhargavas spring into this promi-£66}nence
all of a sudden in the Mahabharata. We look in vain for any reflection of
their phenomenal power and glory in the Vedic literature.^^ There the
Bhargavas are frequently alluded to as devoted to the fire-cult and they ap-
I^ear in the role of a group of ancient fire priests. They are said to have
procured fire for mankind. In the Battle of Ten Kings, the
Bhargavas are mentioned with the Druhyus. In many passages they are
associated with the Afigirases. The Atharvaveda is also known as BhrgvaiV
giras, and it seems certain that both the Bhrgus and the Angirases dabbled
a great deal in the black art and were feared on that account. That they
probably came into conflict with other clans and especially perhaps the K§a-
triyas is indicated by the fact that in the last-named Veda the name of
Bhrgu is chosen to exemplify the dangers incurred by those who oppress
Brahmins. The Siiijaya Vaitahavyas succumb as the result of an attack
on Bhrgu. 'The Aitareya Brahmaipa shows Bhrgu in a similar light.

Thus we see that the Vedic references give no ground for explaining the
eminence of the ancient Bhargavas implied by the epic account. These refe-
rences supply nevertheless rudimentary clues of ideas ahd sentiments which
were probably magnified in the imagination of the remote decendants of a
powerful ancient clan, influenced strongly by the cult of ancestor worship.
Thus, for example, the close connection of the Bhrgus with the fire cult may
ixirhaps serve to explain the part that Agni plays in many of the Bhargava
legends in the Mahabharata. The Cyavana-Asvins legend of the epic finds
some support in the statement of the Bgveda to the effect that the Asvins re-
juvenated Cyavana, making him “ acceptable to his wife and a husband of
maidens. ” The Brahmainas amplify this account. The connection of the
Bhrgus with the Atharvaveda explains the element of witchcraft in the
Bhargava legends of our epic, such as, for example, the revival of the dead
by the Bhargava Sukra, or the paralyzing of the arm of Indra by Cyavana
and of the creation of the monster called Mada, mentioned above. That tlie
Bhrgus had in some way championed the cause of Brahmins against other
clans is, as £67} already mentioned, supported by a reference in the Athar-
vaveda. Their intimate association with the Angirases implied in the Vedic
literature is reflected faithfully in many of the stories and genealogies of our
epic.

Taking a collective view of these Bhargava references in the Great Epic,
we cannot avoid the conclusion that the Bhargava heroes occupy a surpris-
ingly large portion of the canvas — ^which is said to depict the Bharata
War — ^filling up as they do much of the available space of the background.

EPIC STUDIES


And it is more than probable that if the epic is examined yet mqre minute-
ly, still further evidence of Bhargava material, hitherto undiscovered, will
be brought to light. Their myths and legends are uniformly distributed over
the entire extent of the Great Epic with the exception of some short and
unimportant parvans (10 and 15-18) at the end (comprising in all not more
than 2500 stanzas, a negligible fraction of the epic), books on vrtiich the aver-
age reader of the poem bestows but scant attention. The figures of the
Bhargavas have also been magnified to colossal proportions, painted with a
thick brush and in vivid colours. In short, the Bhargavas are represented in
our epic — ^the Mahabharata, the epic of the Bharata's or the epic of the
Bharata War— throughout as the people. How does that come about?—
** Cui bono ? as the Roman lawyer would have asked.

To imagine that all this fulsome eulogy liberally showered upon the he-
roes of the Bhargavas, and the interminable repetition of their stories and
legends are entirely unconscious — at least unintentional — ^and without any
ulterior motive, being just ordinary features of epic treatment, would be in-
deed naiVe.'^ In the first place, we have very clear and definite evidence of
the fact that our epic ha^ been consciously and deliberately expanded at
least in one instance : the surreptitious addition of a bunch of Bhargava
legends to the Kuru-Pajjdava epic in the shape of the so called Paulompar-
pan in the Adi which is entirely made up of Bhargava legends and has not
even the remotest intrinsic connection with the story of the epic.
Then we have equally clear and definite evidence of the tenden-
tious “ BhTguization of older l^ends, which occur in the epic itself in Iuh)
forms, one with and the other without some important Bh&rgava element, to
wit, the Stories of Sixteen Kings (Sodasarajikiya) and the Nahu§a-£68}
Agastya legend . We have also noticed that our Mahabharata contains t\\'o
variant openings, one of which is clearly inspired by a Bhargava,^ both for-

^ There isi only one explanation of the childish exaggeration and this repeated
mention on the annihilation of the Ki§atriyas by the Bhargava Rama. A deep
analysis of the motives underlying this (phenomenon) would suggest that these
fabrications are only a form of ‘over-compensation’, and endeavour to make the
Bhrgus feel important and * worth while’, after the disastrous blow to their ego-
ideals, It is the psychological revenge of the Bhrgus who were all but exterminated
by the K§atriyas. The slaughter of the Bhrgus admitted by the Bhrgus them-
selves in the Aurva legend deserves all the credence which unfavourable evidence
by a witness against one’s own self ordinarily does ; what the Bhrgus in turn (fid
to the K§atiiyas — namely, the annihilating the K§atriyas by Bhargava Rama 3X7
is known to us only from the account of the event from Brahmin sources. This
myth— the dream of the Bhrgus— is the sublimation of that intolerable inferiority
feeling . which had been repressed, but which was clamouring for expression.

? This was noticed by Holtzmann, Das Mahabharata, vol. 2 (1893), p.. 12.

tunately preserved by the coinservative instinct of the redactors, helped by a
process of conflation peculiar to the Mahabharata, which tolerates a close
juxtaposition of discrepant versions. We have further indirect testimony of
the effort made to connect some Bhiargava or other with the proi>agation of
the epic. We are thus told that it was the Bhargava Uttahka who instigated
Janamejaya to undertake the snake sacrifice at which the Mahabharata was
first publicly recited. Our Astika is that tale which was narrated to the
Bhargava Ruru by his father Pramati. And last but not least, we must take
account of the very important fact that the Kulapati saunaka himself, be-
fore whom the Mahabharata is said to have been recited by the Suta Ugra^ra *
vas, was also a Bhargava ! So when Saunaka says that he wants to hear
the history of the Bhargavas before anything else (1. 5. 3) :

tatra vomsam aham pur v am hotum kchdmi Bhdrgavam |,
the reason for this peculiar predilection of the host of the Suta! is very evi-
dent.

But it might be contended that we are unnecessarily emphasizing the
Bhargava element ; that the Mahabharata was or has come to be an encyclo-
paedia of Brahmanic tradition and it therefore contains also all the Bhargava
legends — in a slightly exaggerated form perhaps. The epic itself says (1.
56. 33) :

yad ihdsti tad anyatra yan nehdsti na tat kvacit [

That is undoubtedly true, to a certain extent. One can, however, easily con-
vince oneself that the diaskeuasts who boldly conceived the colossal idea of
converting the popular Epic of the Bharatas into the Encyclopaedia Brah-
manica, though generally catholic in their selection of Brahmanic legends and
doctrines, and eclectic as regards their religious and philosophical outlook,
yet they {69} were probably not entirely without their preferences and pre-
judices, and that they do not apportion anything like the same amount of
space and breadth of treatment to the myths and legends of other Brahmanic
families such as the Agastyas, Atreyas, Kai^vas, K^yapas, Gautamas, Va-
si§thas, and so on. The legends of these other families or clans are by no
means entirely ignored in our Mahabharata, but they are comparatively few
in number and hardly ever repeated. They appear like negligible details
on the vast canvas of the epic and are easily lost sight of in this colossal
accumulation of apparently most heterogeneous elements, which are all the
same carefully balanced so as to produce a more or less homogeneous impres-
sion. Very differently treated are the Bhargava legends in our Mahabharata.
To make any impression by the side of the titanic figures of the old epic like
BhS§ma and Karrja, Krgpa and Arjuna, the Bhargavas had to be magnified a
great deal and their legends, which were probably not so well known then

sequel. '' Unser Mahdhkdrata/* he remarks, kehrt aber sofort wieder zur ander-

as now had to be repeated. And we accordingly find that the legends have
been repeated, so often that the redactors themselves must have in time come
to believe in them ; and the figure have been magnified, so liberally that
they app>ear almost to eclii>se the heroes of the Great Epic itself.

Just for the sake of contrast, we might compare the other great epic
of India, the Ratnayanja, for Bhargava references. That epic also is a Brah-
manic epic, containing a host of Brahmanic legends and stories.
The result of his quest for Bhargava’ references will astonish the
reader. The references are remarkably few and extremely meagre.
About our Bhrgu, a viMuti of :§ri“KT§ha» the only thing recorded in
the Ramayaija is that his wife was decapitated by Vi§nu ! Cyavana has
been introduced in Valmiki’s epic only to narrate some stories. The solitary
reference to our Rama Jamadagnya {&arvasastrabhrtam varah) has been no-
ticed above ; it is the one in which he challenges Rama Dasarathi and is
worsted in the encounter ! We learn nothing more about Jamadagni from
the Ram^yaiija than the bald fact that he was slain by Arjuna Kartavirya.
Aurva, who as an infant had blinded the Haihayas by his effulgence, is not
mentioned at all, so far as I know. Comment is superfluous.

£70} Now there can be no question that all this Bhargava material in
our present Mahabharata is entirely foreign to the plan of the original saga
of the Bharatas, occurring as it does almost wholly in the episodic portion
of the epic. There should foe, therefore, in my opinion no hesitation in con-
cluding that in our version of the Mohabhdrata there is a conscious — nay
deliberate — weaving together or rather stitching together of the Bhdrala le-
gends with the Bhargava myths.

The question how precisely this Bhargava element, which we find con-
centrated mostly in the updkhyasnaSy came into the cycle of the Bharata le-
gends is intriguing, but unfortunately the answer is largely a matter of spe-
culation. Even according to the traditional view, it was not the work of Vyasa,
the reputed author of the Mahabharata, because the diaskeuasts have been
fortunately frank enough to admit that his work, the Bharata, which originally
consisted merely of 24,000 stanzas, had no episode to speak of (1. 1. 61) :
caturvimsatisdhasrtm cakre Bhdratasamhitdm j
updkhydnair vind tdvad Bhdratam procyate budhaih i]

It could again hardly have been the work of Vaiiampayana, the direct
pupil of VyaSa, according to tradition, who is said to halve recited the Bha-
rata of Vyasa, in the presence of Vyasa himself, as he had been taught by
his guru, during the intervals of the short snake Sacrifice celebrated by king
janamejaya.

The case was different with the next recorded recitation of the Maha-
bharata : it was by the Suta Ugra4ravas in the presence of the Bhargava
Saunaka during the twelve-year sacrifice instituted by the latter (1. 1. Iff;
4. Iff). Even before the recitation commences, iSaunaka explicitly asks the

Suta who had come there to recite his Mahabharata, to narrate first of all the
history of the Bhargavas and, as directed by his host, the Suta obediently
does sq. There is a very clear shifting of the centre of gravity. Here
we have a different milieu and a. different interest. The scene changes from
the bustling and scintillating pageantry of the Kaurava Court to the reflec-
tive calm and leisure of the sylvan retreat of the Bhrgus.

Few scholars, I imagine, would now be inclined to deny that our epic
text has undergone momentous alterations in the course {71} of its long and
eventful history. It is now generally recognized that the Bharata, like the po-
pular lays, ballads and early epics of all countries and all people, has always
been a fluid text, adjusted to the varying needs of the occasion and the differ-
ing tastes of the audience. No disp>aragement or condemnation of the text is
thereby implied. The process is quite normal, inevitable and in a wider
sense wholly right. To continue to be a vital force in the life of a progres-
sive people, the epic must be a slow-changing book. The fact of expurgation
and elaboration is only an outward indication of its being a book of inspira-
tion and guidance in life, and not merely a book lying unused and forgotten
on a dusty book-shdf. And this is no drawback in the case of our text.
Therein lies on the contrary its capital interest and importance for us. It
is a rapid motion picture reel of many ages of Indian culture— not necessarily
factitive history — arranged in a naive fashion : something like the sculptured
panels on the gateways and the railings of the Buddhist Stupa at Sanchi or
the mural frescoes of Ajanta, with scenes telescoped all in one plane, without
much regard to perspective or perhaps with its own peculiar technique of pers-
pective.

As already remarked, it seems probable that in the formative period of
the epic a powerful Bhargava influence — direct or indirect — ^has been at work,
so to say behind the scenes, in shaping our epic for us. This element had
obviously obtruded itself upon the original nucleus, certainly after the time
of the original author Vyasa and probably after that of Vaisampayana. The
next traditional link, however, in the transmission of the epic is the Suta. Is
the Suta then responsible for the conversion of the Bhlarata into the Maha-
bharata ? Now I do not doubt that some of the Sutas probably were gifted
versifiers, able to compose ex tempore short bardic poems and to improvise
lays to suit them to the varying tastes and requirements of the audience.
But if we consider these Sutas capable of composing on the spur of the mo-
ment such masses of narrative episodes and didactic discourses as we find in
our Mahabhfirata, we shall be asking these minstrels with an accomplish-
ment far beyond their natural capacity. Nobody is, however, so credulous
nowadays as to imagine the Suta as the author of those extensive innovation
that must {72} have been necessary in order to convert a heroic poem of about
24,000 stanzas (taking the traditional figure as a rough guide for our spe-
culations) into an encyclopaedia, of the present dimensions.

EPIC STUDIES


We are not in any case, as far as I can see, constrained to accept every
single statement of the epic in its exact literal sense. And when I say that,
I mean no disparagement either of the text ; far from it. Our epic does not
pretend to be a dry, prosaic, matter-of-fact chronicle, nor a statistical history
in the modem sense, based upon a laboriously compiled critical apparatus.
If it were that, it would surely not have lived for 2500 years. We have on
the shelves of our libraries hundreds of ponderous tomes and compendiums
of national and world history, prepared along approved lines by laborious
professors of history. But hardly anybody reads these works twice, and they
are mostly forgotten, in a generation or two, by an understanding and un-
grateful posterity. The Mahabharata never was a scientific chronicle of that
type and it would be egregious folly to regard it as such. It is above all
an inspired poem. It was actually regarded by later generations as a kdvya :

krtam mayedam bhagavan kdvyam pammapujitam |, '
the highest type of Indian poetry, like its sister epic, the Ramayapa. It was
before everything else a work of art, creative art, idealistic in conception,
informed with deep religious feeling, permeated by a conscious didactic pur-
pose, focussed more on ideas and ideals than on facts and figures, in which
people were not interested then so much as now ; a work in which a moral
was conveyed by a parable, an elusive truth by a tangible facile myth. And
to the inspired creators of a traditional book of that type we must at least
allow poetic licence and common imagination.

The entire story that the Suta had heard the epic at its first recitation
by Vaisarhpayana and reproduced it verbatim at Saunaka’s bidding, having
committed it to memory after a single hearing, is so obviously unnatural and
improbable that it seems clearly more appropriate to regard it merely as a
poetic fiction, a “ frame-story,'’ the most popular of Indian devices of literary
composition. But there is no symbolism without a basis, however difficult
it may £73} be for us to reach the elusive subconscious or unconscious. To
my mind, the frame-story of our Mahabharata is directly an unconscious
admission of the fact that the Bharata had at a critical stage of its evolu-
tion passed into the sphere of influence of the Bhrgus, through the medium
of the wandering minstrel. The Bhargava influence is implied in the person
of the Kulapati Saunaka. The Snta, who u^ to recite the poem in the
Heroic Age, is kept on, with due regard to traditional usage, to give the new
recension a setting appropriate to it and indicating the source at the same time.

The influence of the Bhargavas in the narrative portion of the Great Epic
is very evident and can hardly be disputed. But their influence in an en-
tirely different sphere, though less tangible and therefore more difficult to de-
monstrate, is to my mind nevertheless probable : I mean the incorporation
into the epic of large masses of didactic material, concentrated chiefly in the
iSanti and AnuSasana, especially so far as it concerns the Dharma and Niti
elements. Though the philosophy of the Mahabharata is often times rather



EPIC STUDIES VI


335


shaky, being in places abstruse and confused, and though the religious be-
liefs which find expression there are perplexingly eclectic, oscillating between
Vai§iDavism and Saivism, between Henotheism and Pantheism, there can be
no two opinions about the fact that the Mahabharata offers a very sound and
complete exposition of Dharma and Niti according to Indiah theorists, a
feature which has given this vaierable old monument of Indian antiquity
its rank as Smrti and its abiding value and interest to the Hindus, nay to all
true children of Mother India.

Now it happens that Dharma and NJti are just the two topics in which
the Bhrgus had specialized and with which their names are prominently as-
sociated. The connection of the Bhargava Sukra with NIti, which is prover-
bial in the Mahabharata, is so patent that it does not need to be especially
pointed out. The connection of the Bhrgus with the Dharma^stra is perhaps
not so well known, but is nevertheless equally certain. One has only to re-
call that, according to a tradition preserved in the work itself, our Manusmrti,
the most famous and popular of ancient Indian works bearing on the Dhar-
ma^astra, is the ancient Code £74} of Manu in the form in which it was
communicated to mankind by Bhrgu and is therefore even commonly known
as the Blifgusamhita, an explanation which I see not the slightest reason to
question or doubt. It is also recognized that there is intimate connection
between the Mahabharata and the Manusmrti. The Manusmrti, it may be
pointed out, has an introduction not unlike in conception to the first chapter
of our epic : a few stanzas agree to some extent even in their wording. The
opinions of Manu have been frequently cited in our Mahabharata {ity evarh
Manur abravU). According to Buhler's computation, there are about 260
stanzas of the Manusmrti, that is nearly 10 per cent, of the total, which are
again found verbatim (or with only slight vari^ions) in parvms 3, 12 and
13 alone of the Great Epic.^ Then on the side of the Mahabharata, Dharma
is the foundation on which the whole stately edifice of the Great Epic has
been reared, and to a great extent also the material of which it is composed.
Our Mahabharata is itself a dharmOtgrantha. The putative hero of the epic,
Yudhi§thira is called Dharmaraja, himself a son of Dharma ; he is Dharma
incarnate. The Bharata was a dhcnma-yuddha : yato dhmmas tato jayab^
The field of battle was a dharma-k^etra. Narayana incarnated himself
as Si^-Kr^na to restore the fallen Dharma. The essence of the book {Bhdra-
ta^sdvitri), embodying the moral of the story, is given as (B. 18. 5. 62 f.) :

The infiltration of masses of Bhargava material in the shape of Bhargava
myths and legends, the manner of its treatment, ahd even that strange admix-
ture of the Epic with the Dharma and Niti elements, which latter especially
has so long puzzled many inquirers into the genesis of the Mahabharata,
thus appear to find a simple and straightforward explanation in the assump-
tion of an important umtrny dmkeuasis of the epic under very strong and
direct Bhargava influmce. But this does not at all £75} imply that the text
has remained untouched after this first diaskeuasis ; far from it. Like all
traditional works, it was a slow-changing book ; and additions and alterations,
as already remarked, must have been made in it continuously throughout its
long history of about 2500 years.^

These further additions were in the main probably made in the first ins-
tance by the Bhfirgavas themselves in the centuries that immediately fol-
lowed) the first important diaskeuasis under Bhargava supervision, since it is
most likely that just as the different collections of Vedic hymns, the various
Brahmanas and the ritualistic manuals were all, for some time, the closely
guarded property of diverse Vedic schools and families of sages, which had
respectively cultivated and developed them, so also our remodelled Bharata,
now elevated to the rahk of the Fifth Veda, must have remained for some
time in the exclusive possession of the Bhargavas as their close literary pre
serve. That would, in my opinion, account for the apparent homogeneous
character of this heterogeneous mass : it all came from different hands, but
out of the same mould.

If the above considerations have any validity, they might help us to lift
up a comer of the thick veil enveloping our Great Epic and allow us to have
a covert peep into its history. Such a peep would show that there existed
in India, in very ancient tim^ an epic poem of about 24,000 stanzas, attribut-
ed to Vyasa (the ‘‘Expander'’), which described in great detail the Bharata
War and sang the glory of the P5ji?,davas. This heroic poem, the Bharata,
which used to be recited by the Sutas mostly at royal courts and had in
course of time become very popular, was at a critical stage of its history ap-
propriated by the Bhrgus (who had certainly specialized in the Dharma and
NitiSstra and probably also developed leanings towards Vi^puism), with the
idea of developing the epic into a vdiide of jxxpular instmction and edifica-
tion combined with entertainment. Theste anchorites, full of age-old wisdom

and wonderful masters of the art of inyth-weaving, took from the Sutas the
Bharata and gave back to the world the Mahabharata, the same book yet
different. In the process of the redaction by the Bhrgus, the work, naturally
and to an extent unconsciously, received that characteristic and inddiWe
stamp £76} which was predetermined by the eventful history, the natural
proclivities, the special endowments, and the peculiar ‘‘ Weltanschauung '' of
the Bhrgus. It was this little episode in its history that necessarily gave cur
poem the anomalous character of an Epos and “ Rechtsbuch coimbined. It
may be surmised that this remodelled Bharata remained for some consider-
able time in the hands of the Bhargavas, who had developed it and so to say
re-created it, as their exclusive literary property, and they exploited it there-
after and propagated it in their own way. The colossal success of the Bhar-
gava recension of the ancient Epic of the Bharatas, a success which in one
sense was richly deserved, was the indirect cause of the neglect and subse-
quent disappearance of the original heroic poem, which probably still existed
at the time of the composition of the Asvalayana Grhya Sutra (3. 4. 4).“^
Like other branches of the hieratic literature, when the epic at last passed out
of the hands of the Bhrgus and became the common property of the literati
of India, it still remained a fluid text, not entirely closed to minor altera-
tion and expansion, but retained its character as a traditional work, revered
and cherished by the people as the work of Mahar^i Vyasa and serving still as
a vehicle of popular education, fiispiration and edification as intended by
the Bhrgus. The further we pursue the study of the traces of Bhiargava in-
fluence on the Epic of the Bharatas, the clearer, it seems to me, will become the
history of our Mahabharata, the Great Epic of Bharatavar^a.
