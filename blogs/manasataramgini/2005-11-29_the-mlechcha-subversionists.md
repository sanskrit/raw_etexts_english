title = "The mlechCha subversionists"

+++
I have never been a great fan of many modern Hindu fads: 1) They include
the foolish opposition to the ultimate non-Indian origin of the
Indo-Aryan and their incursion into India. 2) The statement that all
religions say the same thing only their practioners distort the “Truth”.
This is especially frightening ignorance with respect to Islam and
Christism. 3) The Hindus in reality worship only one god. 4) Hindus do
not believe in the evolutionary theory. But I have always held that it
is up to Hindus themselves to chose their desired level of ignorance
rather than be “saved” by some blathering Indologist. As I have argued
before, Indologists are not all bad, their translations of the veda have
given uneducated Hindus the chance to understand them at some
superficial level. Without these aids, the lack of proper Sanskrit
education in India may have kept the masses even more ignorant.

Yet the weight of the evidence shows that many mlechCha, turuShka,
prAchya and yavana Indologists are a dangerous creed with a subversive
anti-Hindu streak. The recent letter signed by them in the California
school book affair shows this. Let us analyze some of these
Indologists:  
Michael Witzel: A pompous German crusader with a growing anti-Hindu
streak. He made his Malhotran U-turn in the 1990s and has been driving
on the opposite lane ever since. Witz in German means a joke and much of
what Witzel has been saying recently seems to be a joke: “Mit Witzel
herum haben wir nur viele Witze“.  
Steve Farmer: A bright mind in the orbit of Witzel, whom he serves as a
faithful lackey. Of course he oversells his brain storms as though they
are the best theories possible.  
Homi Bhabha: One of those fuzzy heads at Harvard making gold out of the
gas of “Post-colonial studies”  
Madhav Deshpande: A traitorous brown-sahib and a fallen brahmin. Like a
Gungadin he potters around ever-attempting to please the White Massa.  
Harry Falk: Has taught us the profound truth that the poor Indians never
knew to write until they were made literate by the gracious Greeks and
their Semitic teachers.  
Lars Fosse: A Dalitist Hindu-hater. Attempting subversionist attempts
via the Dalit traitors of India.  
Robert Goldman: The perverted man who compared the expansion of Hanuman
to the erection of a flaccid phallus. Wants to down-size the Ramayana to
put the uppity Hindus in place.  
Dwijendra Jha: Worst Brahmin traitor and lickspittle of Witzel.
Dwijendra he was called, but taskarashiromaNi he is.  
Jonathan Kenoyer: Son of missionaries in Pakistan \! What else but hate
for Hindus can he learn from his Momeen friends.  
Rajesh Kocchar: A burnt out astronomer now making hay as a lickspittle
of his White Massas.  
Richard Meadow: A Paki-loving Hindu baiter.  
Rafique Mughal: What does a bloody Pakistani Momeen need to tell us
about Hindus.  
Palaniappan: Dravidianist traitor.  
Parimal Patil: Hindu traitor  
Asko Parpola: An associate of Christian missionaries and passes away
utter nonsense such as his mIn (fish) theories as decipherments of the
Indus graffiti. A Dravidianist and collaborator of Tamil chauvanists.  
Patrick Olivelle: A Shri Lankan convert to the Christist delusion. Once
a very careful translator of Sanskrit texts, now on the way to his great
Malhotran U-turn. Very dangerous because some prestigious translation
projects of Sanskrit texts are in his hand.  
Don Ringe: Renowned Linguist. Has been insidiously recruited to aid the
mlechCha subversionists.  
Harmut Scharfe: A German scholar who wrote important and largely
positive works on India such as the study of kauTilIya arthashAstra,
education in ancient India and the India state. Now he is observed
making his Malhotran U-turn and speeding on the reverse lane.  
Sudha Shenoy: A spineless Indian grandmother wanting to be in the
company of the White Massas.  
Romila Thapar: Indian communist and “eminent” historian, well-known
charlatan.  
Muneo Tokunaga: Has done great service to the Hindus in the past by
pioneering the electronic production of numerous Hindu texts. Is making
a Malhotran U-turn with a possible racist tinge inspired by his German
Hofmeisters.  
Stanley Wolpert: A fake historian, who has peddled his unoriginal works
as the one-eyed man rules in the country of blind men. A pro-Paki and a
South Asianist.  
Dom Wujastyk: The manager of the Indology list, which descended to being
a venue for anti-Hindu tirades rather than indological discussion.  
Stefan Zimmer: German racist.  
Claus Zoller: Famed for his discovery of the Kentum Substratrum in
Bangani. Could be a spy.

Why are so many Indologists making the famed Malhotran U-turns. I
believe that one major reason is that there is a concerted attempt by
the Western powers to undermine India through subversion of historical
memory. So they are all funded by various such bodies to do the job. I
fear Malhotra of U-turn theory fame may himself have been subverted.
