The Mahabharata Textual Criticism is unquestionably making progress ;
slow but steady progress. There are many things in it still that are
obscure, but some things have undoubtedly been cleared up. Thus there
seems to be consensus of opinion among scholars now on the following points.

1 R. seems to have stomehow a lurking partiality for the consensus of B and
S (or even B and G). If he only knew, the agreements between K and S are likely
to prove mudi sounder than those between B and S ; for, while there are indica-
tions that there may be sporadic contamination between B and G (and perhaps
evOT between B and S), the (genuine) Kaiimiri version (;§) and S as a whole have
certainly the appearance of being almost wholly independent of each other through-
out the Adiparvan.

EPIC STUDIES


m


The Mahabharata textual tradition, as we know it, is far from being
quite uniform. There are now two main streams of tradition, the Northern
Recension and the Southern Recension. Each recension is further sub-divided
into a number of provincial versions, which differ inter se in many parti-
culars. But the text of the Mahabharata must have been in a fluid state for
a very long time, almost from the beginning. Clearly therefore a wholly
satisfactory restoration of the text to its pristine form — even the late so-called
satnsahml samhitd /orm — ^would be a task now beyond the powers of criti-
cism. All that we can attempt now is to reconstruct the oldest form of the
text that is possible to reach on the basis of the MS. material available. The
peculiar conditions of the transmission of the epic necessitate an eclectic but
cautious utilization of all MS. classes. The Kasmiri version {textus simpli-
dor) has proved itself so far to be unquestionably the best Northern version ;
and the Malayalam, which in many respects is superior to the Grantha, is
likewise the best Southern version (textus arnatior). The agreement between
the KasmirT version and the Southern recension (or sometimes even merely
the Malayalam version) can be taken as an indication of originality. But
contamination between the different versions was inevitable and must be
admitted. The Telugu MSS. are generally and the Grantha MSS. frequently
contaminated from Northern sources. Even the Malayalam version, which
is on the whole free from Northern influence, may show some contamination,
in unexpected places. {91} In fact, all versions, with the possible exception
of the Ka^mirf, are contaminated in various degrees. It is, therefore, often a
very ticklish question to decide which agreements are original and which
secondary. Notwithstanding these difficulties, experience has now shown, the
case is not as desperate as it might at first appear. For one thing, there is
a considerable bulk of text where the Northern and Southern versions are in
full agreement, where there are no variants at all, or — ^more frequently — only
unimportant variants : this part of the text is fortunately certain. There is
then the question of the “additional*' passages, that is, passages found in
only one of the rival recensions. There is only one rational way of dealing
with these “ additional “ passages : they must be carefully segr^ted from
the rest of the text, and examined individually. The onus of proving the ori-
ginality of these “ additional “ passages will naturally rest on him who
allies the ori^nality : the documents speak naturally against them, but their
evidence is not by any means conclusive.

These are some of the principal findings of the Prol^omena. It is assur-
ing to find tfet these conclusions have been restated and endorsed emphati-
cally by so cautious and judicious a critic as Prof. M. Winternitz in his
recent review of the Adiparvan volume, in the pages of these Anmls (Vol. 15,
pp. 159-175). The outlines of the reconstruction may, therefore, be taken
to be correct, and the method of reconstruction sound. There is bound to be
difference of opinion as regards details, When there are hundreds of thou?>-

cmds of readings to be considered and weighed, it is natural that all the selec-
tions would not satisfy all readers ; and there are bound to be small slips in
so enormous and difficult a work as this. But the reader has the advantage
of having the full critical apparatus before him, prepared with all possible
care and presented in a convenient manner. The reader may easily substi-
tute in the text any reading that appeals to him better. Prof. Winternitz
has thus shown hisi preferences, in the article mentioned above, in a certain
number of cases, where he differs from me as regards the choice of readings.
They are passages, as he tells us, which he came across in reading parts of
the Critical Edition with his pupils in the Indologisches Seminar at Prag.
Me has thus published these criticisms after much thought and discussion
with {92} other scholars. I gladly take this opportunity, therefore, to present
my view of the case, setting forth the reasons which have guided me in the
choice of the readings adopted by me in the Critical Text.

1. 3. 60 ; gird vd sarhsdmi.

I have indeed assumed that agreement between K (strictly speaking,
between the original Kasmiri version, or at least the isarada MS. SJ and S
is a sufficier.t though not a neecssary proof of originality. But there is no
agreement here between K and S. Kq, it is true, represents the version K in
a comparatively pure form (Prolegomena, -p. L.); but K© is not K ; and Kj
is, on the whole, decidedly a better representative of the Kasmiri version
than Ko (Prolegomena, p. xlix). Now here Kq and have different
readings ; Ko agrees with S, and Ki with the rest of N ! This fact has been
ignored by Winternitz. As for the agreement of Ni and S, I have pointed
out in the Prolegomena (p. lix), that '‘even the manuscripts of distant
Nepal are not wholly free from contamination from some Southern source or
sources (direct or indirect).’’ Thus the agreement between and S cannot
be considered as compelling evidence, by any means. Moreover, it should
be borne in mind that this agreement between Kq and S concerns merely
the omission of one syllable ; and it is clear that this trifling omission could
quite easily take place utterly independently in the respective group)s. There-
fore, even the documental probability in favour of the reading preferred by
Winternitz is not at all strong. It is, in fact, considerably weakened by
the following (intrinsic) consideration. N has vd and a dodeka (hypermc-
tric) line ; S omits vd and has the eleven-syllable (normal) line. This is a
circumstance suspicious in itself. It is by no means certain or necessary that
all the padas of our Tri^tubhs should be of the eleven-syllable pattern. Some
of these hypermetric padas can indeed be made normal by the omission of
one or nK»*e of the additional syllabks, often n^rely of an expletive. But
there are many lines which defy such athetiratiem ; for instance, the second
pada of the very next stanza (1. 3. 61 ; ndsatyadasrm sunasau vknjaymttau) ,
Such lines ought to {93} warn us against giving hasty preference to these nor-
malizing readings. I have cited elsewhere (Prolegomena, p. xciii) clear



EPIC STUDIES


248

instances of efforts made by redactors to correct hypermetric padas of Slokas.
Similar efforts are to be found among the variants of our Tristubhs. But as
the scheme of the Tristubh is more variable and arbitrary, or at least more
complicated and obscure, it is difficult to prove the alterations made by the
different scribes or editors. In this particular instance, however, it seems to
me, there is no reason to assume that the original pada was not hypermetric,
because our pada is a standard hypermeter — a type of which Hopkins has
cited numerous instances. Cf. No. 6 of the typical, oft-recurring varieties
(mentioned by Hopkins in The Great Epic, p. 275) :


The scansion of our line is :

N-- vj ,

which, it will be seen, is a pada of the identical pattern.

From the examples given by Hopkins, I will cite here only the follow-
ing :

3. 13. 193 mamaiva (tau) vdmyau parigrahya rdjan
5. 42. 9 tatrdnu (te) ydnU na taranti mftyum
5. 48. 77 vegena {iva) sailam abhihatya Jambhalj,

13. 94. Vi na (hy) tUsake dra^lum iha jivalokam
        Hari, 2, 72. 44 vi-iOnjano jam Vtha) vidvm samagrak

Are we to omit the bracketed syllables — or some similar syllable — in
each case, on the ground that they disturb the metre, if not the sense ? We
do not possess yet the collations of all these passages, but I am confident
that there will always be some MSS. if not versions (or even a whole recen-
sion), which omit these extra syllables, for one reason or other. There is
this other consideration. The ancients had as good an ear for the rhythm
of their Tri§tubhs as we have, if not better. Why and how was the offend-
ing syllable first inserted, and then tolerated by generations of editors? All
N MSS. except contain the hypermeter. Is it not, under these circums-
tances, more probable that the original was a hypermetric line, which was
emended by some redactors in conformity with the later ideas of the regular
Upajati metres? {94} This particular hypermeter is moreover antique, for
we find (as Hopkins has pointed out) already an example of it in Maud*
Up. 3. 1. 6 :

yatra {tat) satyasya paramam nidhdnam,

with the scansion - — , which differs from our

line as regards the quantity of the first two syllables only ; ours has an
iambic opening, the Mupdaka line trochaic. Here, also, we can with im-
punity omit the bracketed syll 2 d)le (tot), and get a line which is metricaily
a “ better line, but obviously not the original one. I am, therefore, fully
persuaded that in all such cases we have original hypermeters. These old



£PlC STUDIES IV


249


stanzas were not built at all on the pattern of the later, more regular, classi-
cal metres, but followed some other finer rhythmic principle, which escapes
our methods of rough analysis by syllable-counting. — Now as regards the
sense. The exact explanation of the phrase gird vd samsdmi is, I admit, difficult.
Nilakaptba offers the facile explanation : vdMhdas cdrthe (i.e. vd = ca),
which can hardly be considered satisfactory. Devabodha analyses the phrase
into gkdV’\-d=sdmsdmi (with girau, loc. of gm), but that hangs together
with his interpretation of the Asvins as the Sun and the Moon, which is not
very convincing. It is possible to interpret the words as ‘ gird vd ’ samsdmi
(i.e. vai-\r dsamsdmi) , as is done by some editors. On the other hand, it is
also possible to emend vd to vmi (“ ye two, ” acc. dual), which would give
a satisfactory sense. This reading, which is mentioned as a patha by Arju-
namisra, is found in only one of our inferior MSS. (Dg). It seemed to me
such an obvious emendation that I did not like to adopt it on such slender
MS. evidence, and I have hesitatingly (as shown by the wavy line) set in
the text the old Northern reading vd, which isi unquestionably a lectio diffi-
cilior. The whole hymn is, however, obscure and full of interpretative and
other difficulties. It will have to be studied and dealt with more minutely
before we can be sure of its text and meaning. But I am fully persuaded
that vd (or some such word) did form part of the original line, and it would
be a mistake to omit it.

1. 3. 145 Kuruksetre nivasatdm.

Why WiNTERNiTZ should have any doubts about nivasatdm, I fail to
understand. It is merely an augmentless imperfect, and {95} augumentless
imperfects are most common in the Mbh., especially in the case of verbs with
prepositions, as in this case. Even Whitney {Sanskrit Grammar, §587d)
remarks : “ Besides the augmentless aorist-forms with md prohibitive, there
are also found occasionally in the later language augmentless imperfect-
forms (very rarely aorist-forms), which have the same value as if they were
augumented, and are for the most part examples of metrical license. They
are especially frequent in the epics^ (whence some scores of them are quot-
able).” To this, in 1884 (that is now more than fifty years ago), Holtz-
MANN added the note :

” Beispiele von fehlendem Augmente des Imperfects sind ziemlich hau-
fig, besonders in Q>mpositum und hier wieder in solchen, die mit auf a aus-
lautenden Prapositiooen, ava, upa, apa, zusammengesetzt sind : aber nicht

ihm, utthdpaym, uccdr^iyan; paripdlayan, nivartayetdm , nirjayat ; sdni-

jdhyata 1. 58. 8, avabudhyata 120.11, ewati^fhat 189.11, avamamsthdb
(no. V. 1. !) 189. 21, samahhidravat 218. 28. There are many others, less
certain. A number of instances will be found in the Tentative Edition of
the Virataparvan by Mr. Utgikar ; the Critical Edition of this parvan, I
may add, will again contain quite a few instances of this particular solecism.
How many examples are really needed before it is admitted that augument-
less imperfect forms occur regularly in the Mbh., and we cease to talk of
“correct” and “incorrect” forms? The augmentless forms are quite
as “ correct ” as the other as far as the Mbh. is concerned.
WiNTERNiTZ points out that the “correct” form “is given by the Kasmi-
rian transcript by the Maithili and Bengali MSS., by Arjunamisra, and
by some Southern MSS., ” and therefore he prefers it. It is a wonder that
£96} it is not given by more MSS. ; because the tendency is always to change
an “ incorrect ” form into the “ correct ” one. We have here to lode not to the
MSS. which have the ” correct ” form, but to those which have not the “ cor-
rect ” form ! Let us look at it in another way. If nivasatdm be the original
reading, then there are two ways of improving the text : (i) keep vasatdm
of the original and change the .word to nyavasatdm and thus make it “ cor-
rect” (Central sub-recension and Malayalam, independently), or (ii) keep
ni- intact, and change the word to the present nivasatab (“ K” version) ;
both are represented here. If, on the other hand, nyavasatdm were the origi-
nal reading, no one would think of changing it later to nivasatdm ; and
nivasatah of K would also be quite unintelligible. The text reading niva-
satdm thus explains, to a certain extent, how the other readings may have
arisen and has therefore been preferred. And I think there cannot be much
doubt about its correctness and originality.

1 . 3. 183 prabruhi vd kim kriyatdm dvijendra.

If WiNTERNiTZ prefers me kvm, he must, at the satne time, also prefer
karardyam adya | yendsi kdryeii^i etc., found in N (except K D2.5) ; but
he did not realize it.’ The me kim of the Vulgate cannot be joined to kriya-
tarn dvijendra of K B4 D2.5 S. There is no MS. which reads prabruhi me
kim kriyatdm dvijendra | susrusur asmy adya vacas tvadiyam. The reading
of the line proposed by Winternitz will be like an animal with the head
of a horse and tail of a donkey ! The text reading of the entire line — nay, of
the entire stanza — occurs verbatim in Kj. 3. 4 I think, the original NoKrthem
reading was probably prabruhi vd kim, as in text. If vd be useless after pra^
bruhiy it is more than useless after kim, where Winternitz would have it.
It is conceivable that the (original) Northern reading (preserved in Kj. 3. 4.
is corrupt, and we ought to give here preference to S. That is another mat-
ter. Not being convinced that vd kim of 3. 4 was “ secondary ” or cor-



EPIC STUDIES IV


251


rupt from hint vd of S, I have adopted, in the text, vd kirn underlining it to
show that it is less than certain. But mdm kirn, mdm yat, me kim, me tv am,
vokyam of the Northern MSS. are clearly all secondary, and need not be
considered at all.

{97} 1. 55. 3 stptum pdtram ca rdjams tvmn.

I have taken the Sarada MS. only as the norm for my edition ; I have
not undertaken to reproduce its text verbatim. The srotfpdtrarh ca rdjams
tvdm of §1 K is opposed by all other MSS. And, moreover, as there is agree-
ment between B D and S — more or less independent versions — on the reading
srotum pdtram ca rdjams tvam, this reading is indicated as the original, and
has been adopted, without wavy line ; a procedure quite in accord with the
principles of text reconstruction laid down in the Prolegomena (p. XCI).
WiNTERNiTZ finds srotrpdtram ca rdjams tvdm of K “better Sanskrit,” but
I must frankly confess that I could not make head or tail of it, and I can-
not understand it even now. The text reading is the same as the reading of
the Vulgate and of the Southern recension, and is besides quite clear, and,
as far as I can judge, flawless Sanskrit. It may be translated : “ And thou
art, O King; a fit person to hear (Vyasa's Bharati Katha),” a sense which
suits the context admirably. Furthermore, K has here an entirely different
reading for the whole stanza. If we adopt the reading preferred by Winter-
NITZ, then we must read the stanza as :

srotrpdtram ca rdjmhs tvdm prdpyeyarh Bhdratl subhd ]
guror vaktraparispandani mudd protsdhativa nwm\\,

which is apreciably different from the text. But the variants of the other ver-
sions do not at all suggest that this is the original reading. Our text: repre-
sents the reading of the Southern recension, which has here, in my opinion,
the greatest probability.

1. 56, 8 : katham vyatikramm dyute.

It is natural that W. should demand wavy lines for this verse. I admit
the line is most puzzling, and I only lighted upon the solution of the puzzle
by accident, after prolonged wrestling with it. An explanatory note was really
called foi-, because the first line is absolutely unintelligible unless one knows
the particular meaning of the root vyatikram intended here, which is “to
wrongly submit or surrender oneself to, wrongly take to (a thing or person,
acc.)”. It is a rare meaning, but not unknown. It is given in the dictionaries
of Monier Williams (ed. 1899, s. v. {98} vyatikram), and Macdonell
(s. v. kram). It appears not to be given in PW, but pw has (s. v. krOm) :
“verkehrter Weise sich einer Sache (Acc.) hingeben”. One example of the
use is (B.) 12. 174. 36 :

atha ye buddhim aprdptd vyatikrdntds ca mudhatdm
te 'tivelam prakr^ymti samtdpam upaydnH ca | \



252


EPBC STUDIES


Here vyatikrMM ca muihatam must mean those who have surrender-
ed themselves (wrongly) to folly” ; no other meaning will fit, as far as I
ctin judge. Our stanza is, therefore, to be traslated thus :

How (indeed) did the two sons of 'Prtha, as well as the two som of
Madri, (tamely) surrender themselves to the tiger among men (Yudhi§-
thira), who was being cheated at dice by those wicked men, and (how did
they) follow him?”

This strange submission consists in their consenting, in the first instance,
to be used as pledges or stakes in that dire game of dice, and acquiescing
dumbly to everything that Yudhi^thira did. The Southern recension is un-
animous on the point that the doubtful word was some form of vyMikmm ;
and the eight readings recorded in our crit. app. show that it must have been
some word which was as unintelligible to the scribes and editors as it is to
WiNTERNiTZ. WiNTERNiTz is again mistaken in thinking that the S reading
is vyatikmmadyute. This is the reading not of S but of only two MSS.
(Gs.e) out of the thirteen Southern MSS. of our crit. app. I myself have
followed S in reading vyatikramm dyiite, which is the reading of five of the
Southern MSS. In fact, my text represents the reading of the majority of
the Southern MSS., and is, therefore in a sense, the true S reading. It is
needless to add that vimrjitcm of ‘‘ K ” and vyasaninam of the Central sub-
recension, are emendations, made by those who could not make head or tail
of the original. For it is clear that no one would change vinirjitam or vya-
sofdnam to any of the Southern readings, while the reverse would be the most
natural thing in the* world. It is further worthy of note that while the
Northern MSS. have the easier reading, there is no agreement between the
Kasimri and the Central sub-recension. They must therefore represent in-
dependent alterations of a third original. — Following certain other S MSS.
P. P. S. Sastri has adopted the reading {99} vyatikramam dyute (without
recording any v. 1.) ; but I am inclined to think that this is a wrong analysis
of ""krammdyute whidi in S MSS. stands for both ^krammh dyute and
°kramm dyute— Now that I have explained how the awkward word is to
be interpreted, I have no doubt that Winternitz will agree with me that the
text reading is correct

1. 57. 20 : kriyate *U€€hrayo njpaih.

There has been extraordinary reluctance among scholars to face the fact
that the Mbh. text once contained far more examples of hiatus than what one
deems right or readable for such an ancient and venerable text. But there
is hardly any excuse now for such hesitation. On p. xciii of the Prolegomena,
I have given numerous instances of the surreptitious efforts of scribes and
redactors to eliminate hiatus, which show that hiatus was an anathema to
them. It is wdl known that the Sandhi is not rigidly observed in the Vedic
Sajhhitas, the Brahmaoas, and the Upani^ads, in Pali, and in Prakrit works.



EPIC STUDIES IV


253


Why must the Sandhi then be rigidly observed in the popular epic, a work
which has its roots firmly embedded in the soil of the heroic poetry of the
Sutas, and which has throughout preserved vestiges of its humble origin ? The
only reference (so far as I know), in the poem itself, to the Mbh. being a
Kavya {krtam mamedam bhagavan kdvyam paramapujitam) has now dis-
appeared with the Brahma-Ganesa inteipolation in the Adi, and we are thus
left only with a Purana, Itihasa or Akhyi^a. A specimen of this class of
work may surely contain sporadic instances of hiatus, without our being
scandalized. It is futile, I may add, to try to apply to this category of popu~
Utr literature the rules of the dialect of the high-brow iSistas. We may expect
every conceivable solecism in the language of the Mbh., and we find, in fact,
an amazing variety of them ; the hiatus, which was extremely common, is
only one of such so-called irregularities. But for this strange modem anti-
pathy towards hiatus, Winternitz would have recognized that the emenda-
tion is quite legitimate and certain. Winternitz considers the North-
ern readings but wholly ignores the Southern, which is fatal to his
argument. S does not contain either ati (or abhi) which is found only in
certain N MSS., and is besides superfluous. {100} TG have recast the line ;
kuTvanty etc dhvafocchrayam, with kurvmti (note the active voice!), that
is, a form of the root kr (like kriyate of N) at the head of the pada. All
these versions have the verb, it may be noted, in the beginning of the pada.
M contains the same three words as our kriyate, ucchr^yali and njpm}}, but
transposes kriyate and ucchrayalt, reading ucchrayah kriyate nrpaih. This is
the key-.reading, which gives a clue to the original. You can explain every-
thing else, but you cannot explain the transposition in M {which fiormdly
ought agree with TG), unless you start from the hypothetical kriyate
*ucchrayo njpaih. If you argue, on the other hand, that the reading of M
is an arbitrary variant, which is in no need of a special explanation by means
of an emendation, then there is no need of a critical edition either ; because
all MSS. contain approximately the same text and the same story, and the
few differences could be regarded as arbitrary variations which needed no
explanation. With this reading, containing the opprobious hiatus, you can
explain all the variations. N inserts a futile and innocuous abhi (corrupted
in some MSS. to ati) to destroy the hiatus. M transposes the ucckrayo^ which
is the chief cause of the trouble ; TG recast the original, and substitute a
reading which fits badly in the context, with ah active kmvanti (having no
proper subject), after kriyaie in stanza 19. That is how I r^atd this little
complex of readings, and hence the emendation, of whose correctness I myself
have no doubt whatsoever.

1. 57. 21 : hdsyarupef^a samhmah*

This reading is undoubtedly, as Winternitz rightly observes, the lectio
difficitior, but there is not the slightest doubt about its being the original
reading, judging by documentary evidence, and therefore, there is absolutely
17A

EPIC STUDIES


no nedd of underlining it. It is, in the first instance, the reading of the whole
oj M, which WiNTERNiTZ appears not to have realized. I have stated, as my
opinion, that the Malaytalam version is the best representative of the Southern
recension (Prolegomena, p. lxxiii). I am glad to note that Winternitz
{Annals, Vol. 15, p. 170) agrees with me, and that even my learned friend
Vidyasagara Prof. P. P. S. Sastri now endorses it. In the introduction
(p. iii) to Vol. IV of his edition £ 101 } of the Southern Recension, Sastri
writes : “ Not having been subject to Nayak influence in any manner what^
soever, the tradition handed down By the Malayialam Manuscripts preserved
the Grantha text, in a purer and more unmixed form than even some com-
paratively early Grantha manuscripts, as the Malayalam MSS. do not at
all seem to have come into contact with the Northern Recension till ‘very
recent timesj'^ Now this reading of the Malayalam version is supported by
the reading of the Kasmiri version ; for though is missing, yet (India
Office 2137) has the corrupt hdmyahdmya'' (for hamsa° of the rest of N),
and it is well known that in Niagari copies of ;Saradia MSS., s is frequently
transcribed wrongly as m ; so that we have to read hdsyahdsya (dittography).
The reading is further home out by Devabodha s gloss (the MS. reads hdsa^
for our hdsya^) : hdsariipena kridavatararuperia (cf. p. 9910 of the Crit
Ed. for the gloss) , where hamsa, in any case, would not fit, for it is not clear
how hamsarupa would be krlidvcddrarupa. Further, samkarah is the read-
ing of all MSS. except B 5 Dn, which have Isvarah (an obvious emendation)
and TG which has vdsavaJi (which must likewise be an emendation), origi-
nally, perhaps, only a gloss. Here practically the whole of N is supported
by M. samkarah is here not a name of Indra, but only an epithet, an attri-
bute meaning ‘auspicious, beneficent'. Thus in (B.) 3. 229. 6 samkara is
used with reference to Skanda : lokdndm samkaro bhava. In (B) 3. 201. 29
the epithet mahesvara (“great lord'’) is applied to Vi§nu tvayi .nit-
yam mahesvara. Further in 1 . 58. 43, the epithet isa (“lord”) and
sambhu (“auspicious”) are applied to god Brahma : prabhavah sarvabhu-
tdndm tsah sathbhuh prajdpatih. This shows that the words samkara, sambhu,
Isa, mdhesvara, and so on, which are now generally regarded as proper names
of Mahadeva, were still not specialized, but were applied to other gods as
well, as mere epithets, descriptive of their beneficence or omnipotence.

1 . 57. 58 : dvayor drsyator ebhih.

Here it is not difficult to see on what authority the adopted reading
rests. Tlie footnotes give here the reading of N V^ B D £ 102 } (except D 5 )
of the Northern, and of G of the Southern recension. The adopted reading
(whidi is partly supported by the drsyayor of B 3 ) is, therefore, the reading
of the remaining MSS. K D 5 T M (since 6 , is missing, as mentioned on

p. XXIV of the Prolegomena). The Vulgate lacks here the support of the
Grantha version, which has an enitrely different reading :

The Grantha version dispenses altogether with the troublesome drsyatoh
of the original (or the unsuitable v. 1. drUayoh of the Vulgate), thus reveal-
ing its secondary character. The line was recast in the archetype “ Sigma
(see the pedigree in the Prolegomena, p. xxx). The textual relations here
are ideal, being clear as crystal. Winternitz is right in regarding it as pass,
part, praes. with active ending. Passive forms with active endings are quite

1. 92. 2 : Gahgd srir iva rilpim.

The configuration of the MSS. as well as the intrinsic merit of the read-
ings are different in the two lines. That is how iSj appear to be of greater
authority in the first line than in the second. The salildt of the text is found
in all MSS. except (S only transposing the word : Text salildt tasmdt,

S Gangd salildt), and is, therefore, for one thing, obviously far better docu-
mented than sayandt of Ki only. In the second line, therefore, we have,
practically, only two readings : sayandt of Si Ki, against salildt of the rest ;
therefore the reading of has been rightly re-[103}-jected. Such is not

the case in the first line. Here we have three nearly independent readings
(§1 Ki Gahgd mr iva rupini : Vulgate G. strlrupadhdrim : S lobhamyata-
mdkrtih, which latter is mr jourth pdda). Here, while the two Northern
readings are somewhat allied to each other, the Southern reading is entirely
different, having very little connection with the Northern. None of the
readings can be mechanically derived from the other, and intrinsically they
are all more or less of the same value. Such being the case, the Northern
tradition was, as usual, followed. Winternitz does not say why he thinks
strirupadhdrm is better than the other. The reason why I chose stir iva
rupini {** beautiful like Lak§mi '') is that it is nearer in sense to lobhamyata-
mdkjtih (‘'with a most enticing form'*) of S, than stfirupadhdrmi (“assum-
ing the form of a woman”) of the Vulgate. I have here explained in detail
the exact reasons which have weighed with me in making the difficult choice,
but as a matter of fact, they are all three epic iterata and these iterata

keep alternating with each other indiscriminately. In such cases, it is im-
possible to decide, with certainty, which is original and which is secondary,
and the matter is also of no great consequence. The uncertainty of the
text tradition has been duly indicated by a wavy line.

1 . 92. 7 : rdjan kmydm varastnyam.

I am glad Winternitz has drawn my attention to a wrong reading
which has crept in here, through oversight, and I gladly take this opportun-
ity to publish a correction. The reading I had intended to adopt, or at
least I should have adopted, is precisely the one advocated by Winternitz :
rdjm kamydfh vara°, that of the Kasmiri version (iSi Ko-2.4). The fact is
that just for first two words of the last pada of this stanza, there is a con-
fusing array of readings in Northern MSS., all meaning, more or less, the
same thing : rdjan kdmyam Ko-2.4), divydm (K3), divydm kmydm
(Vulgate), kdmydm divydm (B), divydm kdmydm Under these

circumstances, clearly, the Kasmin reading should have been adopted, ac-
cording to the principles enunciated in the Prolegomena, but through a
clerical error kmydm (of the Vulgate) £104} has crept in, in place of
kdmydm (of the Kasmiri), which was intended. — I do not agree with
Winternitz however when he says that the epithet kmyd is “not very
appropriate for Gah^ It would be quite appropriate, as far as I can see.
It would imply that she was an unmarried virgin, which is the regular
meaning of kmyd ; compare :

1. 57. 63 uvdc /2 matpriyam krtvd kmyaiva tvam bhavisyasi

1. 104. 12 prdddc ca tasydh kmydtvam punch sa paramadyutih

(B) 3. 307. 16 sd mayd sake samgamya punch kmyd bhavisyasi

It would then answer Pratipa’s objection (1. 92. 6) :

ndham parastriycm kdmdt gaccheyam varavarnini.

But kanydm is not supported by the MS. evidence, and kdmydm is :
that is the main point. The constituted text should therefore be corrected
accordingly by changing kmydm to kdmydm.

1 . 92. 45 : na ca torn kimccmvdcc.

Here I do not agree with Winternitz. I am fully persuaded that the
text is quite in order. The first mistake Winternitz makes is in thinking
that sa is the reading of K ; it is actually given in the crit. app. as the
reading of 61 Ko.3.4 D5. Winternitz has overlooked the fact that §1
differs from Kj, which is in itself suspicious ; and K^ is also excluded from
the group. If ca has to be translated by “ but there is no help for it ; for
ca has frequently to be rendered in that way. For the Mbh., I may add,
ca and tu are almost synonymous, tu having entirely lost the specific ad-
versative force. It is quite clear that there must have been a period in the
history of Sanskrit, as it was spoken, in which the two ^all particles ca



EPIC STUDIES IV


257


and tu were confused in the mouths of the common people, and were used
indiscriminately. That is, in fact, the only explanation of the curious particle
cu one conies across in certain A^ka inscriptions, which is evidently a com-
bination of ca and tu. The iSarada MS. undoubtedly offers a “better"’
reading, but, as a comparison of the different versions shows, it is a clear
innovation or emendation. That the original had something like na ca (of
the text) is proved by TG, which has nu tUy only in a slightly different
combination : {105} ma^ia kimcin na tu tdm. M differs from TG, and
has a third combination, with a new word vacanam, not found in the other
versions : novae a vacanam kimeit, which has neither na ca nor na tUy and
which does not help to solve our difficulty. The sa of some of the Kasmiri
MSS. is not necessary for the context, as the subject mahipatih (“ the king ”)
occurs in the same line.

1. 92. 50 : a^teme Vasavo dev ah.

Practically all the MSS. except those of the D version begin with a^tau,
which makes it probable (if it does not directly prove) that the original
must have begun with astau ; therefore imesiau (one of the readings pre-
ferred by WiNTERNiTZ) must be ruled out, as an emendation, probably of
a lectio difficilior. The (final) me of and the initial ime of some

Nagari MSS. suggest that the original was the conjectural * asteme, which
combines the characteristics of these groups, and which is very close to the
a^td of 5^2. It is also suggested, to a certain extent, by the Bengali
fl.s/CM ye. The conjectural astemCy is in fact,, tlie hypothetical form to
which the various readings astau me, asta me, astau ye, astau hi, and imestau
seem to converge. The convergence is not a matter of which a mathematical
proof can be supplied. If Winternitz does not see the convergence, he
may substitute for the text reading any of the five readings found in the
MSS. I did not know which to choose ; hence the emendation. The change
is not quite unmotivated. The motive appears to have been the seemingly
irregular Sandhi (double crasis) : astau 4 - ime = a^td + ime = asteme.
But as a matter of fact, there need not have been any irregularity at all in
the Sandhi, for asfeme may simply be resolved into (^(d-\-ime, or asta+ime,
since besides the heavier a^tmi, both the forms and asta were in use,
of which the latter (a^(a) particularly was used, I think, in all periods of
the language (cf. Whitney, Sanskrit Grammar § 483). The translation of
Winternitz is not quite accurate ; at least it is not literal. The stanza
has no word for “obtained birth,” which Winternitz interpolates into it,
in order to justify the reading me, of me,” which he has further to explain
as “ in my body ”. Translate : “ Those gods, the Eight Vasus, had on

account of Vasi§tha’s curse become men (lit. attained the state of men).”

for the original reading ; it is purely the result of conflation. is, more-
over, not a version ; it is merely a single MS., written in Maithili script,
and as such, capable of showing any reading at random. Again, the agree-
ment of with Dn and S against B Da is most unnatural and thoroughly
suspicious. In other words, the MS. evidence here is extremely confused.
Ordinarily I would have adopted the K reading tnmiusaivam updgatah,
which has occurred already in the previous adhy. (1. 92. 50), and occurs
again in (B) 3. 83. 66 ; but owing to the mdnu^m of B, which recurs in
S, I have given here prefer^ce to the reading of the Bengali version. I
may point out that it is the reading of the entire Bengali version, and not
of a few unimportant MSS., as Winternitz imagines. The readings are
these :

K manusatvdm updgatah
B mdnusm tanum dgatdh
S mdnusim yonim dgatdh,

This being the constellation of the readings, mdnusim and dgatdh are
as good as certain, as suggested by the agreement between B and S. There-
fore the real variant is only tanum : yonim. It is likely that the original
was yonim which was corrupted, in N, to tanum, and then the original pada
mdnusim tanum dgatdh (preserved in Bengali only) was replaced by the
recurrent tag mdnusatvam updgatdh ; but it is most unlikely that the latter
was the original which was changed in B to mdnusim tanum d°, and in S
to mdnusim yonim <5°. In any case, the Kasmiri reading must be rejected
here as secondary (cf. Prolegomena, p. lxii), as shown by the evidence of
B and S. Dn Di appear to have got their yonim from S (ibid. p. lxvii), and
f? Vi possibly from Dn.

1. 93. 11 : devadevarsisevitam.

Winternitz is mistaken in thinking that the hermitage in question was
frequented by Ifeis only, and not by gods as well. In fact, the talk is not
about a hermitage at all, but about the £107} forest {vanam) containing
the hermitage. Moreover, it was not an ordinary hermitage, but the hermit-
age of Vasi^tha, situated on the slopes of the celestial mount Meru (1. 93.
15 f.) :

Vasi^tho ndma iti sa khydta dpava ity uta || 15
tasydstamapadam punyam mrgapdksigandmitam |

Meroh pdrsve nagendrasya sarvartukusumdvrtam ] [ 16

The forest, therefore, in which Vasi^tha’s hermitage was situated, was
inhabited and frequented by divine r§is (like Vasi§tha) and by gods (like
the Vasus). That is how, in fact, the Vasus found themselves in that her-
mitage on that fateful day. If the forest were not frequented by gods, the
Vasus would not have cotne there at all. If we adopt the reading devd
devar^isevitam (which is plausible) then the compound must be taken to



EPIC STUDIES IV


259


mean “frequented by gods and jsis” (and not by divine j^is, as Winter-
nitz understands it). According to our text, the forest was frequented by
gods and divine T§is. As will be seen, there is not much to choose 'between
the readings, but I prefer the text, because only the divine |T?is like Vasi§tha
could reach those regions, not ordinary r§is. Moreover, such adjectives
(forming the entire second half of the line) are extremely common in the
descriptions of sacred forests, hermitages, tirthas, with many variants, as
may be seen from the following examples from the Aranyaka' (Bom. Ed.) :

3. 82. 41 devarsipitrsevita

84. 46 siddhagandharvasevita
87. 5 rdjarsigmasevita
89. 7 devagandharvasevita

89. 8 devarsiganasevita

90. 21 brahmarsiganasevita
156. 10 siddhacdrmapujita
     and 145. 41 devadevarsipujita,

which latter has our combination devadevarsi, and in which deva cannot be
separated from devarsi, for the stanza reads :

tatrdpasyata dharmdtmd devadevarsipujitam |
Nara-Ndrdyanasthdnam Bhdgirathyopasobhitam [ 1

The adjective devadevarsisevitam (or ""pujitam) is used with reference
to the most sacred and inaccessible regions like the {lOSj penance groves
cn Meru or Gandhamadana, or on the Himalayan peaks. I do not wish
to suggest that the simple phrase devarsisevitam would not have sufficed
here. I only want to show that tliere is nothing wrong with the text read-
ing, which is proved by the Kasmiri version ('^^ K). From the graphical
point of view, the difference between the readings (devd and deva-) is so
slight that the documentary evidence actually counts here for very little. It
is just owing to this uncertainty that the reading has been underlined in the
critical text.

1. 214. 9 : Dharmmdje * atiprityd.

Here again we notice Winternitz’s prejudice against hiatus; to which
I had drawn attention in tlie discussion on 1. 57. 20, above. But here my
case is stronger still. As far as the Vedic tradition is concerned, e (like o)
remained unchanged before a which was generally elided in the written text,
but, according to the evidence of metre, must almost invariably in the
Bgveda and generally in the Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, be pronounced
whether written or not. According to the statistics prepared by Vedic
scholars, it must be pronounced in the Rgveda in 99 per cent of the cases,
in the Atharvaveda and the metrical portion of the Yajurveda, in about
80 per cent of its occurrences. This shows that in the older stages of the



260


EPIC STUDIES


language, at any. rate, any Sandhi between final e (or o) and initial a was
rare. The rule becomes more and more rigid as we advance, until with
classical authors, ignorance or violation of the rule came to be regarded
as a capital blunder. Now the Mbh., whatever its age be, stands unques-
tionably midway between the Vedic and the classical epoch, and therefore
partakes naturally of the linguistic characteristics of both. In the Vedic
literature, where the scribes or editors did not dare to add even a single
syllable to the received text, the later antipathy towards hiatus shows itself
in the efforts to coalesce, in the written text, the adjoining vowels, accord-
ing to rules of (Sanskrit) grammar, leaving a correct but unmetrical and
unreadable line. The subterfuge is however so obvious that no one hesitates
to dissolve the Sandhi automatically and restore the hiatus. Much reluctance
is felt, on the other hand, by scholars £109} in admitting that the epic text
likewise contained originally many instances of hiatus, though of course
they are not as frequent as in the Veda. The reluctance is due to two
causes. Firstly the Mbh. text looks on the surface so like a classical text
that scholars, who have so far studied the text mainly from printed editions,
insist on applying rules of classical grammar to the text. The second reason
is that the ancient redactors who had not the same compunction about
making small adterations in the epic text (as is evident from our critical
apparatus) as they had in the case of the Vedic texts, have not resorted
to coalescence in order to remove the hiatus, but have boldly added little
expletives like cc, tu, hi for saving their precious rules of grammar, a pro-
cedure which, as it leaves tlie line metrically intact, makes the detection
of their nefarious interference difficult, if not impossible. Now though the
Mbh. looks on the surface like a classical text, there are many peculiarities
of Sandhi and grammar — even in the printed editions and the Vulgate —
which distinguish it from a classical text. Coalescence unknown to classical
usage is seen in amale Hmanam (1. 68. 64), te 'jhaya (1. 70. 41), manyate
'tmdnam (1. 198. 19). We have hiatus in a compound in Ndrdyam-
urogatah (1. 16. 35) ; Pragrhya Sandhi in samupete 'dbhute 'naghe (fern,
du. 1. 14. 5), jajhate 'stravi sdradau (1. 57. 88) etc. Double crasis in pama-
gdbhavan (1. 21. 6), Vasumanabravit (1. 87, 18), jdyateti (1. 11. 13).
Hiatus between padas, caused by the change of as to o (1. 76. 35) : jagdma
svapuram hr^to mujndta mahdtmand. Frequently we come across Prakritic
Absolutives like gjhya (1. 2. 93 ; 9. 19 ; 39. 23, 30 ; 119. 16 ; 123. 12, 16,
50; 124. 20 etc.), tosya (1. 1. 109), cintya (1. 9. 2), u.syn (1. 71. 58),
etc. etc, ; and the converse {tvd for ya) in sam-pujayiivd (1. 54. 15), d-
nayitvd (1. 66. 12), nu^mitvd (1. 85. 18), mu-sktvdnugatvd ca (1. 133.
24), prdpayitvd (1. 189. 25) etc., some of which may however, be explained
as absolutives of verbs with separable prepositions. Such a separable pre-
position we have in 1. 65. 34 :

firati sravanapurvdm naksatrdm sasarja ha j,

where prati is to be construed with sasarja, as pratisasarja : a line often
misunderstood by editors, commentators and translators alike. These vio-
lations of (Sanskrit) grammar are not so rare that one has to hunt for them
with a microscope. There is an endless list of fllO} them. One meets with
them at every step. If these and scores of other irregularities do occur as a
matter of fact, why could there not be hiatus as well ? Scholars are not yet
familiar with this phenomenon, because they have been dealings so far, with
the clarified text, from which most of these irregularities have been carefully
expunged, as is evident from our critical apparatus, by purists who have had
the handling of the epic text during a long succession of centuries. I have
noted that even Bohtlingk, who was otherwise a careful and conscious
editor, has in editing Mbh. passages for his Chresthamathie, rigidly enforced
Sandhi rules, even in prose passaged, with a zeal which was worthy of a better
cause, where there was not the slightest manuscript authority for doing so.
My study of the Mbh. MSS during the last t ten years has convinced me now
that it is the grammatical and material irregularities of the original that are
responsible for quite a large fraction of the mass of variations which we
come across Jn the MSS. The correctness of my reconstructions can be
proved only by adducing the entire evidence, which it is not possible to do
here, but which may be undertaken later on, when a large part of the text
has been dealt with in a like manner. I am fully persuaded that the Critical
Edition, as it advances, will supply material for confirming most of my con-
clusions. — To return to the case under consideration. Winternitz points out
that hi is found in all N MSS., including iSj, but he ignores that Kj shows
here tu, not hi ? Now is a clear transcript of a Sarada MS., and agrees
with our §1 to such an extent that I have expressed it as my opinion that it
is a copy of a ^rada original very similar to our '^radia MS. It is, no
doubt, a very small and insignificant variation, but how would Winternitz
explain it all the same ? hya cannot be misread as tva, even in the Sarada
script. Why should just Ki show here tva ? Is it not, perhaps, because a not
very distant ancestor of our and Ki had still the obnoxious hiatus, as in
our text ? The KaiSmIri version does contain many original features and
archaisms.

1. 215. 2 : ekdm trptim prayacchatdm.
        prayacchatdm of the text, I may point out, is not entirely wrong ; it may
        be construed with bhavcmtau, understood, ai more £111} respectful form of
        address than the second person. In stanza 5, however, the reading sampra-
        yacchata^m has been accepted, because the subject in the second person
        iytwdm) is expressed. We cannot argue that since in 5 we have sampra-
        yacchatiam, therefore in 2 we must have also prayacchatam. Because in
        the Mbh., which is not and never was polished literature, we do come across
        such strange yoke-fellows. Changes of subject and changes of construction
        are frequent. That is the view I had taken when I adopted the text reading.



262


EPIC STUDIES


But on second thoughts I decided that prayacchatcm would nevertheless be
a better reading, and the correction now proposed by Winternitz had been
already published by me, in the “ Addenda et Corrigienda,’' at the end of the
volume (p. 996).

1. 216 . 10

sasarja yat svatapasa Bhauvano bhuvanaprabhuh |
pfajapatir mirdesyam yasya rupam raver iva 1 1
The matter is not simple as Winternitz imagines. Of course, with the
reading yani, any one can see that the relative may be construed with rathmn
in 8. We then get two sentences : '‘Which (scil. chariot of Arjuna) was
fashioned by Bhauvana. .. .by (the power of) his austerities,” and “whose
beauty was like that of the sun.” But the reading yat is actually found in
(except Kq) ViG (except GJ ; i.e. in the Kasmiri version (except Kq),
agreeing with the Grantha version (except GJ, plus the Maithili MS. How
is it that so many MSS. give what Winternitz considers, an “ impossible ”
reading ? The reading is, in fact, not impossible at all ; only the construc-
tion is a little involved and difficult to understand. By reading yat we
actually get better sense. Construe : yasya, raver iva, yat anirdesyam rupam,
{tat) Bhauvamh. .svatapasa sasarja, “whose indefinable (or incompar-
able) loveliness (or splendour), like that of the Sun, Bhauvana had fashioned
by (the power of) his austerities.” This construction avoids the two dis-
jointed and halting sentences yam anirdesyarn Bhauvanaf ^. . . .svatapasa sa-
sarja, and yasya rupam raver iva (or yam Bhauvmah. . . .svatapasa sasarja,
and yasya anirdesyam rupam raver iva), which result from the wrong read-
ing ymn for {112} yat, yat is almost a perfect example of the lectio diffi-
cilior, and a regular trap for unwary editors.

1 . 218 . 14 : jaladhdrdmuQo 'kuldn.

Winternitz is here again mistaken in thinking that ""mucotuldn is the
reading of S. It is the reading of only five of the thirteen Southern MSS.
('Ti Gj. 2 M3.5) ; three others (T3 G3.4) read °mucofUlm, *three more (Mg.g)
read mumocivan, two (G5.3) read as in text {"^mucokulm). The question is,
in fact, what was the original riding of S. That question I have not been
able to answer definitely, and I have, therefore, put in, as a stap-gap, the
reading of Gg.e which seemed to me not improbable, since initial d is curi-
ously enough, sporadically treated in the Mbh. text, like a. The reading
""mmakuldn is useless ; it is obviously a substitute for some reading which
was difficult to understand or explain.

I have underlined muco in the text, but I now think that it is as good
as certain. It is documented not only by the whole of S, but also by Ko.^.a
Sf Yjy^. If muoo be admitted, then samdhUdn of the .Northern group be-
comes secondary, but with an important residue in the shape of the final
kuldn, agreeing with the final of °mucokuldn of Gg rhyming with

The documentary evidence, therefore, points unmistakably to a reading jala-
dhardmuco{x)ldn. Query, what is the value ot x? The adjective dkuldn (“ con-
fused”) qualifying meghdn would be not inappropriate, referring to the con-
dition of masses of clouds confusedly hurled about by a! cyclonic wind ; not
so appropriate, to my mind, the atuldn (“incomparable”) preferred by
WiNTERNiTZ, and adopted by P. P. S. Sastri, against the evidence of his
basic MS. 3?, which has our text reading. In Sastri’s adoption of atuldn
and his ignoring of variants, which must have appeared to him meaningless
corruptions or clerical mistakes, we have an illuminating example of how the
readings get indiscriminately distributed, disturbing the relationships estab-
lished by the stemma codicum, and how the lectio difficilior is gradually effaced.

£113} 1. 218. 27 : vydtisthanta mahaupsali

The text reading vydtisthanta, it must be confessed, has not been adopt-
ed because it is the reading of Sj Ki ; it is a mere slip. I am thankful to
WiNTERNiTZ for drawing my attention to it. The reading vyatisthmta should
be adopted without doubt.

t * *

I may repeat here what I l^ve stated elsewhere that the problem of the
Mahabh^ata Textual Criticism is a problem sui generis. Here the princi-
ples of textual reconstruction, which must be first evolved from a study of the
MS. material and the MS. tradition, can be considered as finally settled only
after considerable discussion and exchange of ideas on the subject. I would,
therefore, repeat my request to Prof. Winternitz, made some years ago, to
continue his searching and exhaustive examination of the fascicules or volumes
as they come out, and give us the benefit of his ripe experience and valuable
opinions and findings. His publications on a subject which has engaged his
attention, off and on, for the la^ forty years cannot but throw some much-
needed light on the obscure question of the Mahabharata Textual Criticism
(which has unfortunately not received much attention so far from scholars),
and thus advance the cause of Matebharata studies.

In conclusion, I must express my grateful thanks to Prof. Winternitz
for the very kind and encouraging remarks he has made regarding the work
in general as also my keen appreciation of the uniformly courteous tone of
his sympathetic and appreciative review.
