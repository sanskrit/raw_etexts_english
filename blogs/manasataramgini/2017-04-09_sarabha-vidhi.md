The account of this rite continues from the [prefatory
narrative](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/04/08/a-prefatory-narrative/).

Lootika: “There are several ways in which Rudra is worshipped as Śarabha
conceived as the great dinosaur. We shall follow the way which is
appropriate for us brāhmaṇa-s who observe the śruti as our supreme
religious authority rather than the āgama-s, even though we accept the
latter as specific authorities. The purely āgamika methods are practiced
by śaiva-s, śivabhakta-s and liṅgin-s.”

then rolled out a canvas and showed Jhilleeka and Prachetas a picture of
Śarabha: “One shall accordingly visualizing Śarabheśāna as having five
dinosaur-like heads each with with 3 eyes and a heavy, sharp beak. He
has 12 arms two of which will be wings. I shall talk of the weapons and
other objects held in the arms later. Enclosed in his two wings are the
goddesses Pratikriyā-śūlinī and Pratyaṅgirā. In his heart we visualize
the fierce Bhairava of the Dakṣiṇasrotas, Svacchanda, associated with
the pada ghora-ghoratrebhyaḥ of the bahurūpin. In his belly we visualize
the seven-flamed Agni Vaḍavānala. In this two dinosaur-like feet we
visualize Jvareśvara and the ferocious lion-headed Haribhadra, even as
they were emitted by Rudra to slay Dakṣa.

One begins by invoking Rudra the lord of animals thus:  
rudraḥ paśūnām adhyakṣaḥ  
sa māvatv asmin brahmaṇy  
asmin karmaṇy asyāṃ purodhāyām  
asyāṃ devahūtyām asyām ākūtyām  
asyām āśiṣi svāhā ॥

Make an offering in the aupāsana fire at the svāhā.

Having visualized Śarabha as stated earlier you shall first perform the
worship the five faces conjoining the Brahma-mantra-s thus:

oṃ hauṃ tatpuruṣāya pakṣirājāya namaḥ । tatpuruṣaya vidmahe…||  
oṃ hauṃ vāmadevāya gauryai gāndhāryai garuḍyai namaḥ । vāmadevāya namo…
||”  
oṃ hauṃ sadyojātāya śālvāya namaḥ । sadyojātaṃ prapadyāmi… ||  
oṃ hauṃ aghorāya ākāśabhairavāya namaḥ । aghorebhyo’tha… ||  
oṃ hauṃ īśānāya Śarabheśānāya namaḥ । īśānaḥ sarva-bhūtānām… ||

Then you shall practice the japa of the mūlamantra:  
vāsudeva ṛṣiḥ । triṣṭubh chandaḥ । kālāgnirudraḥ Śarabheśāno devatā ॥  
khaṃ bījam । khaṃ śaktiḥ । khaṃ kīlakam ॥  
khaṃ Śarabheśānāya khaṃ śālvāya khaṃ pakṣirājāya hum phaṇ namaḥ ॥

Then you pacifies the deity with:  
oṃ Śarabhaṃ tarpayāmi ।  
oṃ śālvaṃ tarpayāmi ।  
oṃ pakṣirājaṃ tarpayāmi ॥

Thereafter one worships the aṅga-devatā with their mantra-s. Lootika
will give you those mantra-s of the śakti-s. Hearing it from her mouth
you stand the chance of instantaneous success.”

Lootika: First one should worship Pratikriyā-śūlinī with the mighty
Vairocanī-ṛk: tām agnivarnāṃ tapasā… closing one’s eyes. If the image of
a Durgā riding a lion holding a trident in her hand appears while
uttering the mantra then it is a sign of success. She has six-arms and
it colored like a flame with a bluish tinge. You pacify her with the
mantra:  
oṃ maheśānīṃ mahāŚarabhaśūlinīṃ tarpayāmi ॥

Then you worship Atharvaṇabhadrakālī-Pratyaṅgirā with the mantra:  
oṃ hrīṃ pratyaṅgire dhāma dhāma jyotir jyotir
bhūr-bhuvas-suvar-mahar-vṛdhat karad ruhan mahat tac cham oṃ lakṣmyai
namo vaḥ ॥ She is fourteen-armed, black-colored, with dense free-flowing
hair, wearing bright osseous ornaments and evoking erotic sentiments.
She is Lakṣmī because she is Siddhilakṣmī. The special vyāhṛti-s of the
mantra are from the Gopatha-brāhmaṇa of the veda of our ancestors the
Bhṛgu-s and the Añgirasa-es. If when uttering the mantra with closed
eyes she appears before you with a hallow like an eclipsed moon around
her head then it is a sign that you might be on the path of success. You
must see her upraised sword. If erotic sentiments arise in you at that
point it is a good sign. But you must not get lost in them. Instead you
should take in a breath with the oṃ hrīṃ and retaining it even as you
slowly utter the rest of the mantra till the vyāhṛti-s you must locate
your mūlādhāra-cakra and perform the jālandhara and mūla-bandha. You
pacify her with the mantra:  
oṃ pratyaṅgirāṃ viśvalakśmīṃ somaguptāṃ mahāŚarabhīṃ tarpayāmī ॥

Now Somakhya would impart to you the remaining male devatā-s.”

Somakhya: “Having worshiped the śakti-s you shall invoke in the heart of
Śarabheśāna the fierce Bhairava with the following mantra:  
aiṃ kṣāṃ kṣīṃ kṣūṃ kṣaḥ kṣmlvryūṃ svacchandabhairavāya sphuratātmane huṃ
phaṇ namaḥ ॥  
He appears as five-headed and ten-armed riding a white bull.

Then you worships the fierce Agni Vaḍavānala with his seven tongues
which correspond to the heptagon of the Śarabha-yantra with this
mantra:  
oṃ raṃ hiraṇyāyai kanakāyai raktāyai kṛṣṇāyai suprabhāyai atiraktāyai
bahurūpāyai namaḥ kṛṇuśva pājaḥ prasitiṃ…||  
The terminal of the mantra is the rakṣohā-ṛk of Vāmadeva Gautama.

Then you worship jvareśa or the jvarāstra of triadic form, which Rudra
hurled at Kṛṣṇa Devakīputra with this mantra:  
oṃ namo bhagavate rudrāya jvararūpāya trikāyarūpāya vo namaḥ ॥

You then worship Haribhadra accompanied by a hundred Rudra-s of
blue-hued necks as has been described in the śruti with the mantra:
“nilagrīvāḥ śitikaṇṭhāḥ…”. He is worshiped by the mantra combining the
utterance from the Skandam and Acintya-viśva-sādākhyam:  
oṃ jaya jaya rudra mahāraudra bhadrāvatāra oṃ śrīṃ hrīṃ mṛgendrāya
haribhadrāya namaḥ । oṃ jūṃ saḥ oṃ ॥  
Now Lootika shall impart to you the worship of the zoocephalous
āvaraṇa-yoginī-s.”

Lootika: “First in the four directions having completed the worship of
Śarabheśāna and his aṅga-s you shall worship the following yoginī-s
thus starting east in pradakṣiṇa order:  
oṃ gajānanāṃ pūjayāmi tarpayāmi namaḥ । elephant-headed.  
oṃ siṃhamukhīṃ pūjayāmi tarpayāmi namaḥ । lion-headed  
oṃ gṛdhrāsyāṃ pūjayāmi tarpayāmi namaḥ । vulture-headed  
oṃ kākatuṇḍīṃ pūjayāmi tarpayāmi namaḥ । crow-headed.

Then you shall worship the mighty maṇḍala-yoginī with the following
mantra:  
namāmi mahāyoginīṃ sarvaśatruvidāraṇīṃ ।  
aṣṭavaktrīṃ koṭarākṣīṃ vakrāṃ vikaṭalocanām ।  
uṣṭragrīvāṃ hayagrīvāṃ vārāhīṃ Śarabhānanām ।  
ulūkīṃ ca śivārāvāṃ mayūrīṃ vikaṭānanām ॥

She bears the following 8 heads: 1) camel, 2) horse, 3) sow, 4)
dinosaur, 5) owl, 6) jackal, 7) peacock, 8) lion. She is the guardian of
the Śarabha-maṇḍala.

Then you pacify her:  
aṣṭavaktrīṃ tarpayāmi pujayāmi namaḥ ।

Now Somakhya would take you through the concluding pacifications.”

Somakhya: “The concluding part of the worship is conducted with the
mantra of the Bhṛgu-s of yore:  
tubhyam āraṇyāḥ paśavo  
mṛtyā vane hitās tubhyaṃ  
vayāṃsi śakunāḥ patatriṇaḥ ।  
tava yakṣaṃ paśupate ‘psv antas  
tubhyaṃ kṣaranti divyā āpo vṛdhe ॥

You tie a rakṣa with the mantra:  
śune kroṣṭre mā śarīrāṇi  
kartam ariklavebhyo gṛddhrebhyo  
ye ca kṛṣṇā aviṣyavaḥ ।  
makṣikās te paśupate vayāṃsi  
te vighase mā vidanta ॥

Then worship his weapons:  
triśulaṃ tarpayāmi ।  
daṇḍaṃ tarpayāmi ।  
pinākaṃ tarpayāmi ।  
pāṣupataṃ tarpayāmi ।  
kuliśaṃ tarpayāmi ।  
cakraṃ tarpayāmi ।  
musalaṃ tarpayāmi ।  
khaḍgaṃ tarpayāmi ।  
khaṭvāṅgaṃ tarpayāmi ।  
paraśuṃ tarpayāmi ॥

i.e. the trident, rod, pināka bow, pāśupata missile, thunderbolt,
discus, pestle, sword, skull-brand and axe.

Then he concludes by reciting the mantra-s:  
tasmai prācāyā diśi antardeśād bhavam iṣvāsam anuṣṭhātāram akurvan ।…ya
evaṃ veda॥

Thus the rite is concluded.”
