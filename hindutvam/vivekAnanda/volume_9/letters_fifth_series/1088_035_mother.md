## XXXV

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

HOTEL BELLEVUE  
BEACON STREET , BOSTON

*19 September 1894*

DEAR MOTHER

The huge packet received. It was a few pamphlets sent over to me from my
monastery in Calcutta. No news at all about the phonograph. I think it
is high time we make them inquire into it.

The two volumes of Todd's \[Tod's\] history of Rajasthan have been
presented to me by Mrs. Potter Palmer. I have asked her to send it over
to your care. The babies will like reading it very much, and after they
finish I will send it over with my Sanskrit books to Calcutta.

I did not ask you to send me the typewritten news clippings at all, but
a little slip I sent over some time ago from the *Indian Mirror*.
Perhaps it did not reach you at all. You need not send the typewritten
thing at all.

I do not require any clothes here; there are plenty of them. I am taking
good care of my cuffs and collars, etc.

I have more clothes than are necessary. Very soon I will have to
disburse myself of half of them at least.

I will write to you before I go to India. I am not flying off without
giving you due intimation.

Yours,  
VIVEKANANDA

P.S. — My love to Babies and Father Pope.
