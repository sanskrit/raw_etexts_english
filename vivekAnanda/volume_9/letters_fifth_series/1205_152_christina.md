## CLII

*To Sister Christine*

C/O DR. E. GUERNSEY,  
180 WEST 59TH STREET,  
NEW YORK,

*12th November 1899*.

CHRISTINA —

Mrs. Bull has gone to Boston without seeing me. I am with the Guernseys.
All today laid up with colds.

Oh, these nasty colds. The doctor here declares my case as entirely one
of nervous exhaustion. Even the dyspepsia is entirely nervous.

I will be a few days yet here, and then I don't know where I go. I have
a great mind to try health food. As for you, write unreservedly where
you \[would\] like me to be. If you think it best for me to come to
Detroit, write or wire on receipt of this. I will come immediately. Only
difficulty is now the dyspepsia.

With love to Mrs. Funkey \[Funke\],

Ever yours with blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA.

P.S. If Cambridge is best, say that immediately.

V.
