## CLXXII

*To Sister Christine*

VEDANTA SOCIETY,  
102 EAST 58TH STREET,  
NEW YORK,

*13th June 1900*.

DEAR CHRISTINA,

There is no cause for any anxiety. As I wrote, I am healthier than ever;
moreover, all the past fear of kidney troubles has passed away. "Worry"
is the only disease I have, and I am conquering it fast.

I will be here a week or two, and then I come to Detroit. If things so
happen that I cannot come, I will sure send for you. Anyway, I am not
going to leave this country before seeing you. Sure, sure — I must see
you first, and then go to Europe.

Things are looking cheerful once more, and good luck, like ill, also
comes in bunches. So I am sure it will be smooth sailing every way now,
for some time at least.

With love to Mrs. Funkey \[Funke\],

Ever yours in the Truth,  
VIVEKANANDA.
