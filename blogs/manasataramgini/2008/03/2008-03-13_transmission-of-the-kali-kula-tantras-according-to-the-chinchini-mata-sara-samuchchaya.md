There was a muni named shIlAchiti in the shivapITha of shrIshaila. His
son was a siddha named vidyAnanda who looked like a shAbara tribesman.
He lived in shmashAna-s and performed nightly vIrasAdhana by meditating
on his chakras. He went to the mountain range to the north of shrIshaila
and there in a gold mine \[\*\] dear to the gods he worshiped, desirous
freedom. A tantric niShkriyAnanda was pleased with him and initiated him
into the kAli krama (CMSS 7). He then transmitted the tradition of kAli
krama in bhAratavarSha.

\* “This cave of gold” might be identified as either one of 3 caverns
recognized today: dattAtreya cave, “Akkamahadevi” cave or umAmaheshvara
cave.
