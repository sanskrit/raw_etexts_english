## LX

U. S. A.,  
*March, 1896*.

DEAR ALASINGA,

. . . Push on with the work. I will do all I can. . . . If it pleases
the Lord, yellow-garbed Sannyâsins will be common here and in England.
Work on, my children.

Mind, so long as you have faith in your Guru, nothing will be able to
obstruct your way. That translation of the three Bhâshyas (commentaries)
will be a great thing in the eyes of the Westerners.

. . . Wait, my child, wait and work on. Patience, patience. . . . I will
burst on the public again in good time. . . .

Yours with love,

VIVEKANANDA.
