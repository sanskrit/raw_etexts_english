*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

1502 JONES STREET,  
SAN FRANCISCO,  
*7th March, 1900*.

DEAR JOE,

I learn from Mrs. Bull's letter that you are in Cambridge.

I also learn from Miss Helen that you did not get the stories sent on to
you. I am sorry. Margot has copies she may give you. I am so so in
health. No money. Hard work. No result. Worse than Los Angeles.

They come in crowds when the lecture is free — when there is payment,
they don't. That's all. I have a relapse — for some days — and am
feeling very bad. I think lecturing every night is the cause. I hope to
do something in Oakland at least to work out my passage to New York,
where I mean to work for my passage to India. I may go to London if I
make money here to pay a few months' lodging there.

Will you send me our General's address? Even the name slips from memory
now!

Good-bye. May see you in Paris, may not. Lord bless you, you have done
for me more than I ever deserve.

With infinite love and gratitude,

Yours,  
VIVEKANANDA.
