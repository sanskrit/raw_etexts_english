The lakṣaṇa of ‘gauḥ’ in Hindu tradition is to be determined by seeing
what our pūrvācāryas have commented on this,and not on pseudoscientific
nonsense like ‘desi cows are associated with gold nanoparticles’, ‘A2/A1
milk’,etc.

“gōḥ sāsnādimattvaṁ lakṣaṇam” has basically been the definition since
the time of Pātañjali
(of[mahābhāṣya](http://www.intratext.com/ixt/san0011/_P2.HTM#10) fame).

Vidyāraṇya similarly quotes Pātañjali thus

> tathā cōktaṁ bhagavatā patañjalinā mahābhāṣyē – atha gaurityatra kaḥ
> śabdō yēnōcyaritēna sāsnāmāṅgūmakakudakhuraviṣāṇānāṁ saṁpratyayō
> bhavati saḥ śabdaḥ

So ,our ‘gauḥ’ is *any* breed of cow that is humped with horns,and with
a dewlap and tail. And not about A1,A2(I don’t think the [rājan
bhadravarman of
champa](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/05/13/shri-bhadreshvara-and-the-kings-of-champavati/)
near Vietnam,who was a śrotiya and boasted of performing vaidika rituals
could have checked for A1/A2 or gold nanoparticles).

I discussed with others (like Hariprasad),who noted that there is no
strong reason to deny respect to cows of foreign breed since they are
all of the same jāti,one can at best to say that there is tārātmy within
breeds of cows and that foreign breeds of cows have less abhimāni devatā
sannidhyam. Also,we have consumed their milk for whatever reasons,so not
slaughtering them and taking care of them till their death should be our
way of showing upakāra smaraṇam.
