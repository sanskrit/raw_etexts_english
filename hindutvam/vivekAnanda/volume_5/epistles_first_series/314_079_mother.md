## LXXIX

ALMORA,  
*28th July, 1897*.

MY DEAR MOTHER, (Mrs. Leggett.)

Many many thanks for your beautiful and kind letter. I wish I were in
London to be able to accept the invitation with the Raja of Khetri. I
had a great many dinners to attend in London last season. But it was
fated not to be, and my health did not permit my going over with the
Raja.

So Alberta is once more at home in America. I owe her a debt of
gratitude for all she did for me in Rome. How is Holli? To both of them
my love, and kiss the new baby for me, my youngest sister.

I have been taking some rest in the Himalayas for nine months. Now I am
going down to the plains to be harnessed once more for work.

To Frankincense and Joe Joe and Mabel my love, and so to you eternally.

Yours ever in the Lord,

VIVEKANANDA.
