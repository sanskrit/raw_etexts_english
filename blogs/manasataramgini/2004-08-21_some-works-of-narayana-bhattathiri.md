MelpattUr nArAyaNa bhaTTathiri, was a great nambuthiri sanskrit writer
who apparently lived for a 106 years (born 1560) after escaping death
due to syphilis earlier in his life. He wrote a remarkable vaishNava
tract, the nArAyaNIyaM, which is a glorious work of sanskrit poetry
despite its extremist stance. prakriyA sarvasva was his famous treatise
on saMskR^it grammar that took the place of the siddhAnta kaumudI of
bhaTToji dIkShita in the midst of the nambuthiris. He also revolted
against the pANinian grammatic tradition by composing the ApANinIya
prAmANya sAdhAna where he built upon his teacher achyuta pishAraDiâ€™s
work of non-pANinian approach to grammar.

He wrote one half of the mImAMsa text mAnameyodaya. Also well known is
his niranunAsika prabandha a work without nasals describing shUrpaNakhA
lament to rAvaNa after lakShmaNa had cut off her nose. He also composed
many works in the champu style.

In the nArAyaNiyaM he shows his link to the great nambuthiri
astronomers, by giving the date of his composition in the katapayadi
system as AyurArogayasaukhyaM.
