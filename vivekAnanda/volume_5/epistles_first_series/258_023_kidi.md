## XXIII

U. S. A.  
*30th November, 1894*.

DEAR KIDI,

. . . As to the wonderful stories published about Shri Ramakrishna, I
advise you to keep clear of them and the fools who write them. They are
true, but the fools will make a mess of the whole thing, I am sure. He
had a whole world of knowledge to teach, why insist upon unnecessary
things as miracles really are! They do not prove anything. Matter does
not prove Spirit. What connection is there between the existence of God,
Soul, or immortality, and the working of miracles? . . . Preach Shri
Ramakrishna. Pass the Cup that has satisfied your thirst. . . . Preach
Bhakti. Do not disturb your head with metaphysical nonsense, and do not
disturb others by your bigotry. . . . 

Yours ever with blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.
