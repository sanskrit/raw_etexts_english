The veda offers us a few clues on the status of the wolf in Vedic
society. Unsurprisingly, pastoralists with large herds of cattle and
reverence for the cow did not take kine-killers like the wolf kindly.

A hymn in the Rigveda to Pūṣan talks about this:

यो नः॑ पूषन्न॒घो वृको॑ दुः॒शेव॑ आ॒दिदे॑शति  
अप॑ स्म॒ तं प॒थो ज॑हि

yoḥ – who, naḥ – us, pūṣan – O Pūṣan, aghaḥ – dangerous, vṛkaḥ – wolf,
duḥśevaḥ – malignant, ādideśati – would threaten (subjunctive), apa –
away, sma – verily/always, taṃ – that wolf, pathaḥ – from the path, jahi
– you kill

“O Pūṣan, The dangerous malignant wolf, who will threaten us, You
\[Pūṣan\] smite him away, as always, from the path”

A few clues exist in Sāyana-s commentary, who calls the wolf as
“asmadīyasya dhanasya ādātā apahartyetyarthaḥ” meaning the wolf is the
ravisher and taker of our wealth (kine, chiefly).
