In a few hours we head into the great unknown. We thought last night
that we had shaken of the “crane-arrow” after a costly expedient. Today
we are not sure if this is so. Whatever the case, over the next three
days we have to be in the wild, as in the old days of field work, and
hope we are not struck by the arrow then.
