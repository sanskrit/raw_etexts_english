title = "A brief note on prahlAda, hiraNyakashipu and an early nArasiMhAkhyAna"

+++
The daitya-s prahrAda/prahlAda and virochana are known in the veda
itself. The killing of prahlAda and his clan by indra in a battle in the
high heavens is alluded to in more than one post-RV vaidika text. This
great battle between indra and prahrAda is also alluded to in the epics
on multiple occasions:  
jigIShator yudhAnyonyam indra-prahlAdayor iva | (mahAbharata 3.270.12cd)

prAhrAda is among the daitya-s killed by indra in the epics consistent
with the vaidika account:  
rathenAnena maghavA jitavA\~n shambaraM yudhi |  
namuchiM vala-vR^itrau cha prahlAda-narakAv api ||  
bahUni cha sahasrANi prayutAny arbudAni cha |  
rathenAnena daityAnAM jitavAn maghavAn yudhi || mahAbharata 3.165.18-19
(“critical”)

Seated on this car indra conquered shambara in battle. Seated on this
chariot maghavAn conquered namuchi, vala, vR^itra, prahlAda and naraka
along with thousands, millions and tens of millions of daitya-s.

In the taittirIya brAhmaNa 1.5.9-10 the daitya prahrAda kAyAdhava is
said to hide his son virochana in a crater (termed a pradara) in the
ground so that the deva-s might not kill him. Hence, the brAhmaNa in its
characteristic style states that one must not drink water from a crater
– implying that it might be poisoned by the presence of the daitya
virochana.

prahrAda was an enemy of the deva-s in all early aitihAsika and
paurANika narratives consistent with the vaidika account. In the
kurma-purANa he is described as fighting viShNu during his attack on
hiraNyakashipu and is defeated by a puruSha emanated by viShNu. Later he
attacks nR^isiMha and flees to save himself after being struck by him.
In the harivaMsha he attacks the deva-s along with his grandson bali and
is eventually subjugated by viShNu. In the shantiparvan the [arrogant
prahlAda is defeated by
kArttikeya](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/08/07/the-fall-of-prahlada/).
Only later the zealous vaiShNava-s in their drive to elevate viShNu over
indra made him a positive figure and an ideal devotee of viShNu. In fact
this is in contrast with the view of the early vaiShNava-s who mention
his defeat along with that of other daitya-s and dAnava-s as an act of
viShNu, evidently alluding to the famous dAnava-conquering strides of
viShNu already known in the veda:

AsurIM shriyam AhR^itya trIMl lokAn sa janArdanaH |  
saputradArAn asurAn pAtAle vinyapAtayat ||  
namuchiH shambarash chaiva prahlAdash cha mahAmanAH |  
pAda-pAtAbhi-nirdhUtAH pAtAle vinipAtitAH || (an old vaiShNAva AkhyAna
found in certain recensions of the bhArata)

He janArdana having seized the wealth of the asura-s and the three
worlds pushed the asura-s along with their sons and wives down to the
netherworld. The mighty namuchi, shambhara and prahlAda were trampled
under foot and pushed down into the netherworld \[by viShNu\].

However, the famous father of prahrAda, hiraNyakashipu, is not mentioned
in the shruti. Nevertheless there are hints that he existed in the
ancient Indo-Aryan tradition:  
1\) The early vaMsha-s invariably mention him as a daitya the father of
prahrAda. E.g. the ancient daitya-sR^iShTi in the mahAbhArata states-

eka eva diteH putro hiraNyakashipuH smR^itaH |  
nAmnA khyAtAs tu tasyeme putrAH pa\~ncha mahAtmanaH ||  
prahrAdaH pUrvajas teShAM saMhrAdas tadanantaram |  
anuhrAdas tR^itIyo .abhUt tasmAch cha shibi-bAShkalau ||  
prahrAdasya trayaH putrAH khyAtAH sarvatra bhArata |  
virochanash cha kumbhash cha nikumbhash cheti vishrutAH ||  
virochanasya putro .abhUd balir ekaH pratApavAn |  
balesh cha prathitaH putro bANo nAma mahAsuraH || mahAbharata 1.59.17-20
(“critical”)

diti bore one son who was known as hiraNyakashipu. The names of his
fives sons are narrated thus: prahrAda was the first, followed by
saMhrAda thereafter; the third was anuhrAda followed by shibhi and
bAShkala. prahrAda’s three sons O bhArata are said to be virochana,
kumbha and nikumbha. virochana’s had one son the valiant bali. bali’s
son was know by the name of bANa, the great demon.

Thus as in the veda the eldest son of prahrAda is described as
virochana. Further the mahAbharata has the AkhyAna of sunda and
upasunda, the sons of nikumbha, who are mentioned as being born in the
clan of hiraNyakashipu (mahAsurasyaanvavAye hiraNyakashipoH purA |).

2\) In the rAmAyaNa there is an allusion the tale of indra capturing the
wife of hiraNyakashipu. The paurAnika narratives (e.g. bhAgavata
4.18.12) indicate that she, kayAdhu (consistent with the vaidika form of
prahrAda’s matronym) was the daughter of the dAnava jambha who was
killed by indra. Other paurANika narratives suggest that indra abducted
kayAdhu to preclude the birth of her dreadful and mighty son prahrAda,
but subsequently released her (in some accounts upon nArada’s
suggestion).

3\) In the bhArata there are multiple mentions of the slaying of
hiraNyakashipu by viShNu-  
The vanaparvan has an account of the killing of the dAnava-s called the
kAlakeya-s with draining of the “ocean” by Canopus (agastya, i.e. Alpha
Carinae; cognate of Iranian Satvas). Into which the early vaiShNava-s
have inserted a stuti of viShNu (the abhaya stuti), which describes his
chief exploits as the lifting of the submerged “earth”; killing of the
first of the daitya-s hiraNyakashipu as nR^isiMha, the trampling of bali
as vAmana, and the felling of the yaj\~na-destroying archer jambha (it
is not clear if viShNu is regarded as having killed him; because this
exploit is largely attributed to indra). It is clear it is an early
stuti because the list stops at jambha and does not have the structure
of the later avatAra lists.  
The vaiShNavAbhaya-stuti goes thus:  
tvaM naH sraShTA cha pAtA cha bhartA cha jagataH prabho |  
tvayA sR^iShTam idaM sarvaM yach che\~NgaM yach cha ne\~Ngati ||  
O lord, you are the emitter, the sustainer, and the destroyer of
ourselves and the rest of the universe. It is you who has emitted this
universe with all that is living and nonliving.

tvayA bhUmiH purA naShTA samudrAt puShkarekShaNa |  
vArAhaM rUpam AsthAya jagad-arthe samuddhR^itA ||  
O lotus-eyed one, it was you who had formerly for the benefit of the
world raised from the sea the lost earth, having assumed the form of a
boar

Adi-daityo mahAvIryo hiraNyakashipus tvayA |  
nArasiMhaM vapuH kR^itvA sUditaH puruShottama ||  
O foremost puruSha, assuming the form of the man-lion, you had slain
hiraNyakashipu of mighty valor, the first of the daitya-s.

avadhyaH sarvabhUtAnAM balish chApi mahAsuraH |  
vAmanaM vapur Ashritya trailokyAd bhraMshitas tvayA ||  
The great asura bali was indeed incapable of being slain by any one.
Taking the form of a dwarf, you banished him from the triple-world.

asurash cha maheShvAso jambha ity abhivishrutaH |  
yaj\~nakShobhakaraH krUras tvayaiva vinipAtitaH ||  
The asura jambha, was renowned as a great archer. This disturber of
rituals was indeed felled by you.

evam AdIni karmANi yeShAM saMkhyA na vidyate  
asmAkaM bhaya-bhItAnAM tvaM gatir madhusUdana || Mbh 3.100.18-23
(“Critical”)  
Former achievements of yours such as these cannot be counted. O slayer
of madhu, you are the refuge for us afflicted by fear.

In the droNa parvan the pA\~nchAla hero dR^iShTadyumna advancing against
droNa is described thus:  
tasya rUpaM babhau rAjan bhAradvAjaM jighAMsataH |  
yathA rUpaM paraM viShNor hiraNyakashipor vadhe || Mbh 7.164.146
(“Critical”)  
The form, O king (dhr^itarAShTra), of his ( dR^iShTadyumna) when he
sought to slay the bharadvAja hero was like the ancient form of viShNu
during the killing of hiraNyakashipu.

Again dR^iShTadyumna is compared to nR^isiMha in course of a fiery
speech to arjuna when the latter was expressing deep concern over
fighting ashvathAman:  
tataH pA\~nchAlarAjasya putraH pArtham athAbravIt |  
saMkruddham iva nardantaM hiraNyakashipuM hariH || Mbh 7.168.21
(“Critical”)  
Then the son of the pA\~nchala king, said to arjuna the following, like
the lion (i.e. viShNu) to the furious and enraged hiraNyakashipu.

kR^iShNa tells yudhiShThira that he should kill duryodhana with the
appropriate plots or clever plans. As an example he says hiraNyAkSha and
hiraNyakashipu were both killed by plots or plans:  
kriyAbhy upAyaiH pUrvaM hi hiraNyAkSho mahAsuraH |  
hiraNyakashipush chaiva kriyayaiva niShUditau || Mbh 9.30.9
(“Critical”)  
The great asura hiraNyAkSha, as also hiraNyakashipu, were both slain by
plots and clever plans.

In the early pA\~ncharAtrika account in the shAntiparvan we see:  
nArasiMhaM vapuH kR^itvA hiraNyakashipuM punaH |  
surakArye haniShyAmi yaj\~naghnaM diti-nandanam || Mbh 12.326.73
(“Critical”)  
viShNu said: Again having taken the form of the man-lion I will slay for
the sake of the gods the yaj\~na-destroying hiraNyakashipu.

Further, in the shAntiparvan, in the account of skanda defeating
prahlAda he is clearly mentioned as hiraNyakashipu’s son. Again, in the
shAntiparvan there is a remarkable prose section composed by the early
nArAyaNIya pA\~ncharAtrika-s in a form resembling the vaidika brAhmaNa
texts with the express purpose of presenting viShNu as supreme and
down-sizing indra and rudra. This text mentions that hiraNyakashipu
originally had vasiShTha as his hotR^i. He dismissed vasiShTha and
appointed his nephew trishiras tvAShTra as his hotR^i. Furious vasiShTha
cursed him:  
hairaNyagarbhAch cha vasiShThAd dhiraNyakashipuH shApaM prAptavAn |
yasmAt tvayAnyo vR^ito hotA tasmAd asamApta yaj\~nas tvam apUrvAt
sattvajAtAd vadhaM prApsyasIti | tach ChApadAnAd dhiraNyakashipuH
prAptavAn vadham | (Mbh 12,329.19-20)  
hirANyakashipu received a curse from vasiShTha the son of hiraNyagarbha.
Since another person was chose as the hotR^i by you, your ritual will be
incomplete and you will attain death at the from being the like of which
has never existed before. And by that apparition hiraNyakashipu attained
death. \[Subsequently, indra kills trishiras tvAShTra who was taking
away the soma from the deva-s as in the vaidika account.\]

This early pA\~ncharAtrika account is remarkable in more than one way:
it seems like it was actually adopted from a real brAhmaNa text and
reworked to establish the primacy of viShNu-nArAyaNa. It contains an
unusual form of the legend which is seen nowhere else in the later
texts, i.e. the connection of hiraNyakashipu with trishiras and him
being killed as a result of a curse of vasiShTha who was formerly is
purohita. His killing is however attributed to an unprecedented being.
This being while not being explicitly named as nR^isiMha or viShNu,
there is sufficient hint that it was none other than nR^isiMha. This
indeed appears to be one of the earliest versions of the nR^isiMha
legend.

In conclusion we may infer the following: In the rAmAyaNa while the tale
of nR^isiMha is not mentioned, the daitya hiraNyakashipu is mentioned.
In the mahAbharata there are multiple clear mentions of hiraNyakashipu
and his killing by viShNu in an unusual form namely that of a man-lion
or lion. The leonine nature of viShNu per say has ancient roots, but it
is not unique to him [as several other deities are also attributed
leonine forms in the
veda](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/02/02/notes-on-vaishnava-shaiva-and-kaumara-sectarian-competition-in-the-purana-s/).
Thus, it appears that the daitya hiraNyakashipu had an early presence
(predating the epics) as a major daitya, but his importance was
relatively lower than that of other daitya-s like prahlAda, virochana,
and bali who despite being his successors are more important in the
early layer. While the nR^isiMha legend was connected to the killing of
hiraNyakashipu from the beginning it appears that this legend grew in
importance only later with the manifestations of viShNu as varAha,
vAmana-trivikrama and hayagrIva being more important in the early
period.

In this context we may make note of the following. Hindu tradition
records two kinds of demons, namely dAnava-s and daitya-s, who were
later collectively called asura-s (after the mutual Indo-Iranian
polarization of the terms deva and asura). The dAnava-s are the sons of
dAnu and daitya-s those of diti, as is emphasized in the paurANika
vaMsha-s. In the oldest layer of Hindu tradition (i.e. the RV) only dAnu
and dAnava-s are mentioned. Consistent with old vaMsha preserved in the
Mbh we see that all the major antagonists of the deva-s who are killed
by indra assisted by other deva-s in the RV are dAnava-s and not
daitya-s. Following are the major dAnava-s mentioned in the RV:  
dAnu: mother of the dAnava-s killed by indra.  
vR^itra: killed by indra assisted by marut-s sons of rudra, vAyu and
viShNu  
vala: killed by indra assisted by bR^ihaspati  
namuchi: killed by indra assisted by ashvin-s and sarasvatI.  
shambara: killed by indra assisted by viShNu and agni.  
shuShNa: killed by indra assisted by marut-s sons of rudra.  
pipru, kuyava, aurNavAbha: killed by indra.  
To this the epics add:  
naraka: slain by indra.  
jambha: slain by indra probably assisted by viShNu.  
viprachitti: killed by indra.  
tAraka: killed by kumAra.  
krau\~ncha: killed by kumAra.  
tripura-s (sons of tAraka): killed by rudra (already mentioned in YV).

In contrast, diti is mentioned only 3 times in the RV and the term
daitya is wholly missing. Similarly diti is mentioned a few time in the
AV vulgate and paippalAda saMhitA-s but not term daitya. However, the
daitya virochana is mentioned as the son of prahrAda in both AV
saMhitA-s. Another daitya andhaka (or in the form ardhaka) is also
mentioned in the AV. As mentioned earlier the daitya-s receive little
more mention in the brAhmaNa texts. Importantly, among the daitya-s
fewer appear to be slain by indra (primarily the earlier mentioned ones)
and mostly appear in later texts:  
hiraNyAkSha: killed by viShNu as varAha.  
hiraNyakashipu: killed by viShNu as nR^isiMha.  
prahrAda/prahlAda: killed by indra.  
virochana: killed by indra.  
balin: crushed by viShNu as trivikrama.  
andhaka (son of hiraNyAksa): killed by rudra.  
sunda and upasunda (grandsons of prahlAda): deva-s tricked them with the
help of apsaras tilottamA to kill themselves.  
mahiSha (grandson of diti via daughter): killed by kumAra.  
bANa (son of bali): killed by kumAra (later partially appropriated by
the vaiShNava-s for kR^iShNa vAsudeva).

Thus it appears that the daitya cycle was a later one developed after
the original dAnava cycle and viShNu had a place of prominence as the
great deva warrior this cycle. It was within this context that his
legend of nR^isiMha arose.

While we have nothing else left of the enigmatic prose nArAyaNIya
account mentioned above, do we have any other early account of the
nR^isiMha legend? Indeed, there appears to be one which is found in some
recensions of the mahAbharata that never made it into the vulgate or the
“Critical i.e. the Pune neo-recension”. This is a standalone section
that appears in the vanaparvan and describes the exploits of viShNu in a
succinct manner. Its archaic nature is suggested by the fact that it
recognizes only three manifestations of viShNu namely varAha
(incipiently present in the veda), nR^isiMha and vAmana-trivikrama
(already present in the veda). It also sets those manifestations in a
distinctive context from the usual accounts:

*It first describes the end of the universe after the completion of 1000
\* 4 yuga cycles; it is first burnt by the saMvartAgni and the stars and
planets are said to be completely destroyed. Then all there is a still
fluid which is now called the ekArNava (the one ocean). In this ocean
the thousand-headed, thousand-limbed nArAyaNa sleeps on the coils of the
great serpent sheSha. This is the night of the god when the manifest
universe ceases to exist. The text then gives the etymology of nArAyaNa;
nArAs is said to be the body of fluid, i.e. that of the ekArNava. This
fluid was sent into motion (ayana) by him who is called nArAyaNa for the
origination of the universe. Thus from his nave arose a lotus. From the
lotus brahmA was emitted and from him all of existence. Then viShNu
assumed the form of a gigantic boar 100 yojana-s in length and brought
up from the ekArNava the land for the living beings to live. \[Note that
in this context varAha is not described as fighting hiraNyakashipu and
is placed in the context of a primal origin myth in line with the
vaidika allusions to this myth.\] Then he is said to assume the of
nR^isiMha and slay hiraNyakashipu. Then assuming the form of a dwarf he
tricks bali into giving him the three pace of land; Growing gigantic he
covers the whole universe and conquers it on behalf of indra.*

The nR^isiMha narrative of this text goes thus:  
narasya kR^itvArdha-tanuM siMhasyArdha-tanuM prabhuH |  
daityendrasya sabhAM gatvA pANiM saMspR^ishya pANinA ||  
daityAnAm Adi-puruShaH surArir diti-nandanaH |

nArasiMhena vapuShA dAritaH karajair bhR^isham |  
evaM nihatya bhagavAn daityendraM ripu-ghAtinam ||

Having assumed a body of half man and half lion the lord \[viShNu\]
having gone to the assembly hall of the the lord of the daitya-s touched
one palm with another. The foremost person among the daitya-s, the enemy
of the gods, the son of diti, having seen this unprecedented being, who
full of anger with blood-shot eyes, with a raised trident in the hand,
wearing a garland, thundering like a rain-cloud, gloomy as a black
cloud, the enemy of the gods the son of diti, the valiant hiraNyakashipu
assailed nR^isiMha. Having seized him with his powerful, sharp claws of
the chief of the animals, with the body of a man-lion, he \[viShNu\]
tore him apart violently with his claws. Thus, the lord slew the chief
of the daitya, who was the killer of his enemies.

While this account is rather short it still conveys the chief points of
the myth: 1) The sudden appearance of nR^isiMha in the sabhA of the
demon. 2) The gesture of touching his palms seems to indicate that he
would not kill him with his palms or a weapon held by his palms. 3) It
is emphasized that the form was something unprecedented, suggesting that
hiraNyakashipu had immunity against regular forms. 4) He is described as
holding a trident in his hand – even in this early version of the
narrative the *[convergence between rudra and
nR^isiMha](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/02/02/notes-on-vaishnava-shaiva-and-kaumara-sectarian-competition-in-the-purana-s/)*
had already emerged.
