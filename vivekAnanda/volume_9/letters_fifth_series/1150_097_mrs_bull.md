## XCVII

*To Mrs. Ole Bull*

63 ST. GEORGE'S ROAD

*18th July '96*

DEAR MRS. BULL,

I received your last note duly — and you already know my gratitude and
love for you and that I perfectly agree with most of your ideas and
work.

I did not understand, however, one point. You speak of Sturdy and myself
being members. Members of what? I, as you well know, can not become a
member of any society.

I am very glad to learn that you have been favourably impressed by
Saradananda. There is one big mistake you are labouring under. What do
you mean of \[my\] writing to my workers more confidentially and not to
you? I seldom write to anyone — I have no time to write. I have no
workers. Everyone is independent to work as one likes. I do not bother
my head about these little things at all. I can give ideas — that is
all; let people work them out any way they like, and Godspeed to all.

"He who works unattached to persons and giving up the fruits of work is
a genuine worker" — Gitâ.

Yours Ever with love and gratitude,  
VIVEKANANDA
