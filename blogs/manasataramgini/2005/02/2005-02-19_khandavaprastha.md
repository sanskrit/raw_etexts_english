Those battles were over. Our gaping breaches in the fronts of sharirasya
oShadhi, dagdaratha and kosha remained, but the realization dawned on us
that we had won the encounter. Our amAtya and sachIva had been
unfortunately cursed with naraka which had visited then in the form of
the dreadful possession of the old one. indra had however given them a
boon that they would pass through naraka in pleasant surroundings. We
had invested the fort of khANDavaprastha after much fighting. Our
internal affairs were relatively precarious but we now ruled over
khANDava. ajadADhika, viTmukha and muNDakacha lay dead or wounded on the
field. We roamed around in khANDavagrAma not knowing where to start and
what to do. We received a congratulatory message from the Princess of
Hayastan, who then asked to try to cultivate masura lentils in khANDava.

Hayastanika then asked me narrate the story of the sale and the purchase
of the two cell phones.
