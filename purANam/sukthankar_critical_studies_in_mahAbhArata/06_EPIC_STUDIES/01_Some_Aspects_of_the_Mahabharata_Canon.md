title = "01 Some Aspects of the Mahabharata Canon"

+++

The problem of the Mahabharata textual criticism is a problem sui generis.
Here the principles of textual reconstruction must first be evolved from an
intensive study of the manuscript material and the‘ manuscript tradition.’^
They can be finally considered as settled only after prolonged and consider-
able discussion and exchange of ideas and opinions.

The vulgate text of the Mbh. is fairly readable and appears, in places,
to be even “ better ” than the critical text, because the former has been purged
by the continuous emendations of scholars for cetituries. The reader is con-
sequently apt to prefer, at first sight, the readings of the vulgate text, but a
thorough and sympathetic study of the author’s language and thought and a
critical evaluation of the variants would show him that the constituted text
is sound.

Of the many reviews of the first fascicule of the critical edition of the
Mahabharata that have appeared during the past year there are two
that deserve my special attention : the review by Dr. Hermann Weller in
the Zeitschrift fur Indologie und Irmistik (vol. 6, pp. 166 ff.), and that by
Professor Edgerton in the Journal of the American Oriental Society (vol. 48,
pp. 186-190). Both reviews are evidently products of a very close study of
the text and the critical apparatus. Particularly valuable is the review by
Prof. Edgerton, who can appreciate the difficulties of the problem I have
had to confront perhaps better than most scholars, since he has had to struggle
with problems of a like nature in his valuable work on the Paficatantra and
the Vikramacarita.

In the succeeding pages I have endeavoured to set forth my reasons for
adopting in the text the readings that have commended {158} themselves to
mef, in those cases whidi have been discussed by Weller and Edgerton in
the reviews mentioned above. They concern the readings of 1, 1. 19, 42, 49,
62, 201, and of the identification of the hundred sub-parvans of the Mbh.
enumerated in the second adhyiaya of the Adiparvan, that is, in the Parvasam-
grahaparvan.2

numbers without alphabetical prefix refer to the critical edition of the epic. When
a reference is made to other edtions of the epic, I have prefixed’ to the reference an

1. 1. 19 :

vedais caturbhilji samitam (v. 1 . smmniidm).

Weller suggests an emendation — ^in fact, two alternative emeindations.
He first proposes to read sammitdm for my samtdm. The former variant
is found only in one MS. which besides transposes the first two words of the‘
piada. His alternative suggestion is more radical. Seeing that the variant
preferred by him yields a pada metrically defective, he proposes to mend
matters by recasting the pada thus : caturUhih mmmitdm vedaili. This
pathya he thinks, must have been the original reading of the pMa. The
only reason Weller has adduced for rejecting the text reading is the sup-
posed intrinsic fitness of the alternate ; it suits the conteixt much better, he
believes. K^, the solitary MS. which contains the reading preferred by
Weller, stands sixth on my list of K MSS., whose relative valu« diminishes
in the order there given ; it is full of clerical mistakes, due probably to the
difficulty eixperienced by the copyist (either of this MS. or of one of its
ancestors) in deciphering the ( ? iSaradia) exemplar. I consider it an inferior
codex. With Weller’s reading we get a prior pada with the scansion

— / ^ — . Hopkins* statistical study of the relative frequency

of the different forms of the padas {Great Epic, p. 236) shows that this is
a “rare** combination. Even Weller realizes that the line does not read
smoothly and calls therefore the length of the sixth syllable a “metrical
archaism.*’ Now samitam (of the text, {159} without the anusvara) recurs
in a similar context, also at the end of a prior pada, and apparently in the
same sense in (B.) 1. 96.90 : idam hi vedaih samitam. It also occurs, in a
different context, in Susruta 2 . 346. 3 : angusphaparvasamitam. If we read
sammitdm in the passage under discussion, we should have pari passu to read
it in the two latter passages also, both of which then would be metrically
delfective ; the scansion of the first would be nearly the same as tliat of the
pSda in question, the second would end with three consecutive iambs. Are
these all instances of “ metrical archaisms *’ ? For that, it seems to me, the
documental probability of the reading perferred by Weller is not strong
enough. The text re(ading, which is mentioned by Nilakaptha as a variant,
is supported indirectly by {satnatam) and directly by Ko. 3 . 4.0 On

the other hand, Weller’s reading, as has already been remarked, is found
only in one inferior MS. Worthy of note is Nilakantha’s gloss : samitam Hi
pdphe Udydm ity arthah. The initial mistake of Weller lies in supposing that
sammitdm suits the context better than samitdm, wherelas, in point of fact,
sammmitdm is nothing more than a doublet of the other word. Weller does
not realize that his attempt to substitute an “ easier reading ” has been anti-
cipated by the scribe of K 5 , who likewise finding the emended line (metrically)
unreadable has transposed the words of the pada, reaching a new combina-
tion : caturbhir vedaih sammitdm, which according to Hopkins {loc. cit.) is
of “very rare, sporadic** occurrence. The word samita has been perfectly

correctly explained in PW. : samita {su -f mita) — sammita, “ gleiches Mass
habend, gleich.” The relation between the two words is clearly revealed by the
more familiar doublets satata : samtat\a, sahita : samhita and so on, 5/i-and sam
being the unaccented and accented forms of one and the same prefix. When
the accentual factor became inoperative, the choice was conditioned solely by
metrical considerations. The identification in the case of samita may have
been helped by contamination with sam + ita { — samgata)y “conformable
to, in harmony with ” (a meaning not unsuitable even here), or by its sup-
posed connection with sama, “ equal “ (cf. Wackernagel, Altind. Gramm.
II, 1 . § ‘30 \>p). The semantic values of the words in question being the
same, the combined {160} forcd of documental probability and metrical pre-
ference decides the question of choice incontestably in favour of the adopted
text.

The text reading really needs some further justification. Weller’s mis-
understanding of the* text is, ini my opinion, a direct confirmation of my re-
mark in thei Foreword (p. vi) that it is a lectio difficilior. The word was,
I suppose, early misunderstood. To judge by the character of the variants,
it was comnxonly, though erroneously, interpreted as sam -f ita, “ united, com-
bined with.” In this sense, in course of time, it must have been ousted by
its easier synonyms samyukta (substituted for it in B D) and sahita
(mainly in T and G). Both these readings are inadequate. Nilakaijitl'ia s
explanation caturveddrthavatlm is inadmissible ; the phrase can at best mean
catutvedaviattm\ (“possessing the four Vedas”), which is of course sheer
nonsense. Roy’s “ comprehendeth the sense of the four Vedas ” and Dutt’s
“contains the sense of the four Vedas” are dually inaccurate paraphrases
(based upon the explanation furnished by the scholiast), because the passage
in the vulgate cannot be'ar the meaning here forced! upon it. On the other
hand, the literal meaning of semtyukta or sahita is, as already re-
marked, wholly imsuitable. For what could the assembled sages melan by
saying that they wished to hear the (Mahabharata) Samhita “combined with
the four Vedas ” ?

To return to the manuscript evidence. The K group is partly corrupt
and indecisive though the majority has the text reading : Ko. y. 4. o as in text;
Kj sahitdm ; K., samUtam ; K5 smhmitdm. All these stand resolutely against
samyuktdm of the vulgate ; but, from the point of view of transcriptional
probability, none of them is wholly incompatible with samitdm of the text.
Three out of the four Malayalam MSS-, have also prewired the true reading ;
the remaining Malayalam MS. has sahitdm, the reading of the T G group.
With this data I should explain the genesis of the’ variants thus. The text
reading is a lectio difficilior, preserved in the majority of K intact, and in
the remaining MSS. of the K version in a corrupt condition. The K read-
ing being partly supported by M, there is a partial agreement between two
more or less independent versions, a condition almost wholly absent in the

After having proved that the text reading is not only better documented

can be suggested how the variant eva ca may have arisen. Two explana-
tions — both mere possibilities — occur to me. It is for one thing possible that
the original dtmavdn may have been deliberately suppressed in order to avoid
the monotonous reiteration of dtma at the end of three consecutive verses.
A more likely reason for the suppression may have been the lack of a copula
in the original line, which had been crowded out by the succession of three un-
usually long names (two of four syllables each, and the third one of not less
than five), taking up by themselves 13 syllables out of an aggregate of 16 of
the 41oka line.

one hand and by one section of the Southern recension on the other. But
the compelling power of this agreement is weakened by the circumstance that
one Malayalam MS. and three (out of the seven) Grantha MSS. are outside
the group. Had the whole of B agreed with the whole of S, it would have
been difficult, if not impossible, for reasons explained in the previous section,
£165} to reject the concordant reading. The weak point of this variant lies
in the fact that it does not at all explain, as far as I can judge, how the other
readings may have arisen. There is the same flaw in the other rejected
variant, though not in the same degree. The text reading, though weakly
supported by MSS, serves admirably, in my opinion, to account for the
existence of the variahts, especially if smhksepam is taken as an adverbial
gerund in-am (Pacini’s nanud), as I think it should be ; c/. Whitney, Sans-
krit Grammar, § 995. For there would then be an inherent tendency to substi-
tute for it simpler readings, samksipya ca and samksepatah would be very
neat paraphrases of the awkward adverbial gerund : the second {samksepatah)
preserving nearly intact the original ak^aras, the first {samk^ipya) involving
a more radical change from the view-point of form, but closely following the
original in sense. The latter may, moreover, have been directly suggested by
vistlrya in the first pada which it nicely balances. I assume, of course, that
samksipy\a was introduced independently in B D on the one hand and S on
the other. In other words, I think that the concordance between certain
sections of the Northern and the Southern recensions is purely accidental, and
it is unquestionable that it could be that. I must frankly admit, however,
that there is a strong element of subjectivity in this choice, which can in no
way be said to be compelling. I prefer the text reading, fully realizing that
others may prefer either of the other two readings ; but that is precisely why
a wavy line has been printed in the text below samksepam, I doubt very
much whether any compelling reason can be advanced to prove the absolute
superiority of any one of the variants over the others.

Edgerton discusses at some length the variation amrtam : am tarn and
decides emphatically in favour of anrtam, Edgerton’s arguments are briefly
these : first and foremost, the text reading does not do justice to the emphatic

In the first place I differ from Edgerton radically as to the value and im-
portance of the word eva in the sentence. It is unquestionably true that eva
does emphasize the preceding word or words, but this is neither necessarily
nor universally true. Very frequently, especially in the epics and the
Puranas, the emphasis is so slight that it is almost negligible, and the word
is nothing more than an expletive. My experience fully corroborates P. W.,
which has the following note s. v. eva : ” Nicht selten, aamenlich nach einigen
Partikeln, ist die Bedeutung von eva abgeschwacht, dass wir auch den Nach-
druck aufgeben.” But the best answer to Edgerton’s contention as to the
value of eva is to show that it figures very frequently at the end of the pada,
in long enumerations of names and attributes where no emphasis could be
intended whatsoever. Here are some examples- chosen at random :

Edgerton discusses at some length the variation arnrtam : anrtam and

In the first place I differ from Edgerton radically as to the value and im-
portance of the word eva in the sentence. It is unquestionably true that eva
does emphasize the preceding word or words, but this is neither necessarily
nor universally true. Very frequently, especially in the epics and the

It would be clearly preposterous to see in these evu ca emphatic parti-

more than copulative expletives. My impression is that the epic “ poets ”
use the conjunctions m, caiva or eva ca according as they require one, two or
three syllables to fill their line ! This, I hope, will suffice to dispose of the
alleged necessity of looking for and finding any striking paradox in
this line.

But I think Edgerton is making another and a graver mistake. His
remark that “ the panegyrist of the epic [italics mine] starts out to claim that
it contains everything makes me suspect that Edgerton has possibly mis-
understood the hemistich in question. Here the subject matter of glorifica-
tion is not the epic at all. but merely the first’ adhyaya thereof. The hemis-
tich occurs in a passage at the end of the first adhyiaya, and the passage is
evidently of the nature of a phalasrutL The hemistich says : “ This is the
body of the (Maha-) Bharat a.” Here “ this refers not to the whole epic but
merely to the Anukramainl chapter mentioned in the previous stanzas. The
whole line is a subordinate {hi) clause depending upon the main clause con-
tained in the immediately preceding stanza. “ (200) He who repeats (in an
undertone, even) a little of the Anukramani at both twilights is freed immedi-
ately from as much sin as has been accumulated during the day and the night ;
(201) for, this is the body of the (Maha-)Bharata (that is) Truth and also
Immortality ! ” It is owing to its partaking of the qualities of (or, as the pane-
gyrist of the adhyaya will have it, owing to its being) Truth and Immortality
that it is able to absolve the devout reciter of the adhyaya immediately from
sin. The emphasis, if any, is on hi (“for”), not on eva. Objection may be
taken to the neuter gender of etat, since it is made to refer the Anukramani
(f.) chapter as I do here. The gender may be explained either as a case of
attraction by the gender of the predicate {vapus, n.) or as referring indiscri-
minately to anukramofii (f.) or adhyaya (m.). But if Edgerton does not
like that, I have no great objection to his translating : “ For this form of the
(Maha-)Bharata is Truth and Immortality.” According to this interpreta-
tion, the variant amtam is wholly inappropriate and inadmissible ; and in fact
on second thoughts I am inclined even to dispense with the wavy line under
amrtam.

£171} The paradox conceived by Edgerton might apply fitly to the
whole? epic, which may be said to mirror all phases of life, ‘‘ Truth, — yes,
and Falsehood too ! ” but it is clearly unreasonable and even impossible to
say that the Anukramaji^ chapter by itself could be “ Truth,— yes and False-
hood too.” Furthermore, even if this wonderful chapter be the Truth as well
as Falsehood, I fail to see how it should follow that such a chapter could on
that account be able to give absolution to a sinner. If one bears in mind
that the subject matter of the panegyric is the Anukramani chapter (and not

EPIC STUDIES


the epic), one cannot, I think, come to any other conclusion than that the tru(:
reading is rnnrtam.

It may be added that Edgerton’s mistake is quite natural and is caused
primarily by the* misleading division of the passage (stanzas 200-202) into
distiches, which suggests that the subject matter of the pr^asti is the Maha-
bharata. The first half of stanza 201 is logically and grammatically con-
nected with the preceding stanza (200); on the other hand the second half
is part and parcel of the following stanza (202). The first half clearly refers
to the Anukramani chapter, the second half equally clearly to the epic as a
whole. Could I have foreseen the confusion it is apt to cause, I would cer-
tainly have joined the first half of stanza 201 to 200 and the second half to
stanza 202, notwithstanding that this arrangelment yields two consecutive three-
line stanzas. In such cases I have mostly made three distiches, sometimes,
I fear, as in this instance, clouding the sense.

There remains now only one point to be* considered. By saying that
amrtam is a lectio difficilior, Edgerton implies that the change from amHam
into anrtdm is ordinarily inconceivable, since any copyist would have fought
shy of attributing falsehood to the epic. Such a view would, in my opinion,
be entirely incorrect. The distinguishing feature of scribes’ emendations is
that it is superficial. The scribe does not stop to think very deeply about
the consequences of the change. Here, I fancy, the variant has arisen merely
because, in entirely different contexts, satyam and anftam are found frequently
combined into a phrase, sometimes even combined into the compound
satyanrta (e.g. satydnrt\e yo vivmakie loke, 1. 3. 152 ; satydnrte avapasyan
jandndm RV. 7.49.3). I {172} therefore hold that the substitutions of anrtam
for amftam is wholly within the range of probability and even quite natural
for an Indian scribe.

Although it is prefectly true that all previous efforts to make the text
of the Mbh. agree with the numerical data of its extent and size have ended
in dismal failures, Edgerton is needlessly nervous about my attempt to re-
duce the number of the (sub-)parvans exactly to one hundred. Edgerton’s
view is that the traditional hundred ^ould be regarded as an approximate
or “ round ” number. This is the explanation given also by C. V. Vaidya
in his Epic India (p. 189) when he is faced with the anomaly that his list
of " hundred parvans ” contains 107 titles. In support of the view, one mi^t
cite the use of the word sataka in titles of anthologies like the SrngSrasataka,
which frequently, if not uniformly, contain more than 100 stanzas. The paral-
lelism would, in my opinion, be not quite exact, because, I think, here the suffix
ka (miscalled svdrthe by Indian grammarians) probably suggests, if it does not

actually connote, the approximate character of the denominaticxi. Less con-
vincing still isi the analogy (mentioned by C. V. Vaidya, loc. cit.) of the ap-
pellation satasdhasn of the Mbh, This expression is admittedly not intended
to mean exactly one hundred thousand, whatever else it may mean. But the
latitude implicitly allowed in the use of the expression satasahasra in stating
the number of stanzas which are approximately a lakh cannot, it seems to me,
be claimed by a person giving the number of chapters which are approKf-
mately only one hundred. That question apart, when the old experts of the
Great Epic {bhdratacintaka, 1. 2. 172) had calculated and stated the
exact number of adhyayas and slokas, parvan by parvan for all the eighteen
parvans, apparently correct to the last digit, would it not be exceedingly
strange if the numbet of the chapter-groups alone, given in the very same
adhyaya, in the same context, were to be only approximate ? A few stanzas
more or less in an aggregate of several thousand stanzas, or a few adhyayas
more or less {175} in an aggregate of several hundred adhyayas would not have
mattered very much one way or the* other ; but a few parvans more or less
when the total was only in the neighbourhood of hundred ! So careless I
suppose even the careless custodians of the fifth Veda were not. Their cal-
culations imy have befen wrong, but their intention is perfectly clear. They
say and mean that the number was exactly one hundred : notice the puniam
in the first pada of the hemistich. In fact, the amazing difference in the
lengths and characters of these chapter-groups — ^there are some containing
only 1 adhyaya and less than 70 stanzas, there are others which contain more
than 70 adhyayas and considerably more than 3,000 stanzas ! — could, I think,
only have been the result of an over-mastering desire on the' part of some
old editor or editors to reach, by hook on crook, some such predetermined
“round"’ number.

Edgerton is perfectly right when he says that tlie attempt to reconstruct
the original text of this passage presents some very serious textual difficulties.
Whether my text will finally prove correct in every respect or not remains of ,
course! to be seen. I hope it will fit the constituted text of the whole epic ;
but I shall not be greatly shocked if it does not. The texts of the present
editions, Calcutta, Bombay or Kumbhakonam, do not conform to the detahs
given in the “ Table of Contents.” There arc all kinds of discrepiancies bet-
ween them : the sloka numbers do not agree’ ; the same is true of the adhyaya
and the parvan number. These discrepancies cannot be helped, — so long as
we do not know who had done the coimting andj when it was done. As for
the constituted text of the passage in question, I will only say that I have
forniied it rigidly on the! principles of textual criticism worked out by me and
followed elsewhere in the course of my work on the edition. These principles
have been applied independently of the queJStion of the past, present cm* future
form and divisions of the epic. The constituted text is based
mainly on documental and intrinsic probability. It is



200


EPIC STUDIES


more than likely that it contains some slight errors ; the different versions are
interwove'n in such an intricate manner that to disentangle them with com*
plete assurance or to one's complete satisfaction is not yet possible, or perhaps
is no longer possible. I honestly believe that the discrepancieis between the
constituted {174} text and the present Table of Contents," will be very
considerably diminished. But about one thing I feel perfectly confident and
that is that the number is intended to be exactly one hundred. Edgerton
himself would probably have been less sceptical had he known that both
Arjunamisra and NUakaaita have left behind them in their scholia mnemonic
stanzas, stating the exact number of (sub-)parvans in each of the eighteen
(major) parvans. In both cases the total is exactly one hundred ; besides
that, the individual figures tally exactly in the two lists.

Here are the stanzas themselves.

My series differs from that of the mnemonic stanzas only as regards
the two (consecutive) parvans Santi and Anu^sanr,. The aggregate number
of the two parvans is the same in our lists ; the discrepancy is only with
regard to the division of the five sub-parvans between the two major parvans.
My figures for these parvans are 3 and 2 ; those given, by the scholiasts in
their stanzas are 4 and 1 respectively, differing only by one each from mine.
I am unable to account for this discrepancy at present.

These stanza;s, it will have to be admitted, make the case for the ex-
actitude of the figure 100 very much stronger. Is it conceivable that two
different scholiasts would make up two different mnemonic stanzas, each
giving a perfectly fictitious series of figures, with the total exactly hundred,

1 It will be noticed that 17 (out of the aggregate of 19) names of the (major)
parvans, in this scheme, are identical with the names of the Mial (sub-)parvan
of each group. This is valuable because it suggests how the names of the 19
(major) parvans were obtained from the (older) list of the hundred (sub-) parvans.

for the number of chapter-groups in each of the eighteen books of the epic ?
These stanza's establish, in my opinion, irrefutably that as late as the time
of Arjunamisra the total number of (sub-)parvans was believed to be exactly
one hundred, and (what is much more important) the exact number of
(sub-)parvan in each of the (major) parvans wasi also believed to be
accurately known. Whether or not these figures tallied exactly with the
actual divisions of the version of the text prepared by these commentators
is an entirely different question, which I am not yet prepared to answer in
the affirmative. These stanzas stand, in my opinion, for an effort to save
from the limbo of oblivion some precious fragment of traditional knowledge
regarding the epic. Like fossils these skeletons of the old Parvasarhgraha-
parva have survived, despite the frantic efforts of centuries of editors and
critics to make the “ Table of Contents '' agree with the form of the text
known to them.

Many of Edgerton’s suggestions and queries relate to the uses of the
wavy line : mostly cases where he has either less or {178} more confidence
in the readings I haVe adopted. This device, as Edgerton himself admits,
is *‘by its very nature hard to apply strictly and consistently.” Moreover,
most of tile words cited by him are merely commonplace adverbs, conjunc-
tions and other expletives like caiva, dkuh (v. 1. viduh), iha, vd, tv-air a, edpi,
kintrvd (v. 1. vd kirn) and so on. I will therefore forbear from entering
into a detailed discussion of the relative merits of the variants, especially
as, in the maljority of the cases, the manuscript evidence is so conflicting
that absolute certainty is impossible.

I cannot conclude this paper without expressing both to Professor
Edgerton ahd to Dr. Weller my cordial thanks for the very kind remarks
they have to make regarding the work in general, and my keen stppreciation
of the uniformly courteous tone of their very sympathetic reviews.
