## VIII

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

MINNEAPOLIS

*24 November 1893*.

DEAR MOTHER

I am still in Minneapolis. I am to lecture this afternoon, and the day
after tomorrow go to Des Moines.

The day I came here they had their first snow, and it snowed all through
the day and night, and I had great use for the arctics. (A waterproof
overshoe.) I went to see the frozen Minnehaha Falls. They are very
beautiful. The temperature today is 21^(o) below zero, but I had been
out sleighing and enjoyed it immensely. I am not the least afraid of
losing the tips of my ears or nose.

The snow scenery here has pleased me more than any other sight in this
country.

I saw people skating on a frozen lake yesterday.

I am doing well. Hoping this will find you all the same, I remain,

Yours obediently,  
VIVEKANANDA
