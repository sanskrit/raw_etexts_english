For several years we have been fascinated by the symmetric icon
attractors popularized by the physicist Sprott. The above attractors
discovered by Golubitsky and Field gain their symmetry because of the
step r=(x+i\*y)^n, where n is an integer power. Thus they spread the
xn+1 and yn+1 values over the imaginary plane resulting in symmetry
decided by the power n. The z-value is not used in the calculation of x
and y so it appears rotationally symmetric around the z axis.
