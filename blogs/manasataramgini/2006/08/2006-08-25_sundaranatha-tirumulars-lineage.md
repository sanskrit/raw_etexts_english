title = "sundaranAtha (tirumUlar)’s lineage"

+++
In the preamble to the tirumantiraM tirumUlar (verses ) gives his
lineage thus (translated only loosely during conversation with my
clansmen who know the drAviDa bhASha/transliterated from a reading in an
old book possessed by them):

n^an^dhi aruLpeRRa n^Adharai n^ADiDin  
seek the nAtha-s (tantric adepts) who have attained the grace of nandin,

n^an^dhikaL n^Alvar chivayOka mAmuni  
The 4 nandins, and then the muni shivayogI,

manRU thozudha padhanychali viyAkramar  
pata\~njali of the holy temple and vyAghrapAda,

enRivar ennO DeNmaru mAmE (TM 67)  
and with I complete you count to eight.

Thus we have 4\*nandin-s -\> shivayogi -\> pata\~njali -\> vyAghrapAda
-\> sundaranAtha (tirumUlar).  
This fascination with nandin prevades the whole of the tirumantiram

For example we have in the preamble:  
n^an^dhi aruLAlE n^AthanAm pErpeRROm  
By the grace of nandin I attained the name amongst his nAtha-s,

n^an^dhi aruLAlE n^Adhanai n^ADinOm  
By nandin’s grace I sought the first nAtha,

n^an^dhi aruLAva dhencheyum n^ATTinil  
What can I not do with nandin’s grace.

n^an^dhi vazikATTa n^Anirun^ dhEnE (TM 68)  
With nandin showing the way I remain here in the \[guru-lineage\].

Further we find vinAyaka apparently called nandin’s son in the
introductory invocation:  
n^an^dhi makanRanai nyAnak kozun^dhinai  
pun^dhiyil vaiththaDi pORRukin REnE  
nandin’s son, a bloom of knowledge  
I meditate on him and worship his feet.

We do not know for certain if this preamble of the tirumantiram was
added later, but my sources believe that on linguistic grounds it should
be considered an integral part of the text. This tradition of
attributing a lineage to nandi does not follow the tradition of teachers
of several well know tantras including shrividyA, where we see
illustrious matsyendra nAtha. In a sense these lineages vaguely
resemble, in concept, those stated for the krodhabhairava sUtras,
siddha-yogeshvarI-mata, the glorious vishvAdya tantraM, which expound
the mysterious yoginI-jAla of vishvA and the famed yoginI-jAla-shambara.
However no tradition as that of tirumUlar is seen in any sanskR^it text.
Nevertheless, the krodhAnala saMhitA of the krodhabhairava tradition is
said to have been founded by nandinAtha and transmitted by him. Of which
only the binduvijaya is supposed to survive in fragments. Amongst the
drAviDa siddhAntin-s there is a belief that a part of the raurava Agama
was transmitted by nandin; however, a lineage akin to that given by
tirumular is not attested there to the best of my knowledge.

But the tirumantiram names nine tantras as a part of the tradition it
received from nandin. These are described in verse 63 of the preamble
as:  
peRRan^al AkamaN^ kAraNaN^ kAmikam  
uRRanal vIram uyarchin^dham vAdhuLam  
maRRav viyAmaLa mAkuN^kAlOththaran^  
thuRRan^aR chuppirany chollu makuDamE (TM 63)

All the tantras named here belong to the Urdhva-srotas emanating from
ishAna or the upper head of the five-faced deva. They are divided into
the 10 shiva Agamas and 18 rudra Agamas, both of which are seen in the
nandin tradition of tirumular. They are:  

- principal shivAgamas: 1) kAraNa 2) kAmikA 4) chintya 8) suprabheda ;
- principal rudrAgamas: 3) vIra 5) vAtula 6) vimala 9) makuTa upAgama of
the kiraNa tantra stream 7) kallottara.

It should be noted that within the tirumantiram a particular hierarchy
of the siddhAnta tantras is implicit, with the above 9 being primary.
This, however, is not mentioned in the surviving Sanskrit tradition. It
again points to the fact that tirumular’s lineage was probably an early
branch of the siddhAnta tantric tradition that possibly had its unique
set of chosen tantras amongst the core shiva tantras and rudra tantras,
which it considered primary. Thus, we encounter this verse:

Akamam onpAn athilAna n^AlEzu  
There are nine Agamas that emerged in the ancient time  
mOkamil n^AlEzu muppEtha muRRuTan  
Then they split up into three paths  
vEkamil vEthAn^tha chiththAn^tha meymaiyon  
To display the truth of vedAnta and siddhAnta  
RAka muTin^tha varunychuththa chaivamE (TM1429)  
That is the secret knowledge of shuddha shaiva

The genuine connection of the siddhAnta Agamas and the tradition of
tirumUlar is established beyond doubt in the discussion of the
celebrated pa\~nchAkSharI vidyA (namaH shivAya) seen in the verse 890
onwards. Here tirumUlar reaches the height of his work, describing at
length the extraordinary vikR^itis of the pa\~nchAkSharI and the
numerous yantras derived from it. He also explains the harihara yantra,
establish the archaic nature of this yantra/mantra and bringing memories
of the ancient hariharAlayas of Angkor and Vietnam. In fact few of the
yantra-s derived from the pa\~nchAkSharI vidyA mentioned by tirumular
are of utmost importance as an independent evidence because the Sanskrit
originals are lost (though their fragments are very much retained in
mantra manuals).

Taken together with references to other incidents veiled by mysticism,
we may infer that around 500 AD Kashmirian, or Kashmir-trained shaiva
tantric like sundaranAtha entered the drAviDa desha and seeded a tamil
tradition. For this they claimed a distinctive lineage from nandin,
which they might have inherited from a lost Sanskrit tradition related
to krodhabhairava or derived it afresh in the drAviDa lands. They appear
to have originally considered as authoritative a set of 8 principal
Agamas and 1 upAgama of the siddhAnta srotas, and were also influenced
heavily by the shrIkula tradition — of which we do not know which
tantra-s they followed. However, from the form of the pa\~nchadashi
which is given by tirumUlar we may conclude that they were affiliated
with kAdimata form of the shrIvidyA mantra, unlike most later
Kashmirians and Himachalas who tended to follow the hAdimata. They were
clearly vedic in affiliation, in that they held the veda as the highest
authority and respected the vedic yAga-s, though for all practical
purposes the Agamic religion dominated their thought. The important
point to note here is that from an early period there was a symbiosis
between various shaiva and shAkta tantric schools. Of the latter the
dominant ones were kubjikAmata, shrIkula, kAlikula, and trikA.
