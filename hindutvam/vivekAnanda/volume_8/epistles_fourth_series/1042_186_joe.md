## CLXXXVI

*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

102 E. 58TH STREET,  
NEW YORK,  
*24th July, 1900*.

DEAR JOE,

The sun = Knowledge. The stormy water = Work. The lotus = Love. The
serpent = Yoga. The swan = the Self. The Motto = May the Swan (the
Supreme Self) send us that. It is the mind-lake. (This explains the
design on the Ramakrishna Math and Mission seal, printed on the title
page of this volume — *Ed*.) How do you like it? May the Swan fill you
with all these anyway.

I am to start on Thursday next, by the French steamer *La Champagne*.
The books are in the hands of Waldo and Whitmarsh. They are nearly
ready.

I am well, getting better — and all right till I see you next week.

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.
