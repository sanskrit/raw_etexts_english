## THE CENTRAL IDEA OF THE VEDAS

(*Vivekananda in Indian Newspapers*, p. 30.)

\[*The Indian Mirror*, July 20, 1894\]

Swami Vivekananda explained in America the central idea of the Vedas as
follows:

I humbly beg to differ from those who see in monotheism, in the
recognition of a personal God, apart from Nature, the acme of
intellectual development. I believe, it is only a kind of
anthropomorphism which the human mind stumbles upon in its first efforts
to understand the unknown. The ultimate satisfaction of human reason and
custom lies in the realisation of that universal essence which is the
All. And I hold an irrefragable evidence that this idea is present in
the Vedas, the numerous gods and their invocations notwithstanding. This
idea of formless All, the *Sat*, i.e., esse or being, called *Atman* and
*Brahman* in the Upanishads, and further explained in the Darsans, is
the central idea of the Vedas, nay, the root-idea of the Hindu religion
in general. (Unidentified source.)
