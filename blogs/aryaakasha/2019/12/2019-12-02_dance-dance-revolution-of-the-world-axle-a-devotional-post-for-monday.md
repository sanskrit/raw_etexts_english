“Which of his members is the seat of Fervour: Which is the base of
Ceremonial Order?  
Where in him standeth Faith? Where Holy Duty? Where, in what part of him
is truth implanted?  
Out of which member glows the light of Agni? Form which proceeds the
breath of Mātarisvan?  
From which doth Chandra measure out his journey, travelling over
Skambha’s mighty body?  
Which of his members is the earth’s upholder? Which gives the middle air
a base to rest on?  
Where, in which member is the sky established? Where hath the space
above the sky its dwelling?  
Whitherward yearning blazeth Agni upward? Whitherward yearning bloweth
Mātarisvan?  
Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha to whom with long-ing go the
turning pathways?  
Whitheward go the half-months, and, accordant with the full year, the
months in their procession?  
Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha to whom go seasons and the
groups of seasons?  
Whitherward yearning speed the two young Damsels, accordant, Day and
Night, of different colour?  
Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha to whom the Waters take their
way with longing?  
Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha”

\[First 7.5 Lines of AtharvaVeda X 7 – To The World Axis\]

\[Art by a chap by the name of ‘Lifeless Mech’\]

\[Also, the Vedically knowledgeable shall note several things with this
post \[pun, perhaps, intended\].

The first being that I am making a direct link between the concept of
Shiva-as-Nataraja and Axis Mundi ; in particular, the notion that the
revolution, the movements of Shiva’s Tandava Dance is, ultimately, the
force which turns the Wheel of Creation – in the manner that the
spinning of the chariot-axle turns the wheel thusly affixed.

Hence – Skambha !

The second, being that all the Deifics, all the Theonyms cited to this
point in the hymnal are rather strongly Shaivite linked. Whether
*directly*, in terms of Agni or Chandra, or subject to intriguing
interpolation and indirect-yet-still-Sound \[pun, again, perhaps
intended\], as with Matarisvan.

The third, being the *further* associations, some of which are Deific
Person(ages) or Emanations, again linked Directly or Indirectly to
Shiva. The Day and Night, thence the Passage of Time (and Its
Regulation); a Descent of Water(s); as well as some of the virtuous ,
expressive concepts we see here in adjectival form.

Now to be sure, there is also *quite a lot more* going on in that Hymnal
– and I do not mean to make, as it were, a full/total identification of
*all* of that with Shiva; in no small part because my Shakta theological
inclinations supply closer fits for certain elements, and for the
overarching concept as a whole – but that is not to exclude Shiva \[how
could we, even if we wanted to … and for that matter *why* would we want
to ?! \] , but rather to run the principle in question with Him as an
important , vitally integral , core component. One of Two in many
ax-iomatic respects.

But more of that in, perhaps, a future series of posts.

For the moment … Jai Ishvara – Jai Nataraja – Jai Mahadeva
