## Solar months (Religious)

(5) The calculation of solar ( saura ) months necessary for determining the lunar months of the same name, will start 23° 15' ahead of the vernal equinoctial point. This tallies with the present practice of most almanac-makers. 



The months would thus commence at the moments when the tropical longitude of the sun attains the following values : 



- Saura Vaiśākha commences when the Sun has the longitude of 23° 15' 0"

- Jyestha 53 15 0 

- Aṣādha 83 15 0 

- Śrāvana 113 15 0 

- Bhadrapada 143 15 0 

- Āśvina 173 15 0 

- Kārtika 203 15 0 

- Mārgasirsa 233 15 0 

- Pauṣa 263 15 0 

- Māgha 293 150 

- Phālguna 323 15 0

- Caitra 353 15 0 



This recommendation is to be regarded only as a measure of compromise, so that we avoid a violent break with the established custom. But it does not make our present seasons in the various months as they were in the days of Varahamihira or Kalidasa. It is hoped that at not a distant date, further reforms for locating the lunar and solar festivals in the seasons in which they were originally observed will be adopted. 



## Lunar months

(6) As usual the lunar months for religious purposes would commence from the moment of new-moon and would be named after the saura māsa in which the new-moon falls. If there be two new-moons during the period of a saura māsa, the lunar month beginning from the first new-moon is the adhika or mala and the lunar month beginning from the moment of the second new-moon is the śuddha or nija, as usual. 



## Lunar mansions (nakṣatra-s)

(7) The moments of moon's exit from a nakṣatra division of 13° 20' each or sun's entry into it, would be calculated with a variable ayanāṁśa i.e., on the supposition that they are fixed with respect to the stars. The value of this ayanāṁśa would amount to 23° 15' 0" on 21st March, 1956. Thereafter it would gradually increase with the usual annual rate, the mean value of which is about 50".27. 



## Consequences on festivals

These arrangements would ensure that the religious festivals, and observances determined by the sun (such as the Mahāviṣuva saṁkrānti, Uttarāyaṇa saṁkrānti, Dakṣiṇāyana saṁkrānti) would follow astronomically correct seasons, but those determined by the lunar calendar would continue to be observed in times conforming to the present practice, and the **correction we have introduced in the length of the year** would prevent their further shift in relation to the seasons. 



The dates of +++(sun-determined)+++ festivals have already shifted by 23 days from the seasons in which they were observed about 1400 years ago as a result of our almanac-makers having ignored the precession of the equinoxes. Although it may seem desirable that the entire amount of shifting should be wiped out at a time, we consider it expedient to maintain this as a constant difference and stop its further increase. As a result, there would at present be no deviation from the prevailing custom in the observance of the religious festivals. 



In the calculation of nakṣatras, however, we have adopted a variable ayanāṁśa, so, that at the time of a particular nakṣatra the moon may be seen in the sky near the star or star-group of that name. This practice is being followed in our country from the Vedic times and is perfectly scientific. 



## Day span

(8) The day should be reckoned from midnight to midnight of the central station (82.5° E. Long. and 23° 11' North Latitude) for civil purposes, but for religious purposes the local sunrise system may be followed. 



## Data and Calculation

(9) For the purpose of all calculations, the longitudes of the sun and the moon should be obtained by applying the most up to date and complete equations of their motions, so that they may tally with their observed values.
