## XXXII

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

ANNISQUAM

*5 September 1894*

DEAR MOTHER

The news of the arrival of the phonograph from Khetri has not come yet.
But I am not anxious, because I just now got another letter from India
wherein there is no mention of the photographs I sent, showing that
parcels reach later than letters.

Herewith I send you an autograph letter of H.H. the Maharaja of Mysore,
the chief Hindu king in India. You may see on the map \[that\] his
territory occupies a very large portion of southern India.

I am very glad that he is slowly being gained over to my side. If he
wills, he can set all my plans to work in five days. He has an income of
$150 million dollars; think of that.

May Jagadamba \[the Mother of the Universe\] turn his mind towards the
good work. He says he quite appreciates my good words — they were about
my plans for educating the poor. Hope he will soon show it in material
shape.

My love to all. Why the babies do not prattle?

Your son,  
VIVEKANANDA
