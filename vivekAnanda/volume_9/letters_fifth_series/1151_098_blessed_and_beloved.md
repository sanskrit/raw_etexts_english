## XCVIII

*To Sister Christine*

\[POSTMARKED: SAAS-FEE\]  
SWITZERLAND

*5th August 1896*

BLESSED AND BELOVED,

Surrounded on all sides by eternal snow peaks, sitting on the grass in a
beautiful wood, my thoughts go to those I love — so I write.

I am in Switzerland — constantly on the move — getting a much needed
rest. It is a miniature Himalayas, and has the same effect of raising
the mind up to the Self and driving away all earthly feelings and ties.
I am intensely enjoying it. I feel so, so uplifted. I cannot write, but
I wish you will have the same for ever — when your feet do not want, as
it were, to touch the material earth — when the soul finds itself
floating, as it were, in an ocean of spirituality.

Prof. Max Müller has written in the *Nineteenth Century* an article on
my Master. Read it if you can — August number.

I hope you are enjoying this beautiful summer and are perfectly rested
after hard work.

My love to all. Blessings to all.

Yours ever with love and blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA

P.S. A few Alpine flowers growing almost in the midst of eternal snow I
send you, praying that you may attain spiritual hardihood amidst all
snows and ice of this life.

V.
