<p class="Text">The short stories have particular imporatnce in the evolution of life. It has been the custom since the ancient time that the old grand mothers relate the stories to the children while feeding them, the children take keen interest in listening to the stories. Sometimes they insist also to relate the stories. The mothers relate the good fables, in the form of tales to the children which increase their knowledge as well as simultaneously develop good tendencies. There are several types of fables and stories. Some are imaginary, which provide recreation and amusement chiefly. Some fables are historical, mythological and cultural that are inspiring in our lives and they shape our mental tendencies.</p>
<p class="Text">In fact, the fables touch our innerself, and thus they develop our consciousness and noble tendencies. They possess the natural attraction. A person reads them with interest and mental concentration. So, these fables leave a permanent impression on the reader’s mind also children, old and youngs—all get benefitted with them.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">A number of years earlier, the special edition of ‘Kalyan’ had been published in the shape of ‘Satkathanka; which was the collection of mythological, historical and spiritual fables. These fables are opportune and very effective. The collection of the same fables is being presented in a small number in the form of this book here. It is expected that the readers would like them and will be benefitted.<span class="char-style-override-3"></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">God’s egotism and Lord </p>
<p class="Text">Once, a war between gods and demons broke out. By Lord’s grace, the gods got victory. The demons, breaking down the propriety of Lord and Shastras were defeated. It was the will and grace of the Lord only, sole factor behind this great victory, yet the gods could not realise it. They thought—‘This is our victory and this good luck and repute is the result of merely our valour.’ It took no time for the Lord to smell it. He appeared before them in the form of a wonderful demi-god to put away their this arrogance, the source of all the vices. </p>
<p class="Text">The gods could hardly recognise His wonderful form and got amazed at all. They sent god-fire to find out the whereabout of the demi-god. On the arrival of the fire there, the Lord, in the disguised form of demi-god, asked him—‘Who are you?’ The fire said—‘Don’t you know me? I am ‘Jatveda’ popular by the name of ‘Agni’ (fire) in the universe.’ The Lord in the disguised form of demi-god, asked, ‘What is the power in you being so reputed and virtuous?’ Then, the fire said—‘I can burn to ashes the entire living and non living beings of the universe.’ Then the Lord (in the form of demi-god) put a straw before him and said—‘Please burn it.’ The fire tried to the best of his capacity, overpowered by anger, himself blazed from top to the bottom, but he could not burn that straw. At last, he returned back being disappointed and ashamed and said to the gods—‘I could not find out the least about this demi-god.’ Then, with the unanimous consent, the god of wind went to that demi-god and the Lord repeated the same question to him also—‘Who are you?  and what is your supernatural power?’ He said—‘I am known by the name of ‘wind’ in this universe, I am air and I can blow off all the objects of the earth.’ Then,  the Lord pointed out his attention towards the same straw and asked him to blow it off. The wind-god applied his whole strength, but he could not budge it an inch even and at last being ashamed he returned to the gods. When the gods asked him—‘Could you get any trace of this demi-god?’ Then, he also directly answered, ‘I could not know at all who is this demi-god?’ </p>
<p class="Text">At last, the gods said to Indra—‘Lord! You, yourself, should find out who is this demi-god?’ ‘All right!; saying so Indra, no doubt, did go near him, but that demi-god had disappeared before he reached there. ‘In the last, watching the curiosity and firm devotion, apparantly Uma,—The embodiment of spiritual knowledge, Goddess Parvati appeared there in the sky. Indra asked her—‘Mother! Who was this demi-god?’ The goddess Uma said—‘That demi-god was the well-known Brahma’ Himself. It is His grace and sportive power that the demons were defeated; you, all the gods were but instrumental. It is your sheer ignorance and false pride to consider your victory on the demons as the result of your own vigour and courage. It is your false notion. To remove off your this very delusive annihilating illusion and false pride, the Lord has curbed your arrogance having appeared in the disguised form of a demi-god and creating curiosity in you. Now, understand it very well that In this universe whatever the valour of the great vigourous, the vitality of a powerful, the knowledge of the learned, the austerity of an austere, the lustre of the glorious, the radiance of  radiants is only a little part of the powers of different frolicsome activities of the frolicsome great Supreme Lord and is the centre of all the up and downs in the universe there exists the control of verily the Supreme Brahma—the embodiment of existence, Bliss and Consciousness. The egotism of their power and strength of the beings is false and illusionary. </p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">Indra’s eyes opened with the words of the goddess Uma. He felt ashamed of his ‘mistake’ having come back. He made all the gods glad telling them the entire mystery.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">At the door of Yama</p>
<p class="Text">‘It is a boomerang on the donor to donate a cow not worthgiving is gifted in charity; by this thought endowed with the virtuous wisdom, the sage’s son Nachiketa became impatient. His father Vajashravas—Vajashrava’s son, Uddalaka during the performance of great Yagya, naming Viswajit, donated his entire property in charity, but in the gifted presents to the priests of the Yagya, seers and other members, good as well as useless cows, also, were being donated. For the protection of his father’s welfare, in spite of his anticipation of some harm to himself, Nachiketa said humbly—‘Father! I am also your wealth, whom are you donating me?”</p>
<p class="Text">Uddalak gave no answer. Nachiketa asked the same question again, but Uddalak avoided it.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Father! Whom are you donating me?’ On the third time query, Uddalak lost his temper. Being irritated he said—‘I offer you to the death.’</p>
<p class="Text">Nachiketa did not deviate. He was ready already to suffer the result. With folded hands he said to his father—‘Father! This body is mortal, but moral conduct is at the top. To keep on your words true, permit me to go the Yama’s world.’</p>
<p class="Text">The sage got scared; but seeing his son’s devotion to truthfulness he permitted him to go to Yama’s land. Nachiketa saluted his father’s feet with devotion and set out for the Yama’s land.</p>
<p class="Text">Yama happened to tremble. He was well-acquainted with the evil result of not receiving the Brahman guest warmly and he was the effulgent son of the sage like fire, who had passed three nights without taking food and water at his door in his absence. Yama rushed up with the golden pitcher full of water in his own hands. Offering the water to wash his feet and hands with due honour he said very humbly—‘Respectable the Brahman’s son! In spite of being a revered guest, you passed three nights without food at my gate, it is my blunder. Demand three boons for each and every night.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘O the God of death! May my father be cool–minded, pleased, and free from anger when I go back there from you, may he talk to me affectionately having recognised me! The father–devotee child demanded this first boon. ‘Be it so!’ Yamaraj said.</p>
<p class="Text">‘O the death God! You know the resourceful fire of the paradise very well knowing the same, the people attain the immortality and the status of god in the heaven, I want to know it. This is my second boon—demand.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘This fire is the means of the attainment of the heaven. Yamaraj was highly pleased to get Nachiketa, even being young, he was sharp-minded and real inquistive. He said—‘This is the root cause of the stability of Cosmic universe, consider it existing in the cavern of the wisdom of learned scholars!’</p>
<p class="Text">Explaining the method of the constructions of Yagya Pandal and fire selection as how many bricks and what kind of bricks are required, how then should be placed and what requisities are required, being fully satisfied Yama explained about the second boon—‘The fire about which I told you will be famous in your name and take this variegated jewelled garland also.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘O Nachiketa! Now demand the third boon. Having explained, very well, the fire as the means of attainment of heaven, Yama said.</p>
<p class="Text">‘You are the god of death,’ with reverence Nachiketa said—‘The soul exists or not, cannot be determined by direct vision or guess. So I want to have self-knowledge from you. Kindly, unfold it.’</p>
<p class="Text">Yama hesitated. The self-knowledge is not a common knowledge. He told Nachiketa the difficulty of that knowledge, but he could not swerve him from his determination. Yama used the world-fascinating arm, gave the temptation of the beautiful fairies unavailable even to gods, the sensuous enjoyments to be enjoyed for a long time, and other fascinating worldly objects but the sage boy did not deviate from the boon of self-knowledge.</p>
<p class="Text">‘You are very fortunate.’ Yama admired Nachiketa’s dispassion and condemning the materialistic worldly attachments, told him that a person endowed with wisdom, detachment and discrimination, is entitled of getting this self-knowledge. Giving the full explanation of the good and the pleasant, worldly pleasure, knowledge—ignorance, Yama said—‘You want the good and you are entitled of knowledge.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘O Lord! If you are really pleased with me, you must be kind enough to explain that Supreme Brahma whose vision is before your eye-sight and who is transcendental to all varied worldly objects.’</p>
<p class="Text">Soul is animate. Soul is free from birth and death. Neither it is born from any one nor has given birth to anyone. ‘Seeing the inquisition of Nachiketa Yama had got very much pleased. He explained the nature of soul in detail—‘Soul is unbegotten, constant, eternal, it lingers even after the body is perished. It is subtler than the subtlest and greater than the greatest. In spite of existing in the mortal body it is without body, even remaining impregnated in all the unstable objects it is ever stable. It is impregnated in each and every particle. The entire system of creation works on its command. Being afraid of it the fire burns, the sun is blazed with its fear, and Indra, wind, and the fifth death are active due to its fear. The persons who come to know its nature, before their death, are liberated. Having overcome the afflictions like grief etc., they attain the eternal bliss.”</p>
<p class="Text">Yama said—‘That is attained neither by the discoursing on Vedas, nor by the sharp talent and, not by hearing the Shastras the whole life.</p>
<p class="Text">‘It is attained by only those who have got rid of all  the sensuousness, who have made themselves free from all the desires and whose pure innerself has become beyond the approach of even the shadow of gloominess and who become quite restless to attain it.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">After getting the self realisation, when Uddalak’s son, Nachiketa came back to his father’s hermitage, he found that the group of aged austeres were standing there to welcome him.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">Dharma in distress</p>
<p class="Text">Once, in Kuru state it occured a very big rain of hail (stone). It destroyed all the growing plants and a fierce famine fell upon. The subjects affected by famine began to run away leaving the country in the scarcity of food. A Brahman named Ushasti also lived there; His wife’s name was Atiki she yet was a girl. That Brahman, named Ushasti, too, began to wander about with her, leaving the country. Wandering about here and there both of them reached a village of elephant-keepers. Because of hunger Ushasti was on the verge of death at that moment. He saw that an elephant-keeper was eating boiled black gram. He went to him and asked for some black gram. The elephant-keeper said—‘I have no extra black gram except this much black gram in the pot which I am eating, ‘then where from should I give you? ‘Ushasti said—‘Give me a little of this.’ At then, the elephant-keeper gave some of the black gram to Ushasti and keeping the water before him said—‘Take this black gram, eat it and then drink the water; Ushasti said ‘No, I cannot drink this water because, I will be guilty of drinking leftover water.’ The elephant-keeper was much surprised at this. He asked—‘These black grams are also our leftover; then, what is there in the water that will cause you the flaw of using the leavings?</p>
<p class="Text">Ushasti said—‘Brother! If I had not eaten this black gram, I would have died. For the protection of life, according to the injunctions of the scriptures in distress, I am eating this black gram. But the water will be available anywhere else. Like black gram, if I drink the left-over water also, then it will be violation of the injunction of the scriptures. So, brother! I will not drink your water.’ Saying so, Ushasti ate some of the black grams himself and gave the rest to his wife. The Brahman lady had already got something to eat; so, she did not eat that black grams and kept it with her.</p>
<p class="Text">Next day, in the morning, Ushasti said to his wife after daily routine—what should I do, if I could get even a little food to eat from somewhere, I would earn some money worth of livelihood; because it is not far away where a king is performing ‘Yagya; he will select me as a priest in the auspicious performance.’</p>
<p class="Text">Then, his wife Atiki said—‘I am in the possession of the remaining black grams of the yesterday; take it, go to the Yagya place, after eating this.’ Being quite feeble due to appetite, Ushasti ate this and he went away to the king’s Yagya. Reaching there sat near the Udgatas of the Samvedas and finding their mistakes said—‘O the chanters! You know—who are the gods of whom you are chanting eulogy keep it in mind that your head will fall down? if you eulogise the deity without knowing them; He said in the same way to the Pratihartas also. Just hearing this all the priests stopped their performance and sat down.</p>
<p class="Text">Seeing this condition of his priests, the king asked Ushasti—‘Lord! Who are you? I want to know your identity.’ He replied “O King I am Ushasti son of Chakra”. The king asked, Are you Ushasti, isn’t it? I have heard so much of your virtuous characteristics. So, I had made your search to the best of my reach; you could not be traced out; so, I had to select other priests. I am fortunate enough that you, yourself visited here. Kindly, oblige me to perform all the performances of the Yagya.”</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">Ushasti said—‘Very well! but these priests will not be dismissed, they should perform their jobs according to my instruction and the gifts should also be given to me the same what is given to them. Neither I want to make them out nor I want to humiliate them by accepting more reverential gift than they. They will go on working under my guidance.’ After then, all the priests got themselves engaged in the performance of the Yagya-activities going near Ushasti and after knowing the deities to whom the hymns are addressed and the Yagya was performed in the prescribed way. <span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">Knowledge of Brahma through Cow-service</p>
<p class="Text">There was a Brahman lady of good moral conduct. Her name was Jabala. She had a son naming Satyakam. When he grew up to be worthy of study and getting knowledge, he began to say to his mother—‘Mother! I want to stay in Gurukul; when the teacher asks me my name, lineage, what lineage will I tell him?’ At this query she said—‘Son! I could not get any opportunity to ask your father about your lineage; because I used to remain busy in the guests reception always those days. So, if the preceptor asks you about your clan etc., you will tell him that you are Jabala’s son Satyakam, it is enough.’ With his mother’s permission, Satyakam went to Haridrumat Gautam sage and said—‘I have come here to serve your honour as a celibate.’ The Preceptor asked—‘Dear child! What is your lineage?’</p>
<p class="Text">Satyakam said—‘Lord! I don’t know what is my lineage. I am Satyakam, Jabala’s son, well! I know this much only in this concern.’ Then, Gautam said, ‘My child! except a Brahman none else can speak so frankly the truth in such a smooth manner. Go, bring some sacrificial firewood. I will perform the ceremony of your initiating the sacred thread.’</p>
<p class="Text">After Satyakam’s ceremony of investing the sacred thread, bringing four hundred feeble cows before him Gautam said—‘Take them to the forest to graze them. You will not bring them back till they become one thousand in number.’ He said—‘Lord! I will not come back until their number increases to one thousand.’</p>
<p class="Text">Satyakam went to the forest with the cows. Building a hut, he began to live there in it and began to tend them. Slowly and slowly, the number of the cows increased to one thousand. Then, one day, a bull, coming to Satyakam, said—‘Dear child! now, our number has reached one thousand, now, cause us to drive to the Guru’s place of residence. Besides this, I will also tell you about one foot of Brahman . That ‘Brahma’ is ‘Prakasavan—‘the shining’, its second foot will be explained to you by fire.</p>
<p class="Text">Driving away the cows Satyakam moved ahead. At the sun-set, he dropped the cows, making them drink water, he managed to halt there in the night. Then after bringing the wood he lit fire. The fire said—‘Satyakam! I tell you the second foot of ‘Brahman’; He is ‘Anantavan’ ‘the unlimited,’ the next sermon will be given to you by swan.’</p>
<p class="Text">The next day it was dusk Satyakam again halted on the side of a pleasant pool and he managed for the cows to halt at the night there. In the meantime a swan came flying from the above and sitting near Satyakam said—‘Satyakam!’ Satyakam said—‘Lord! what is your instruction?’ The swan said—‘I am delivering you the Jyotisman sermon of the third foot of ‘Brahma’; He is luminous; the sermon of the fourth foot will be given to you by a diver-bird cock.’</p>
<p class="Text">The next day in the evening, Satyakam managed for the cowst to halt under a banyan tree. Hardly, he was sitting after lighting fire than a diver-bird coming there called—‘Dear! I deliver you the fourth foot of Brahman, He is ‘Ayatanavan’ ‘the support’.</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, after getting the knowledge of the existence, Bliss and intelligence solidified, Supreme Lord, through those gods, Satyakam reached the place of his preceptor—Gautam. Seeing his glowing splenderous face full of lustre and free from worry, said—‘My child! You look to be like the knower of ‘Supreme Brahma.’ Satyakam said—‘Lord! I have got the knowledge from those who are apart from the human beings. I have heard that the knowledge, learned from the preceptor like you, is the best. So, teach me everything.’ The preceptor became highly pleased and said—‘My child! Whatever you have attained, that is ‘Brahma’ Tattva and he taught him about Brahman everything did not leaving anything.’</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-7">The carter’s knowledge</p>
<p class="Text">There was a great charitable king, his name was Janashruti. He had got rest-houses built everywhere with the motive that people all over would eat his food and he had opened free of cost public hotels. One day, some swans happened to sit on the roof of his palace flying over. The last swan of them said to the swan ahead—‘Well! O Bhallaksh! O Bhallaksh! Just see, the brightness of Janashruti has spread all over: the sky like daylight lest you should touch it, it might burn you to ashes.’</p>
<p class="Text">At this, the next swan said—‘This poor king is a puny fellow, it seems that you don’t know Raikva with the cart,. That is why his lustre, in spite of being too, inferior to his lustre, is being praised by you in this way. At this, the last swan asked—‘Brother! Who is Raikva with the cart?’ the swan ahead, said—‘Brother! How to praise the glory of that Raikva! Whenever the dice of the gambler is cast, he turns the tables, he wins others (his rival), in the same way, whatever the auspicious deeds are done by the subjects, its fruit is attained by Raikva. Really, whosoever succeeds to know the knowledge what the spiritual knowledge is known to Raikva he gets its fruit accordingly.’</p>
<p class="Text">Janashruti was listening to this conversation very attentively. The next morning just getting up calling his attendants he said—‘Approaching Raikva with the cart, speak to him that the king desires to meet you.’ According to the king’s order, the search was made  everywhere, but Raikva could not be traced out. The king thought over that it was the cities and villages only where the attendants searched for Raikva and then he said to them—‘Now, again you should start your search of his stay in the worth living places of the knowers of Brahma in forests, and on the river banks etc., and the solitary places.’</p>
<p class="Text">At last, in a solitary place sitting beneath a cart, itching his body anyhow he was got available. The royal persons asked—‘Lord! Is it you, the carter Raikva?’ The saint said—‘Yes, it is I.’ </p>
<p class="Text">After getting the information, the king Janashruti went to him with six hundred cows, one garland, and a chariot driven by the she-mules and said—‘Lord! I have brought all this to offer you kindly, accept it and tell me about the God whom you worship.’ Hearing the king’s words the saint said—‘O Shudra! Keep these cows, this garland and the chariot with you, yourself.’ Hearing this the king came back and again the second time, he went to the saint with one thousand cows, one garland, one chariot and her daughter and began to pray with folded hands—‘Lord! Accept this, and now Sir, teach me about your adorable deity.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">The saint said—‘O Shudra! Did you again bring these objects for me? Can the spiritual knowledge be bought with all these objects? The king sat silently. Then, finding the king devoid of the arrogance of the wealth etc., he delivered him the sermon of the spiritual knowledge. The holy area where Raikva sage lived began to be known as ‘Raikva Parna’.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-8">Three sermons from a single letter</p>
<p class="Text">Once, gods, human beings and demons—all the three approached Lord Brahma to study the knowledge of fundamental truth as celibates. After some time passed, when they expressed their desire to get the returning–sermons from him. First of all the gods said—‘Lord! deliver us your precepts.’ Prajapati uttered only a single letter—‘Da’: the gods said—‘We understood.’ In our paradise there is the excess of enjoyments. Being badly attached with them, we fall down from the heaven at last so, you are advising us to restrain the sense organs as ‘da’ means ‘subjugation’. Then Brahma said—‘Exactly right you understood.’</p>
<p class="Text">Then, the human beings said to, Brahma—‘Now, deliver us your sermon.’ The Brahma said to them also—‘Da’ the same single letter only. The human beings said—‘Yes, we understood, You have advised us for ‘charity’; because, we pass our whole life in the avarice of amassing the worldly objects, so our welfare lies in the charity.’ Then, the Brahma said—‘Right, this is the purpose of my version.’</p>
<p class="Text">Now, the demons approached him and prayed for the precept. The Prajapati delivered them also the precept of the same ‘Da’ letter. The demons thought, ‘we are violent’ by nature; Anger and violence is our routine job.’ Therefore, undoubtedly ‘Daya’ kindness is the only way for our welfare. Prajapati has given us the same teaching, because by kindness having given up the evil doings, we can get rid of the sins by this way.’ Thinking on the line when they became ready to depart, The Prajapati asked them—‘Did you understand?’ The demons said—‘Lord! You have advised us to be kind to all the creatures.’ The Prajapati said—‘All right! you understood.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">Even today, the echo of discipline is heard to us daily in the form of ‘da, da, da’, resounding in the sound of the clouds. In other words—O the sensuous Gods! Restrain your sense organs, O the hoarder’s human being give food materials in charity and O the indignation dominated demons! Show mercy to all the creatures. We should live all in life  three things—discipline, charity and compassion from this story.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-9">Maiden Keshini’s sacrifice and prahlada’s justice</p>
<p class="Text">There was a world beauty endowed with all the merits, girl of Panchal province. She wanted to marry with any virtuous person born in a par excellent family. She was well acquainted with the fact that the virtuous family has the vital role among the general merits of a bridegroom worthy of marriage. This was the reason that she gave the first priority to the virtuous family among all the comforts of a married life and made up her mind to marry with Sudhanva, the austere’s lad.</p>
<p class="Text">Proposals of several princes came to Keshini, desirous to marry her; but she turned down all the proposals, One day, the Emperor Prahlada’s prince. Virochan also expressed his desire of his marriage to her. Though, the worldly gains of her marriage with the prince, Virochana were not concealed to her, yet, she submitted her response in the following words.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Prince! I have made up my mind to marry with sage Angira’s son—Sudhanva, but this decision has been taken only because of his excellent family race. Now, you, yourself should tell me whether a Brahman family is superior or demon family; if the Brahman is superior, then why should I not marry with Sudhanva?’</p>
<p class="Text">On this version Virochan expounded the superiority of demon dynasty. In reply, Keshini said—‘All right! If this is your opinion, then come tomorrow in the morning at my dwelling place before the suitors assembly is held; Sudhanva will also be present there, you can have the mutual discussion with him on this subject matter.’</p>
<p class="Text">In the morning both the princes reached Keshini’s dwelling place, but unpleasing happening occured. It was so as Virochan reached there first and Sudhanva later on. So, Virochana said to him—‘Sudhanva! You just take the seat on the throne beside me’. But Sudhanva refused to sit beside him and said—‘The persons of equal virtues and merit only can sit together side by side.</p>
<p class="Text">Father-son, two Brahmans, two Kshatriyas, two old persons and two outcaste persons can sit together side by side. From this point of view I cannot sit beside you; because you are not equal to me. Probably, it is not known to you that when I used to go to your father’s assembly having seated me on a higher place, he, himself, used to sit on the lower seat than mine and attended me as well as served me.</p>
<p class="Text">On this issue the dispute between the both started; but they could not agree to be of the same opinion. In such a situation they considered it appropriate to get it decided by any judge. But on the Virochana’s this statement that he could not accept any god and Brahman as a judge; Sudhanva chose king Prahlad the father of Virochan as judge but there was made a condition that the defeated person would surrender his life in the feet of the victorious one.</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, both the princes, eagerly desirous for justice went to Prahlad, his majesty and explained the entire narrative before him. Even they told him about the condition of the life surrender and the both prayed to him for the justice.</p>
<p class="Text">Prahlad for a moment first hesitated being overwhelmed by the son’s affection; but he discussed with Sudhanva about the morality and immorality and truth and untruth Sudhanwa explained. As the woman living with co-wife, the gambler defeated in the gambling, and the man with his  inflicted body due to carrying over load pass through the miserable condition in the night, One who gives the false judgement suffers the same pain.</p>
<p class="Text">One who gives false jundgement being a prisoner in the city of the king suffers the pangs of hunger on the out side gate and faces many enemies. For an ordinary animal five generations, for a cow, ten generations, for a horse one hundred generations, for a human being his one thousand generation fall into hell if they give a partial judgement. One who speaks untruth for gold  causes all his past and future generations to fall into hells. For wife if one tells a lie, he faces total destruction. Therefore, you should never give a partial judgement in the affection of your son.</p>
<p class="Text">In the last, giving more importance to the truth and family repute in the comparision to his son’s attachment, addressing Virochan, Prahlad said—‘Virochan! Angira is superior to me, Sudhanva’s mother is superior to your mother and Sudhanva is superior to you. Sudhanwa won you, now, Sudhanva is master of your life.’ Being pleased with this decision of Prahlad, Sudhanva said kind-heartedly ‘Prahladaji! Even being overpowered by your son’s attachment, you didn’t speak the untruth, contrary to it you announced a just judgement; so, I hereby surrender you this unobtainable your son to you; but he should wash my feet before Keshini. This is the simple atonement of this event.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">It is here, noteworthy that by making Sudhanva, her life partner and moral supporter, Keshini, not only, gave priority to a virtuous family born personality in the comparison to the materialistic enjoyments and comforts, but by her life, she presented an universaly praiseworthy ideal example of Hindu culture before the world.<span></span></p>

<p class="Sub-Heading">(Sacrifice of Mayuradhwaj)</p>
<p class="Text">The king of Ratnapur, the majesty Mayuradhwaj’s ‘Ashwamedhiya horse’ had been left free in the same days when his majesty Yudhishthir’s Ashwamedh Yagya—was going on. On the one side, Shri Krishna, Arjun were there in the protection of Pandava’s horse, and on the other side it was Tamradhwaj there. In Manipur both of them came to encounter with each other. In the encounter, having defeated Arjun, Tamradhvaj took away both the horses to his father, but it created a great sadness in the majesty Mayuradhwaj’s mind instead of happiness. It was because he was a unique devotee of Krishna.</p>
<p class="Text">On the other side, when Arjun came to consciousness, he became restless excessively. The Lord, under His devotee’s spell, disguised Himself in the form of a Brahman and Arjun as His pupil. They reached the king. The king Mayuradhwaj got astonished with their lustre. He was just about to pay obeisance to them that they blessed him earlier saying ‘Swasti’ (good to you). The king reproached their action. Then, he asked them their purpose of visit. Shri Krishna said—‘The lion has caught my son. I prayed to him again and again to leave my only son anyhow. I went to the extent that he should accept me in his place, but he did not pay any heed to my request. After my earnest prayer, he has agreed to return my son in case of the king, Mayuradhwaj may give the right part of his body, getting it to sawed by his wife and son gladly.’</p>
<p class="Text">The King accepted the proposal of Krishna disguised as Brahman. His queen, because of being his half partner of the body, desired to offer her own body, but the Brahman told him the requirement the right portion of his body. The son, telling himself his father’s own, expressed desire to give his own body. Personality, but the Brahman rejected this proposal also. At last, between the two pillars, muttering divine names ‘Govind, Madhav, Mukund’ etc., the King sat down. The queen and Tamradhvaj began to tear his body with the saw. When the body of Mayuradhwaj was being sawn, the drops of tears came out of his left eyes. Then on this, the Brahman said—‘I don’t accept any object offered with sorrowful mind.’ Mayuradhwaj said—‘The tears of my eyes don’t mean that I am feeling afflicted of the cutting of my body. Left portion of my body is worried and agonised as—both of us were born together and grew together, but it is my misfortune that I could not serve the Brahman’s purpose along with the right portion.’</p>
<p class="Text">Now, the Lord revealed Himself. Bearing the conch shell, wearing yellow garment and of dark blue colour, wheel and mace, the divine lustrous Shyamasundar as soon as he touched the King’s body with His nectarial Lotus-hands, it became more handsome, young and stronger than that of earlier. All of them began to pray the Lord falling down at His feet. The Lord asked them to demand a boon. The King made the prayer—‘to bless him with true love in its feet and in future such hard test should nor be taken.’ In the end, having stayed there as guests for three days, Shri Krishna and Arjun moved ahead with the horse.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-11">It is you the same</p>
<p class="Text">Arun’s son, Uddalaka had a son, named Shwetketu. One day, his father said to him—‘Shwetaketu! Fulfil your duty of a student life as a celibate in the Gurukul; because, in the history of our family there was none free from self-study.’</p>
<p class="Text">Thenafter, Shwetketu went to the Guru’s residence and there, having got his sacred-thread-ceremony performed, went on studying for twelve years. When he returned home after completing his study, he became proud of his knowledge. Seeing his this condition, the father asked him—‘Saumya! You are so proud of your knowledge, but have you got the knowledge of one single element that provides the knowledge of all the subjects? If you know it, if you hear this, you hear all the worth hearing subjects, if you ponder over it, all the objects worth giving thoughts are known to you?’</p>
<p class="Text">Shwetketu said—‘I don’t have knowledge of any such element. How can there be the possibility of such a knowledge even?’ The father said—‘Just as by knowing the clay, one comes to know the earthen pots as well as all the objects made of earth, or just by knowing the single gold, one comes to know all the golden bangles, the golden crowns, pendants and pots etc., all the objects of gold, or by knowing the iron, one comes to know all the items made of iron from nailcutter to the entire items in which the basic element is only iron. The pointed hook of a saw, spade, nailcutter, sword etc., are only verbal deformations the iron is the reality.’</p>
<p class="Text">Then, Shwetketu said—‘Father! My reverent preceptor did not give any such kind of knowledge. Now, it is you to give me the knowledge of that entity, really my knowledge is quite shallow and negligible.’ Thus, the father said—‘In the beginning it was the only ‘Sat’, ‘existence’ without a second. It thought to be expanded in so many numbers. It created fire. From fire to water, from water to grains, and further it created all other objects. If there is anywhere any red object, that is the part of fire, any white object is the part of water and any dark object is the part of grain. So, in this universe, the fire, water and grain are the Tattvas. By the knowledge of all the three, all the objects of the universe come to our knowledge or by knowing the root element of all the three, nothing remains unknown. </p>
<p class="Text">On the insistence of Shwetketu, Aruni, precepted him again that fundamental truth by quoting the examples of curd, honey, river and trees and further said that on account of being created from that eternal existence or our ownself all these objects are the same existence or the self that soul you are. Thus, Shwetaketu got the true knowledge that after knowing a single supreme spiritual truth, pondering over and through devotional worship, the entire knowledge and worship is assimilated.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-12">He told truth</p>
<p class="Text">Only a few days had passed for the great sage Ghor’s sons Kanva and Pragath had returned from Gurukul. Both the sage’s sons had the heartiest affection with each other. Pragath considered his elder brother Kanva as his father, his wife had a great affectionate love for Pragath. Due to his presence, the atmosphere of the hermitage had become very pious and pure. The smokes rising up constantly from the Yagyas-fire had created the atmosphere of the hermitage Sattvik.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, complete peace was prevaling in the hermitage. Kanva had gone in the interior of the forest to bring the fire-wood. His saintly wife was sitting just in front of the altar. At a little distance the sage boy, Pragath was chanting the Samaveda-song. The eyes of the sage-boy began to feel drowsy due to the cool and pleasant breezing and he went asleep taking rest by keeping his head in the laps of the sage-wife. The sage-wife was absorbed in some thought.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Who is he, how did this mean dare to take rest in your laps? Just placing the fire-wood, Kanva’s eyes grew red; the sage-wife got scared to see his excessively furious face.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Lord! She was just going to speak something, that Kanva kicked on the back of Pragath with the leg. The sage boys eyes opened. He stood up. He saluted the sage Kanva.</p>
<p class="Text">‘The gate of this hermitage is closed for you from today, Pragath!’ The sage Kanva’s voice was enraged with the fierce blaze of anger, the hair roots of his body had shivered. ‘Brother! You are just like my father, and she is apparantly my mother.’ Having offered his reverential affection to her feet, Pragath removed Kanva’s suspicion. Kanva was growing normal by and by, but his suspicious mind was yet restless.</p>
<p class="Text">‘The sage prince, Pragath had truly said, lord! Since I have stepped into the hermitage, I have always brought  him up like my son. The elder brother’s wife always treats—her husband’s younger brother as her son, you know this fact very well. This is the ideal of holy India.’ The sage-wife pacified the sage Kanva’s rage.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Brother Pragath! It is merely the fault of my eyes, I committed a great sin it was a unnecessary doubt created in my mind.’ The sage, Kanva’s modesty got awakened, embracing Pragath, he showed his affection to Pragatha. Pragath applied his feet-dust to his head.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Not brother, the sage boy Pragath is my son. The sage boy has got the right of my full affection.’ The sage wife got melted Kanva’s heart out of affection.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Alright, Pragath is my son. From today both of us are his father and mother.’ Kanva smelt the Pragath’s head. A new life came to the hermitage, combining with the glory of truthful speech, the spotless heart’s delightfulness and the simplicity of heart.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-13">Fruit of adoration</p>
<p class="Text">The seer Atri’s hermitage was the holy symbol of his austerity. It was the constant rain fall of matchless peace, and divine bliss all around the hermitage. The winsomeness was pervading in each and every particle of the hermitage by the chanting of Veda-spells and rising smokes of the Yagyas. In spite of remaining in delightful state of mind the great sage looked sad always. The sole cause of his sadness was Apala. She was his affectionate daughter. Her physical feature had been deformed on account of skin-disease. The splendour of her body had faded due to spots of white leper. The husband had turned her out of the hermitage only because of this disease, she was passing her time for a long time residing in her father’s hermitage. Day by day, her youth was perishing; Only due to the exclusive affection of sage Atri her life was continuing. To get rid of her skin disease, Apala took the shelter of Indra. She engaged herself in the reverential worship with keen devotion. She knew it that Indra could be pleased with the extract of Soma leaves. It was her heartiest desire that Indra should accept the Soma juice, giving his apparant vision. </p>
<p class="Text">‘What a clear moonlight is! The moon appears as if it is taken bath in the ocean of nectar just now or the seers have coronated it with the milk of the cow fulfilling all his desires. Having taken bath in the pond, Apala took the earthen pot full of holy water on her shoulders, she was in delightful mood,—it was the first watch of night—she was going on towards the hermitage.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Undoubtedly, Indra is highly pleased with me today, I have got my entire. On the way, she saw the Soma-creeper, just clinging with her teeth to test, she accomplished the essence of Soma juice, the drops of the Soma essence fell down on the earth from her teeth. She got immense joy to get the Soma creepers. Her penance manifested in the form of Soma creepers. Apala got the vision of a divine person on the way.</p>
<p class="Text">I wander about from house to house to get the drink of Soma juice. Because of your action of taking out the Soma essence, I, myself, came here being attracted.’ Coming down from his divine golden chariot, Indra gave his introduction, The gods king enjoyed the Soma juice He initiated to demand boon in the contented voice. </p>
<p class="Text">‘Your delightfulness is the fulfilment of my desires. If the vision of the deity is attained, what is greater fortune than this?’ The Sage’s daughter eulogised Indra. </p>
<p class="Text">‘True devotion never goes waste, goddess!’ Holding Apala, Indra took out her three times through the hole of his chariot. By His grace she was cured of her skin disease, she brightened like the brightening of the sun. The sage Atri blessed his daughter. Apala went to her husband’s abode. As a result of adoration her married life became pleasant.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-14">Ability-test</p>
<p class="Text">The entire sky was overcast by the flames of smoke of Yagya; a special effulgence manifested in its spotless, and clean bluish tint. His majesty Rathviti Darbhya’s capital became a great holy place by the presence of the Yagya-performer-sages. He was sitting on the seat near the altar with his queen and charming daughter.</p>
<p class="Text">‘How modest and well-behaved charming daughter she is!’ Atri’s son, sage Archanana thought to himself while pouring oblation in the Yagya-pit with the Vedic-spells. The new fresh splendour began to undulate in his milky-white beard. He cast his glance at his son Shwavashva, well versed in Vedas and Veda’s branches; it was blossoming out youthfulness in the sage. Prince, his eyes were combining the feelings with purity and simplicity and there were faith devotion in his heart. ‘I beg for your daughter as my daughter-in-law, your majesty!’ The meaningful sober speech amazed the sages-group. The public got astonished. ‘It is your great obligation; what will be better than this for my daughter’s good luck that she will dwell there in the seer Atri’s hermitage?’ His majesty Rathviti expressed reverential love to Archnana. The royal maiden stared with down eyes towards the sage prince Shyavashva as if she were expressing her eagerness and her acceptance to bow down her head on his feet.</p>
<p class="Text">‘But my family belongs to the royal dynasty, we can hand over our daughter only to the sage who is the seer of Mantras.’ The royal queen rejected the proposal.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Father! To prove the worth of my family, I will become the seer of Mantras; For me, the royal daughter is not so important as the status of a seer. This is main and that is subsidiary. Shyavashva took the feet-dust of Archanana. It was his solemn oath that he would not return the hermitage without acquiring the seer status. Arcnanana went away. Shyavashya used to wandering about as a celibate begging alms.</p>
<p class="Text">On the way, his majesty Videdashva’s son—Tarant and royal queen, Shashiyasi and Tarant’s younger brother—Purumirh received and welcomed the sage prince warmly in his capital and worshipped Shyavashva by donating him so many cows and unlimited wealth.</p>
<p class="Text">But still I did not even see a glance of Mantras.’ Shyavashva could not go to the hermitage. He was wandering about in the forest. In the mean time, being pleased with his devotion to truthfulness the Lord Rudra's sons Rudragans manifested their visions to him. By their grace, he acquired the status of a seer of Mantras. The Marudgans gave him ‘Rukmamala’ also.</p>
<p class="Text">‘It is a matter of great luck for us that my daughter is going to be the life-partner of your grandson.’ On coming down from the chariot in the hermitage, the king, Rathviti and the royal queen adored the sage-Atri and offered beverage of honey.’</p>
<p class="Text">Shyavashva and his wife made obeisance to the seer Atri. They got the blessings of Archanana. Shyavasya got the status of Vedas-father and the royal lass got the status of Vedas-mother. His majesty-Rathviti set out for penance on the Gomati-bank in the Himalaya.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-15">Desire of the selfless—Twenty-one older generations liberated</p>
<p class="Text">When Hiranyakashyapa, himself, was bent upon to kill Prahlad and in the furry of anger gave a first blow on the front pillar, Lord Nrisimha Bhagawan came out having torn out the same pillar and holding Hiranyakashyapa under his paws ripped open his stomach with his nails. The demon king’s attendants ran away to save their lives. Wearing the garland of Hiranyakashyapa’s intestine in his neck, licking with the tongue again and again roaring fiercely the fiery-eyed Lord Nrisimha Bhagwan sat on the demon king’s throne. His fierce wrath did not cool down.</p>
<p class="Text">All the gods accompanying Lord Shankar and Brahmaji, came to visit there. All made prayers separately. But all this proved in vain. Brahmaji got afraid that if Lord’s wrath was not pacified, God knows what a calamity would fall upon. He sent goddess Lakshmi; but Lakshmiji, too, turned back just seeing that fiercely dreadful appearance and said ‘I have never seen such dreadful countenance of my deity. I cannot go near Him.’</p>
<p class="Text">At last, Brahmaji said to Prahlad—‘Son! It is you to go near the Lord and cool down His wrath.’</p>
<p class="Text">Prahlad didn’t know at all, what is fear. He went to the Lord in the normal way, saluating Him lay down on the ground. The Lord Nrisimh, Himself, lifted him and seated him in his lap and began to lick his head with His tongue affectionately. The Lord of all the three universes said—‘Son! Pardon me. It took a long time in reaching here, so you had to suffer long the intense sufferings.’</p>
<p class="Text">Coming down from His lap, with folded hands Prahlad made prayer in the choking voice. The Lord said—‘Prahlad! I am pleased. Demand any boon whatever you desire.’</p>
<p class="Text">Prahlad said—‘Lord! What are you saying this? The attendant who attends his master with the expectation of getting something, is not really an attendant. You are a great liberal master of mine and I am a servant of Your feet. If you really, want to give me something, then, grant me only the boon that I should be ever free from any desire.’ God is omniscient. Saying ‘Be it so’, He said—‘Prahlad! Do demand something.’ Prahlad thought—‘If the Lord insists upon demanding some boon, certainly there lies some longing in my mind.’ At last, he prayed—‘Lord! My father reviled you excessively and has tortured your servant—myself. I want that he should be pious getting rid of this sin.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord Nrisimha laughed—‘Prahlada! The person whose son is the devotee like you, became automatically purified Twenty one generations of The clan, in which a devotee like you was born, got deliverance.’</p>
<p class="Text">It was the desire in Prahlad’s mind that even the person who tortured me may not meet an evil destiny. Really, unique is this longing! In a true God devotee how can remain any longing for himself?</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-16">A God-devotee—detached from body—ever-fearless </p>
<p class="Text">The saint Jad Bharat, kept himself always like an inanimate. He used to do any work of anybody if he asked him to do. In return he ate the food if offered by him. If he was not given by him anything, even then he used to remain pleased. He did not know as if what was being given to him in food and by whom it was being given. If anybody served him good food or dry bread, either the burnt rice or any other thing—O! He ate even the husk, the burnt scraping of rice like nectar. Either winter or summer, either rain or dry he remained wandering about naked body being carefree. He slept down anywhere on the earth, in the field or field-ridge like, wherever he felt drowsy. How can cleanliness and very appropriate behaviour be expected from such a person? He had worn the dirty sacred-thread round his waist, this was the symbol of his being a Brahman. After the death of his mother and father, it was not expected from his step-brothers that they would look after him and the idea of his own some possession could not at all be expected to occur in his divine mind. How could one imagine to get such a cheap labourer? Bharat did not at all know to disobey anyone.</p>
<p class="Text">The brothers felt their insult to see Jadbharat eating food given by others by doing their works; so they seated Jad Bharat on their own field to watch. No doubt, Jadbharat sat down to watch the field but it was not possible for him to differenciate his own farm and other’s farm and he had to do something extra more than sitting on the farm and watching it, how could it be known to him? Well! no doubt, he remained sitting on the farm certainly, Even in the dead of night in the darkness he remained sitting on the boundary of the field.</p>
<p class="Text">At the same time any outcaste chieftain of the Shudras wanted to sacrifice a human to the goddess Bhadrakali to fulfil his desire of getting a son. He had already got a human for the sacrifice; but exactly on the sacrifice night, that man fled away anyhow. The chieftain’s attendants moved away in the night to search out that man. They could not get that man but they found Jad Bharat watching the field. On account of being free from worry, Jad Bharat’s body was well built. The chieftain attendants found that the man was a good animal for sacrifice; well enough! They felt pleased! They got him. Having tied with ropes, they took him away to the goddess temple.</p>
<p class="Text">‘We will worship you.’ The chieftain also became pleased. By getting the fat man like Jadbharat, for the sacrifice, it became more convenient to them that he was such a man as was not opposing anything at all.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Well, now start worship!’ Everything was accepted to Jadabharat already from the very beginning.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Eat to your full appetite.’ The chieftain served him different kinds of dishes.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Well, I will eat.’ Bharat took the meal to his full satisfaction.</p>
<p class="Text">‘We will sacrifice you.’ Having adored him well, the chieftain, got Bharat stand in front of the goddess and he took the consecrated sword in his hand.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Well! Do the act of sacrifice,’ For Bharat it was also as if an act of worship or feeding. </p>
<p class="Text">The chieftain took up the sword to use; but even the goddess Bhadrakali does not possess the power to accept the sacrifice of a God-devotee having the self-realisation, before Her idol, for Her sake, the head of the devotee detached from body should be cut down-perhaps, her own existence would be in danger before this act. This is not a fancy, the goddess Bhadrakali, Herself, felt so. Her body was growing to be burnt to ashes. Guffawing in fierce wrath she appeared within half a moment and snatching away the sword from chieftain’s hands, she cut away the heads of the chieftain and his attendants in the twinkling of an eye in an single stroke. With her attendants she began to drink their blood in demonical frenzy, began to toss up their skull and began to dance.</p>
<p class="Text">For Jadbharat—the seer of Truth, detached and exalted soul for him his own death has no significance so for him Bhadrakali’s sport was also a curious spectacle. He went away from there silently.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-17">Devotion to God is the source of the entire mundane and ultramundane pleasures</p>
<p class="Text">It is not a recent episode, it is related to the  Satyayug of the beginning of creation. Manu had two sons—Priyavrat and Uttanapad. Uttanapad of them became the king. He had two queens but he was indifferent to his elder queen; Suniti. He was being overpowered by the love of the younger queen Suruci. One day, the elder queen’s son—Dhruva came in the sportive mood and sat in the lap of his father. The younger queen was present there. She could not tolerate it. She dragged him down from his lap and said in the rebuking tone—‘My son Uttam is entitled of this seat. If you are interested to sit there, by the devotion of God take birth from my womb.’</p>
<p class="Text">It was a very harsh treatment. It was being advised to a small child that ‘To sit in his father’s lap or on the throne you will have to die first and then to be born of step-mother’s womb.’ Even his father did not oppose the child’s insult. After all Dhruva was the Emperor’s prince; being inflicted by the insult, weeping he came from there, Where should a small child go? It was his mother only, his sole shelter.</p>
<p class="Text">Devoid of the husband’s love, Suniti heard the entire matter with a stony heart, Embracing the son to her breast she said with tears in her eyes—‘Son! Really you are unfortunate to be born of my womb; but whatever your step-mother has said for your insult, that is true. Really, if you want to sit on the king’s throne, like Uttama, then, worship reverently being devoted to the Lotus-eyed Shri Hari’s feet. Your grand father, Manu got the superior position only by that Lord’s devotion. It is the grace of Lord Hari only by that Lord Brahma is embelished with Brahmanhood. Devotion to God is the only means of attaining mundane and ultra-mundane pleasures.’</p>
<p class="Text">The child Dhruva as if got the way. It was not known to him what is God, how His devotion is achieved having saluted his mother he left his dwelling place and set out on the path to the forest all alone. Whether Dhruva knew anything or not but it remains all well-known to that Lord whom Dhruva had set out to attain. It is impossible that if anyone is bent upon whole-heartedly to attain Him and he does not get the way. Playing on the lyre the seer, Naradaji, the part and parcel of Lord Narayana’s mind, happened to appear before him on the way before Dhruva reached the forest. The child Dhruva saluted the sage. The seer put his hand on his head, fondled and having asked him everything, consoled him ‘Still you are a child. What is the meaning of honour or insult of a child. Go back home, I just, persuade your father. The path of penance and worship is very difficult. In due course of time you will grow up and then, you will be able to do all these things.’ Dhruva was a child but really, he was not an indeterminate. His determination was the determination of the Emperor’s prince. Very humbly, he prayed—‘I want such a place which has not been attained even to my forefathers, father and anyone. Yet, I have to attain such an abode only from Shri Hari. You have been kind enough to give me your vision, then tell me now the means of the fulfilment of my purpose also.’</p>
<p class="Text">The sage got pleased with his firm determination. He said—‘Your mother has directed you towards the right path. The best means is the worship of the Lord Narayan devotedly to attain the desired goal for anyone. The sage  advised him to mutter ‘Dvadashakshara Mantra’; commanded him to go to Mathura and worship the Lord.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">मायाकी गति छाया-जैसी धरै चह्यै तो धावै। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">पीठ फेरि जो त्याग चह्यै तो पाछे-पाछे आवै॥</p>
<p class="Text">Maya is just like shadow. When it is followed to chase it, it runs away ahead, but when it is given up and turned back, it comes on following. It was once, when his majesty Uttanapad remained silent on pushing Dhruva from his lap and now, it is he the same, who has become restless to get the news of Dhruva’s departure for the forest. He has forgotten the hunger, thirst and sleep even. If Dhruva comes back, he is ready to offer him everything, now he began to think this. Having sent Dhruva to Mathura, the seer Narada came to his majesty and consoled him. Dhruva reached Madhuvan. Having taken bath in the Yamuna river, according to the sermon of the seer, he engaged himself in the muttering of Mantras and in the meditation of the Lord. He made a rule to eat jujube tree fruit and wood apple only for a month on the three days interval. The next month, on every sixth day, he ate only the dry straw and the leaves fallen down from the tree in natural way. He passed the month. In the third month after the interval of nine days, he used to drink water once only, and in the fourth month, it became his vow only to take a breath only once on the interval of twelve days. The fourth month passed and Dhruva stopped even taking breath. Remaining stood on one leg without movement steadly that Kshatriya prince was absorbed in uninterrupted meditation. </p>
<p class="Text">There was a thundering of the clouds, the ligtening from the clouds striked, the hail-stone fell down, the lion’s roar and the snake’s hissing sound came to him—but all these illusions of the Maya did not affect him. Dhruva was a such a firm mountain that all the illusionary activities of Maya themselves perturbed even after dashing it hard. At last, disguised in the form of Suniti, Maya came crying—‘Son Dhruva! Return back! Return back son!’ But the closed eye-lids of Dhruva neither moved nor opened!</p>
<p class="Text">The gods were writhing. They abide in each and every body, due to Dhruva’s firm bereath control they were feeling suffocated and Dhruva had reached beyond their approach. Their any effort was incapable of shaking even Dhruva’s meditation. At last, all the gods, crying repeatedly for mercy by protecting them, reached the shelter of Lord Narayan. The Lord assured them and He, Himself, riding on Garuda, visited Madhuvan to bless Dhruva.</p>
<p class="Text">Absorbed in deep meditation, Dhruva was quite unaware that the Lord of all the three universes was standing before him. The Lord made His vision invisible from the heart of Dhruva. Being restless, Dhruva opened his eyes and remained staring being amazed. He joined his hands but what to speak; it is a keen desire to eulogize but the eulogy is not known. The omniscient Lord laughed, He made the child’s cheeks touched with the conch assimilating all the Vedas in it. The goddess of learning awakened, a speech opened, Dhruva began to eulogize.</p>
<p class="Text">After eulogy, the Lord said—‘Son Dhruva! That so far the abode which has not being attained to by your father and forefathers, even by others, belongs to you. At present, go back to your home. After your father embelish the hereditary throne; Having enjoyed the earthly pleasures, after the time is over, you will dwell in My divine world in this same body. All the seven great sages and all the groups of stars will take round of that world.’</p>
<p class="Text">Having attained the Lord’s grace, Dhruva came back. His majesty Uttanapad gifted the jewelled garland of his neck to the person who gave him news of his coming back. What to talk of the delightfulness of Suniti, she could hardly bless him even due to being overjoyed. The queen Suruchi who disdained Dhruva; on the salutation by Dhruva where she said in the overjoyed voice—‘Live long, my son!’ His majesty coronated him with the status of prince-regent just then, having brought Dhruva to the city with ceremonial function.</p>

<p class="Text">Generally, Lord Krishna’s queens start making a wry face with the name of Braja Gopis. To humble their arrogance, the Lord, once, made a frolicsome acitivity. Remaining constant hale and hearty free from any disease, Lord acted a drama of falling ill. Naradaji came there. He smelt Lord’s feelings. He said that there was certainly medicine of that disease, It was taking a dose of the feet dust of a living devotee. Rukmini, Satyabhama all were asked. But the question was who would give her feet dust to the Lord. The Lord said—‘Once, try to get it, going to Braj’. Just hearing Naradaji’s arrival from Shyamasundara, all the maidens of Braja including Radhaji rushed up without washing their mouth of night. After the query of Krishna’s well-being, Naradaji conveyed them the news of Krishna’s disease. Gopikas were totally afflicted? They, at once, asked—‘Is there no physician?’ It is impossible for no that we cannot part with object belonging to us for Shri Krishna. ‘The Ayurvedic physician and medicine both are present; but the drink is not available.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘What is that drink?’</p>
<p class="Text">‘The drink is rare; who should give it? Everyone has got it, but none is ready to give it. I took the round of the entire universe, but all in vain.’ ‘It belongs to all.’ Have we also got it? ‘Why not! but you, too, cannot be able to give it.’</p>
<p class="Text">It is not any object with us that we cannot part with that object belonging to us for Shri Krishna.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Well, then, will you be able to give your feet dust to Krishna? It is that drink with which if the medicine is given, the disease will be cured.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘O the great saint! What is this an uphill task? Just take, we stretch our leg, just at once, take away the feet dust as much as you want.</p>
<p class="Text">‘O well! What is this you do? Naradaji got a bit perplexed. ‘Don’t you know that Shri Krishna is Supreme God? Enough it is! Your just feet dust to provide him to eat? Are you not afraid of hell?’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Naradaji! Beloved Shri Krishna is our all pleasure—property, enjoyment, deliverance, everything it is He. Even by going to the hell forever, if we may be of any use to get Him cured—if we may provide him the least delightfulness then, we will mutter the reverential sing of such a desired hell constanly. It was long before, he has already destroyed our evil and hell-demons. Naradaji got overwhelmed. He tied the small bundle of the holy feet dust of Shri Radharani and of other her identical and consecrated himself also with it. Then, dancing with it, he reached Dwaraka. The Lord took the medicine. Hearing all about, the queens got ashamed of. Their ego of love perished. They realised that they were good for nothing before those Gopies. They saluted them mentally with spotless and reverent mind.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-19">The cry of distressed is inevitably heard by the Lord—Ocean of Mercy</p>
<p class="Text">Yudhishthir had already lost his entire in the gambling. Shakuni? had won his entire prosperity by deception. Yudhishthir kept his brothers, himself and the queen Draupadi even on bet one by one. A gambler’s false hope goes on deceiving him badly—‘probably he might win the next chance. But Yudhishthir continued losing every chance. When he lost Draupadi also, Duryodhan got Draupadi dragged forcibly in the open assembly through his younger brother Duhshasan. The vicious Duhshasan brought Panchali catching her locks and dragging her to the assembly. Draupadi was in menstruation and she had put on only a single cloth. The calamity did not only end there:—Exposing his thigh, he said ‘Duhshasan! making this Kaurava’s maid, servant naked, get her seated on my thigh.’ </p>
<p class="Text">The royal assembly was full. Dhritarashtr, Pitamah Bhishm and Dronachary were all present there. There were hundreds of the members of the assembly. Well experienced old learned persons were there, braves and honourable persons also were there. Among such persons, the Pandavas queen, whose hair had been bathed at the time of ‘Avbhrith bath of Rajasuya’ who had been honoured by all the kings of the earth as the Emperor’s queen merely a few weeks before along with the Emperor, being in the condition of menstruation she was brought catching her hair having been dragged now, the order was being issued to make her naked.</p>
<p class="Text">As regards, Vidura, too, was there; but who was there to hear his words? Draupadi asked repeatedly—‘When Yudhishthir had already lost himself, after that he had put me on bet; so moraly was I lost or not?’ But versed in righteous like Bhishm even did not give any definite answer. That vicious Duhshasan who was famous for having the strength of ten thousand elephants in his arms caught hold of Draupadi’s Saree.</p>
<p class="Text">‘My well renowned vigorous in all three universes husband!’ being distressed she was looking for all around that somebody would protect her; the Pandavas had turned their faces back being ashamed of and grieved.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘The preceptor—Drona, Pitamah Bhishm a religious minded Karn, Draupadi found none of them to help her. Contrary to it, Karn is encouraging Duhshasan. Bhishm, Dron etc., the big devotees and moralist have got their mouths shut because of the fear to be insulted by Duryodhan and their heads are bowing downwards. Duhshasan is pulling with his mighty and fat arms using his full power the single saree merely on the body of a helpless feeble women. How long will Draupadi be able to remain holding her Saree? No one is there to help her! The flood of tears started flowing from her eyes. Her both the hands lifted up leaving the hold of the saree, she became oblivious of the assembly, the Saree and her own body. She came to cry in the distressed voice—‘Shri Krishna! Dwaraka Nath! Dev-Dev! The dearest of the Gopis! Jagannath! I am sinking into the ocean of wicked Kauravas, O the ocean of mecy! Liberate me.’ Draupadi began to call. She remained calling to the supporter of helpless, the destroyer of distress and the compassionate. She was now unaware and unmindful of what happened or what is happening. The uproar started in the assembly. The people got amazed. Duhsasan was pulling Draupadi’s Saree with his full strength and with a great speed. He began to pant, he had perspired profusely, his arms, having the energy of ten thousand elephants, got exhausted. The heap of clothes of different colours was coming out from Draupadi’s Saree. The ten-handed long Saree, covering her body was not slipping the least from Panchali’s body. It had become endless. The compassionate Dwaraka Nath, Himself had entered the defiled Saree of the woman in the menstruation period. Today He had descended in the form of clothes and then, how could anybody find out the beginning and end of that eternal? ‘Vidur! How is this uproar?’ Anxious the blind king Dhritarashtra asked.</p>
<p class="Text">The saint Vidur said—‘Duhshasan has exhausted pulling Draupadi’s Saree. The heap of clothes has come to be formed. This is the uproar of the assembly-members in amazement. Besides this the jackals have entered your Yagya Pandal and they are crying. The other inauspicious omen are occuring. Draupadi is absorbed in calling the Supreme God, Shri Krishnachandra. That omnipotent has extended her saree at the present; but if you don’t please Panchali at once, the Shri Krishna’s great wheel may appear anytime and destroy your sons anyone cannot foresee it. You are, here by, listening to the Duryodhan’s condemnation, made by the assembly members in uproar being distressed with fear.</p>
<p class="Text">Dhritarashtra got afraid. He rebuked Duryodhan. Duhshasan left Draupadi’s Saree and took his seat silently. Whether he realised it or not, but it was not hidden to the devotees like Pandavas and Bhishm how Draupadi’s shame was protected.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-20">The Lord or His Force</p>
<p class="Text">Mahabharata-war was finally decided. Both the sides had got busy to gather their relatives, well-wishers, associates and assistants. It was certain that Shri Krishnachandra would favour the Pandvas side; but all the Kaurava warriors were afraid of only this fact. If Shri Krishna used his discus, there was none to face it and his Narayani army—Was best army of the world to be ignored?’ Whatever happens it matters little; the effort to get the support of Krishna whatever is possible, should be made.’ This was the opinion of the advisers like Shakuni.’ Against his will, even, Duryodhan reached Dwaraka to give the war-invitation to Dwarikadhish.</p>
<p class="Text">Duryodhan’s daughter was married with Shri Krishna’s son Samba. There was no hurdle for Duryodhan to enter Dwaraka—Lord’s palace. He reached inside the building. Lord Vasudeva was taking rest lying on the bed after lunch. There was no otherone in the room. The Lord of frolicsome activities had closed His eyes pretending to sleep. Duryodhan looked hither thither, A superior seat was placed to sit beside his headside. He began to wait for Shri Krishnachandra awakening silently sitting on that seat. </p>
<p class="Text">Arjun had also started from Upaplavya city to give war–invitation. He also reached the same room of the Dwaraka Lord. Seeing Shyamasundar sleeping, he being oblivious of his ownself, stood beside His feet and began to stare the Shyamasundar’s sleeping pose.</p>
<p class="Text">All of a sudden Shri Krishna opened His eyes. Seeing Arjun just infront began to ask—‘Dhananjaya! When did you come? What is the matter?’</p>
<p class="Text">Duryodhan feared lest He may make same committment to Arjun. He said in the sitting position—‘Vasudev! First I have come to you. Arjun has come just now.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘You!’ Turning back His face to the left side Janardan saw Duryodhan and after respectful salutation asked, ‘What is the purpose of your visit?’ </p>
<p class="Text">Duryodhan said—‘You do know it well that my war with the Pandavas is definite. You are my relative. I have come here to ask for Your help in the war.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Arjun! You!’? Now when it was asked to Arjun, he said—‘I, too, have come with the same purpose.’</p>
<p class="Text">Dwarakanath said in serious tone—‘Both of you are my relatives. In this family-war, it does not suit me to fight from either of the side. I will not take arms in this war. On one side, I will remain without arms and on the other side my army well-equipped with arms  will fight. But O the king! I have sighted Arjun first and he is younger than you also; so, first Arjun should be given the chance to choose either of the both what he prefers.’</p>
<p class="Text">As if Arjun got a boon. He was fearing that anyhow, the first chance might not be given to Duryodhan and if he chose Vasudev, it would create disaster. He said with eagerness—‘It is you to remain on my side.’ Duryodhan’s face had parched away with the decision of the Lord of Dwaraka: He had started thinking, ‘If he does not hold the arm, then, what will be His use in the war? Contrary to it He will go on creating a new havoc daily. Arjun might choose the army, lest He should fall on our head. Just hearing Arjun’s desire, Duryodhan stood up with enthusiasm from his seat—‘Yes, all right. It is accepted to me—You! Remain with the Pandavas side, and order the Narayani force to march in my favour. The Lord had glanced towards him with left sight, so He became happy not to get the Lord.’</p>
<p class="Text">Just before Duryodhan, the order was placed to the army. When he went away being pleased, smiling Madhusudan said to Arjun—‘Parth! What a childish act you did! Why did you not ask for the army? I had given you the first chance. I will not lift the arms, I have already told it. What gain did you think of accepting me? If you want, you may take army of a legion of brave Yadavs in my place.’ </p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">Arjun’s eyes came to be full of tears. He began to say—‘Madhav! Why do you put me to test? I have not choosen you considering any gain from you. Whether the Pandavas are winner or loser, but I cannot survive without You. Your honour is our vital force, I am Yours and want to live close to you. What do you expect from me to do? Smiling Vasudev asked Arjun and smiling Arjun answered—‘I will make You the charioteer. Take the rein of my chariot in Your hand and make me carefree. One, who surrenders the rein of his life chariot to the Lord, is sure his mundane are and ultra mundane victory is sure.’<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-21">Shri Krishna’s Self-form—Vision </p>
<p class="Text">Mahabharata-war ended. His majesty Yudhishthir was coronated as Emperor. Now, Lord Shri Krishna was coming back to Dwaraka along with Subhadra. While journeying, the Lord reached the Marawar state where great lustrous saint Uttanka lived. The Lord viewed him and adored him also.</p>
<p class="Text">Then after, the saint also welcomed Him warmly. Then, the questions about their well beings started. At last, when Shri Krishna narrated about  the ruin of Kauravas, the Muni (saint) got overpowered with anger and said—‘Madhusudana! The Kauravas were your relatives and lovers. In spite of being powerful you did not protect them. So, I will curse you today. Oh! All the braves of the Kuru dynasty got destroyed and you ignored them inspite of having capacity.’</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Krishna said—‘O the son of Bhrigu! First listen to me. You have passed through a severe penance remaining as celibate from the very childhood and you have contented your preceptor by your devotion to guru. I know all about it; but mind this that anyone can not humiliate Me or curse Me on the basis of his power of a little austerity. I just, tell you something about the spiritual truth, having heard it and then, later on you should contemplate about it. O the sage! It should be known to you—These Rudras, demi-gods, all the demons, gods and demi-gods devils, serpent and fairies all are My manifestations. Sat, Asat and apart from this, the imperceptible universe that exists that is also not separate from Me, perpetual the God of gods. I descend a number of times in a number of species  with great saints to protect and establish the righteousness. It is I, the cause of Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra Indra and the cause of their origin and annihilation. Whenever the righteousness is on the decline and unrighteousness is in the ascendant, I incarnate through different classes of birth and establish righteousness when I incarnate as God then My conduct and behaviour are just according to gods-like. On descending in the demi-gods-class of birth, my behaviour changes like the conduct and behaviour of the demi-gods and likewise after incarnating in the class births of serpent, a class of demi-gods, demons my conduct and behaviour changes accordingly. At present, I have appeared in the form of mankind. So, I requested the Kauravas humbly, but due to being overwhelmed with infatuation they did not accept my advice. So, having given up their lives in the war they have now, reached the heaven.’</p>
<p class="Text">Then after, Uttanka said—‘Janardana! I know, You are the supreme Lord of the entire universe. Now, I will not curse You. Kindly, show me Your universal form. Then, after, the Lord viewed him the eternal Cosmic form  initiated Him to demand the boon. UttaÆk demanded the boon to make the water available in that Maruland (desert). The Lord said—‘Whenever the water is needed, remember Me.’ Having stated so the Lord set out for Dwaraka. </p>
<p class="Text">One day, the saint Uttanka felt very thirsty. He began to wander about here and there for water. In the meanwhile, Shri Krishna’s boon came to his mind. He remembered Shri Krishna. Just then what he saw—A fully naked fierce wretched looking dreadful surrounded by dogs was seen coming. The constant flow of water falling through his urinal organ was seen. Coming near the saint he said—‘O the sage! I feel pity to find you restless in the thirst of water. Make haste to come close to me and drink the water.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Hearing this, Uttanka lost his temper and began to rebuke that wretched and began to say willy-nilly unpleasant words even to Shri Krishna. After his refusal, the wretched with dogs disappeared from there. Seeing this, the saint Uttanka came to understand that it was all the illusion of Shri Krishna. Then and there, Shri Krishna appeared in a form wielding with Ponch-shell, wheal and mace. Just seeing Him Uttank spoke—‘Keshava! It is not proper for you to provide a Pariah’s urine to a thirsty Brahman.’</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Krishna said in a sweet voice—A mankind is never given nectar apparantly to drink. So, I had sent Indra disguised in the form of a wretched secretly to make you drink nectar, but you could not recognise him. First the king of gods was not ready to give you nectar. But, after my repeated entreaty he became ready to make you drink the nectar on the condition that if the sage drank the nectar from my wretched form in the so called way, then I would give him and if not accepted, he would be deprived of the nectar. But it is a matter of regret that you did not accept the nectar. You committed a blunder by returning him. Well! I again grant you boon that whenever you desire for water, at the same time, the clouds will provide you sweet water by raining in this deserted land. The name of the clouds will be Uttanka cloud.</p>
<p class="Text">On the Lords such saying, Uttank began to live there very happily since then. Even today, the uttank clouds rain water in the deserted land of Marawar.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-22">The Lord likes simplicity</p>
<p class="Text">There was a Lord Shiva’s temple in the forest. Kannappa, the son of a tribal, set out for hunting and wandering about reached that temple. In the temple there was the full idol of Lord Shiva. That emotional simple-hearted, the son of a tribal felt in his mind that—‘The Lord is all alone in this forest infested with violent wild animals, lest any animal should cause him trouble.’ It was getting dark at that moment. That the son of a tribal strung the arrow on his bow and sat down to watch at the temple gate. He remained sitting there the whole night.</p>
<p class="Text">The morning set in. Now, the feeling came to his mind to worship the Lord. He went in to the forest, hunted the animals, and roasted the meat. Breaking the beehive of the bees he took out the honey. He took the honey and meat in a leaf bowl, plucked some flowers from the forest-creepers and got them entangled to his hair. He filled his mouth with the river water and reached the temple. There were some flowers and leaves lying on the idol. Kannappa removed them with his feet; because it was the bow in his one hand and in the second hand it was the leave’s bowl of meat. He poured down the water on the idol from his mouth. Now, placing the bow on one side, taking out the flowers entangled to his hair, he offered it to the idol and he put the loaf-bowl of the meat before the idol as oblation and stringing the arrow on the bow sat down at the temple gate to watch. </p>
<p class="Text">Kannap forgot his home, he forgot his family, and even to the extent that he had no sense of food and sleep even. He forgot as if the world and his body in the Lord’s worship and in His watch.</p>
<p class="Text">A Brahman came to the temple daily in the morning from the far away village and went away after worshipping. His arrival timing was the same when Kannappa used to go for hunting. Seeing the piece of meat in the temple the Brahman felt very sad. Bringing the water from the river he washed the temple clearly. He, himself, took the bath again and then, made worship. But it was not the matter of one day. When the same condition of the temple began to continue daily, one day the Brahman decided, ‘Today, I will watch who depraves the temple daily hiding myself.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Hiding himself the Brahman went on watching; but he saw the dreadful tribal coming with bow, he dared not speak him, just entering the temple Kannappa saw that one eye of the idol was bleeding. He put the leaf bow on the ground and came to weep in anguish—‘Oh! Who is that wicked who has wounded my Lord’s eye?’</p>
<p class="Text">First, Kannappa drawing the bow and arrow rushed up out of the temple. He wanted to kill the person who had wounded the idol; but very soon, throwing away his bow and arrow he started collecting the grass-leaves. He returned with a bundle of grass to the temple and crushing each leaf and each root began to rub it to the eye of the idol. Kannappa’s effort did not prove fruitful. The bleeding of the eye did not stop at all. It made the tribal son very much distressed. At the same time it came to his memory that some tribal one had told him anytime—‘On the wounded part of the body if the flesh of the same part of any other one’s body is used, it recovers very soon.’ Kannappa got pleased. He took out one arrow from his quiver and pierced its point into his eye. Taking out his own eye with his own hands he placed it on the eye of the idol and got it pressed. The blood was coming out from the cavity of his own self-eye; but he was not at all conscious of his own pain. He was feeling delighted that the bleeding of the idol eye had stopped.</p>
<p class="Text">At the same time the second eye of the idol began to bleed. Now, Kannappa had already found out the medicine. He put the toe of his feet on that eye of the idol so that the eye of the idol might be traced out after taking out his eye when he would become blind. He pierced the point of the arrow in his second eye. All of a sudden the temple got illuminated with the divine light. From the same idol Lord Shankar emanated. He clinged Kannappa to his heart.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">‘Brahman! The methodical worship does not please me. It is the simple heartiest devotion and emotional feeling that I like.’ The Lord Shiva addressed the hidden Brahman. Kannappa’s eyes had recovered and become quite well. He had now become an attendant of Lord Shiva and went away with Him to the divine abode. On account of the contact of tribal’s son, that Brahman also got the vision of the Lord.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-23">Guru-service and its fruit</p>
<p class="Text">Upamanyu was the next other pupil of the sage Ayoddhaumya. The Guru had deputed him the job of  grazing cows and watching them. It is the rule of the student life that he should stay at the Guru-residing-place serving Guru leading the life of a celibate. He should beg alms in the neighbouring city or villages and present it before the guru. He should remain contented with whatever of the alms is given to him by the Guruji to eat. Upamanyu also followed this rule; but whatever the alms he brought, the sage Dhaumya used to possess the whole of it. He gave no part of the alms to Upamanyu at all. Upamanyu, too, never complained.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, the sage asked—‘Upamanyu! I consume the whole grain of your alms, in such a situation what do you eat?’ You look hale and hearty.’ Upamanyu said—‘I beg again the alms.’ The sage said—‘But you don’t do right. It creates some shortage for the householders. It causes sin of grabbing of other beggar’s living. Upamanyu accepted his fault and assured him that he would not do so in future. After the interval of a few days, the sage Guru asked again—‘Upamanyu! what do you eat nowadays?’</p>
<p class="Text">Upamanyu said—‘Lord! I usually drink the milk of these cows.’</p>
<p class="Text">The sage rebuked—‘These cows belong to me, without my permission, to drink their milk is a crime.’</p>
<p class="Text">Upamanyu gave up the drinking of milk also. After some days, when the Guru asked him again, he said that he drank the froth fallen down from the mouth of the calves. But the preceptor had to put him to test. He instructed—‘Never do such a mistake in future. The calves are very kind, they would be making the foam of more milk and pouring it down for you and they would be remaining hungry themselves.’</p>
<p class="Text">All the ways of Upamanyu’s food were closed. He had to run after the cows the whole day, from forest to forest. One day, he felt excessively hungry. When he found nothing else to eat, he ate the leaves of ‘Aak plant’ being compelled. With the heat of those poisonous leaves his eye-sight went away. He became blind. Because of being blind, while wandering about in the forest, he fell down into a dry well. </p>
<p class="Text">It was sun-set. The cows returned without the grazier; but Upamanyu did not return. The sage got worried—‘I stopped Upamanyu’s food completely. Probably, he went somewhere being annoyed.’ With the pupils he reached the forest at the same time and began to call loudly—‘Son Upamanyu! where are you?’</p>
<p class="Text">Upamanyu’s voice was heard—‘Lord! I am lying here in the well.’ </p>
<p class="Text">The sage went near the well. On query, Upamanyu narrated him the reason of his fallen down into the well. Now, the sage advised Upamanyu to pray Ashwani Kumars—the physician of gods. By the permission of the Guru upmanyu began to pray. How long will the divinity of gods continue, if the gods are not pleased on the prayer of a holy Guru devotee celibate? Being pleased with the prayer of Upamanyu, Ashwani Kumar appeared in the very well and said—‘Take this sweet bun-like fried cake and eat it.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Very humbly upmanyu said—‘Without offering it to the Guru, I don’t want to eat this cake.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Ashwani Kumar’s said—‘First, your Guru too, had prayed me and he had eaten the given cake without having offered to his Guru. You should also do so.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Upamanyu said—‘The followers should not find fault at the Gurus. Kindly, excuse me all of you, I cannot eat the cake without offering it first to my Guru.’</p>
<p class="Text">Ashwani Kumar’s said—‘We are highly pleased with your devotion to Guru. Your Guru’s teeth are the iron-teeth, but your teeth turn to gold. Your eye-sight will also come back as in the past.’ </p>
<p class="Text">The Ashwani Kumar took Upamanyu out of the well. Upamanyu saluted the feet of the Guru. The sage Ayoddhaumya blessed after hearing everything—‘May all the Vedas and religious treaties be committed to your memory without any effort! Their hidden meaning will be known to you. You will get the knowledge of the truth of religious scriptures.’</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-24">The auspicious fruit of elders-respect</p>
<p class="Text">Both the sides of the Kauravas and Pandavas had gathered in the battlefield of the Kurukshetra for war. The armies had already made their strategies. It seemed the delay of only a few moments of the war to be started. Suddenly, Yudhishthir put off his armour and put it aside on the chariot. He put aside the arms and weapons also and alighting from the chariot, he started going towards Bhishmapitamah in the midst of Kauravas army on foot.</p>
<p class="Text">Seeing the elder brother going unarmed on foot towards the enemy-army, Arjun, Bhimasen, Nakul and Sahdev also got down from their chariots. They reached near Yudhishthir and began to follow him. Shri Krishnachandra also was going with the Pandavas. Bhimasen and Arjun were much anxious. They began to ask—‘Your majesty! What are you doing this?’</p>
<p class="Text">Yudhishthir gave no answer to anybody. Shri Krishnachandra also hinted to remain silent and said—‘The virtuous Yudhishthir always behaves moral conduct. At present he is engaged in the moral conduct.’</p>
<p class="Text">An uproar was created among those belonging to the Kauravas group. They were saying—‘Yudhishthir is a coward. He has got frightened to see our huge army and coming to the shelter of Bhishm. Some of them began to suspect that it might be any game to poach Bhishm to their own side. The soldiers began to admire Kauravas gladly.</p>
<p class="Text">Yudhishthir reached directly to Bhishmapitamah and salutating him said with folded hands—‘Pitamah! We have become compelled to fight against you. Kindly, permit us and bless us for this act.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Bhishma said—‘O the best of Bharat dynasty! If you had not come in this way to seek permission, I would have certainly cursed you to face defeat. Now, I am pleased with you. Be victorious. Go and fight the war. Demand boon from me. Parth! Man is the slave of wealth but wealth is slave to none. It is the wealth through which the Kauravas have subjugated me; that is why, like the impotents I say that you may ask for any boon whatever you want except fighting from your side. As regards the war, I will do fight from the Kauravas side.’ Yudhishthir asked merely—‘You are invincible. Then, how can we win you in the war?’</p>
<p class="Text">Pitamah told him to ask this question later on. From there, Dharmaraj went to Dronacharya and after making obeisance, he sought the permission from him also to fight the war. Saying the same words of Bhishmpitamah blessed him; but when Yudhishthir asked him the way to defeat him, Dronacharya spoke point blank—‘None can kill me if there are arms in my hands but it is my nature that in the war, I get absorbed in meditation keeping the bow aside after hearing any unpleasant news from a reliable person. I can be killed at that time.’</p>
<p class="Text">Having made salutation to Dronacharya, Yudhishthir reached Kripacharya. After making obeisance, on Yudhishthir’s demand for permission, Kripacharya also blessed him after saying the same words of Bhishmapitamah; but Yudhishthir could not ask his that family priest the way of his death. Asking that heart-rendering matter again and again being overpowered by distress, he became unconscious. Kripacharya had already understood his purpose. He said—‘O the king! I am incapable to be slain, I cannot be killed by anyone. But I give you words that daily in the morning. I will pray to the Lord for your victory, and I will not be any hurdle in your victory in the war.’</p>
<p class="Text">After that Yudhishthir reached his maternal uncle, Shalya. Shalya also blessed him repeating the same words of Pitamaha; but promised him to go on discouraging Karn with his harsh words during the period of war. Having made obeisance to his preceptors and being embelished by their blessings of victory and after seeking permission from them, Yudhishthir came back along with his brothers to his army. His this outstanding humility created such a sympathy for him in the hearts of Bhishm, Dron, etc., without which the victory was too irksome for the Pandavas.</p>

<p class="Text">During banishment, the Pandavas were in Dwaita Vana. While loitering in the forest, one day, they felt thirsty. Climbing on a tree Yudhishthir watched all around. Seeing the traces of greenery and water at a place, he sent Nakul to fetch water. Nakul started out towards the place. He found a pool full of clean water; but as soon as, he stepped down the pond to drink water, this voice was heard to him. ‘Don’t dare to drink the water of this pond. I have already taken its water in my possession earlier. First answer my questions, then you may drink its water.’</p>
<p class="Text">Nakul was very thirsty. He didn’t pay any heed to what a Yaksh was saying. But just as he touched the water of the Pond with his mouth, at once, he fell down on the ground being lifeless. </p>
<p class="Text">It got, too late after Nakul’s departure. Then, Yudhishthir sent Sahadev. On nearing the pool, the voice of the Yaksh was heard to Sahadev also. He, also, tried to drink water without paying any heed to the voice, and he, too, fell down in the lifeless state. In the same way Dharmaraj Yudhishthir sent Arjun and Bhimasen also. Both of them also came turn by turn and they, too, reached the same fate.</p>
<p class="Text">When none of his brothers who had been sent to fetch the water, did not return, in spite of being very much tired, Yudhishthir himself, came upon the pool. Seeing his god like brothers lying there lifeless, he got distrssed beyond limit. For a long time, he expressed his grief for his brothers, and then, at last, he, also, descended into the pool to drink water. First, the Yaksh restrained him to be in the guise of a heron; but on the query of Yudhishthir—‘Who are you?’ he was looked in the form of Yaksh on a tree.</p>
<p class="Text">Peace-minded virtuous Yudhishthir said—‘Yaksh! I usurp never the possessions of others. You have already acquired the right of this pool earlier, then, this water may remain in your possession. Please ask the questions what you want to ask, I will try to answer them to the best of my intelligence.’</p>
<p class="Text">Yaksha put many questions. Yudhishthir gave the appropriate reply of all the questions. Being well satisfied by his answers, Yaksh said—‘O the king! You gave the satisfactory answers of my questions.’ One of your dead brothers can now be revived; whom do you want to come back to life?’</p>
<p class="Text">Yudhishthir said—‘Kindly, revive my younger brother Nakul.’ Yaksh said in the amazing words—‘You are wandering about in the forest being devoid of the kingdom, at last, you have to fight a war against the enemies, in such a condition, why are you so much restless for Nakul forsaking your great valiant brother Bhimasen or the best one in the knowledge of the science of arms Arjun?’ </p>
<p class="Text">Dharmaraj Yudhishthir said—‘Yaksh! The joys of royality or the sorrows of exile depend according to luck or chance; man should never deviate from the path of ‘Dharma’. One who safeguards Dharma, Dharma protects him. Therefore, I will not forsake Dharma. Kunti and Madri—both are my mothers. Kunti’s son I, myself, am alive. So, I want that my step-mother Madri’s dynasty might not ruin. Her one son at least, might remain alive. So, please, by reviving Nakula’s life make the both blessed with son.’</p>
<p class="Text">Yaksha said—‘You are a great liberal in the worldly and unworldly affairs both, so, may all your brothers be alive! I am your father, Dharma, I had come to see you and test your steadfastness to righteousness.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Dharma appeared in its original form. All the four dead brothers got revived.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-26">A devout is invincible</p>
<p class="Text">The gods and demons jointly made the churning of the ocean for the sake of nectar and had also taken out the nectar; but, because of being blessed with the grace of the Lord Narayan it were the only gods who could drink the nectar. The demons were cheated, it was only their labour what they could get. As a result, among the gods and demons, War was inevitable. In the war even, the gods being immortal on account of taking the nectar, became winner and got victory. It was the Demons king Bali who had already been killed in the war; but the preceptor, Shukra revived the lives of Bali as well as other dead demons in the war with the art of vivifying. Bali with his attendants went away to the western mountain—behind which the sun-sets.</p>
<p class="Text">By the means of his dedicated service, Bali pleased the preceptor, Shukra. The preceptor got a Yagya performed. Having appeared from the Yagyapit, the fire provided the divine chariot, the inexhaustible quiver and other weapons. Now again Bali invaded upon the paradise. This time Bali’s potential lustre was so indomitable that the king of gods, Indra got disappointed just watching him. Even the gods preceptor Brihaspati advised the gods to escape themselves in the mountain caves fleeing away silently and remain hidden there. Bali occupied Amaravati without any struggle.</p>
<p class="Text">The throne of the heaven can be occupied only by that one who has performed complete one hundred<span class="char-style-override-4"> ‘Ashwamedha Yagya’s</span>. Any work becomes fruitful only when it has been acted on the earth this field of action. The works done in the heaven are fruitless. You have occupied the paradise; but this right may continue so, you should complete the performance of one hundred <span class="char-style-override-4">‘Ashwamedha-Yagyas’</span> the preceptor Shukra admonished Bali.</p>
<p class="Text">Bali had taken the vow to follow the preceptor’s instruction strictly as it is word by word. On the earth, on the holy bank of Narmada river his Yagya-pavilion was constructed and he began to perform the <span class="char-style-override-4">Ashwamedha Yagyas</span> one after another. Ninty-nine <span class="char-style-override-4">Ashwamedha Yagyas</span> were perfectly performed without any hindrance. The last Ashwamedha also started. On the other hand, the goddess mother Aditi was very much anguished with the misery of her homeless sons. She prayed to her husband, the sage Kashyapa—‘Please, find out any way that my sons misfortune may be averted.’</p>
<p class="Text">The sage advised her to worship the Lord by keeping on the ‘Payobrata’, Aditi completed this fast in worship with great reverence and dedication. Being pleased with her worship the Lord Narayan visioned her His form. The Lord said—‘O the goddess! One who protects Dharma,  is always protected by Dharma. One who is virtuous and righteous, and acts upon the ordains of the preceptors having the knowledge of religious treaties, is invincible even for me. No one can win him by force. But My adoration never goes waste. I will descend in the form of your son and make their heaven available to the gods tactfully.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Having granted the boon the Lord disappeared. He descended in the form of Vaman. The sage Kashyapa, got Vaman’s ritual ceremony performed by the sages. After the sacred thread ceremony-performance, Vaman started out towards the Yagya-pavilion of Bali. The Lord Vaman, wearing the wooden-sandal in his feet, girdle in his waist, taking umbrella over his head, with the pot with a wooden water-pot full of water, a staff  and in the guise of a celibate looked lustrous apparently like sun.</p>
<p class="Text">The last <span class="char-style-override-4">Ashwamedha-Yagya</span> of Bali; the demon’s king was at the verge of the last oblation. At the gate of the Yagya pavalion, when Vaman reached like the embodiment of sun, all the priests, the Demon king, Bali himself, and  other members stood up in His honour. Bali seated him on a higher seat with due respect. Having washed his feet, he worshipped him. At last, very humbly with folded hands Bali said—‘You are a celibate Brahman lad. I am highly blessed by your visit. Kindly tell me your purpose of visit. Demand whatever you want.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Lord Vaman praised the generousity of the demon’s clan, discussed about the outstanding chariteers and admired Bali’s munificence. After this, he said—‘I want the land of my three steps.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Bali came to laugh and said—‘O the Brahman lad! you are learned, but still you are a child, Well! if you want to demand simply land, then demand as much as may be sufficient for your livelihood.’ </p>
<p class="Text">But why should he take the land that may serve only the purpose of his livlihood when he wants the entire three universes. Vaman said seriously—‘O the king! Greed is the worst. If I am not satisfied with the three steps of land, then, the greed will require the kingdom, and then again there will be the expansion of the desire to get the entire earth and you know it the greed never ends even after getting all the three universes. You were not right to excite my greed. If you give my only three step-land measured with my own steps—that much is more than sufficient for me.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘All right! As you are pleased.’ Bali, smiling demanded from his wife the water pot to resolve. But in this period Shukracharya had come to recognise Vamanji. He rebuked his pupil—‘O the fool! What are you going to do? He is not a small Brahman lad. It is disguised Vishnu standing before you in this form. He will measure the entire earth in his one step, and in the second step he will measure the Paradise etc. He will leave no place to measure the third step. Where will you stay having given up the entire? Join your hands and say to him—‘God! Look for another client. Kindly, be kind to me to oblige.</p>
<p class="Text">‘He is Vishnu Himself!’ Bali also got startled. There was no question to disbelieve his preceptor. Bowing his head, he thought for two moments and then, that great thinker raised his head—‘Lord! Through these big Yagyas, You make me to worship that Vishnu in the form of Yagyas, who may be the apparent Vishnu he or some one else; I have already given words to give the land. It is not possible for me, the grand son of Prahlad, to refuse like a miser after having given acceptance saying ‘Yes’. It may go against me even beyond the imagination. Having capacity, I will not return a Brahman who has come to my door.’</p>
<p class="Text">Shukracharya lost his temper. He said angrily—‘You don’t follow my advice, and consider yourself virtuous and wise; it will destroy your prosperity at once.’</p>
<p class="Text">Bali accepted the curse of his Guru, bowing his head but he did not back out his acceptance. Taking the water he resolved to offer the three step-land. Just taking the land in offering, the Lord Vaman assumed cosmic figure. In a single-step, he measured the entire earth and when he raised the second-step, the nail of his bottom toe pierced the boundary covering of the universe space and went out. Now, the Lord said to Bali—‘You boasted to be a great chariteer, you have offered me three step-land. The two steps have covered all the three universes. Now give me the place to put my third step.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Bowing his head Bali said—‘The landlord is bigger than the land. Please, put your third step over my head and fulfil your entire claim given in the charity.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord put his third step on the head of Bali and blessed him. Indra got his Paradise, Vaman Lord became Upendra for Indra’s protection; as regards Bali, He offered Himself to Bali. The Lord gave more affluence than that of even heaven, to Bali to reside. In the next era of the Manu, Bali will become Indra, He assured him. Beyond this also, He granted the boon that He, the Supreme God, Himself, having the mace in His hand will remain present at the gate of Bali in Sutal. Thus, inspite of being cheated Bali remained winner and the ocean of mercy, Lord, Himself became his gate-keeper.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-27">The distress for the cause of dharma is benedictory</p>
<p class="Text">The Pandavas were passing the banished life. By the prompting of lord Vyas, seeking the permission of his brothers Arjun began to perform penance. By his penance, he pleased the Lord Shankar. The Lord Shiv gifted him his ‘Pashupatrastra.’ Thereafter, the ruler of gods Indra, having seated Arjun in his chriot, took him away to the heaven. Indra and the other protectors and feeders of the realms gave Arjun their divine weapons. Having these weapons, Arjun made an attack on the enemy of gods—Nivata Kavacha-demons. The gods; also, were failing to win over the demons. The gods were feeling terrorised by the demons attack again and again. Arjun defeated the demons in the war. Being smitten by the arrows released from the Gandiva-bow, the demons ran away and went away to the nether world. </p>
<p class="Text">When, the demons triumphant Arjun came back to Amaravati, the gods welcomed him warmly with great zeal and enthusiasm. The god’s assembly was well decorated. The divine ruler Indra occupied his seat on the throne taking Arjun by his side. The group of demi-gods took up the lyre. The best fairies of the heaven began to dance one by one. The divine ruler wanted to satisfy Arjun by any means. He was watching towards Arjun attentively so that he might find out his interest and attraction. </p>
<p class="Text">Arjun was in the Paradise. The climes of worldly beauty and affluence, the heaven had been decorated specially. The fairies were bent upon attracting the dearest guest of the divine ruler and gods by displaying their entire artistry. The divine chamberlain introduced the next fairy naming her after the dance of the former fairy was over and the gods assembly got thrilled with a new and fresh curiosity. But the Arjun, in whose reception, all this was being done, was sitting silently bowing down his head and casting down his eyes. In this magnificence of the Paradise he was remembering his banished brothers, sleeping on the ground having eaten the fruits and roots, in their garments of the tree-bark. He was the least attracted to this immortal land Amaravati.</p>
<p class="Text">Suddenly, the stage-controller called the name of Urvashi. Arjun raised his head. He stared at Urvashi many  times dancing at the stage, presenting herself in the Gods-assembly. Thousand eyed, Indra marked it. When the function was over, the divine ruler called the king of demi-gods—Chitrasen, to him and said—‘Going to Urvashi, convey her my order that she should serve Arjun in the night today. Arjun is the dearest of all of us. She must please and amuse him in the night today.’</p>
<p class="Text">Urvashi had already been bewitched by Arjun. When she got the order of the divine king, she accepted it with great pleasure. She adorned herself that day as much as she could with the erotic sentiment. Being dressed up fully in the best amorous look, she reached Arjun’s residing place in the night.</p>
<p class="Text">Just seeing Urvashi, Arjun left the bed and stood up. With folded hands, bowing his head, he saluted her and said—‘Mother! How did you visit here at this dead of night? What service should I render to you?’</p>
<p class="Text">Urvashi was taken aback by this address of Arjun. She frankly spoke that she, herself, was enchanted to him and at the same time, she had been ordered by Indra also. She requested earnestly that Arjun should accept her. But Arjun said with stable mind—‘You should not speak to me such an improper thing again. You are the mother of my Kuru-race. I have heard this through the sages. Today, in the god’s assembly, when the chamberlain addressed your name, I desired to glance your view. Considering you the mother of my family-clan, I cast my glance at your beautiful feet several times reverently. It seems that the Lord Indra came to misunderstand it.’</p>
<p class="Text">Urvashi persuaded him—‘Parth! This is not earth, rather than this is Paradise. We, the fairies are neither anyone’s mother nor sister nor wife even. Every visitor of the Paradise can enjoy us according to his merit. You should accept my prayer.’</p>
<p class="Text">It was the solitary and lonely night, well dressed up and with amorous look, the best and the most beautiful fairy queen was praying; but the virtuous Arjun, having the knowledge of religion, could not be deviated and the cupid could not even touch his pious heart. In the same way with folded hands he prayed—‘As Kunti is my mother, as Madri is my mother, as Indrani Shachi Devi is my mother, in the same way, I consider you also as my mother. Please, oblige me treating me as your son.’</p>
<p class="Text">Even any seer had not ever ignored Urvashi in such a way. It appeared to her that her beauty was being insulted. </p>
<p class="Text">Being violent with the rage under the spell of sex, she cursed him—‘You did not accept my urge like an impotent, so you will have to pass one year as an eunuch among the women dancing and singing.’</p>
<p class="Text">Having cursed him, Urvashi went away. Arjun, too, was capable to curse her and he had been cursed in an unjustified way; but he, only, saluted Urvashi bowing his head, while going away.</p>
<p class="Text">Next day, in the morning, the king of gods came to know all about. Being pleased with Arjun’s self-control, he said—‘Dhananjaya! The person who follows the righteous path, never faces disaster. If any calamity ever befalls, it is only benedictory to him. Urvashi’s curse will have its effect only for one worldly year, and due to the effect of curse, for the last one year of your unknown exile period none will be able to recognise you. This curse will prove to be merely a boon for you at that time.’</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-28">The mother’s life has a great impression on child in pregnancy</p>
<p class="Text">The demon’s king, Hiranyakashyapa wanted to dissuade the supreme devotee Prahladji from the Lord’s adoration. It was his presumption that Prahlad was yet a child and someone had misguided him. After the proper guidance he would change his thought with this persumption, the demon’s king had sent Prahlada to the hermitage of Shukracharya’s sons—Shunda and Amarka to study and instruction had been given to both the preceptors that very carefully, they should impart the education to the child appropriate to the demons in economic policy, ruling policy, politics etc.</p>
<p class="Text">Whatever the preceptors taught Prahlad, he used to learn it and crammed it; but it did not appeal to his mind. That education had no significance to his mind. When both the preceptors became busy with the hermitage affairs, Prahlad used to call his other classfellows of demon’s-children to him. First, he was a prince; secondly, many efforts of Demons-king to kill him had proved to be in vain; Due to this, all the demon-children gave him due respect. On the Prahlad’s call, all of them used to come to him leaving their games and sports and listened to him very attentively. Prahlad taught them about the importance of self-restrain, virtuous conduct, compassion to the living beings; he used to persuade them to realise the sensuous worldly enjoyments as illusory and taught them to realise the glory of Lord’s adoration. </p>
<p class="Text">The demon–children asked—‘Prahladaji! You are still immature in age, you have also been living in the royal palace with us and you have come here to the preceptors for study. How did you come to know all this?’</p>
<p class="Text">Prahladji told them—‘Brothers! There is also a history behind it. After the death of my uncle—Hiranyaksha, my father decided to perform penance to become immortal and he went away to Mandarachala mountain. In his absence, the gods made an attack on Daityapuri. The demons were defeated in want of their leader and leaving their women and children escaping their lives ran away to different places. The gods robbed the empty houses of the demons and burnt them to ashes. At the end of the pillage the god’s ruler Indra, was taking away my mother Kayadhu to Amravati having got her arrested. On the way, the god sage Narad came across. He rebuked the divine king—‘Indra! Why are you taking away this holy-hearted woman belonging to other husband? At once, release her.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Indra said—‘O the seer! She has the pregnancy of the demon king. I want to destroy the demon-generation. When, she bears the child, I will kill him and then, I will release her.’</p>
<p class="Text">Naradji then said—‘You are mistaken, O the god’s ruler! She is conceiving a great God-devotee in her womb. You have no power to assail any harm to him.’</p>
<p class="Text">The god’s ruler sentiment at once changed. He said with folded hands—‘O the seer! Pardon me! it was not known to me that she has got a God-devotee in her womb.’ Indra took a round of my mother. He bowed his head towards the innate and having left my mother, he went away.</p>
<p class="Text">Naradji said to my mother—‘O the daughter! Follow  me to my hermitage and till your husband returns after the performance of penance, stay there comfortably.’ </p>
<p class="Text">The sage Naradji came to the hermitage once in the day, but there  was no difficulty for my mother there. She served the other sages of the hermitage. The seer, Naradji used to deliver the precept to her regarding the devotion to God. The seer’s motive was to deliver precept to me.I heard those divine sermons. My mother did forget those sermons because of being a female and remaining always busy in the domestic affairs and because of passing a long time; but by the mercy of the seer, his sermons are still fresh in my memory.</p>

<p class="Text">The <span class="char-style-override-4">Mahabharata</span>-war had been over. Dharmaraj Yudhishthir had become the sole Emperor. With the consent of Shri Krishna, he, along with the queen Draupadi, and his brothers, had come to Bhishmapitamaha, well-versed in righteousness, waiting for the sun moving North-ward, lying on the arrow-bedstead in battle field to give up the life. Bhishmapitamaha was delivering him the teachings on various subjects relating to castes, stages of Hindu life, and the duties of the king and subjects etc. While his sermons were going on, the queen Draupadi came to laugh.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Daughter! Why did you laugh?’ Checking his sermon in the duration, Pitamaha asked. </p>
<p class="Text">Being abashed Draupadi said—‘It was my mistake. Pitamaha! Pardon me.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Pitamaha was not satisfied. He said—‘Daughter! Any modest woman of a noble family does not laugh without any meaning before the elders. You are modest and virtuous. Your smile can never be meaningless. Removing your hesitation, frankly tell me the reason of your laughter.’</p>
<p class="Text">With folded hands Draupadi spoke—‘Grandfather! It is against courtesy; but on your order, I am bound to say. I can never disobey you. When you were delivering moral sermons, the thought came to my mind—‘Today, you are explaining the morality in such a fine manner; but in Kaurava’s assembly when Duhshasan was bent upon making me naked, where had your knowledge of morality  gone? It seemed to me that you have got this moral knowledge later on. Just the moment this thought came to my mind, I fell to laugh, kindly, pardon me.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">Pitamaha, very calmly admonished her—‘Daughter! It’s no matter to pardon. I had the knowledge of righteousness and morality at that time even; but due to consumption of polluted food of Duryodhan, my mind had gone impure, that is why I had become helpless in taking the decision of righteousness in that gambling assembly. But now, the blow of Arjun’s arrows has made my whole blood out of the body. On account of going the polluted blood made of impure food, out of the body, now my mind and intellect have become pure; so, at present, I understand the truth of righteousness and morality exactly right and I am making explanation.’<span></span></p>

<p class="Text">The king of Mithila, his majesty Janak was sleeping in his royal palace. In the sleep he saw a strange dream—</p>
<p class="Text">Any enemy-army has attacked on Mithila His huge army has surrounded the whole city. The tumultuous war broke out. The Mithila army was defeated. His majesty, Janak was arrested. The victorious enemy ordered—‘I don’t take your life; but put off your all royal garments and ornaments and leave this country.’ That king got it announced—‘If any one provides shelter and food to Janak, he will be sentenced to death.’</p>
<p class="Text">The king Janak put off his entire ornaments and garments. He set out from the royal palace wrapping his waist with a small piece of cloth. He had to cross the boundary of the state on foot. None even spoke to him on account of the fear of his life. His feet got blistered due to going on foot. Being afraid. None allowed him even to stand at his door. Therefore, he sat under the tree or slept remaining without food. For a number of days he remained without a grain of food in his stomach.</p>
<p class="Text">Janak was not now a king. Janak was like a beggar with scattered hair, dusted body, oppressed with hunger. Out of the kingdom, he found a city. It came to his knowledge that there was a free food distributing place and there the hungry persons were provided with a dish of rice mixed with pulse. With a great hope, Janak reached there; but the dish of rice mixed pulse boiled together had already been distributed. Now, the distributer was hardly going to close the door. Feeling dizzy Janak sat down and tears began to flow from his eyes. The food distributing worker felt pity at his condition. He said—‘The dish is now no more; but in the pot there lies some of its leftover. If you agree, I may give you, There is the smell of its being burnt.’</p>
<p class="Text">The same seemed to be boon for Janak. He spread his both the palms. The worker put the leftover of the burnt rice mixed with pulse on his palms. But at the same moment a kite swooped down. With the swoop of its paws, Janak’s hands shook in such a way as the whole scrapings of rice mixed with pulse fell down into the mud. Being terribly distressed Janak came to cry.</p>
<p class="Text">It was the dream till now; but really, Janak came to cry in the dream. On account of his cry, his sleep did  get dissipated; the queens, the attendants, the maid-attendants rushed up to him. ‘What happened to the majesty?’</p>
<p class="Text">The king Janak is staring at all around now. He is lying on his bed stead of gold, adorned with jewels and gems on the soft bed like milk foam. He does not feel at all hungry. The queens are standing near him. The servants and maid servants are present in his service. He is still the king of Mithila. Seeing all this Janak said—‘Is it the truth or was it the truth?’ </p>
<p class="Text">The queens got worried. The minister’s worry also got enhanced. It seems that the king has become mad. He did not say anything to anyone. He did not answer any question. He put only one question to anyone who appeared before him is it true or that was true.</p>
<p class="Text">The doctors came, the charmers came, so many others came, but the condition of the king did not improve. Suddenly, oneday, the sage Ashtavakraji visited Mithila. He assured the ministers and he reached his majesty Janak. Janak asked the same question to him also. The Yogiraja Ashtavakraji found out the cause of the question by virtue of his meditation. </p>
<p class="Text">Ashtavakraji asked—‘Your majesty! When you were standing spreading your both the palms in the form of a beggar having wrapped your waist with a cloth at the gate of the food distributing place and on your palms, the scrapings of burnt rice mixed with pulse had been put, at that time whether this royal palace, your this royal garments, these queens the royal minister, servants-maid servants were present?’</p>
<p class="Text">His majesty Janak now said—‘Lord! None of them was there at that time. At that time it was only I distressed with misery, hungry and merely a beggar, who was there.’</p>
<p class="Text">Ashtavakraji again asked—‘O the king! After being awakened, when you were in this royal dress in the royal palace, existed on the bedstead, then was there free distribution place food, its that worker, your poverty-stricken guise, the leftover of that burnt rice mixed with pulse and your that hunger?’ </p>
<p class="Text">His majesty Janak—‘Lord! Absolutely not, nothing at all.’</p>
<p class="Text">Ashtavakra—‘O the king! Anything that is present at a time and does not exist at another time, can never be true.’ At this time when you are awakened, the situation of the dream does not exist, so that is not true, and at the time of dream, this situation did not exist, so it is also not true. Neither it is true nor that was true.’</p>
<p class="Text">Janak—‘Lord! Then what is true?’</p>
<p class="Text">Ashtavakra—‘O the king! When you were standing spreading your palms at the gate of the food-distributing place, At that time you were there?’</p>
<p class="Text">Janak—‘Lord! Indeed I was there.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Ashtavakra—‘O the king! At present are you here in the royal palaces?’</p>
<p class="Text">Janak—‘Lord! No doubt, I am here.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">Ashtavakra—‘O the king! You exist in the awakenning condition or in the sleep as a witness. Only, the situations and conditions change; witnessing both the conditions ‘you’ yourself don’t change. Your existence does not change. Your presence exists in all the conditions. So, it is only you, the truth. It is only the soul which is truth.’<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-31">The worldly relations are illusory</p>
<p class="Text">Once upon a time there was a very glorious king named Chitraketu. It was very difficult to count his queens, but he had no issue. One day, the seer, Angira made a visit of the king Citraketu’s palace. Seeing the king very eager for the issue, he got a Yagya performed and gave the remaining oblations of the Yagya to Kritdyuti, the eldest queen of the king. While departing, the seer said to the king—‘Your majesty! There will be born a son to you; but he will be the cause of your happiness and sorrow both.’</p>
<p class="Text">The queen Kritdyuti became pregnant. In the due course of time she gave birth to a son. The happiness of the king, Chitraketu was beyond the limit. The big celiberations were organised throughout the country. The issueless king for a long time had been blessed with a son; As a result, his affection had upsurged. On account of the affection of the son, he lived in the elder queen’s palace, generally. With the eldest queen, blessed with a son, he had developed his solitary attachment to her. It resulted so, that the king’s other queens began to feel jealous of her. The husband’s negligence for them made them distressed and this sorrow assumed a fierce form of hostility. In the enmity their wisdom failed. To them the root cause of their negligence seemed to be that newly born child. So, at last, with the joint consent together, they gave poison to the infant secretly. The child died. The great queen, Kritdyuti and his majesty Chitraketu, both fell down near his dead body like a tree having been cut off and the roar of distress covered the entire royal palace. </p>
<p class="Text">Being afflicted by the hue and cry in the royal palace, two divine personalities visited there. The seer Angira had come this time with the sage Narada. The seer said to the king—‘O the king! You are devotee of the Lord and Brahmans. Being pleased with you, I had visited here earlier to show you the path of God-vision; but seeing the keen desire of a son in your mind, I granted you the boon of son. Now, you have already experienced the agony of son’s separation. The entire world is full of sorrow and grief in the same way.’</p>
<p class="Text">The king Chitraketu was still overwhelmed with sorrow. He could not understand the secret of the seer’s version. He remained only staring at these exalted souls. The sage Narada, came to the conclusion that he could not be made free from attachment in this way. He attracted the child’s spirit by his divine power. After the arrival of the spirit he said—‘O the spirit of the living being! Just see, these your mother and father are so much being distressed. Enter your body again and make them happy and enjoy the royal comforts.’</p>
<p class="Text">All, present there, heard clearly what the spirit was speaking—‘O the seer! Of which birth as living being are they mother-father? There is no father-mother or brother-relative of a spirit. I have been his father several times and several times he has been my father. Several times he has been my friend or enemy. All these are the relations of mortal body. The moment, the soul is detached from the body, all the relations are detached. Then, everyone has to reap what he has sown.’</p>
<p class="Text">Having said this, soul disappeared. Hearing his words Chitraketu’s infatuation had gone. Having performed the ritual rites of the dead body of his son, he came to the seer with healthy mind. The sage, Narad delivered him the sermon of Lord Shesh’s worship, due to which impact he got the view of Sheshji in a very short time and he became Vidyadhar.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-32">The misery by progeny-attachment</p>
<p class="Text">Any time in the past there was a fine city, on the bank of Tungabhadra river. There lived a ritualist Brahman named Atmadeva bearing a moral character. His wife’s name was Dhundhuly. She was the queen of beauty, born of noble family, but she was talkative, quarrelsome, miser and taking interest in the others disputes and felt delighted by the quarrels of others. She was expert in doing her domestic works. Atmadev was satisfied with his wife; but he had a great sorrow in his mind that he had no issue. He even spent half of his property in charity and auspicious deeds; but such all his deeds could not provide him any issue. At last, being distressed he made up his mind to give up his body and one day, secretly he went to the forest. In the forest on feeling thirsty after drinking water from a pool, he was sitting when a recluse came there. Seeing him sitting there stable having drunk water the Brahman Atmadev reached close to him and began to burst into tears.</p>
<p class="Text">On the query of the the recluse saint, Atmadev told him his worry and asked him the way to get a son. The saint told him after seeing his fortune line through his yogic power—‘There is no son in your fate for the seven births. Give up your infatuation of getting the son. This attachment is due to ignorance. Just see! Due to their sons his majesty Sagar and the king Anga also had to suffer a lot. The real happiness lies only in being divested of infatuation in adoration of the Lord.’ </p>
<p class="Text">But the Brahman was spell-bound with the desire of son. He said—‘If you failed to tell me the way how to get a son, I will give up my life just infront of you.</p>
<p class="Text">At last, being compelled, giving a fruit to the Brahman, the saint said—‘What to do, your obstinacy is strong; but the son will not give you happiness; because the obstinacy against fate causes only troubles. Well; take this fruit and feed of to your wife, it will cause your wife to bear a son. If your wife speaks the truth, leads a pious life, remains compassionate to the living beings, donate charity to the poors and take the meal only once a day for one month, the virtuous son will be born.’</p>
<p class="Text">The saint went away having given him the fruit and the Brahman gave the fruit to his wife reaching home. But Atmadev’s wife was a lady of strange nature. She did not eat the fruit, reverse to it she began to weep before her female friend—‘O the female friend! If I eat this fruit I will be pregnent, due to this my stomach will enlarge, my hunger will be minimised, I will become weak, then, how will the domestic work be done? Suppose, if ever, the robbers happened to come in the village, how will the pregnant woman be able to escape by fleeing away. If, suppose, my child situated in the womb becomes curved, then I will die. I have heard of the labour pains also, it troubles excessively. I am a delicate woman, how will I be able to I bear it? In the period of my helplessness, my husband’s sister will steal away my entire possessions. The practice of dutifulness of the rules of purification and truth etc., is also unbearable to me. Even, in bringing up the child it is more troublesome for a woman. In my opinion, a widow or a barren women only is more happy. In this way, by false reasoning the Brahman’s wife did not eat the fruit. </p>
<p class="Text">After some days, the younger sister of the Brahman’s wife came to her, The female Brahman said to her unfolding the whole story—‘Sister! What should I do in such a condition?’ Her sister said—Don’t worry. I am pregnant, I will give the child to you when it is born. You will give the riches to my husband, he will hand over the child in its return. In this duration remain confined in the house secretly pretending to be pregnant. I will make it public that my son died after six months. Coming daily to your house, I will bring up your child. Give this fruit to the cow to test it.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Brahman-wife gave the fruit to the cow and said to her husband, ‘I ate the fruit.’ At the maturity of time her sister gave birth to a son. Secretly, her sister’s husband handed over the child to the Brahman’s wife. The Brahman woman said to her husband—‘Very easily the son was born. The Brahman’s joy had no bound. The ceremonies of the son were being organised with great pomp and show. The Brahman named the child in the name of his mother ‘Dhundhakari’.</p>
<p class="Text">After some days, the cow also gave birth to a human baby. It created a great curiosity among the people. This child was very handsome and lustrous; but his ears were like that of a cow. The Brahman got that child’s sacrament ceremony also performed and named him ‘Gokarn’. </p>
<p class="Text">After being grown up, Gokarna became humble, learned, a man of moral conduct and righteous; but Dhundhakari became the most wicked. He always kept him away from bath and other activities of purity, inedible objects of food were favourite to him, he was excessively wrathful by temperament, he took food with his left hand, he was a thief, he remained envious to all others without any reason, he used to throw the small children into the well, he was a murderer, he always kept arms in his hand, he used to cause troubles to the blinds and poors, he used to wander about with pariahs having rope in his hands and dogs with him. He destroyed the entire parental property being indulged in prostitution and having beaten the mother and father, he began to take away even the domestic utensils to sell.</p>
<p class="Text">Now, the sorrow of his son’s nuisance became unbearable to Atmadev. Being sad he became ready to commit suicide. But Gokarna persuaded him that ‘this entire mortal world is insubstantial. There is no happiness here at all. The real joy lies in the adoration of the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">Having accepted the advice of Gokarna, Atmadeva went away to the forest. He concentrated his mind to the devotion of God there, due to this he attained divine abode. On the other side, Dhundhakari started beating his mother daily asking her—‘Where is the hidden wealth, speak! Being distressed by the daily beating, the Brahman lady committed suicide by jumping into the well. Gokarna, being dispassionate by nature, went away on pilgrimage. Now, Dhundhakari had no obstacle and he got full freedom. He got five prostitutes stayed at his own residence. He began to nourish them by committing theft, robbery, gambling etc.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, Dhundhakari collected a good deal of wealth by his immoral activities. Seeing the wealth, the prostitutes felt greedy in their minds. With their mutual consent, one day, in the night they tied Dhundhakari lying asleep, with the ropes and put the burning charcoal on his mouth and killed him. Then, they buried his dead body in a pit, having dug it and went away with all his possessions.</p>
<p class="Text">After death, Dhundhakari became a evil spirit. When Gokarna returned from the pilgrimage and slept in his house in the night, that devil Dhundhakari assuming different forms, tried to terrify him. By the mercy of Gokarna, he could be successful in speaking, knowing the narrative of his misery from his own mouth, Gokarna gave him words to get him rid of his misery and at last, expounding the story of Shrimadbhagavat for seven days he got rid him of the form of a spectre.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-33">The Renunciation of Shukadevji</p>
<p class="Text">Once, Vyasaji desired to marry. He demanded his daughter from Jabala Muni. Jabala handed over his daughter named Chetika to him. Chetika’s second name was Pingala. After some days, Shukadevji came into her pregnancy. Twelve years passed but he did not come out. Shukadevji had a very sharp wit. He studied all the Vedas, the other branches of Vedas, Purana, theology, and the religious treaties of salvation by hearing only in the pregnancy and practised even in the womb. If there used to be any mistake in the chanting, Shukadevji rebuked even from the pregnancy. On the other hand, the mother was also feeling pain due to the expansion of the pregnancy period. Seeing all this Vyasaji felt astonished. He asked the innate—‘Who are you?’</p>
<p class="Text">Shukadevji said—‘I have already moved through eighty-four lakh species of birth. In such a condition what should I tell you, who I am?’</p>
<p class="Text">Vyasaji said—‘Why don’t you come out?’ </p>
<p class="Text">Shukadev—‘Wandering about in the dreadful mortal world, I have developed the sentiment of great dispassion. But I know that just coming out of the womb, with the touch of illusory Vaishnavi, my entire knowledge and the sentiment of detachment will be away. So, my purpose this time, is to remain in the womb, being initiated in the practice of Yogas and thus get the salvation.’</p>
<p class="Text">At last, on the assurance of Vyasaji not to be touched with the Vaishnavi illusory, he did come out of the womb any how, but at once, he began to set out for the forest. Seeing this Vyasaji said—‘Son! Stay here in this house so that I may perform the birth sacrament ceremony at least.’ Then, Shukdevji said—‘Till now, in different births and births after birth, hundreds of ceremonies have been performed. It is those binding ceremonies, that have kept me wandering about in this worldly ocean. So, I have no concern to them.’</p>
<p class="Text">Vyasadeva—‘A Brahman child should study first Vedas passing the first stage of life as a celibate in the hermitage. Then after, he should perform the duty of a house-holder, then he should enter the forest life and renunciation. Only then he gets salvation otherwise the fall is inevitable.’</p>
<p class="Text">Shukadeva—‘If the celibacy can provide salvation, then, the unuches would have been always getting salvation, but it is not so. If the stage of a householdership  assists in getting deliverance, then, the entire world should get deliverance. If the stage of forest-life had been liberating everyone, then, all the deers would already have been liberated. If in your opinion, those who follow the path of renunciation, must get salvation, is correct, then all the paupers should get salvation first.’</p>
<p class="Text">Vyasadeva—‘It is the saying of Manu, for the moral and dutiful householder, this mortal world and the next world both are delightful and pleasant. A householder’s harmonised possession is always pleasant.’</p>
<p class="Text">Shukadeva—‘It may be possible by divine grace, that fire may also create cold, the moon may shed heat, but acquisition can bring happiness, it is not possible at all in all the three times.’</p>
<p class="Text">Vyasadeva—‘After a lot of virtuous deeds a man is blessed with the human body. After getting it, if anybody understands the real truth of householder’s life correctly then, what is impossible for him?’</p>
<p class="Text">Shukadeva—‘Just after the moment of birth, man forgets the knowledge of the pregnancy period what he had in the womb. In such a situation, the enterance in the house-holder life and the imagination of benefit from it is just like to pluck the flower from the sky.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Vyasadeva—‘It may be the son of a human being or of any donkey, when he is smeared with dust, walks in unsteadiness and stammers his words are very pleasant to the people.’</p>
<p class="Text">Shukadeva—‘O the saint! It is the symbol of ignorance at all always to get pleasure or contentment from an unholy infant lying in the dust. Those considering pleasure in it, all are ignorant.’</p>
<p class="Text">Vyasadeva—‘In the Yama-world there is a dreadful hell which name is—‘pum’. An issueless man goes there. That is why, a son is praised.’</p>
<p class="Text">Shukadeva—‘If only a son is the means of salvation, the pigs, the dogs and locusts can be specially distinguished to get it.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Vyasadeva—‘To bear a son makes anyone to get rid of the father’s debt, After seeing the grand son he gets rid of the god’s debt and the look of a great grand son provides him heaven.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Shukadeva—‘The vultures are long-lived, all of them see many future generations. Grand son and great grand sons are absolutely negligible in their point of views. But it is not known how many of them were blessed with redemption.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Saying thus, the dispassionate Shukadeva went away to the forest.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-34">Power attained by penance</p>
<p class="Text">‘Mother! Make me drink the milk of the same sweetness.’ Coming home, Upamanyu sat down in the lap of his mother. Just a little before he had seen his maternal uncle’s son drinking the milk, he had also got a little milk.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Son! We are poor, there is want of food grain even to appease our hunger, then how can the milk be available?’ The mother persuaded the obstinate Upamanyu; but he could not be consoled anyway. The childish obstinacy is generally seen in such a way.</p>
<p class="Text">The mother had kept some food grain in the house having collected it. Having grinded it and mixing it with water she said to Upamanyu—‘Drink the milk.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘No mother! This is the spurious milk, the pure milk is sweet.’ Upamanyu refused to drink milk just while touching it to the mouth. He began to weep restively.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Son! Diamond, pearl, gem all are there in this world; but it is available only by the favour of fortune. We are unfortunate, so, it is difficult for us to get the pure milk. The Lord Shiv is omnipotent, When that Bholenatha is pleased, He does not hesitate to give the milk ocean even. It is His shelter that can fulfil the desire. He becomes pleased with penance. Upamanyu’s mother gave him the lesson. ‘I will perform penance, mother! I will shake the Almighty great God’s seat by the power of my penance.’ That merciful Lord would positively give me the ocean of milk. Upamanyu could not stay even for a moment in the house. </p>
<p class="Text-Black">* * *</p>
<p class="Text">Upamanyu started an austere penance on Himalayas. For the pleasure of Lord Mahadeva he abandoned the food and water even. By his penance the entire universe got grieved. Taking the gods with him Lord Vishnu going to the Mandarachala mountain said to Lord Shiv—‘It is only under your control to assure the universe by refraining Upamanyu from the penance.’ </p>
<p class="Text-Black">* * *</p>
<p class="Text">Such a dire penance is not for you, the child!’ Having alighted from the Airavata Indra introduced himself. ‘Your visit has made this hermitage holy; Upamanyu welcomed Indra and asked for devotion in the Lord Shiv’s feet.</p>
<p class="Text">‘It is very difficult to get Lord Shiv, I have control over all the three worlds; you, come in my shelter, I will provide you all the enjoyments’ Indra put him to test.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Indra! you cannot talk against Lord Shiv-devotion in this way, It seems that you are a demon in his disguised form. You want to create hinderence in my penance. You are reprover of Shiv; I will kill you; you have denounced my deity.’ Upamanyu rushed to kill, but suddenly, he halted.</p>
<p class="Text">‘You have acquired my devotion by your penance, I am pleased, my child!’ Shiv in the form of Indra granted him fearlessness. Upamanyu bowed down to his feet.</p>
<p class="Text">‘I was testing you.’ Having got emerged the ocean of milk, Chandrasekhara fulfilled the devotee’s desire. Placing him in the lap of Parvati the Lord said—‘The mother of Jagat is your mother and I am your father.’</p>
<p class="Text">The goddess imparted him the prosperity of Yoga and the Supreme Brahma knowledge. Being flourished, he began to eulogize the father and mother of the universe with the choked voice of emotion. Shankar along with Girija disappeared.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-35">Annihilation by libidiousness</p>
<p class="Text">In 'Hiranyakashyapa' family, demon Nikumbh’s sons—Sund and Upasund were outstanding vigorous and unrestrained. They were the chief of demons in their period. The both were the real brothers. They loved each other so much that the proverb—‘One soul in two bodies’ proved worthful in this case. The both were similar in their taste, interest and attitude, in their conduct and behaviour and in their motives. They lived together, ate together and remained associated with each other every where. Without the company of each other neither of them went anywhere. They talked very sweetly with each other and the both tried their best to cause comforts and making contented to each other.</p>
<p class="Text">Sund and Upasund, both the brothers started the performance of austere penance to become immortal together at the same time. Going to Vindhyachala mountain, they began to pass the life depending on only air. The lump of earth covered their bodies. At last, they began to make oblations to the fire cutting the pieces of the flesh of their bodies. When it remained only the skelton, having raised their hands above, on the base of the feet toe they started performing penance in the standing position. On account of their dire penance lingering for a long time, the Vindhya mountain got afflicted.</p>
<p class="Text">In the duration of the penance of both the demons, the gods tried to create hindrance by many ways. But all the temptations, fear and cheating proved in vain. At last, being satisfied witht their austerity, Brahmaji visited there. On saying to demand the boon the both demanded—‘May we both become the knower of all the illusory arms and become immortal.’ But Brahmaji did not accept to make them immortal. At last, after contemplation they said—‘If you can not grant us immorality, then, grant us the boon that both of us should never be defeated nor killed by anyone. If we die ever, we should die with the hands of either of us.’ Brahmaji on this agreed and said—‘Be it so!’</p>
<p class="Text">Having granted boons to the demons Brahmaji went away to his world and both of them came back to the demon world. The both decided to get the victory over the three worlds. Just after the start of their attempt, they became victorious. Whatever the boon they had acquired, knowing this, how could gods dare to fight the war? Just while getting the news of the demons attack, they ran away here and there leaving the heaven. These demons won the demi-gods, demons, serpents etc. After becoming the victorious overall the three worlds they ordered their attendants. ‘None should be allowed to perform Yagya, worship and study Vedas. The place or city where such activities are going on, should be burnt to ashes. Destroy the sages searching them out.’</p>
<p class="Text">By nature the cruel demons began to move round committing the murder of the Brahmans. They burnt the hermitages of the sages to ashes. If any seer cursed, it proved in vain due to the boon of the Brahmaji. As a result, all the austeres, the Vedas-reciters, self-restraint Brahmans, righteous persons, sages totally hid themselves in the caves of the mountains. There was neither Yagyas worship nor Vedas recilation in the society. But the demons were not satisfied with only this. They began to destroy the saints hidden in the caves assuming the form of cruel, lion, tiger, serpent etc., according to their will. Getting no other way out of this outrage for the peace, the group of seers and saints went to Brahmaji. At the same time the gods also had reached the Supreme Brahmaji to relate their misery to Him.</p>
<p class="Text">After listening to the misery of the gods and sages, the universe-creator Brahmaji called Vishwakarmaji and commanded him to constitute an outstanding beautiful woman. Taking the best portion of all the most beautiful objects of the world Vishwakarma constituted a woman. That woman body had no room for such a portion which was without extreme attraction; so Brahmaji named her Tilottama. She was so beautiful that all the gods and all the protectors of the worlds were charmed just seeing her.</p>
<p class="Text">With folded hands Tilottama asked—‘What is the order for me?’ The creator Brahmaji said—‘Go to the Sund and Upasund and try to create enmity between them.’</p>
<p class="Text">Tilottama accepted the order. Having saluted the creator Brahma, taking a round of the gods, she set out. Sund and Upasund were enjoying in the orchards of Vindhyachala along with their attendants. All the objects of enjoyment were present there. Both the brothers were drunk and sitting on a fine seat. The ladies were dancing. The singers were playing on different types of music on the musical instruments. Many of the people were praising to both the brothers. Plucking the flowers of nerium on the bank of river, Tilottama reached there. Just seeing her, both the brothers were infatuated to her. Being Infatuated with lust, Sund and Upasund both rushed to Tilottama together. Sund caught her right hand upsund caught her left hand. Both of them began to request her earnestly to become his wife.</p>
<p class="Text">Tilottama, looking with the side glance to the both, smiling said—‘First both of you should decide whom I should choose.’</p>
<p class="Text">On account of the infatuation to a woman both the brothers forgot their mutual affection. Each of the both wanted to adopt the woman as his own wife. First it was the intoxication of wine and secondly, the Cupid had made them blind. They forgot their good and bad. Angrily, Sund said to Upasund—‘She is my wife. She is like a mother for you. Leave her hand.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Upasund roared—‘She is my wife, not yours. She is like a daughter-in-law for you. Make haste to be away from her.’</p>
<p class="Text">Both of them got enraged. Being infatuated by passion, they took up the dreadful maces and began to assult each other. By the mutual assult their bodies being crushed, cut down at different many parts. It began to flow the waves of blood. At last, the both fell down like the lump of flesh being lifeless.</p>
<p class="Text">Tilottama’s task was done. She became a distinguished fairy of the Paradise. Indra again became the Lord of the heaven.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-36">The firm truthfulness</p>
<p class="Text">The king of Ayodhya, Harishchandra had donated his kingdom to a Brahman in the dream. When the Brahman, coming to him personaly, began to demand the kingdom, the king left the throne for him. But the Brahman was not a common Brahman and side by side he had no temptation of kingdom. It was the sage—Vishwamitra, who had come to test Harishchandra’s truthfulness by Indra’s initiation. Having taken over the kingdom, for the completion of this donation, he demanded one thousand gold-coins more as the sacrificial fee. The sage had already owned the entire prosperity, treasury etc., of the kingdom, he gave the relaxation of one month period extra to the king for the sacrificial fees.</p>
<p class="Text">The person, who was an emperor till now, got out of the royal palace as a pauper in a common dress with his queen and the prince. He was now, penniless. He had nothing even for the requirements of his journey. The food and water of his donated kingdom was, now, barred to him. That munificent and virtuous reached Kashi, the abode of Lord Vishwanatha. In the open market, he started proclaiming loudly to sell his wife as maidservant. The queen Shaibya, who used to be attended by hundreds of maidservants, was vended by a devout husband. A Brahman purchased her. Anyhow, after earnest prayer with difficulty, that Brahman allowed Shaibya, to keep the small son with her. But even after having sold the queen, Harishchandra could donate only half of the sacrificial fee. For the rest half, he sold himself to the hands of a pariah.</p>
<p class="Text">The queen Shaibya was now the maidservant of a Brahman. She had to do all the domestic works just as to fetch water, to clean utensils, to wash the floor, to lift the cow-dung etc. Her son—the delicate prince of Ayodhya, Rohitashva was passing the maidservant’s son life in this small age. On the next side, the pariah had appointed Harishchandra as the guard of funeral ground. That Harishchandra, there used to be the gathering of attendants and soldiers; in whose service, now used to walk to watch in the night with a stick in his hand all alone on the funeral ground. It had become his duty, to charge the tax from whosoever came there to burn the dead body.</p>
<p class="Text">It was not only the end of his misery. The snake bit Rohitashva. Well! Now how was it possible to share Shaibya’s company to the funeral ground for anyone to be available? Having taken up in her lap, that goddess came to the funeral ground wailing and crying in distress in the dead of night all alone. Hearing her wail, Harishchandra, too, reached there with stick in his hand to charge the tax. The dark cloudy sky, the terribly dark night, but in the light of the flashes of lightening, Harishchandra recognised his wife. The dead body of the son was lying before his sight and the devoted wife was crying; but Harishchandra had made his heart like thunder-bolt, Ah! O God! What a duty! Being bound by duty he said—‘O the auspicious! Without paying something as tax, you cannot perform the funeral ceremony of the son’s dead body. This is the order of my master not to allow any one for the funeral rite without charging the tax. My moral and duty is compelling me.’</p>
<p class="Text">Shaibya—‘What ‘tax’ should I give? What was there in the possession of that righteous woman? There was not even the shroud to cover the dead son’s body. She had brought him covered with the border of her ‘saree’. But she had to protect the husband’s moral duty even by sacrificing her life. She thought to give the half portion of her saree as tax. Harishchandra tried to tear half of her saree.</p>
<p class="Text">The test was over. The funeral ground got illuminated by the divine light. Having appeared the Lord Narayan had caught hold of the hands of Harishchandra. The personified truth, Shri Narayan was Himself fully satisfied with the Harishchandra’s fidelity to truth. He was saying—‘O the king! Now make your departure to the Vaikuntha with your wife.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘O the king! You satisfied me with your service. Now, you are free.’ Harishchandra saw that his master, the pariah was none else, but the Lord Dharmaraj, Himself.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">At the same moment, the seer Vishwamitra too, happened to arrive. He was saying—‘Son Rohit! Do stand!’ Just on his call, Rohitashwa got up as if from sleep. The seer said—‘O the king! Now, Rohit is mine and I am taking him away to enthrone him as the Emperor of Ayodhya.’<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-37">An honest trader</p>
<p class="Text">The great austere Brahman Jajali, had passed the third stage of life (forest life) in accordance with prescribed ordinance and devotion for a long time. Now, he had stood motionless on his leg only depending on air and he was performing very dire penance. Seeing him immovable, the birds misunderstood him any tree and having made their nest in his scattered hair they lay eggs there. That kind-hearted sage remained standing silently. The bird’s egg enlarged and hatched, the chickens came out of them. Those chickens also grew up and began to fly. When the bird’s offsprings became matured to fly and did not return for a month after flying away once, Jajali moved. He, himself, began to feel amazed on his penance and began to consider himself ‘Siddha’. At the same time an incorporeal voice came from the space—‘Jajali! Don’t be proud of. You are not a devout of such a rank as Tuladhara Vaishya, residing in Kashi.’</p>
<p class="Text">Hearing the incorporeal voice, Jajali was greatly astonished. At the same moment, he set out. On reaching Kashi he saw that Tuladhara was a common shop-keeper and he was giving the material items to his customers weighing them sitting at his shop. But Jajali was more astonished at the moment, when Tuladhara saluted him standing from his seat without any enquiry, having described his penance, he told him about the incorporeal voice and his arrogance also. Jaljali then asked—‘You are a simply a businessman, how did you acquire such a knowledge?’</p>
<p class="Text">Tuladhara said humbly—‘Brahman! I do my duty according to my class of birth honestly and very carefully. I sell neither wine nor any despicable object. I never cheat my customers in the weighment. The customer may be old or a child, he may be knowing the rate or not. I give him only the proper object exactly at the right rate. I never adulterate any spurious object with any item of my object. Taking the advantage of the customer’s difficulty, I never earn extra profit from him even. It is my duty to serve the customer, it always remains in my mind. I always work in the interest  of the customers, it is my duty even and it is the morality also.</p>
<p class="Text">Tuladhara stated onward—‘I always keep myself away from attachment, aversion, and greed. To the best of my capacity I donate in charity and welcome and attend the guests. The non-violent activities only appeal to me. Having given up the longing, I treat all the living beings with equal eye and I try to work in the interest of anyone.</p>
<p class="Text">On the query of Jajali, the saint Tuladhara delivered the sermons of righteousness in detail. He taught him that the Yagya involving with violence, inevitably results in misery only. Generally, too, in such Yagyas there is possibility of more mistakes and even a little mistake gives unfavourable result. The person, who causes trouble to the living beings, can never get pleasure and in the next world he can never get the benediction. ‘Non-violence only is the supreme righteousness.’</p>
<p class="Text">The birds who were born in the scattered hair of Jajali, came to Jajali after inviting them. They also affirmed the morality, stated by Tuladhara. The sermons of Tuladhara curbed the arrogance of Jajali.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-38">Arjun’s affection for shelter and war with Shri Krishna</p>
<p class="Text-Black">(Naradaji’s curiousity to see the war)</p>
<p class="Text">Once, while the great seer Galava was offering libation to the sun in the morning, going through the space path the demi-god Chitrasen’s spitted out spittle fell down into the cup-formed palms of his hands. The saint became  furious. He wanted to curse him but when the thought of the loss of his penance came to his mind; he desisted. Going to Lord Shri Krishna he made the complain. Shyamsundara was protetctor of Brahmans, he took vow at once to kill Chitrasen within twenty four hours. To satisfy the sage fully, he took an oath of mother Devaki and of the feet of the great seer also.</p>
<p class="Text">Galavaji had hardly returned when divine sage Narada reached there. The Lord welcomed him. After being calm Naradaji said—‘Lord! You are called the man of Supreme Bliss. The people become free of dismay by seeing you; but God knows why there looks the symptom of worry on your lotus face.’ Then after, Shyamsunder related the entire matter of Galavaji and told him his vow also. Now how could Naradaji be at ease? He was overjoyed. Without the time-loss, he reached Chitrasen. Falling down at his feet, bringing his horoscope etc. Chitrasen also began to ask the influence of his planets. Naradaji said—‘O! What are you asking all this? The end of your life has come already close to you. If you want your well-being, now, perform some charitable and virtuous deeds. Shri Krishna has taken vow to kill you within twenty-four hours.’</p>
<p class="Text">Now, the poor demi-god got perplexed. He started running here and there. He went on wandering about in all the worlds—Brahmadhama, Shivapuri, Indra, Yama, Varun everywhere; but none allowed him even to stay. Who would dare the enmity with Shri Krishna? Now, the poor demi-king along with his wailing wives came to the shelter of Naradaji. Naradaji is always kind-hearted; he said—‘Alright! Move away to the bank of Yamuna.’ Reaching there pointing out a place, he said—‘Today in the midnight, a woman will come here, Keep wailing in loud voice at that time. That woman will save you. But mind it, until she takes vow to save you from your troubles, you will not disclose her the cause of your trouble even by mistake.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Narada was also a strange being. On one side, he persuaded Chitrasena in this way, On the other side, he reached Subhadra in the Arjun’s palace. The seer  said—‘Subhadra! The conjuction of festivals today is very significant. Today in the mid of night, by bathing in the Yamuna river and protecting any poor one, there will be the gain of undecaying fruit of righteousness.’</p>
<p class="Text">It was the opportunate moment of the midnight. Subhadra, along with her one or two female friends reached the Yamuna river for bath. The pathetic voice of wail was heard to them there. Naradaji had already mentioned them the significance of the poor-rescue. Subhadra thought—‘Let us gain the undecaying fruit of the righteous deed today. She at once went there and found Chitrasen wailing. They asked thousand times, but he disclosed nothing without promise. At last after, taking vow and being bound to her vow, he disclosed his conditions clearly. Now, hearing this, Subhadra fell into a dilemma and suspense. On one side it was Shri Krishna’s vow and on the other side her own promise. Ultimately, having determined the protection of the shelter-seeking, she brought him with her. Having arrived home she put the entire situation before Arjun. Chitrasena was also the friend of Arjun. Arjun consoled Subhadra and assured her that her promise would be fulfilled at any cost.’</p>
<p class="Text">When Naradaji was confirmed of the success of his planning on this side, then he reached Dwarika and disclosed it to Shri Krishna that Arjun had given shelter to Chitrasen, so, only after thoughtful consideration you should proceed for war.’ The Lord said—‘Naradaji! Just see once to try to persuade Arjun on my behalf to turn back.’ Now, again the seer went rushing, reached Indraprastha from Dwaraka. Hearing all about, Arjun said point blank—‘Though, I am in the shelter of Shri Krishna by all means, and simultaneously, I possess only His power, yet, I am now firm on His given precept of a Kshatriya to turn back from his duty never to deviate from the moral duty. It is only His power-base through which I will keep my promise. It is He only who is capable of giving up the promise.’ The seer now came to Dwaraka in haste and narrated the view of Arjun as it is. Now, what should be done? The war preparation was made. All the Yadavas and Pandavas with their armed forces came face to face. The tumultous war broke out. It was a fierce war, but neither of them could win. At last, Shri Krishna used His Sudarshan Chakra. Arjun used Pashupatastra appreherending the situation of dissolution of the world, Arjun remembered Lord Shankar. Then He persuaded both of the arms. Then, He reached the devotee affectionate Lord Shri Krishna and began to plead—‘Lord! ‘All the Vedas, Purans, Seers and Gods are the witness that Rama always fulfilled the interest of His devotees. It is your natural characteristic to forget Your promise before the devotees. There would have been numerous sets of examples repeated. It is enough! now,at least do end this frolicsome activity.’</p>
<p class="Text">The arrows were exhausted. The Lord deviated from the war. Embracing Arjun to His bosom, He freed him from the labour of war and made Chitrasen fearless. All rejoiced and shouted ‘well done, well done’.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">But it did not appeal to Galava. He said—‘It was a good joke!’ The seer of the pure heart spoke out—‘Now, see, I show my power. I just burn Krishna, Arjun, Subhadra including Chitrasen to ashes.’ But no sooner did the poor took the water in the palms of his hands, Subhadra came to speak—‘If I am the true devotee of Krishna and my fidelty to my husband is accomplished this water may not fall down on the earth from the hands of the seer!’ It was so. Galava felt very much ashamed of. He saluted the Lord and returned to his residing place. Then all went away to their abodes.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-39">Excellent munificence</p>
<p class="Text">Infact the real name of Karn was Vasusheni. From the womb of his mother Vasushen was born wearing the divine armour and earring. His armour which was clinged to his body like the skin, was impregnable by the arms and weapons and had grown with the growth of the body. His earrings were drenched with nectar. So long as, his earrings were in his ears, his death was not possible.</p>
<p class="Text">Karn was a warrior like Arjun. It was well known to all that in the war it was only Karn who could stand equal to Arjun. The war seemed to be inevitable. In the Pandavas-side all were afraid of Karn. Dharmaraj was feeling restless due to the fear of Karn. At last, the king of gods Indra conveyed the message to Yudhishthir—‘I have thought of the plan to perish the invincibility of Karn, you should not worry.’</p>
<p class="Text">All at once, Karn saw a lustrous Brahman in the dream in the night. That Brahman was saying—‘Vasushen! I demand a promise from you. If any Brahman demands your armour and earring you will never give it to him. </p>
<p class="Text">Even in the dream, Karn got startled—‘What do you say? If any Brahman demands anything from me and should I refuse?’</p>
<p class="Text">It was the dream when the Brahman said—‘Son! I am your father sun. King of gods Indra wants to cheat you. So, accept my advice.’</p>
<p class="Text">Karn replied humbly—‘You are my father, you are venerable to me, I salute you. Kindly, excuse me. It may be Indra or anyone else. In the form of a Brahman, if anybody comes and demands something, I will not be able to refuse him like a miser.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Sun disappeared. The next day, the king of gods Indra visited in the disguise of a Brahman. Having accepted Karn’s reception, he said—‘I have come to demand something from you, but promise me will you give?’</p>
<p class="Text">Karn said—‘Lord! Vasushen has never disappointed any Brahman. Even without giving, my these words are just like having given.’</p>
<p class="Text">Indra said—‘I want your armour and earring which cover your body since the birth.’ Karn took the sword and having cut his body skin with his own hands, handed over the earring and armour, drenched with blood to Indra.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Your body will never be deshaped,’ Indra blessed him, but the king of gods could not depart for the heaven without granting any boon after accepting the charity from him. So, he gave his infallible javelin to Karn and went away with the armour and earring.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-40">At the moment of mourning why rejoicing</p>
<p class="Text-Black">(Shri Krishna’s Love to Arjun)</p>
<p class="Text">Bhim’s great valourous demon-son, Ghatotkach was killed. The Pandavas camp is overwhelmed with sorrow all the eyes are shedding tears, it is only Shri Krishna, who is pleased. He uproars with delight again and again and comes to dance moving to and fro in delight and embracing Arjun to his neck and pats on his back.</p>
<p class="Text">Seeing the Lord so happy, Arjun asked—‘Madhusudan! At this sad moment of Ghatotkach’s death the entire family is drowned in the ocean of sorrow. The entire army force is running away being disinclined. Why are you so happy at this moment? There are not the common reasons that you do so, please, unfold it.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord Shri Krishna said—‘Arjun! It is really an occasion of great happiness for me today. Ghatotkach did die, but my soul like dear, Arjun got saved. This is the cause of my happiness. Karn possessed the armour and ear ring. He was invincible due to this, but no doubt Indra took them away having demanded it. But Indra gave Karn such a power as such while possessing it, I always considered your life is in danger, at all. Karn is Brahman’s devotee, truthful of the vow, austere and kind to even the enemies also. So, he is called Vrish’ (bullock) or ‘Dharma’ (religion). One cannot kill him even in a smooth condition, but who was there capable to kill him when he was endowed with Power? Karn wanted to kill you with that Power. Today, Ghatotkacha was killed by the use of that power, so now, consider Karn as if dead. That is why I am very happy.</p>
<p class="Text">As regards Ghatotkach’s death, I do agree that Ghatotkach was no doubt, the young one of this family, and he was valorious also, but he was sinner, malicious of Brahmans and the destroyer of the Yagyas. I, myself, want to kill such wickeds. So, it is I who has got him killed, I always, stay only there for my activities where there is the existence of Vedas, truth, restraint, purity, righteousness, shame to evil doing, prosperity, patience, and forgiveness. That is why, I am with the Pandavas Arjun! you are my dear soul, I am highly delighted today by your being safe in this way.’ Arjun was puffed up with joy after hearing the Lord’s words, drenched with love and affection. Arjun got his solution.</p>
<p class="Text">Then again Satyaki asked—‘Lord! When Karn had already decided to use his that infallible power only against Arjun, then, why did he not use it? In the battlefield, Arjun did always come to him face to face’ Then, the Lord Shri Krishna said—‘O Satyaki! Duryodhan, Duhshasan, Shakuni, and Jayadrath always daily used to advise Karn to use that power only against Arjun. After the murder of Arjun, all the Pandavs and Srinjay will die without any efforts and Karn also had already made this promise. Daily, he thought to kill Arjun by that power, but no sooner did he come before him, I used to charm him. That is why he could not use that power against Arjun. Even then, Satyaki! That power is the death form for Arjun—I used to remain worried due to this anxiety, I did not even sleep in the night. Now, that power has been got destroyed by using it against Ghatotkach. Seeing it, I feel that Arjun has now, been set free from the death-clutches. In the war, I think the need of the protection of Arjun’s life so much, as I don’t think the need of even my father, mother and brothers like you and not even my own life’s protection as much. In comparision to the kingdom of all the three worlds, if I get more rare object than this even then. I don’t prefer that without Arjun. That is why, as if Arjun has again come back after death, It is seeing this, I am rejoicing very much.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-41">Goddess Sita’s Power and Prowess</p>
<p class="Text">Once, when Lord Shri Rama were seated in the assembly along with his body of attendants, Vibhishan looking restless excessively along with his wife and four ministers happened to come running and taking the long and fast breath again and again began to say—‘O the Lotus-eyed Rama! Protect me, protect. Kumbhakarna’s son, the demon named Mulak whom Kumbhakarna had got left in the forest on account of his being born in the kernel star, but the bees had brought him, up after growing up matured, having pleased the lord Brahma by his penance and then being proud of His power, has created chaos. When he came to know about Your victory over Lanka, coronation of the kingdom to me, he hurried to Lanka accompanied by the inhabitants of the nether world attacked on me. I went on fighting war for about six months anyhow. Last night, with my son, wife and ministers any how I have reached here through the tunnel-path escaping myself. He said—Having killed the spy Vibhishana first, I will kill my father’s murderer, Rama also then after. O Raghava! He must be coming to you also; in such a situation, whatever, you consider porper, do it at once.</p>
<p class="Text">Affectionate to His devotees, Lord Shri Rama had though, so many very important works even at that time, yet having heard the pathetic narrative of the devotee, he, at once, got his sons—Lav and Kush, Lakshman and his brothers and the entire monkey army ready, and started for Lanka, at once by Pushpak plane. Mulkasur came to know about the Raghavendra’s advent. He also got his army ready and came out of Lanka to fight. A fierce tumultous war broke out. The war continued for seven days. Without any break, A big difficult problem arose. From Ayodhya Sumanta etc., all the ministers also came to arrive. Hanumanji continuously went on making the dead soldiers of the monkeys, bears’ and human army, alive, by bringing life giving medicine (Sanjivani); but the result of the war seemed reverse only. The Lord was sitting under the Kalpavriksha (the tree fulfilling all the desire) in anxiety. Mulkasur had gone into the secret cave for witchcraft oblation. Vibhishan was giving this secret information to the Lord. At the same time Brahmaji came there and began to say—Raghunandan! I have granted him boon to be killed only by the woman’s hands. Besides this there is one thing more, listen to this also. One day, being distressed terribly he uttered among the saints such a sentence—‘My entire clan was destroyed because of this violent Sita.’ On this being annoyed one of the saints cursed him—‘Wicked! The same Sita, whom you have addressed as ‘Chandi’, will kill you.’ No sooner did the Muni say this, than this demon of the wicked soul swallowed him. Now, what more, the rest—all the saints drew away from there silently being afraid. So, there is no, now, treatment for him. Now, it is only Sita who can be capable to kill him. In such a situation, Raghunandana! It is better to call Sita, here, at once, and try to get him killed. This is the only way of his murder.’</p>
<p class="Text">Having said so Brahmaji went away therefrom. The Lord Shri Rama also sent Hanumanji and Vinatanandan Garuda, to bring Sita by Pushpak plane-safely, without any delay. On the next side, the daughter of Janak, Sita was passing through a strange condition. She didn’t feel at ease at all even for a moment in the separation of Raghavendra Ramachandra. She watched from the top of the palace again &amp; again having lifted herself there with the hope that whether Lord Shri Ram might be coming from the south probably by his Pushpak plane. Being disapponted from there, she came back again under the vineyard with the hope of getting coolness. Sometimes for the victory of the Lord, she made the circumambulation of basil, the idol of Shiva, Pipala etc., and sometimes she got the Brahmans, recited ‘Manyusukta’. Sometimes having worshipped goddess Durga, she demanded that Shri Rama should return as victorious very soon and sometimes she got ‘Shatrudrika-muttering by the Brahmans. She never felt sleep and remained sleepless. She vowed to make offering to so  many gods and goddess of the world and remained indifferently to the different types of dishes and decorations of her body. In this way her days were passing like an era. In the meanwhile, garuda and Hanumanji reached there to her. Hearing the message of her husband, Sita started at once and reaching Lanka, she glanced the view of the Lord beneath the Kalpavriksha (the tree to fulfil all desires). The Lord asked the cause of her weakness. The goddess said smiling with rhymes—‘Lord! It was all due to your separation. In your absence, neither I feel sleep nor hunger. I, separated from you, remained forcibly absorbed in your meditation day and night like an ascetic. I have no knowledge about the condition of the body.’</p>
<p class="Text">Then after, the Lord narrated about the prowess of Mulkasur etc. After then, what more! Enough it was! The goddess got enraged. An other Tamasi energy came to emerge from her body, its tone was terribly dreadful. She proceeded towards LaÆka. In this period, getting the hint of the Lord, the monkeys, reaching the caves, got Mulakasur detached from the witchcraft oblation. When he ran after them his crown fell down, yet he came in the battlefield. Seeing Sita’s reflection he said—‘You! Run away. I don’t use my vigour on the women.’ But the reflection said—‘I am the goddesss of your death. You had killed the Brahmans favourite to me, now, I will pay off their debt having killed you.’ After stating thus, she shot five arrows at Mulaka. Mulaka, too, started shooting  arrows. At last, using ‘Chandikastra’, the shadow cut off Mulkasur’s head. That head fell down at the gate of Lanka. Making uproar in distress, the demons ran away. The shadow, coming back, entered Sita’s body. After then, Vibhishan showed the Lord, the entire Lanka, because due to father’s exile,  first time, he could not be able to visit Lanka. Sitaji showed him her residing place—Ashok Van. For a while she walked about also in the orchard, holding His hands with her hands. Then, staying in Lanka for some days, They returned Ayodhya with Lav-Kush by the Pushpak aeroplane.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-42">The ideal of a gallant mother </p>
<p class="Text">In the ancient time there was a sharp-witted and very intelligent and glorious Kshatriya woman, named, Vidula. Her son, Sanjay had been defeated by his enemy in the war. His defeat disappointed him. Being defeated, he remained staying inside the house. Seeing her son inactive, Vidula began to rebuke him—‘O the coward! You are not my son. You, the blot of the family! Why were you born in this clan, admired by the braves? You are lying like the impotents. Why are you counted among the male persons? If there is vitality in your arms, take up the arms and oppress the rivals. The small rivers overflow with a little water, the cup formed palms of rats are filled with a little objects and the cowards are contented with a little. But you are a Kshatriya! the Kshatriya woman bears a son to win glory only. Stand up! Be ready for the war.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Son! It is proper for you to achieve victory in the war or having given up your life, piercing the sun-orb, to attain the supreme position, which is rare even to the Yogis, Kshatriyas do not give up their lives lying on the bed as diseased, war is the moral duty of a Kshatriya. Being indifferent to your duty why do you want to remain alive? O the impotent! The base of the kingdom, Yagya, charity and enjoyment is already destroyed and becoming a coward you deviated from your duty also; even then, why do you want to remain alive? Due to you the lineage is sinking, rescue it.’</p>
<p class="Text">The person who is not reputed in the society or the gods don’t consider him worthy of welcome, is neither a male nor a female; he is the worthless burden of the earth only to increase the number of mankind. Really, the person, who could not get repute in any of the spheres of charity, truth, penance, knowledge, wisdom, is like the mother’s excrement. In the real sense, the man is he who has distinguished himself in the study of Shastras, in the practical use of weapons, in the austerity or in wisdom. It does not become you to lead the life of a beggar like fools and cowards. The persons who live the life of disrespect looking towards others for food and clothes of lower breed, mean-hearted, only please the enemies and prick to the kiths and kins like thorn.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Oh! It seems that we will have to die like a pauper being deprived of the kingdom. You are a blot to the family. You are a man to act against the worth and glory of the family. I will also become the sharer of infamy on account of bearing you in my womb. Let not any woman bear the eunuch discourageous son like you. It is better even to extinguish even after a momentory glow of vigour on the forehead of the enemy. One, who is lazy, can never earn fame.</p>
<p class="Text">So, still make efforts having given up the gloom of defeat.</p>
<p class="Text">Having been rebuked by the mother in this way, Sanjay said being grieved—‘Mother! If I go away somewhere, or if I die just in front of you, what will you do with the kingdom, wealth and pleasure-enjoyment?'</p>
<p class="Text">Vidula said—‘I want that your foes should get defeat, poverty and misery and your well-wishers should get repute and prosperity and delightfulness. Don’t adopt the habit of life of the poor persons being brought up by the other’s food. Make such an effort as the Brahmans and friends may get their livelihood remaining in your shelter. The life only of the person whose shelter is sought for the livelihood like the tree, laden with the ripe fruits, is useful.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Son! Mind it, if you give up, then after, soon, you will have to follow the path of the courage graded persons. Just as the man on the edge of death does not like the medicine, similarity my salutary words are not appealing you. Our enemies are at present, very mighty; but if you stand to make efforts and you have enthusiasm, your enemy’s foes will join you. Your well-wishers also will start coming to you. Your name is Sanjaya, the effort to get victory is not seen in you. So, prove your name meaningful.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Son! Whether victory or defeat, whether the kingdom is attained or not, considering the both equal; now, wage the war with firm determination and firm resolve. Victory or defeat depends on the luck according to the favour of time but the best person is he who never feels disappointed. Sanjaya! I am the daughter-in-law of a reputed family and wife of a reputed person. If I don’t find you, doing the good work enhancing the glory, how will I get peace? To die is better for me than to be called the mother of a coward and impotent. If you want to remain alive, then, make efforts to defeat your enemy! Otherwise, it is better to die than to live poor dependedent on others forever.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Even on such challenge and excessive stimulation of the mother in this way, Sanjaya said—‘Mother! You are kindless and stone-hearted woman. I am your only son. If I were killed in the war, will you get peace and comfort with the wealth and kingdom that you want to send me to the battle-field?’ </p>
<p class="Text">Vidula said—‘Son! A man should make efforts for the righteousness and wealth. I am prodding you to go to the battlefield for the accomplishment of the same righteousness and wealth. If you were killed in the war, you will obtain repute in the next world, you will be liberated and if you were victorious, you will enjoy the royal comforts in this world. If you turn away from your duty, you will be humiliated in the society. You will do a great ill to yourself as well as to myself. If because of my attachment, I don’t check you from this evil, that will not be called affection. I don’t want you to go ahead on such a path as leads you to bear insult and poverty in this world, and after death to get the downfall and misery like the persons, deviated from their duties. Restrain yourself from going on the path of the cowards and which is always condemned by the noble persons. One who pours down one’s affection on one’s humble, dutiful, laborious bearing a moral character and virtuous son, is true and his affection is real.</p>
<p class="Text">One who pours his affection on a son devoid of venture, modesty and good conduct, is good for nothing to be the father of a son and it is meaningless. The Kshatriyas are born to sacrifice their lives in the battlefield to get victory over their enemies. Prove your birth worthful</p>
<p class="Text">The sermons of the mother stirred up Sanjay’s sentiments of prowess. His zeal and enthusiasm got animated. He accepted the order of his mother. He got himself engaged in the reorganisation of his force being free from indifference and fear. As a result, defeating his enemy he recovered his kingdom.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-43">The true forgiveness wins the hostility</p>
<p class="Text">The king Vishwamitra along with his army had gone out for hunting. Wandering about in the forest he reached near the hermitage of the sage, Vasishtha. The sage received him warmly Vishwamitra got amazed to see that the austere sage residing in the hut, welcomed his whole army with the royal dish. When he came to know that it was the influence of the Nandini cow that Vasishthaji could do so, he demanded the cow from the sage. When, the sage did not agree to give the cow at any cost. Then, Vishwamitra began to take away the cow by force. But by the order of Vasishtha, Nandini originated the fierce warriors by her roaring and being wounded by these soldiers, Vishwamitra’s armymen ran away.</p>
<p class="Text">All the divine weapons of the king Vishwamitra had proved to be powerless after having been dashed against Vasishtha’s Brahma-dand. Having performed dire penance, Vishwamitra acquired more divine weapons again; but the Brahma-dand of Vasishtha made them also useless. Now, Vishwamitra came to realise that the arms power of the Kshatriya can not assail any harm to the austere Brahman. He started penance having determined to acquire Brahmanhood himself. After the austere penance of hundreds of years, Brahmaji appeared before him, then even he said—‘If Vasishtha accepts you as ‘Brahmarshi’, then, you will be a Brahman.’</p>
<p class="Text">For Vishwamitraji, it seemed to be a great insult to beg before Vasishthaji and by chance, whenever Vasishthaji met him, he addressed him calling as ‘Royal Sage’ (Rajarshi) only; and it went on increasing the annoyance of Vishwamitra. He had become a terrible opponent of Vasishtha. Having prompted a demon, he got hundred sons of Vasishtha killed. He himself used to watch the opportunity to insult, to humiliate and to assail harm to Vasishtha.</p>
<p class="Text">‘I will become the Brahma of the new creation to create it myself.’ Having failed in his purpose, Vishwamitra stooped to a piculiar obstinacy. Really on the strength of his dire penance he started to a new creation. He had been going on creating new grain-food, new shrubs and trees, new animals. At last Brahmaji came and checked him. He assured him that his created objects and living beings would exist in the world like the living-beings as Brahmic creation.</p>
<p class="Text">Being failed in his all efforts, Vishwamitra determined to kill Vasishtha himself. Several times, he  had been defeated in coming face to face; so being fully armed with weapons, in the night, secretly hiding himself he reached the hermitage of Vasishtha. He wanted to kill Vasishtha unknowingly. It was a moonlit night, out of his hut, The seer Vasishtha was sitting on the altar with his wife. In the wait of the opportune time Vishwamitra remained hidden in the screen of the trees.</p>
<p class="Text">At the same time, Arundhatiji said—‘How spotless the moon-light has spread on!’ </p>
<p class="Text">Vasishthaji said—Today, the moonlight is so bright just like the lustre of Vishwamitraji’s penance illuminating all the directions.</p>
<p class="Text">Vishwamitraji heard and became stunned as bitten by a snake. His inner conscious reproached him—‘See to, whom you have come to kill, whom you rancour day and night, what is he, that great man is praising the murderer of his hundred sons to his wife in the lonliness.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">Vishwamitra threw down the arms and weapons from his body. He ran and fell down bowing prostrated on the ground before Vasishtha. The rooted hostility had been over forever. The natural forgiveness of Vasishthaji had got victory over it. Having given up hostility and weapons, today, the austere Vishwamitra had attained Brahmanhood. Having alighted from the altar, the seer Vasishtha lifting him up with both hands was saying—‘Stand up, ‘Brahmarshi!’<span></span></p>

One day, he reached Brahmaji and said with folded hands—‘Pitamaha! Now, there is no trace of great generous donator—the king Bali. I search out him everywhere, but I fail to find him anywhere. Kindly, tell me his address.’ Brahmaji said—‘Your this act is not proper. Although, on anybody’s query, wrong answer should not be given, so, I tell you the address of Bali. At present, Bali resides in any vacant house in the form of camel, bullock, donkey or horse.’ Indra said—‘If I find Bali anywhere, should I kill him with my thunderbolt or not?’ Brahmaji said the king Bali—‘O! He does not deserve to be killed. You should learn some lesson approaching him.’</p>
<p class="Text">Thenafter, Indra putting on the divine ornaments, riding on Airavata set out in search of Bali. At last, he  saw a donkey in a vacant house and on the basis of different traits he presumed that it is he—the king Bali. Indra said—‘O the demon king! at present, you have assumed a unique appearance. Don’t you repent on your this pitiable condition? Where is your royal umbrella, whisk and Vijayanti garland? Where is your that great vow of unhampered religious donation and where are your Sun, Varun, Kuber, Fire and Water form? ‘Where have gone all these?’ Bali said—‘O the divine king! At this time you will not be in the position to see my royal umbrella, whisk, throne etc., objects. But again my good days will come back. Then only you will view them. Now being arrogant in your prosperity you are humiliating me. This betrays your little wit. It seems that you have forgotten your old days. O Indra, knowing well, that your those days will come back again. O the divine king! In this world nothing is stable and certain. It is the time that destroys everything. Having come to know well the strange secret of the time, I never repent for anything. The time spares none-rich, poor, vigorous, weak, preceptor-fool, handsome, deshaped, fortunate-unfortunate, child, young, old, saint, austere, brave and big arrogants none at all and devour all and sundry equally and swallows all as of its breakfast. In such a situation, O the divine king! Why should I worry? It is merely the sport of time that makes any one to get gain and loss and happiness and misery. It is the time only that bestows upon everything to everyone and again snatches it also. It is the influence of time all the works prove to be successful. That is why Vasav! Your arrogance, passion and the egotism of prowess is merely your ignorance. The gain of prosperity or the loss of the prosperity is not under the control of anybody’s hand. Sometimes the man reaches the top of progress and sometimes he falls down. This is the law of nature and the world, so, one should  not be puffed up with joy in progress or dismayed in distress. Neither there is always progress of anyone nor there is always deterioration or fall. It is the time only that provides anyone the highest position and it is the time that causes fall. You know it very well that it was one day when the gods, the forefathers, demi-gods, humankind, serpents and demons all were under my control. What more enough!—‘The people saluted that direction even where my presence used to exist, saying—‘Salutation’. But when the time reversed, my days also turned reverse and I came to reach this condition, then, who is there roaring and blazing to be spared from the clutches of time? I, alone, had the glaze of twelve suns, it was I to hold back water as well as send forth showers, it was I to illuminate all the three worlds, and it was I to inflame. It was I the sustainer and destroyer of the universe and it was I the generous donator, the cause of eclipse, it was I to arrest and release. I was Lord of the universe, but it was the change of time that my that prowess came to perish. The learned persons have named the time as irrepressible and Supreme God. Any sharp speed cannot make a man to cross the time. And it is that time controls me, you and all the beings Indra! Your mind and wisdom is just like that of children indeed. Perhaps, it is not known to you that thousands of Indra like you were born and destroyed. This royal prosperity and fortune what belongs to you now, is not your paternal property or your purchased maid-servant; really, it has already been possessed by thousands of Indra like you. It was possessed by me before you. Now, leaving me it has come to you and very soon it will transfer from you to someone else. Having come to know its secret, I never bother the least. A number of great devouts and righteous persons, virtuous kings along with their able ministers are even seen passing through the misery and lamentation, Besides it, contrary to it, I find the persons, born in a lower graded family becoming the king without the support of anyone. The outstanding meritorious beauty queen looks to be unfortunate and drowning into the ocean of misery and just its reverse the odd looking deshaped woman of bad character, unchaste, disgrace to the family looks to be very fortunate. I ask you here Indra! if the destiny and time is not the factor here, then what is the cause? The disasters caused by time can not be removed or restrained by talent or by force. Knowledge, austerity, charity and kiths and kins—none can protect the man stricken by time. Today, you are standing before me having thunderbolt in your hand. If I want, I may fell you down with a blow of the fist just at once. I may disguise in different dreadful forms just at this time if I want, and after looking it you may run away being frightened. But what should I do? It is the time to tolerate and not to show the prowess. So, I am devoting to spiritualism in the self-willed form of a donkey. By being grief-stricken, the grief is never blotted out, reversely it does expand. That is why I am fearless very much carefree in such a poor condition even. </p>
<p class="Text">Observing the outstanding patience of Bali, Indra praised him highly and said—‘Undoubtedly, you are really, a patient beyond the limit. You did not ruffle at all, in spite of seeing me, the bearer of the thunderbolt. Certainly, you are bereft of attachment and aversion and self-restraint. Seeing your cool-mindedness, compassionate to all the living beings and free from hostility. I am very much pleased with you. You are a great man. Now, I have no ill-will and the sentiment of hostility against you. May God bless you! Now, you may live freely without any suspicion of harm from my side and may you be free from anxiety and disease! And thus, wait for the right time.’</p>
<p class="Text">Having stated so, Indra, king of gods went away riding on his Airavata and Bali, again, got himself absorbed in self-contemplation.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-45">A wonderful reception</p>
<p class="Text">The sage, Durvasa is famous for his anger in all the three worlds. Once, wearing a piece of garment, having grown his matted hair, holding wooden stick of apple tree (Vilvadanda) in his hand, wandering about in the universe (all the three worlds) in the meetings and on squares he used to make in a loud voice, the exclaimation—‘I am Durvasa, Durvasa. I have been wandering about in search of a place to reside. Any one who wants to let me stay in his house, should express one’s desire. But on just a little fault, I will be annoyed. So, he who wants to provide me shelter should be strictly careful of the propriety of conduct, and should be very alert.’</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, exclaiming aloud, the great sage moved about in the divine world, in the serpents world and in this mortal world; but none dared to accept the misery of his proposal. While wandering about, he reached Dwaraka. His proclaimation reached Lord Shri Krishna’s ears. Having called him He got him stayed in His house, but the saint’s style of living was unique. Any day, he used to eat up the food-material of thousands of persons alone, and someday, he ate a little. Any day, he went out of the house and did not return  that day. Some day, he burst out laughing without any reason and sometimes he burst into tears loudly without any cause. One day, he entered his room and lighting fire to his bed, bedseats etc., running came to Shri Krishna and said—‘Vasudeva! I want to eat the sweetened preparation dish of rice and milk boiled together, feed me this dish at once.’ Vasudeva, too, was omniscient and omnipotent. He had already smelt his motive from the time before. So, he had already got ready the desired  food materials—sweatened preparation of rice milk and boiled together. Enough! He also served him that preparation still fresh and hot. Having eaten the dish he said to Shri Krishna—‘Vasudeva! Smear this remaining cooked rice mixed with milk and sugar on your whole body. Shri Krishna, too, did so in no time. He smeared the cooked rice mixed with milk and sugar on his head and on all the rest parts of the body. Shri Rukmaniji was smiling standing there. Durvasa happened to see her. Suddenly he anointed the same cooked rice on her body parts also and having joined her to a chariot, he mounted on the chariot. Then, the sage began to drive the chariot lashing just like the charioteer lashes the horse. Shri Krishna was watching all this silently. The Yadavs felt very much pained to see all this. The great indomitable sage riding on the chariot, drove out on the royal road. Rukmaniji used to fall down again and again. But the sage did not care just a little. At last, when she fell down being incapable to draw the chariot, the sage alighted from the chariot being annoyed and led her on the rugged path towards the south. The Lord Shri Krishna was also following him running after him with the anointed whole body with the cooked rice mixed with milk and sugar. He said to the sage Durvasa—‘Lord! Be pleased with me.’</p>
<p class="Text">Then, being pleased, Durvasa began to look towards Shri Krishna and said—‘Vasudeva! You have got victory over anger. I could not find any fault at you. Now, I am very much pleased with you and grant you the boon that you will be dear to all in the entire world. Your holy repute will spread in all the worlds. Whatever your objects, I have burnt or destroyed will be available in the same condition or in better condition. On account of anointing this whole cooked rice mixed with milk and sugar on your body, you will be free from the fear of death. You will be able to remain alive so long as you desire. Why did you not anoint your the sole of your feet with this sweet cooked milk and  rice? I did not appreciate your this action. Enough! The sole of your feet could not be fearless!’</p>
<p class="Text">Hardly, had Durvasa stated this, Shri Krishna saw towards his body, He found that his body was neat and clean and quite dirtless. Now, casting his glance towards Rukminiji, he began to say—‘O the auspicious lady! The old age, disease and the lustrelessness will never even touch your body. Your body will always spread fragrance and you will be the best of all the women and you will get name, fame and reputation and you will attain the company of Shri Krishna in the same Loka.’ Having uttered this, the sage disappeared. Taking Rukminiji with him Shri Krishnachandra came back home silently. On the arrival at his home, he saw that the objects what the sage had burnt into ashes, were found as they were earlier in the past and found placed at its place as before. All were taken aback to see the wonderful activity of the sage.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-46">Friendship-sustenance</p>
<p class="Text-Black">(Karn’s Significance)</p>
<p class="Text-Black">(1)</p>
<p class="Text">The Pandavs had completed the banishment of twelve years and incognito dwelling of one year. They were now marshalling their braves in their favour in the Upplavya city. To avoid fraternal war and the great massacre may be averled, Shri Krishnachandra went to Hastinapur to persuade Duryodhan as the messanger of the Pandavas; but the obstinate Duryodhan said point blank—‘Without war I will not give the land even of a needle point to the Pandavas.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Vasudev’s treaty-effort proved in vain. He began to return. Bhishm, Vidur, etc., who came out of the city to see him off, were made by Him to return; but calling Karn near him, He got him seated on His chariot. The charioteer was following driving the empty chariot of Karn.</p>
<p class="Text">Having got him seated on his chariot Shri Krishnachandra said to Karn—‘Vasusen! You are brave, considerate and righteous. Just see! Today, I unfold a secret before you. You are not the son of Adhirath of lower caste, you are the son of Kunti. Like other Pandavas you are also Pandava, the Pandu-son; because you were born of Pandu’s wife Kunti in her unmarried age, by the Sun.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Karn went on hearing silently, bowing down his head. Vasudev put his hands on his shoulders—‘You are Yudhishthir’s elder brother. Duryodhan is doing unjust work and he is assuming an isolent air only on your Prowess, leave him and accompany me. It is tomorrow when you will be coronated. Yudhishthir will be your Prince. The Pandavas will follow you. I will salute you. If including you, when the Pandavas will stand together as six brothers, then, who will dare to stand before them in all the three worlds?’</p>
<p class="Text">Now, Karn smiled a bit. He said—‘Vasudev! I know that goddess Kunti is my mother. I am the solar-son and morally, I am Pandava. But Duryodhan has always relied on me since beginning. When all were discarding me, Duryodhan adopted me, and honoured me. There is on me, the burden of so many obligations of Duryodhan. Only depending on my prowess he has decided to wage war. At such a moment, I will not betray him. Permit me, kindly, to fight from his side. It will be what you wish; but a Kshatriya brave should not die lying on his bedstead, better to die fighting in the battlefield and he should attain the heroic end—This is my desire.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Karn! If you don’t agree to my such an excellent proposal; then, do as you like. The war is inevitable.’ Shri Krishna got the chariot stopped.</p>
<p class="Text">Before alighting from the chariot, Karn said—‘Kindly, you must accept my one prayer. ‘I am Kunti’s son, kindly, maintain its secrecy because Yudhishthir is righteous. If he comes to know that I am his elder brother, he will hand over the kingdom to me and I will handover it to Duryodhan. I am grateful to Duryodhan. I am indebted to him. So, I will fight from his side at all; but from the core and corner of the heart, I want the victory of justice. The virtuous Pandavas should get back their kingdom. The victory is inevitably there where you stand, yet you should accept my earnest prayer.’</p>
<p class="Text">Saint Karn’s request was accepted. Having alighted from Shri Krishna’s chariot, he occupied the seat on his own chariot and returned for Hastinapur.</p>
<p class="Text-right-caption">—Mahabharata<span class="char-style-override-5"></span></p>
<p class="Text-Black">(2)</p>
<p class="Text">Having failed in his goal of treaty, Shri Krishna returned back. Now, the war was inevitable. Even the date of war was fixed. On the other side, Kunti was feeling terribly restless. Karn, her own son, was bent on fighting war against his brothers. Duryodhan was making much of himself with the support of Karn only. At last, Kunti Devi made up her mind to persuade Karn. She went out of the house all alone.</p>
<p class="Text">Having taken bath, standing in Ganges Karn offering evening libation facing towards the sun-god. Kunti Devi had to wait for a while. Having finished the evening offering, Karn turned his face. Seeing Kunti, Karn said with folded hands ‘O goddess, the son of Adhirath, Karn bows before you.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Eyes of Kunti were full of tears Being much abashed she said, ‘O son, do not tell yourself as son of Suta before me. I have come here only to say this that you are the son of the Lord Sun illuminating the entire world. You are born of unfortunate me I am your mother. Give up your obstinacy of fighting against your own brothers. Son! I have come today to beg of you only this much.’</p>
<p class="Text">Karn again folded his hands—‘Mother! You are right. I know that I am your son; but I am burdened with Duryodhan’s obligations. Duryodhan became my friend at that time, when there was none to help me. In the days of misery, I cannot give up the friendship of my friend. I will, at any cost, fight from the side of Duryodhan only.’</p>
<p class="Text">Kunti Devi said with choking voice—‘In spite of  being a mother, I came to you giving up my hesitation and it is you who are returning me disappointed.’</p>
<p class="Text">Karn said—‘Mother! kindly, pardon me, I am bound by my duty. But I give you words that, I will not make any fatal assault on any Pandava except Arjun. If ever, my other brothers even come before in the war, I will leave them. Your five sons will remain continuing to be alive. If Arjun were killed, your fifth son would be I and if I was killed, Arjun is already yours.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Remain mindful of your these words.’ Having blessed the goddess Kunti went back. </p>

<p class="Text-Black">(3)</p>
<p class="Text">Pitamah Bhishma always used to disdain Karn. In the beginning of the war, while counting great charioteers and charioteers he had addressed Karn as ‘Adhirathi’, Being annoyed Karn had taken vow that so long as Pitamah was the Commander-General of the Kaurava army, he would not hold the weapon. In the first ten days-war, Karn remained merely a natural spectator. On the tenth day, being wounded by the arrows of Arjun, Pitamah fell down from the chariot. The arrows, pierced into his body, became his bed-stead. After Pitamah’s fall, it was the cease fire. All of his nears and dears came to him. When this crowd was over, when lying on the bed stead, Bhishma Pitamah remained all alone, seeing the lonliness Karn came there. He said—‘Pitamah! always behaving impertinently before you, the Suta-son Karn offers his salutation to your feet.’</p>
<p class="Text">Bhishma Pitamah called Karn affectionately close to him and said in a choked voice being very emotional—‘Son Karn! I knew it that you are an outstanding brave and the best charioteer. You are a learned one having a great knowledge. But I always demoralized you to discourage you. This was the only my intention while addressing you as Adhirathi because it was your prowess that strengthened Duryodhan to get him bent on for war. If you had not shown your courage in the war, Duryodhan would have given up his obstinacy of war. I wanted that this massacre might be averted anyhow..........</p>
<p class="Text"> </p>
<p class="Text"> it happend as it was. I have never formed any bad opinion against you. I have no ill-will against you at all. Don’t mind for my words ever.’</p>
<p class="Text">Karn remained hearing bowing down his head. Pitamah said—‘Son! My sacrifice has already been made. If you want, this massacre can be averted still. I tell you today a secret. You are not the son of Adhirarth. You are solar prince and the son of Kunti. You are the eldest one among the Pandavas. Having given up devil Duryodhan’s company, you should follow your duty in the favour of your righteous brothers.’</p>
<p class="Text">Now, Karn said—‘Pitamah! Whatever you are saying is already known to me. But Duryodhan is my friend. He has always given me an honorable treatment. How can I betray a friend who has always obliged me. He relies on me only, in such a situation how can I leave him in his miserable days? At least you! kindly, permit me to fight the war. This is my heartiest desire to give up this body fighting in the war from the Kauravas side like the braves.’</p>
<p class="Text">Pitamah blessed him—‘Dear son! May your desire be fulfilled! Fight the war from the Duryodhan side with zeal and courage. Do your duty.’</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-47">Faith always makes the Lord near</p>
<p class="Text">In the Duryodhan’s deceitful gambling, having lost their empire, the Pandavas were residing in the Kamyak forest with Draupadi. But Duryodhan was not feeling at ease at all. He remained always worried about how to annihilate the Pandavas completely. By chance, the sage Durvasa visited at his place and stayed there for some days. Duryodhan satisfied him with his service. While departing, the sage asked him to demand any boon. The crooked–hearted Duryodhan said very humbly—‘O the sage! The Pandavas are my elder brothers. If you are pleased with me, I want that as you have obliged me to provide me the opportunity of your service, kindly, be generous even to provide my elder brothers also the opportunity of your service of at least one day. But this is my desire that you should receive their reception along with your all the pupils and visit there the moment when the queen Draupadi has already taken over her meals so that my brothers might not remain hungry for the long time.’</p>
<p class="Text">Really, the matter was that when the Pandavas went to the forest, prompted by their love, a number of Brahmans also accompanied them. By any way, they did not return. It was difficult to manage the food for such a large number of people in the forest. So, Yudhishthir pleased the Lord Sun by his penance and prayer. Providing a pot to Yudhishthir, The Sun said—‘To bring the bulbs roots and vegetable etc., from the forest and prepare it in this pot for food, that food will be unending. Thousands of persons can be served food till Draupadi takes her meal. After Draupadi’s eating, nothing will remain in the pot that day.’ Duryodhan knew this secret. That is why he prayed to Durvasaji to visit the Pandavas after Draupadi had already taken her food. Durvasaji agreed to his request and went away from there. Duryodhan was highly delighted to think that the Pandavas would not be able to serve him food and then, this angry sage will certainly destroy them by his curse. This is the obvious example of ill-will. </p>
<p class="Text">Durvasa had already given words to Duryodhan. Taking the mass of his ten thousands of pupils with himself, Durvasa happened to visit at the Pandavas residing place in the Kamyak forest. Dharmaraj Yudhishthir and his brothers, standing up from their seats, saluted the sage prostrating on the ground before his feet. They prayed him to take his seat on the mat. </p>
<p class="Text">The sage said—‘O the king! Be blessed! All of us are hungry and we have not even taken our lunch. Kindly manage for our meal. We just come back very soon after taking bath in the neighboring pool and being free from the afternoon prayer and worship.’</p>
<p class="Text">According to his nature, Dharmaraj said humbly with folded hands—‘O God! Come soon after being free from afternoon prayer.’ But when Durvasaji went away with his pupils. Yudhishthir and his brothers faces became emaciated due to anxiety. When they called Draupadi and asked her, she said that she had already taken her food. It was certain that the sage Durvasa would burn them to ashes by his curse if the food was not available to him and the food might be served to them, there was no wayout at all. Seeing her husbands worried Draupadi said—‘Don’t worry, you all! Shyamsundar will manage everything.’</p>
<p class="Text">Dharmaraj said—‘If Shri Krishna had been here, there would have been nothing to worry; but just now He has set out for Dwaraka with his attendants after meeting us. His chariot would have not yet even reached Dwaraka.’</p>
<p class="Text">Draupadiji said with firm conviction—‘Where does He come and go? What is that place where He does not abide? He is present here and just He will come.’</p>
<p class="Text">At once, Draupadiji went into the cottage and began to call that reliever of distress of the living beings to herself. The Pandavas saw that the Garudadhvaja chariot driven by four white horses of the Lord of Dwaraka reached there and hardly the chariot could stop, the Lord wearing the peacock feathered crown jumped. But this time neither He saluted anyone nor provided any opportunity to others to salute Him. He directly entered the cottage and said like an oppressed with hunger very eagerly—‘Krishne! I am terribly hungry, at once give me some food.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘You did come brother! I knew it that you would come just now!’ Draupadiji got as if a new life. She got up abruptly—‘The sage Durvasa is to be provided with food......’</p>
<p class="Text">‘First give me food. Then, anything else. I am even unable to stand due to hunger. Today Shyam had felt a strange appetite.’ </p>
<p class="Text">I have already finished my meals. The Sun gifted cooking vessel is already cleaned and washed. There is nothing left in the vessel your penury sister has remembered you for procuring food. Draupadi was looking of the jovial face of the Lord in amazement.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Don’t make excuses. I am very hungry where is that pot? Bring it, give it to me. Shri Krishnachandra as if heard nothing? Draupadi gave the pot in his hands silently. Holding the pot, Shyam peeped into it turning it to many sides. Just clinged to it a very small piece of vegetable leaf was ultimately traced out by Him and taking it out with his red fingers, he said—‘You were saying that there is nothing in it. What is this? It will appease the hunger of the entire world.’</p>
<p class="Text">Draupadi remained staring silently, and the Lord of Dwaraka put it into his mouth saying that—‘May God soul of the universe be satisfied with it! The Supreme soul Shri Krishnachandra belched of satisfaction, then, now, where was anybody left unsatiated in the universe?</p>
<p class="Text">There in the pond while bathing, the condition of Durvasa and his pupils turned strange. Everyone of them began to feel blench after blench. All of them felt that they had done overeating. In astonishment, they began to see one another. Watching his as well as his pupils’ condition Durvasaji said—‘The happening with Ambarish is now striking my mind. The Pandavas are in the forest. They are already in the short of food, really, my visit here was not proper and now, we are not in the condition to eat. His entire food materials will go waste, then, they may destroy all of us in a moment getting angry; because they are devouts. Now, there is only the single way left that all of us should run away from here as soon as possible.’</p>
<p class="Text">When Guruji, himself was ready to run away how the pupils were to stay? When Durvasa Muni fled with his pupils, he did not think at all to stay on the earth. He stopped directly in the world of Supreme Brahma. </p>
<p class="Text">Having eaten the vegetable leaf in the Pandava’s cottage, Shyamsundar came out smiling. Now, He saluted Dharmaraj and sitting there he ordered Sahdev to call the sage Durvasa for lunch. Sahdev went, but he returned alone after sometime. If Durvasa and his pupils had been there, then they could have been found out. Now, they were not present at all even on the earth.</p>
<p class="Text">Dharmaraj again began to be worried—‘It is not known when Durvasa will again come unexpected suddenly’ because, this nature of Durvasa was well known that he goes away having asked to prepare the food and comes back sometimes in the mid of night and sometimes after many days any time. Just coming back, the food should be served to him, a little delay annoys him and he knows only to curse.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Now he will not even peep towards this side. He had come here by the prompting of evil-hearted Duryodhan.’ The great protector of the Pandavas, Shri Krishnachandra assured them fully by narrating the entire occurance and then, being parted from them he went to Dwaraka.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-48">The punishment of theft</p>
<p class="Text">The sage ‘Shankh’ and ‘Likhit’ were two brothers. The both were the austere of high rank and the both had their separate hermitages. Once, Likhit visited Shankh’s hermitage. By chance, at that time, Shankh had gone out somewhere. Likhit was hungry, so he began to eat the fruits plucking from the trees of the hermitage. In the meanwhile Shankh happened to come. He asked him—‘Brother! how did you get these fruits?’ Smiling Likhit said—‘I have plucked them from this front tree.’ ‘Then you did commit a theft.’ Shankh said ‘So, you, go now, to the king and say to him—‘Award the punsihment to me what is given to a thief.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Likhit got highly pleased with this order of his elder brother as he had saved him from the sin of giving up the ideal. He went to the king Sudyumna and said—‘O the king! I have eaten the fruits of my elder brother without his permission, so, please, punish me.’</p>
<p class="Text">Sudyumna said—‘O the holy Brahman! If you consider the king an authority, then, he has got the right to pardon also. So, I pardon you.’ Besides this how should I serve you?’ But Likhit continued his earnest request. At last, the king got his both the hands cut down. Now, he again came to Shankh and begged for pardon. </p>
<p class="Text">Shankh said—‘Brother! I am very much pleased with you. You have the knowledge of righteousness. This is the punishment of the violation of righteousness. Now, going into this river, offer the libation to the gods and forefathers methodically. In future, never do anything immoral and never allow your mind to go towards the immorality.’ As soon as, Likhit began to offer reverently the water after having taken bath in the river, two hands like lotus appeared. He was greatly amazed at it, and coming to his brother, he showed him his two hands. Shankh, then, said—‘Brother! I don’t be suspicious, I have produced there two hands by the influence of my penance.’ Likhit asked—‘If your penance is so effective, then why did you not purify me first? Shankh said—‘It is right; but to punish you was not my right, it is duty of the king. It purified the king also and along with the forefathers you, too, became holy.’ The river where the arms to Likhit were produced, was named, later on, since that day, as ‘Bahuda’.</p>

<p class="Text">‘Sat Path’ passed and they reached the ascending divine land of the heaven. Draupadi, Nakul, Sahadev, Arjun—they began to fall down one by one serial wise. Whosoever fell, remained there left. It is worthless to discuss about rising up again after having fallen down in that ice land. The body got frost bitten at once. Who was there to prevent anyone giving up one’s life in that holy land from attaining the heaven. Yudhishthir was neither stopping nor did he watch his falling brothers down. He had gone beyond attachment or aversion. At last, Bhimasen also fell down.</p>
<p class="Text">When Yudhishthir reached the top of the ascendance to the heaven, he was not alone even then. His brothers and the queen Draupadi had fallen down on the way, but a dog was there with him. That dog had been following him from Hastinapur since start. Just on his reaching there, the king of gods, himself alighted from the divine plane from the sky. Welcoming Yudhishthir, he said—‘By your moral conduct, this heaven belongs to you. Be seated in this divine plane.’ Now, Yudhishthir prayed to take his brothers and Draupadi also to the heaven. The king said that they had already reached there earlier.</p>
<p class="Text">Yudhishthir made the second prayer—‘Please, get this dog also seated in the plane.’ Indra—‘Being a righteous why do you talk so? How can a dog get entry in the heaven? That unholy creature could see me only, it is enough.’</p>
<p class="Text">Yudhishthir—‘He had taken shelter in me. It is his devotion to me that he has come so far away from the city with me. The forsaking of a sheltered is immoral. The discarding of this sheltered is not desirable to me. I don’t want to go to the heaven without him alone.’ Indra—‘O the king! The attainment of heaven depends on the fruit merits. If he had been a virtuous soul why would he have been born in this ignoble class of birth?’ </p>
<p class="Text">Yudhishthir—‘I offer half of my virtuous merits to him.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Blessed, Blessed you are Yudhishthir! ‘I am pleased with you.’ Yudhishthir saw that having given up the disguised form of the dog, Dharmaraj Himself has appeared in person before him and was blessing him standing there.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-50">The result of false egotism</p>
<p class="Text-Black">(Barbarik’s murder)</p>
<p class="Text">Barbarika was the grandson of Bhimasena and his son, Ghatotkacha’s son. His mother was Mauravi whom Ghatotkacha had married after defeating her by his weapons, Shastras and talent. Barbarika was very brave, once, he had defeated Bhimasen by his very simple war, skill. When the thirteenth year of the Pandava’s banishment was over, all the kings gathered together for war from the place, named Uplavya. Starting from there, the great warriors Pandavas came to Kurukshetra, where the Kauravas, Duryodhan etc., were already present from the time before. At that time Bhishmaji had counted the warriors and great warriors of both the sides. When his majesty Yudhishthir came to know the news through secret agents, he said to the Lord Shri Krishna—‘Keshava! Which brave of Duryodhan, in how long time can massacre the Pandavas with their armies?’ On this question, Pitamaha and Kripacharya have taken vow to kill all of us within a month. Dronacharya took fifteen days, Ashwathama took ten days and always frightening me, Karn has announced to kill the Pandavas alongwith the army merely within six days—‘Devaki Nandana! Is there no such a warrior on our side who may express his reaction against it?’ </p>
<p class="Text">Hearing Yudhishthir words, Arjun said—‘Your majesty! All such proclamation by Bhishma as well as other warriors is irrelevant; because, the determination of victory or defeat in the war is not of any meaning. On this side, in your favour too, there are so many kings, who are unconquerable like the ‘time’. Well! Who is there to face even Satyaki, Bhimasen, Drupad, Ghatotkach, Virat, Dhrishtadyumna etc.? Even the never unconquerable Shri Krishna is on your side. So for as I think even a single warrior out of them is capable to destroy the entire Kaurava army. Well! From the old grandfather Bhishm, Dron and Kripacharya, what fear have we got? But even then, if your worry is not extinguished, I alone declare—‘I can destroy alone the entire Kaurava army in a single day—This is my exclaimation.’</p>
<p class="Text">Hearing Arjun’s words, Barbarik said—‘The saint Arjun’s vow is making me impatient. It is not tolerable to me. So, I say all of you along with Arjun and Shri Krishna remain only spectator. I just make the entire Kaurava army to reach the world of Death in fortyeight minutes. Just watch this dagger, blessed by the proved goddess Durga and my divine bow and arrows. By its support, my this task is quite easily possible.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Hearing Barbarika’s words, all the Kshatriyas got astonished. Arjun, too, felt humiliated and began to look towards Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna said—‘Partha! Barbarik has uttered according to his capacity. Many strange things are heard about him. In the past he had massacred nine crores of demons in a moment going to the nether world. Then, again He said to Barbarik—‘Dear son! how will you be able to kill the army protected by Bhishma, Drona, Kripacharya, Karn etc., such great warriors so soon? It is difficult even to Mahadevaji to get victory over them. What source have you got that you are speaking in this way? How should I believe in your words?’</p>
<p class="Text">On the querry of Vasudeva in this way, Barbarik at once, strange his bow and fixing his arrow on the bow and then he filled the arrow with the ashes of red colour and stretching it up to his ears, shot it. The ashes that flew from the point of that arrow, fell down on the delicate parts of both the armies. It did not touch the bodies of only five Pandavas, Kripacharya and Ashwathama. Now, Barbarik said—‘Just all of you watched! By this action, I got the notice of the delicate portions of all the warriors’ bodies who could die. Now, within forty-eight minutes, I just massacre them.’</p>
<p class="Text">Watching it and hearing this Yudhishthir and others got aback. All of them began to address Barbarik ‘Praise-worthy admirable!’ It created a great uproar. In the meanwhile with His sharp ‘Chakra’ (discus), Shri Krishna cut down Barbarika’s head. It caused a great pain to Bhimasena and Ghatotkach etc. At the same moment, Siddhambika etc., goddess happened to reach there and they exclaimed that Shri Krishna was not at all at fault. In the previous birth, Barbarik was a demi-god named Suryavarcha. When the earth was narrating her tale of sorrows and miseries before the gods on the Meru hill, being distressed by the burden, he had then said—‘getting incarnated, I, alone, will massacre all the demons. So long as I remain, no gods need to incarnate on the earth? On this, being enraged Lord Brahmaji had said—‘O the wicked-minded! You are making this desperate effort out of ignorance So, when the war breaks out to perish the burden of the earth, at the same time you will be killed by Shri Krishna and your body will be destroyed.’</p>
<p class="Text">Then after Shri Krishna again said to Chandika—‘Water his head with nectar, and make his head immortal like the head of Rahu.’ The goddess did so. After being alive his head saluted the Lord and said—‘I want to watch the war.’ Then, the Lord fixed his head on the top of the mountain. When the war was over, Bhimasen etc., felt very proud of their fighting and all began to praise of their ownself. At last, it was decided to ask from the head of Barbarik. Approaching him when he was asked, he said—‘I have seen only one person fighting against the enemies. There were five mouths and ten hands to the left side of the person in which he had assumed trident and other weapons and to the right side he had one face and four arms which were well equipped with ‘Chakra’ etc. The left heads were adorned with scattered hair the right hand was being illuminated with crown. His left side of the body was annointed with ashes and the right side was annointed with sandal. On the left side was brightening with the moon beam and the right side the ‘Kaustubha’ jewel was glittering. The same (Rudra and Vishnu) had destroyed the entire Kaurava army. I did not find any one else other than he, destroying the army. Just as he said this, the space got illuminated. It began to rain the flowers and the entire space was resounded with the sound of ‘Sadhu-Sadhu’.</p>
<p class="Text">On this Bhim and others were ashamed of their arrogance.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-51">The gambler became a king</p>
<p class="Text-Black">(The Wonderful Donator in the Heaven)</p>
<p class="Text">In the ancient time, there was a god and Brahman censuring famous gambler. He was blemished with all the vices like wenching etc., and he was a great sinner. One day, he earned a lot of money through deceitful gambling. Then, making a betel leaf with spices in the Swastic shape with his own hands, and with the fragrance and garland and other objects with it, he rushed towards the residence of a prostitute to offer her as a gift. On the way, his legs stumbled, he fell down on the ground and got fainted. When, he came to consciousness, he was greatly shocked and felt dispassion. He offered all the objects venerably to a Shiva’s stone phallus lying there. Enough! it was the only meritorious deed done by him in his whole life. </p>
<p class="Text">In the due course of time he passed away. The Death messangers took him away to the Yama world. The Lord Yama said—‘O the fool! You have to suffer in fierce hells on account of your sins.’ He said—‘Lord! If there is any virtuous deed even, kindly, consider it also.’ Chitragupt said—‘Before death, you have offered a bit of fragrance to the Lord Shiv, as its result, you will get the throne of Lord Indra—the rule of heaven for seventy-two minutes.’ The gambler said—‘Then, kindly, let me firstly be provided the fruit of my virtuous deed. </p>
<p class="Text">Now, he was sent to the heaven by the Yama’s order. The divine spiritual Guru Brihaspati persuaded Indra to leave his throne for three ghadis for that gambler. Again after seventy-two minutes do come back again.’ Just after Indra’s departure the gambler became the king of heaven. He thought ‘Well! now, there is no shelter-giver except Lord Shiv.’ So, being devoutedly he started donating the objects, under his possessions. That devotee of Mahadevaji donated the Airavat elephant (Indra’s elephant) to Augustji, he donated the ‘Uchchaihshrava’ horse to Vishwamitraji and the desire fulfilling cow (Kamadhenu) to the seer, Vasishthaji. He donated the ‘Chintamani gem’ to Galavaji and donated the desire fulfilling tree—Kalpabriksha to Kaundinya Muni. In this way, till time three Ghadis was not over he went on donating and he donated almost all the valuable objects there. Thus, after three Ghadis were over he went away from the heaven.</p>
<p class="Text">When the Lord Indra came back, he found that Amaravati (Paradise) was empty of affluence. He reached the Lord Yama with Brihaspatiji and said in annoyance—‘Dharmaraj! You committed a great blunder by allotting my post to a gambler. He performed a very bad action having reached there. Take it true that he donated all my gems and jewels to the sages and my Amaravati is devoid of all things now.’</p>
<p class="Text">Dharmaraj said—‘You grew old, but even till now, your attachment to the royal objects didn’t fade. The benevolence of the gambler proved better than your one hundred Yagyas. Really, those are the blessed one, who are not careless in spite of getting a big rule of kingdom and remain totally devoted in doing the virtuous deeds. Go, by giving the wealth etc., to Augustya and other sages, or falling on their feet get your gems and jewels back.’ ‘Very good’, saying this Indra came to the heaven and the same gambler, by the influence of prior practice of actions and on the basis of the result of his actions, became a renowned donator Virochan’s son—Bali without suffering the hell-tortures.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-52">The bondage by infatuation</p>
<p class="Text">Being dispassionate from the worldly affairs, while going to the forest, Lord Rishabhadeva had handed over the kingdom to his eldest son out of his hundred sons—Bharat. For a long time, Bharat remained the sole Emperor of the earth and sustained the subjects with pity. His wife was chaste and very modest and all his five sons were father-devotees and virtuous. All the attendants and secretaries remained ready in the majesty—Bharat’s service. But the real goal of man’s life is not the enjoyment of worldly objects. Bharat, himself, was a great scholar and God-devotee and indifferent to the worldly attachments and he had inherited from his father also only the divine property. He did the work of sustaining the subjects only as his duty with the duty sentiment obeying his father’s order. When the sons grew young, he handed over the royal affairs to them and he, himself, went away to the Pulah hermitage far away from the capital remaining all by himself and devoid of all possessious for devotion to the Almighty Lord. One, who enjoyed all the worldly comforts till yesterday, who was the Emperor of the entire earth, began to lead willingly a hard life of an austere person. Having collected the flowers, fruits etc., to bring it and worship the Lord with it, had become the daily routine of Bharat’s life. Muttering, penance and worship—even when going amidst the forest only to take bath and bring the objects of worship—became Bharat’s complete life as the propitating life. He was considerate, rational, God-devotee, and detached and now this penance perished even the remaining of the least dirt in his heart.</p>
<p class="Text">It is a matter of chance—One day, Bharat was muttering the name of the Lord in the standing position, in the water, having taken bath in the river flowing just near his hermitage. In the meanwhile a female deer separated from her group came to drink water in the river alone. The female deer was thirsty, tired and pregnant. She had hardly drunk the water to her full satisfaction, than the roar of a lion was heard from a close. Due to fear, without quenching the thirst the female deer turned and sprang to reach the bank. It resulted that the inborn baby of the stomach of that pregnancy-matured female deer came out and having fallen into the river water began to flow in the current of the river. The female deer could not bear this shock, she moved hardly a little distance, and sat down in the cave of the mountain at last. She gave up her life there.</p>
<p class="Text">While muttering divine names in the water standing, Bharat was watching all this. When the baby, having fallen down from the womb of the female deer, began to flow in the current of the river, he felt pity. He took up that newly born deer-youngone in his lap and having finished the muttering he brought it to his hut. He did bring the deer young-one; but a problem arose how to protect its life. Any how with constant attention and carefulness. Bharat saved that young-one. After some days the deer youngone itself grew up to be capable to graze the straw.</p>
<p class="Text">It was allright till now. It was his duty to protect a creature from the clutches of death; it was virtuous, but the duty did not end only to take it out of the river. It was quite proper to bring up and protect till it became capable of taking its food and running; but the attendants of divine potency hidden in the mind are always vigilant to get an opportunity to bind the embodied soul ever long before, the Emperor, Bharat, who had already abandoned the royal grandeur, his sons etc., his intimate connection  with them had been washed away from his mind, he was all alone in the forest, there was the secret sentiment of lonliness in his mind, and he had to take care of the deer young-one for the several weeks. He had to look after carefully. The attachment got opportunity, the detached Bharat developed his attachment to the deer young-one. His affection to the deer young-one developed. </p>
<p class="Text">This mind is a cheat. It always remains trying to prove its fault as if true by different logics arguments, dutifulness and morality. Bharat’s mind also began to say to him—‘This poor deer young one is helpless, its mother has died, now, it is I only who is its mother and father, it is in my shelter, to bring up it is my duty. When the flaw of mind gets if any opportunity, it takes no time for a wave to turn into an ocean. Bharat’s attachment to the deer young-one went on expanding. Even, while busy in the worship or evening prayer, he used to watch it, after worship he blessed it, if the deer youngone went away ever to the forest, being restless he waited for it and if there was any delay in its return, he used to pray the gods to come it back safely. </p>
<p class="Text">Time waits for none. Bharat’s life span also came to end and death-time approached. The deer young one which had now, grown up to be matured deer, had begun to love him deeply. At the time of his death, it was only staring at him just sitting near him. Bharat too, was gazing it very affectionately and he was thinking being restless—‘How will this poor one remain in my absence?’ In the same condition at the same time he left his body.</p>
<p class="Text">Wise, the relinquisher of empire, worshipper of God for a long time, indifferent to the worldly attachments, such Bharat died while thinking of the deer’s young-one; and on account of it, he had to take birth in the deer species of birth. He was born in Kalinjar from the womb a of she-deer. But the worship of the Lord does not go waste. His reverential devotion had given Bharat such a power as the memory of the previous birth remained fresh in his mind. As a result, as soon as he became capable of walking and running in the form of deer, he ran away from Kalinjar alone and again came to Pulah cottage and there, he began to pass his days depending for food on the mere leaves fallen down after being dry in natural way. In the due course of time at the ripetime, having taken bath in the holy pilgrimage water there, he gave up his body.</p>
<p class="Text">Bharat was born third time in a Brahman family. Here, also the memory of his previous births and knowledge remained fresh in his mind. So, he made himself as if he were a mad deprived of wisdom. The fear always remained in his mind that by being talented and worldly wise, he might not develop attachment to worldly objects. Marking his impractical behaviour, the people began to call him ‘Jad’ Due to this, he became popular by the name of ‘Jad Bharat’. This was his last birth.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-53">What is impossible by true devotion?</p>
<p class="Text">Those days, Dronacharya was imparting the knowledge and skill of arms and weapons to the Kaurava and Pandavas children of Kurukul in Hastinapur. One day, a black coloured and strong built bodied schedule-tribe boy came near him. Having saluted the preceptor’s feet he prayed to him—‘My name is Ekalavya. I have come here with a hope that the preceptor will oblige me and teach me the skill of arms and weapons.’</p>
<p class="Text">The modesty of the boy pleased the preceptor; but he could not allow a shedule-tribe boy to stay with the princes. He said frankly—‘Only the boys belonging to Brahman, Kshatriya and Vaishya castes are admitted in any Gurukul. The knowledge of arms and weapons for hunting purpose can be acquired by you even from your own teachers. The special and higher knowledge of arms and weapons is not necessary for you. It is needed only for those, whose work is to sustain the subjects and fight the war.’</p>
<p class="Text">Ekalavya returned disappointed from there. But his curiosity and zeal did not extinguish. He had a true devotion for getting knowledge of arms and weapons. He got a cottage built in the solitary forest and made an earthen idol of Dronacharya and established it there. He concentrated himself with bow and arrow to the practice of archery before the idol. Once, Dronacharya set out with his pupils to walk in the forest. A dog of the Pandavas parted from them, went away towards in the forest, where Ekalavya was making practice of shooting the aim. Seeing that black coloured Schedule-tribe boy, the dog began to bark. Its barking created hindrance in his practice, so he stuffed the mouth of the dog with arrow. Being perturbed, the dog came back near the Pandavas.</p>
<p class="Text">All the Pandava and Kaurava princes began to laugh to see this condition of the dog, but Arjun got astonished. The arrows had been shot to the dog-mouth in such a way, as no arrow had pierced his mouth; but his entire mouth was fully stuffed with arrows. It was not a joke to shoot the arrows so carefully and so hurriedly. The preceptor Drona, too, set out in search of that archer, who had proved this wonderful work practical.</p>
<p class="Text">Just seeing Dronacharya, running Ekalavya fell down on his feet. The preceptor was amazed to see his own idol in his cottage. But at the same time Arjuna said to him silently and secretly—‘O the preceptor! you had given me words that I would be the best archer among your pupils; but before this Schedule-tribe my skill of archery is negligible. How will your words be true?’</p>
<p class="Text">The Preceptor assured Arjun by indication. He demanded the (Guru fee) fee from Ekalavya and when he asked—‘How should I feel myself blessed to serve you?’ Then, without hesitation the preceptor said—‘Give the thumb of your right hand to me.’</p>
<p class="Text">The outstanding brave and an excellent devotee Ekalavya proved to a man of an outstanding patience also. Taking the sword, he cut the thumb of his right hand and put it before the feet of the preceptor with due respect. He did remain incapable of shooting the arrow on account of his thumb having been cut down. In spite of shooting at the arrows with the left hand, he could never be counted among the archers. But how many days could the world remember him after being a renowned archer? On the basis of his sacrifice, on account of his devotion, Ekalavya became immortal forever.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-54">The glory of hearing the Bhagavat-Katha</p>
<p class="Text">The last part of Satyayuga was going to end, it is related to that time. A great austere Brahman, named Brihattapa, lived there at a village named Satyavrata, about eight miles away to south from the Ganges. He had related the Lord’s fables to a blind by birth sage, named Dirghatama continuously for one hundred years. In the same Satyavrata village, there lived an other Brahman also; whose name was Punyadhama. When Brihattapa started relating the fables, this Punyadhamji reached there without fail to listen to the fable. This Punyadhamaji was so fond of the fables that he went on hearing the fables of the Lord for one hundred years. Although, the Ganges was at the distance of only eight miles from there, yet the covetous of the fables, Punyadhamaji did not even go there to take a bath ever in the long period of one hundred of years. It was his firm conviction that all the Tirthas become present at the time of the Lord’s narrative. So, he went on listening only the most auspicious, (Shatakoti Pravistar) Shri Ramacharitra, and Pancharatra of the same number and the entire History scriptures, mythologies, Vedas and other six branches of Vedas etc., the nector of the Lord-characteristics. At the time of all the three prayers, he used to perform the Deva Gayatri-muttering and other routine works in short. In the night, he used to attend the Pilgrims with great devotion. In short, Punyadhamaji had only two duties—the listening to the fables of Lord Vishnu always and service to the guest saints.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, when Punyadhamji returned after hearing the fables, two saints—Dhritabrata and Gyanasindhu visited him at the same time for the pilgrimage purpose. When Punyadhamaji saw them, he bowed down his head to their feet, he adored them with honey etc., and began to praise for his luck. Then after, he fed them and began to press their legs to comfort them. Punyadhamji’s wife was fanning them. In the duration of conversation, both the saints asked Punyadhamji the distance of the Gangaji from there. Punyadhamji said—‘Your majesty! I have been engaged in listening to the fables for one hundred years. I, myself, never got an opportunity to go there, so I cannot tell you definitely, but as I have heard through others several times that it is about 20 miles away from here in the north.’</p>
<p class="Text">The saints had hardly heard this, they got annoyed. They began to talk to each other—‘Who is another more sinner than he who never served the Ganges. Well! Anyone who only even calls the name of the Ganga from the distance of hundred of miles even, attains Vishnulok and his all the sins are washed away. In spite of being so close to the Ganga, who does not serve her, that self-suicidal person, deserves to be bycotted of all good deeds. Such a person disappointing the gods, dead ancestors and saints inevitably goes to the hell. Today, unfortunately, unknowingly we had to associate with him and it made us sinner.’ Saying in this way, they, at once, went away from there and the next morning, they reached the bank of the Ganges with great curiosity. Saluting from the distance, when they reached near for bath, they could not see the even drop of water anywhere. They went on moving on the bank of the Ganges from Gangasagar to the Himalaya but they could not get even little water at all. At last, having come back to Kashi, they began to pray to the Ganges—‘Goddess! Even the superiormost God, Mahadeva has already retained you on His head. You have emerged from the feet-nail of Lord Vishnu. You are to make the entire universe and pious. O the Universal Mother! If any fault has already been committed by us anyway, O mother! Now, you should pardon us.’ </p>
<p class="Text">When the both prayed in this way, the kind-hearted goddess Ganga, appeared there in form. She spoke in the grave voice like cloud—‘You have condemned the extraordinary wise Punyadham it is the great sin. I myself, remain sitting night and day in the wait of the feet dust of that fortunate man. The place, where there is the fables of Lord being related and the holy persons depending on the support of the Lord, remain there all the pilgrimages are present there—it is not a matter of discussion. The hearing of the Lord Vishnu’s narrative is the ‘injunction’ of morality and to forget it is ‘prohibiting’. All the other injunctions and prohibitions are servants to these both. The sin of killing the crores of Brahmans may be pardoned anyhow but the sin of condemning the God-devotees does not become inaffective in numberless Kalpas. The freedom from the thousands of sins is possible; but the reproach to Lord Vishnu, His fables and His devotees has no medicine to be cured. That fortunate being who is always constantly absorbed in the Lord-Fables has accomplished the performance of all the good deeds. What is the good deed left for him? The Lord can ignore thousands of sins, but He can never forgive the insult of His devotees. It may be presumed for a moment, that He may be ready to give up Lakshmiji, but He the affectionate to His devotees cannot give up His devotee even in the dream. So, both of you should please that Punyadhamaji. Until you do so, you will not be able to see the water.</p>
<p class="Text">On the admonition of the Goddess Ganga in this way, both the hermits went to the village, Satyavrata and began to make prayer to Punyadham. Punyadham took them away to his preceptor. He related them also the fables of the Lord for two years. Then after, all the five came to the bank of the ganges. The Goddess Ganga, worshipped Brihattapa, Dirghatama and Punyadham having risen up. The two hermits, accompanying them, also saw that now, the Ganga was full of water. All the five, now, took a dip bath there and got deliverance.</p>
