title = "Turning of the Turkic wheel: the Khazar Khanate"

In a discussion with ekanetra we revisited the “turning of the Turkic
wheel” at length. While we had earlier touched upon happening in this
regard in the East on these pages, this time ekanetra wondered about the
West. It was important because ekanetra was reconstructing the deep
events that were to shape modern Abrahamistic politics. One point which
was interest was how the transitions from Khazar to Seljuks to Osmans
occurred in the Turkic world. Hence, the retelling of this long story:  
After the initial thrust of the Arab ghazis the orthodox church had
largely staved off the advance of the green crescent into their heart
land. Initially, several Turks had been converted to the desert delusion
by the Arab marauders of central Asia and had served as mercenaries in
the wars against Iranian rebels like Babek Khoremi and also in the
Jihads against other central Asian principalities. In the mean time the
second wing of the Army of Islam, Sufi subversion, was working its way
into the Turkic heartland resulting in the conversion of large swaths of
the Turkic Turcoman tribes. These new converts were soon to form a more
potent force for the Army of Islam than Arabs ever had. This process
began with the initial Arab Jihads in central Asia and extended to early
1000s of CE – we have already seen their effects on the Hindu
civilization.

But for the full story we need to trace back in time.  
\-In the 600s of CE a Turkic tribe called the Khazars, with links to the
Blue Turks, broke free from their overlords, another Turkic tribe the
Pechenegs on the western Central Asian steppes near the Caspian sea. A
Mohammedan chronicle mentions that there were two strains amongst them –
one with fair skin, red hair and blue eyes and another like dark-skinned
Indians, suggesting that they might have been a composite tribe.
Linguistic evidence suggests that they spoke a Turkic dialect and were
pagans worshiping old Altaic deities like Tengri and Umai.  
\-In 650 CE the Kalif sent the ghazi Abd ar Rahman to wage a jihad on
the Khazar. He penetrated into their territory but was destroyed by
Irbis Khan the Khazar ruler in the battle of Balanjar, who used
trebuchets against the Arabs. Following this attack, the Khazars became
politically close to the Byzantines to stave further Jihads through
marriage alliances.  
\-In 723 CE the Kalif launched another Jihad under ghazi al Djarrah ibn
Abdullah on the Khazars as their Khan had recently died. Al Djarrah took
Balanjar and asked the population to submit to Islam and upon their
refusal beheaded most of them. But the Khazars regrouped under a warrior
princess Parsbit Khanim, who defeated the Arabs and expelled them.  
\-In 731 CE the new ruler of the Khazars Barjik Khan retaliated against
the Arabs, killed al Djarrah and marched deep into the Arabs lands
carrying al Djarrah’s dried head as his banner.  
\-In 732 CE the Khazars reached Mosul where they faced the Kalif’s
personal army led by his sons. After a long fight the Khazar Khan was
killed by an Arab sharpshooter and the Khazars fled from the field. The
Kalif pursued the Jihad deep into Khazar territory destroying Balanjar  
\-In 737 CE the ghazis reached the Khazar capital of Itil and sacked it
defeating their general Ras Tarkhan.  
\-Around this time Leo III was the ruler of the Byzantines and the lord
of the orthodox church. He was an Isaistic fanatic who was a mirror
image of his Arab rivals, indulging in smashing of images, and started
forcible conversion of Judaists. At the same time the Mohammedans were
also embarking on the conversion of their paleo-Abrahamistic cousins in
the Ummayad Kalifa. As result several of the Judaists fled to the Khazar
Khanate.  
\-In 758 CE the Arabs captured the daughter of the Khazar ruler Baghatur
Khan and she died while being taken to the harem of Yazid the ghazi who
was occupying Armenia. The Khan sent his general the Ras Tarkhan with a
large force to hit the Arabs. The Khazars invaded South of the Caspian
and started plundering several Arab towns until the Moslems signed a
peace treaty and paid them a large sum of money.  
\-In around 780-790 CE the Judaists who had migrated to the Khazar
khanate had grown close to the ruler Bulan Khan. It is still not clear
what had drawn them together, although it is quite possible that the
Judaist trading network was pretty influential within the khanate. One
of the Rabbis Ishak Sangari converted the Khan and several of the
royalty to Judaism – probably the only major evangelical success of
paleo-Abrahamism compared to its two younger cousins. But even after
their conversion the Khans appear to have been reasonably tolerant
because Islamic sources mention that in addition to two rabbis they also
had a Turkic priest as judges in their courts.  
\-The Judaists fleeing from the Middle East hoped that the newly
converted Khan would come to the aid of his coreligionists who were
facing the brunt of both the Mohammedans and the Isaists. For the next
160 years the Khazars constituted the most powerful Judaist kingdom that
has ever existed (including modern Israel after appropriate
normalization). They accordingly exerted pressure on the orthodox church
and Moslems to spare Judaists in their realm.  
\-In 920 CE the Arabs demolished synagogues in Iran and killed some
Judaists. The Khazar ruler Aaron Khan in retaliation killed the resident
mullah in his capital Itil and demolished the minar of the Masjid.  
\-In the 930s the Byzantine emperor Romanos restarted the conversion of
Judaists in his territory. The Khazar Khan either Aaron or Joseph
invaded Crimea and seized it from the Byzantines.  
\-In the 940s with the relationships with both the Moslems and the
Byzantines deteriorating and several attacks from powers such as the
Khanate of the Rus, the Alyani, and the pressure from other Turkic
groups from the east the Khazars were stretched thin.  
\-The Khazars formed an alliance with their Turkic cousins of the Oghuz
confederation. Among these was a chief called Seljuk who converted to
Judaism under the Khazar influence and named his sons Michael, Israel,
Moses and Jonah. It was Michael who later converted to Islam and founded
the Seljuk dynasty.  
\-In the 943 CE the Khazars formed an alliance with the Nordic Germanic
tribe of the Varangoi and helped the latter devastate Moslem territory.
But over the coming years the Khazars realized that the Rus Khanate was
moving closer to the Byzantines due to the conversion of Olga the Rus
princess to the orthodox church.  
\-In 960 CE the Khazar ruler Joseph Khan formed a tacit alliance with
the Moslems to help them against the Rus Khanate. He blockaded the Volga
and prevented the Rus from trading via his kingdom.  
\-In the mean time the new Khan of the Russians Sviatoslav had rejected
Isaism and returned to the pagan fold. He was a fiery warrior of
tremendous energy. He decided to take on the Khazars head on. He first
formed a broad alliance uniting various Slavic tribes to his banner and
also some pagan Turkic tribes.  
\-In 965 CE he responded to Joseph Khan’s attack by counter-attacking
the fort of Sarkel and reducing it. He then entered Crimea and drove out
the Khazars after smashing them at Kerch. Next he pursued Joseph and his
court via Samandar which he conquered next. Finally, the Russians and
the Khazars had a showdown in the latter’s capital at Itil. The Russian
army crushed them and Joseph Khan was killed. The whole region was
sacked burned by the victorious Russian hordes erasing the largest
Judaist kingdom completely.

The reverberations of this event are heard to this date: Recently the
Russians erected a gigantic statue of Sviatoslav crushing Joseph which
resulted in acrimony between the Jews and Russians.
