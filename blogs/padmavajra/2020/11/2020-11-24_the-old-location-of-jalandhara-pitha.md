Amongst the 51 śākta pīthas,the [four most
important](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/03/04/the-pauranic-element-of-the-pashchimamnaya/)
are Kāmarūpa,Oḍḍiyāna,Jālandhara and Pūrṇagiri. The medieval importance
of this can be gauged by this śloka:

rūpātītaṃ tu kāmākhyāṃ rūpaṃ pūrṇagirirmahāna।  
pādaṃ jālandharaākhyāṃ tu piṇḍaṃ oḍraṃ prakīrtitaṃ।।

(Here Oḍḍiyāna has been concieved to be at Oḍra after the complete loss
of the mūla Oḍḍīyāna even in memory to āstika writers,but that is
another point to be noted in a different article).

This post is going to discuss the location of the historical Jālandhara
pītha as per old historical refernces and relevant śāstra.(Note:The
modern Devi Talab Mandir where Tripuramalini is worshipped is not the
historical Jālandhara,and such lists which list the devi as such have
little idea of the actual pitha/give only generic names for the devī
like Caṇḍī)

Historical and the relevant śāstrīya references to Jālandhara pītha that
allow us to locate the devīpīṭha with a low degree of ambiguity

-   Kumārīkhaṇḍa of Manthānabhairavatantra:idṛg jālandharaṃ pīṭhaṃ
    jvālāvvā tatra viśrutā(There is the famed mother Jvālā at Jālandhara
    pītha)
-   Abu’l Fazl in his Ai’n-I-Akbari notes about
    Jālandhara,Kāmākhya,Śāradā and Tulijā Bhavānī as four main pīthas
    and describes Jālandhara being near Nagarkot and the prescence of
    natural flames being the object of worship there.
-   Kalhaṇa in the 3rd taraṇga of the
    [Rajatarangini](https://epustakalay.com/book/151484-rajtarngini-by-kalhan/)
    alludes to the same general area of Kangra/Trigarta as being called
    Jālandhara/Jālandharāyaṇa
-   The [importance of this pīṭha to Buddhists and their descriptions of
    travels to
    it](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Jalandhara+in+the+eyes+of+Tibetan+and+Trans-Himalayan+pilgrims.-a0242017325)
    leave no ambiguity as to which is the actual temple being referred
    to as the Jālandhara pītha.
