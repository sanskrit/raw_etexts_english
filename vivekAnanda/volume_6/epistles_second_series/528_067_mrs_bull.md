## LXVII

PERCY, NEW HAMPSHIRE,  
*7th June, 1895.*

DEAR MRS. BULL,

I am here at last with Mr. Leggett. This is one of the most beautiful
spots I have ever seen. Imagine a lake, surrounded with hills covered
with a huge forest, with nobody but ourselves. So lovely, so quiet, so
restful! And you may imagine how glad I am to be here after the bustle
of cities.

It gives me a new lease of life to be here. I go into the forest alone
and read my Gita and am quite happy. I will leave this place in about
ten days and go to the Thousand Island Park. I will meditate by the hour
there and be all alone to myself. The very idea is ennobling.

VIVEKANANDA.
