## XXXV

U. S. A.,  
*6th March, 1895*.

DEAR ALASINGA,

. . . Do not for a moment think the "Yankees" are practical in religion.
In that the Hindu alone is practical, the Yankee in money-making, so
that as soon as I depart, the whole thing will disappear. Therefore I
want to have a solid ground under my feet before I depart. Every work
should be made thorough. . . . You need not insist upon preaching Shri
Ramakrishna. Propagate his ideas first, though I know the world always
wants the Man first, then the idea. . . . Do not figure out big plans at
first, but begin slowly, feel your ground, and proceed up and up.

. . . Work on, my brave boys. We shall see the light some day.

Harmony and peace! . . . Let things slowly grow. Rome was not built in a
day. The Maharaja of Mysore is dead — one of our greatest hopes. Well!
the Lord is great. He will send others to help the cause.

Send some Kushâsanas (small sitting-mats) if you can.

Yours ever with blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.
