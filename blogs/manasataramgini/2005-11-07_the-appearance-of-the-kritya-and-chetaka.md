“Everyone knows well how the bharadvAja yavakri met his end due the
kAshyapa’s spells.”  
We had fallen back from suvargaM lokaM. We then started walking along
the great path, when we saw a ratha similar to that of our ally of
utkIla’s clan. We turned around to see the ratha, when we sensed someone
was coming in front of us. We turned and were surprised to see a
beautiful woman, dressed very formally. On such a desolate day, at such
an hour and time it was very unusual to see such a woman coming out from
such familiar territory down such a familiar path. The woman passed us
and we glanced her smile a sinister smile. Having passed behind us she
vanished. Through our third eye we realized that it was not a woman but
the kR^ityA. We then saw the chetaka attempting to bite at the kavacha
but failed to do so. Then the chetaka lobbed a tIkShNa kShurika at us
through the kavacha and then vanished.
