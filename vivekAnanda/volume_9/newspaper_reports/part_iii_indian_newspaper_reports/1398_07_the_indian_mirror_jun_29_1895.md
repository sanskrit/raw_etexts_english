## A SUMMARY OF "BUDDHISM, THE FULFILMENT OF HINDUISM"

(*Vivekananda in Indian Newspapers*, p. 73.)

\[*The Indian Mirror*, June 29, 1895\]

Swami Vivekananda's speech, delivered in Chicago at the presentation of
the Buddhists on September 26, 1893, is published in MacNeely's edition
of the "History of the Parliament of Religions". The following were his
concluding words: —

We cannot live without you, nor you without us. Then believe that
separation has shown to us, that you cannot stand without the brain and
the philosophy of the Brahman \[sic\], nor we without your heart. This
separation between the Buddhist and the Brahman \[Brahmin\] is the cause
of the downfall of India. That is why India has been the slave of
conquerors for the past 1000 years. Let us then join the wonderful
intellect of the Brahman \[Brahmin\] with the heart, the noble soul, the
wonderful humanising power of the Great Master. (*Vide* "Buddhism, the
Fulfilment of Hinduism", *[Complete

, I: 21-23, for a somewhat different summary paragraph.)
