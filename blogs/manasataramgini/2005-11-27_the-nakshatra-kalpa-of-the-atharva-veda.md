+++
The nakshatra kalpa of the Atharva veda that is considered the first
parishishhTa of the AV adduces a R^ishi in addition to the tutelary
deity to each nakshatra. These connections appears to have emerged much
later than the devata-nakshtra connection, but may be of interest to
investigate what these R^ishis meant. The list is:

It must be noted that hasta (Corvus is called the hand of savitA) and
the phrase devo vah savitA hiraNyapANi pratigR^ihnAtu is used often in
the vedic literature. I wonder if this has a link with the position of
Corvus in the East point position during the time these sacrificial
rituals were initiated. As Narahari Achar points out the association of
the constellation with the East point may have been of significance for
sacrificial initiation.
