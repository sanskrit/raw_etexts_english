title = "Sombero sighted"

We we celebrated the true arrival of spring by a remarkable wandering on
the moutain paths. We felt as though the Atman had ceased to be bound
and made its universal identification. As the azure heights of the
celestial dome darkened with the setting eye of mitra and varuNa, we
role the telescope out. One by one we ticked off each of the galaxies
that lay within our reach in Leo and Virgo. That vast swath of galactic
richness starting from NGC3115 in Sextans to M95 and M96 in Leo to the
Sombrero Hat on the head of the Crow to the faint beauty of NGC4038 on
the flank of the Crow.  
10 years had passed between the sightings\!
