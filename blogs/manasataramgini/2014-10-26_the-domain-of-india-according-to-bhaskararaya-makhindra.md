title = "The domain of India according to bhāskararāya-makhīndra"

bhāskararāya was one of the greatest mantravādin-s of all times, who
perhaps was only rivaled by the illustrious abhinavagupta or aghoraśiva
deśika, who in times closer to our own was verily like how a brāhmaṇa
sage of the time of the veda might have been. He shone like a luminary
on the north bank of the Kaveri illuminating many śāstra-s including the
ṛk and atharvaṇa śruti-s, navanyāya outside the vaṅga country and above
all the śrīkula. In the introduction to his śrīkula work
varivasyā-rahasya he says:

ā prācaḥ kāmarūpād druhiṇa-suta-nada-plāvitād ā pratīco  
gāndhārāt sindhu-sāndrād-raghuvara-caritād ā ca setor avācaḥ ।  
ā kedārād udīcas tuhina-gahanataḥ santi vidvat-samājā  
ye ye tān eṣa yatnaḥ sukhayatu samajān kaśca mat kartum īṣṭe ॥

The learned assemblies, which indeed are from kāmarūpa in the east which
is flooded by the riverine son of druhiṇa (i.e. brahmā) to gāndhāra in
the west which is moistened by the Indus system, from the bridge in the
south, by which the foremost of the raghu-s traveled, to the kedāra in
the north laden heavy with snow, may this effort gratify them; who would
wish to please the lay-folk by this work of mine?

Indeed this clearly expresses the extent of India as the domain of the
sanātana-dharma. The marāṭhā patrons of bhāskararāya had placed the
saffron Hindu flag on the fort of Attock. He had himself witnessed
closely the marāṭhā campaigns against the Portuguese in the Konkan when
he was writing his magnum opus the setu-bandha. Thus, there was a brief
period of hope that indeed the idea of bājīrāv-I, of the complete
liberation of bhāratavarṣa, might become reality. It was perhaps the
vision engendered by this hope that inspired the words of bhāskararāya.
Sadly, the marāṭhā-s stumbled and the extent of bhārata today has
contracted and threatens to contract even more. Not surprisingly more
than half the treatises written by bhāskararāya have been lost. But lest
Hindus forget, they must keep in mind that this was the bhāratavarṣa
that their people had in mind even as of 250 years ago and if its
civilizational memory is lost all hopes of regaining it may also be seen
as lost.
