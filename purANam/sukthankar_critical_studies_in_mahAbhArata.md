## PREFACE


The Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute was founded in
1915. The first verse of the Mahabharata was written by Sir R. G.
      Bhandarkar on 1st April 1919 while inaugurating the work of the
      Institute on the Critical Edition of the Mahabharata. On 4th August
      1925 Dr. V. S. Sukthankar took charge of this work as its General
      Editor and reorganized it on a sound basis. For the subsequent 17 years
      he worked on it with an eagle eye and mature scholarship bringing
      international honour to himself and to the Institute. In 1940, the
      British Academy, London, put its seal of approval on Dr. Sukthan-
      kar’s work on this edition. On the 4th January 1943, the Institute
      conferred on Dr. Sukthankar a Distinguished Services Medal in
      recognition of his unique services to the Institute as the helmsman of
      its work on the Mahhbharata on the occasion of its Silver Jubilee
      celebrations. On 5th January 1943, Dr. Sukthankar read his state-
      ment on the Critical Edition of the Mahabharata before the delegates
      for the Silver Jubilee celebrations and other audience in the Tata Hall
      of the Institute. This statement has proved to be his last testament
      more valuable than Aristotle’s will as it is a national testament. I
      quote from it a few sentences which contain Dr. Sukthankar’s mes-
      sage about the Mahabharata : —

“ The part of the Epic critically dealt with so far is, I imagine, in bulk
about four times as great as the Greek Epics, Iliad and Odyssey put together
and one and a half times as our Riamayaipa.”

“ All good work costs money now-a-daiys ! Good manuscripts cost
money. Good printing costs money. Good editors cost money.”

“ Amid the deepest strands that are woven in the thread of our civili-
zation there is more than one that is drawn originally from Bharatavarsa
and from Sanskrit literature and well in the centre of this vast mass of lite-
rature, there stands this deathless traditional book of divine inspiration, un
approachable and far removed from possibilities of human constitution.”

“ We must therefore grasp this great book with both hands and face it
squarely. Then we shall recognise that it is our past which has prolonged
itself into the present. We are it : I mean the real We ! Shall we be guilty
of strangling our own soul ? Never ! ”

These stirring words were read out by Dr. Sukthankar on the
evening of the 5th of January and within a fortnight he pa?s^ away
after a brief illness on the evening of 21st January 1943 ! Truth is
stranger than fiction !!

Such in brief is the outline of Dr. Sukthankar’s association with
the Institute’s Critical Edition of the Great Epic, which he aptly styled
as “ the Content of our Collective Unconscious ” and in which he

finally merged his being after spending every moment of his conscious
life in revising his type-script of the last of his lectures on the Maha-
bharata he was to deliver before the University of Bombay on the
following day !

In striking him down within sight of his chosen goal, Death
pierced the base of consciousness, cutting at the very joint of body and
mind. No preparation for the end, no inspiring last words, were pos-
sible. Yet, those of us who knew Sukthankar intimately cannot
doubt that the sentiments of Valiant would also have been his own had
he received the summons of an approaching end to life’s journey.
“ Though with great difficulty I am got hither, yet now I do not repent
me of all the trouble. My sword I give to him that shall succeed me
in the pilgrimage, and my courage and skill to him that can get it.
My marks and sccirs I carry with me, to be a witness for me, that I
have fought His battles Who will be my Rewarder.” This memorial
volume represents the sword, the keen splendid-tempered image of his
intellect, that he bequeathed to him that has the courage and skill to
wield it. If there be such a person, undaunted by the forces of dark-
ness, let him grasp firm the hilt and smite on.

Side by side with his text-critical work on the Mahabharata
Dr. Sukthankar kept on studying its content and inner meaning and
for that purpose studied many books on Philosophy and Religion.
WTrile I was editing the Review oi Philosophy mid Religion between
1930 and 1937, 1 received numerous books on these subjects for review.
Dr. Sukthankar seemed very much interested in many of them and
he actually ordered some of them for his own library. I was first under
the impression that Dr. Sukthankar perused these books with a view
to get a little diversion to his mind after his fatiguing work on the text
of the Mahabharata day after day for years without rest. I was how-
ever thoroughly surprised when he disclosed to me his scheme of lec-
tures on the Mahabharata which he finally prepared for being deli-
vered before the University of Bombay and before completing which
he took our final leave with a “ Forget-me-not ” emphasis ! The
mystical vein noticed by the audience in those lectures was mainly due
to the psychological changes gradually brought about in the mind
of the great Savant during the ten years prior to these lectures.

The idea of bringing out a Memorial Edition of Dr. Sukthan-
kar’s published writings was first discussed by myself and my learned
friends Dr. S. M. Katre and Prof. D. D. Kosambi with Dr. Mrs.
Malinibai B. Sukthankar, m.b.b.s. and the sons of Dr. Sukthankar
immediately after Dr. Sukthankar’s demise. With the substantial
support iMTomised by the Sukthankar family a Memorial Edition



Committee was formed with Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, B.A.
the Raja Saheb of Aundh as its Chairman and Diwan-Bahadur K. M.
jHAVERi, M.A., LL.B., j.p. as its Vice-Chairman. With the assured
support of these two great friends of Dr. Sukthankar and with the
guaranteed voluntary co-operation of my esteemed friends Dr. Katre
and Prof. Kosambi, it was easy for me to secure the support of the
innumerable friends of Dr. Sukthankar all over India and outside
for the work of the Memorial Edition as will be seen from the Person-
nel of the Memorial Edition Committee which accompanies this Pre-
face. A printed Appeal was subsequently issued by me on behalf of
the Committee and circulated among scholars and institutions inter-
ested in the Memorial Edition. The response to this appeal from the
numerous friends and admirers of Dr. Sukthankar was extremely
encouraging and the First Volume of the Memorial Edition that is
being presented to the public today is a visible embodiment of this
spontaneous response and a permanent Souvenir of the good will left
behind by an Indian scholar who sacrificed himself on the altar of the
Mahabhiarata.

The valuable and scholarly contents of the present volume speak
for themselves and will continue to speak with greater resonance as
years pass by. As observed by Prof. Edgerton they are the product
of Dr. Sukthankar’s knowledge and experience (Jmnam Savijm-
nam) and his native ability which made reputation in three Continents.
Dr. Sukthankar’s literary life was a life of planned action, in which
every detail was scrupulously worked out and revised many times
before it saw the light of the day. Every page of the Critical Edition
of the Mahabharata and the Critical Epic Studies that are being
presented to the scholars to-day under one cover bear the stamp of his
scholarship and fully illustrate the common adage : — “ If a thing is
worth doing, it is worth doing well ”. His Prolegomena to the Adi-
parvan of the Mahabharata, the bed-rock of the Mah&bharata Textual
Criticism, was much in demand since its publication. It is being pub-
lished separately for the first time in the present volume along with
the other Epic Studies of Dr. Sukthankar and thus brought within
the means of individual research scholars through the favour of the
authorities of the B. O. R. Institute. I feel confident that this First
Volume of Dr. Sukthankar Memorial Edition will stimulate the
study of the Indian Textual Criticism on which the attentioa of Indian
scholars has been now focussed by Dr. Katre’s able Introduction to
Indian Textual Criticism (1940), which owes much to Dr. Sukthan-
kar’s inspiration and guidance.

It now remains for me to record my feelings of gratitude for the
unstinted co-operation I have received frojn several friends and learned

bodies in bringing out this iFirst Volume of the V. S. Sukthankar
Memorial Edition. My cordial thanks are due to the authorities of
the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, many of whom are mem-
bers of the Memorial Edition Committee, for their kind permission to
include in the present volume the Prolegomena and other Introduc-
tions to the Critical Edition of the Mahcbhdrata as also Dr. SUK-
thankar’s Epic Studies published in the Annals of the Institute.
Special thanks are due to Principal J. R. Gharpure, b.a., ll.b., the
Chairman of the Executive Board and Dr. R. N. Dandekar, m.a.,
PH.D., the Secretary of the Institute who is also the Editor of the
Annals, for their uniform courtesy and kindness in securing the above
permission. To Dr. S. K. Belvalkar, m.a., ph.d., the present General
Editor of the Mahiabharata, I am particularly thankful for keeping at
my disposal a copy of Epic Studies No. VI which he found in Dr.
Sukthankar’s office papers at the Institute. This copy duly revised
by Dr. Sukthankar in his, own hand has been incorporated in the
present volume. Evidently Dr. Sukthankar had an intention to re-
vise all his Epic Studies in course of time and then publish them in
their final form after the completion of his work on the Great Epic.
Providence, however, decreed otherwise ! As regards the other contri-
butions of Dr. Sukthankar included in the present volume I tender
my most grateful thanks —

(1) To the authorities of the K. R. Cama Oriental Institute,
Bombay, and the Editorial Board of Sir J. J. Modi Volume for p)er-
mission to include Dr. Sukthankar’s paper on “ Arjunamisra ” in
this Edition.

(2) To Mr. B. T. Anklesaria, m.a. the Hon. Secretary of the
K. R. Cama Institute for drawing my attention to the two p>apers of
Dr. Sukthankar viz. (i) Arjunamisra and (ii) An Excursion on the
Periphery of Indological Research and in securing the necessary per-
mission of the authorities of his Institute for their inclusion in the
present Edition. Mr. Anklesaria had collaborated with Dr. Suk-
thankar for a niunber of years in connection with his work for the
Cama Institute and his hearty co-opjeration in this work by the free
supply of the press-copies of the two papjers of Dr. Sukthankar men-
tioned above deserves my best thanks.

(3) *To the Editors of the Festchrift Prof. P. V. Kane and Dr.
R. N. Sardesai, L.C.P.S., Proprietor, Oriental Book Agency, Poona,
its publisher, for pjermission to include Dr. Sukthankar's |)ap)er on
“ RamopD&khyana ” in this Volume.

(4) To the authcarities of the Deccan College Post-graduate and
Research Institute, Poona and in particular Dr. S, M- Katre, m,a.,



PREFACE is

PH.D. its present Director and Editor of their Bulletin for their permis-
sion to include Dr. Sukthankar’s paper on “ Epic Question I — ^Did
Indra assume the form of a Swan ? ” in this Volume.

(5) To the Editors of Feschrift Dr. F. W. Thomas and its
publisher Mr. M. N. Kulkarni, the Manager of the Kamatak FHib-
lishing House, Bombay for their permission to publish Dr. Sukthan-
kar’s paper on “ RamSyana and Nalopakhyana ” in this Volume.

(6) To the authorities, Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic
Society for permission to include Epic Studies I ; ‘ Some Text-Critical
Notes ’ in this Volume.

Every scholar who came into personal contact with Dr. Sukthan-
KAR knows quite well how he loved not only the substantial contents
of any scholarly publication but also its scientific and dignified presen-
tation. He believed in the identity of Truth, Beauty and Dignity in
the publication of all scholarly work worth the name. The volumes
of the Critical Edition of the Mahabharata are a visible embodiment
of Dr. Sukthankar’s ideal in this respect. A good edition according
to Dr. Sukthankar must be good both within and without, and we
have tried to make the present Memorial Edition as good as possible
within the' means at our disposal. But good Editions cost money, said
Dr. Sukthankar in his last public statement and the credit of achiev-
ing any goodness in the present Memorial Edition must go to those
donors, subscribers and contributors who have contributed their mite
towards this Edition out of sheer love and appreciation for the national
work of the departed scholar as will be seen from the list of these
contributors (vide Appendix). Space forbids me to thank all these
contributors individually. I shall however, be failing in my duty if I
do not indicate here the generosity of the following contributors but for
whose spontaneous response it would have been impossible for the
Memorial Edition Committee to proceed with the work of the Edi-
tion : —

Rs. 650 — Dr. Mrs. Malinibai B. Sukthankar, m.b.b.s. and other
members of the Sukthankar family, Bombay.

Rs. 150 — University of Bombay. *

Rs. 100 — Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, b.a.. Raja Saheb
of Aundh, Aundh.

Rs. 100 — ^Right Hon’ble Dr. M. R. Jayakar, Bombay. *

Rs. 100 — ^B. J. Wadia, M.A., ll.b., Vice-Chancellor, University of
Bombay, Bombay.

Rs. lOd— Sir Chunilal B. Mehta, kt., j.p. and Lady Tapibm C.
Mehta, Bombay.

On the completion of the Memorial Edition it is proposed to



publish a full report of the work of the Committee where all contri-
butions and donations will be specified in detail.

I started my work in connection with the Sukthankar Memorial
Edition with the assured initial support of Dr. Mrs. Malinibai B.
Sukthankar and other members of the Sukthankar family. This
support was further strengthened by the formation of a representative
Memorial Edition Committee consisting of numerous friends and
admirers of Dr. Sukthankar in different parts of India and outside.
This support, encouraging as it was for an inexperienced man like
myself, made me confident enough about the success of this enterprise
but I became absolutely fearless in my work when the two great friends
of Dr. Sukthankar, I mean Shrimant Raja Saheb of Aundh and
Dewan Bahadur K. M. Jhaveri agreed to guide me in this work as
the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Memorial Edition Commit-
tee respectively. Their high regard for our National Epic and its Epic
Editor Dr. Sukthankar has been responsible in no small way for the
publication of the Epic Studies of Dr. Sukthankar appearing today
in the form of the First Volume of the Sukthankar Memorial Edition.
On 5th January 1943, Dr. Sukthankar referred to the Rajasaheb of
Aundh in the following glowing terms : —

“ If you want me to point out just one man who is responsible for origi-
nating and furthering the project (of the MahSbharata) he is sitting in front
of you, I mean Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, the Raja of Aundh.”

We are fortunate in having in our midst today, the first anniver-
sary of Dr. Sukthankar’s demise, this very enlightened Rajasaheb,
now in the 76th year to guide all our literary projects with undaunted
zeal and optimism. I cannot adequately thank the Rajasaheb and
other friends for their spontaneous and active co-operation in the work
of this Edition.

I began my work in connection with the Memorial Edition with
the guaranteed collaboration of my personal friends Dr. S. M. Katre,
M.A., PH.D. and Phrof. D. D. Kosambi, m.a. These friends have ful-
filled their guarantee to the very letter as they have been responsible
for the entire editing of the First Volume and all credit for the careful
and accurate editing of the Volume goes to them. During their per-
sonal contact with Dr. Sukthankar they knew perfectly well what
good editing meant according to Dr. Sxucthankar’s highly critical
standards and consequently the good editing of the present Volume
owes everything to them as they have carried out at great inconve-
nience to themselves all the arduous work of seeing the Volume
through the press. Though these friends have done all this labour of
love out of their high sense of appreciation and respect for the work



t» R E F A C E


xi

of Dr. SuKTHANKAR and though they are the members of the Memo-
rial Committee, I take this opportunity of thanking them most cordi-
ally for their disinterested service to Indole^ in helping the Memorial
Edition Committee to bring out the present Volume in the best pos-
sible form and get up.

Dr. SUKTHANKAR was connected with the University of Bombay
in several capacities for more than two decades. His cordial relations
with all the authorities of the University are evident not only from
the grant sanctioned by the Syndicate towards the costs of this Edition
but by the personal generosity of the Vice-Chancellor, the Registrar,
the Deputy Registrar, the Librarian and many other office-bearers of
the University. I am deeply touched by their prompt and spontaneous
l esponse to my appeal regarding this Edition and I convey to all these
friends of Dr. Sukthankar at the premier academic body of the pro-
vince the grateful thanks of the Memorial Committee for their sincere
appreciation of the work of the Committee.

In concluding this preface I must record the valuable services
rendered to the Memorial Edition by Mr. M. N. Kulkarni, the
enterprising Manager of the Karntak Publishing House, Bombay,
but for whose high regard for Dr. Sukthankar and spontaneous co-
operation on the very day this scheme was discussed we would not
have dreamt of undertaking this Edition at a time when the extra-
ordinary high cost of printing and the scarcity of paper had chilled
all academic enterprises in this country. Like my esteemed friends
Dr. Katre and Prof. Kosambi, Mr. Kulkarni has fulfilled his guaran-
tee also to the letter by publishing this First Volume of the Memorial
Edition most promptly and efficiently and thus kept up the high
traditions of his Publishing House for excellent printing and typo-
graphy, which are absolutely essential for good editing according to
the standards of Dr. Sukthankar.

In presenting this firet volume of the Sukthankar jMemorial Edi-
tion to-day, the first anniversary of Dr. Sukthankar’s lamented de-
mise, the Memorial Committee has completed half of its promised
work. Though I am thankful to all my colleagues on th* Memorial
Committee for their continuous co-operation so far, I must reserve my
final thanks to them to a future date when the Second Volume of this
Edition is completed and presented to the public. ^

FOREWORD^


An elaborate introduction containing a comprehensive account of the
manuscript material as also a detailed discussion of the principled Of Maha-
bharata textual criticism will be published with the last fascicule of the
Adiparvan. The following cursory remarks are intended merely to guide the
reader meanwhile through the labyrinth of a very complicated' apparatus
criticus.


GENERAL OBSERVATIONS

In the Mahabharata manuscript tradition, perhaps as much as in any
literary tradition, the textual critic is faced with a bewildering profusion of
versions as well as an amazing mixture of versions. Divers elements have
been working from the earliest times in favour of the development of different
types, on the one hand : on the other hand, there were not wanting elements
that operated against the evolution of sharply differentiated types. To un-
derstand the phenomenon of this luxuriant growth and indiscriminate fusion
of versions, one must appreciate clearly certain details of historical moment,
certain special factors in the transmission of the Mahabharata — traits which
distinguish our work from every other known text except the Ri^ayana and
possibly the Homeric epopees. Notwithstanding the fact that we know so
little that is certain and definite about the early history of the text, we may,
it seems to me, with confidence assume that after its composition the great
epic was for centuries handed down (in differing forms and sizes) from bard
to bard merely by word of mouth. It is moreover extremely probable that
even after the te'xt had been written down, large portions of it, especially
such portions as were popular, continued to be committed to memory, by
itinerant raconteurs for purposes of recitation. It is further easy to believe
that no great care was lavished on the text by these custodians of the tradi-
tion to guard it against partial corruption and elaboration or against ar-
bitrary emendation and normalization : to reproduce the received text with
any great precision would be neither attempted by these bards nor required
of them. It was then inevitable that the protean oral tradition should in
one form or another react on the written tradition and vice versa. One im-
portant and necessary consequence of such antecedents as these is the im-
possibility of retracing all extant versions to any fixed and authentic arche-
type ; since some of the modern editions could not but be descendants of
fluctuating oral versions reduced to writing in some distant past, indepen-
dently of each other, at different epochs and in different circumstances. In

GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MANUSCRIPTS
AND THEIR MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP

An important advance made in the classification of the manuscripts
is the separation of archetype K (which represents Devanagari transcripts
of the Kasmiri or North-western version) from other so-called Devanagari
versions. The affinity of K is documented by the? following agreements :

1. 1. 2* : K { except Ki ) Du the rest ( inclusive of Ki )

1. 1. 8 ; K ; Vi the rest ^ or

1. 1. 49^ : K Vi Bi m ; the rest or

1. 1. 51* : K Vi the rest

1. 1. 192^^ : K ( except Ke ) the rest ( inch Kc )

1. 2. 23* : K ( except Ki.e) mm; the rest ( incl. Ki.q )

1. 2. 76^ : K ( Ks missing ) N 2 f; the rest

Only Ko 1 represent archetype K in a comparatively pure form. Next
to these in purity stands Kg ; while K 3.6 are nothing but misch-codices, K 3
being conflated with the vulgate and K 4 .^ with some Southern version (cf.
1. 1. 26 and 22*, 25*). Ko i contains a text which is shorter and more archaic
      than either the Bangali or the £ 5 } vulgate.'' It is worthy of note that while
      these two manuscripts (K'o.i) have more readings in common with manus-
      cripts of the Southern recension than either of the two latter groups, yet
      they contain not a single “ additional " line which could be considered as a
      characteristic Southern interpolation. — ^Vi stands, as is to be expected, nearest
      to the Bangali version, but it is noteworthy that in a few cases and K
      agree in opposition to all other manuscripts, where it is impossible to consider
      the agreement as purely accidental (cf. 1. 1. 8 , 49'U . — The BangMi version
      is slightly superior to the “vulgate," in so far that it is not interpolated quite
      so heavily as the latter. Bangali omits (like K) not only the Brahma-Gaaiesa
      episode in the first adhyiaya, but (unlike K) also the’ short dialogfle between
      Paraiurama and his ancestors in the second, both unquestionably spurious
      and both found in the “vulgate." Occasionally Bangiali manuscripts agree
      with Southern manuscripts in opposition to K and the “ vulgate (cf. 1 . I.
      22^, 42^). In these cases I have adopted as authentic the concordant read-
      ings of the Bangali and Southern manuscripts in preference to those of K.
      Bangali alone has in a few; cases preserved the correct reading as compared
      with all the other manuscripts (cf. 1. 1. 62^). — Closely connected with the
      Bangali is the version of Arjunami^ra. It not only agrees with the Bangali
      in the omission of the Brahma-Gaijesa episode and of the dialogue mentioned

above, but it shares with the Bangali quite a number of isolated readings
against all other; manuscripts. The (epic) text in the Arjunamisra codices
is frequently contaminated from the “ vulgate ” and has to be corrected with
the help of Arjunamisra’s commentary (cf. 1. 1. 17^, 22^). — Ratnagarbha’s
text is eclectic, standing palpably under the influence of the Southern recension
(cf. 24*, 25*, 27*). — Nilakaintha’s version (which may conveniently be styled
the “vulgate’’) presents a smooth text, with an inconsiderable amount of
Southern element. It may be noted that in rare cases the Bombay edition
(of Ganpat Krsnaji) contains readings which have’ no manuscript support at
all or have at best very weak manuscript support. — Next we have the mixed
Devanagari group represented by misch-codices of small trustworthiness

and of no special value for critical purposes. contain a very large num-

ber of old readings in common with manuscripts of the K group, but D 14
shows at the same time some Southern readings and some unique readings
not found elsewhere (cf. 1 . 1 . 50^, 63'’'^ ; 2 . lOV^). D 9.32 palpably under
the influence of the Southern tradition. — Telugu manuscripts have been placed
in the Southern recension, but they belong in a sense to both recensions ; they
are eclectic on no recognizable principles. — It is difficult to define precisely
the' relationship between the Grantha and the Malayalam versions, which are
very closely allied ; each of them exhibits nevertheless certain features not
found in the other (cf. 1 . 1 . 184"^). On the whole* the Grantha version pro-
duces the impression of being less interpolated and more archaic than the
other. This version has two sub-groups, G^^^ and » numerous cross-
agreements between the two sub-groups show that our manuscripts are con-
flated. G 7 does not belong to dther of these groups ; in point of fact, it is
a misch-codex contaminated! from the Northern tradition and closely allied
to T^ (cf. 1. 1. 63, 64), — often stands in antagonism to M 2 - 4 , sometimes
agreeing with manuscripts of the Northern recension (cf. 1. 1. 32^"^, 4P^, 7P,
128"). The Southern recension, as already remarked, agrees with archetype
K more closely than with any other Northern version.

£ 6 } The Southern version of the first two adhyayas is on the whole shorter
than the “ vulgate ” ; but the shortest version of these two adhyayas is
that preserved by Ko.t, Ko being probably even shorter than K^. The' naive
Brahma-Gnpesa episode, the longest as well as the most obvious interpolation
in the text of the' “ vulgate ”, has been relegated to the Appendix (cf. 1. 1. 26,
53, 60, 62, 64). Its spuriousness has now been placed beyond the domain
of sane criticism through its absence in Ko.a B Da D, In the South-
ern manuscripts (and in some conflated Devanagari manuscripts) Brahma
alone is introduced ; in these there is no talk of Gane^a, who is unquestionably
a late Northern intruder. The yaddsrausam section is also evidently an in-
terpolation, but a considerably older one. Being merely a string of stanzas
summarizing some of the most important incidents and episodes of the epic,
it lent itself easily to being further interpolated by revisers who wanted to



FOREWORD


7


supply the omissions and thus make the summary as complete as possible.
To present the oldest form of this section now recoverable, I have deemed
it sufficient to accept as genuine only such stanzas as are found verbatim in
both the recensions. Here again Ko.j have the fewest interpolations. The
table of contents” in the second adhyiaya is preserved in two versions, a
longer and a shorter. Ko.i S (except G 7 ) have the' shorter version, which
has been adopted in the constituted text as the authentic one.

Since I have not been able to discover any traces of “ secondary interrela-
tionship” between archetypes K and S, I consider the agreement between
these two archetypes as “primitive”, that is depending upon their primitive
connection through the Ur-Mahabharata. This concord is a factor of supreme
importance for the reconstruction of the text. The originality of the agree-
ment is established, in my opinion, by the following considerations. The con-
cordant readings of K and S repre?sent as often as not a lectio difficilior' (cf.
1 . 1. 19^, 94'^ 158^). Frequently such a reading best explains the other vari-
ants (cf. 1. 1. 1 . 14^0- Furthermore the “additional” stanzas which are

found in the “ vulgate* ” but are missing in K and S have all the appearance
of being interpolations, lengthening and weakening the text (cf. 19*, 29*, 35*-
38) ; the same remark applies to the additional stanzas that are found in
    the Southerrs recension but are missing in K and the “vulgate*” (cf. 21*,
    22*, 27*). The high position of K seems confirmed by its being the shortest
    of the known versions.


THE CONSTITUTED TEXT

In preparing the constituted text of the first two adhyiayas, I have endea-
voured to balance the eclecticism advocated in certain matters with a rigid
conservatism insisted on in others. I have been most averse to reject or cor-
rect the readings of good manuscripts. Interpretation has throughout been
given precedence over emendation ; in the first two adhyayas, no emendation
seemed absolutely necessary, nor any absolutely certain. Solecisms, when
shewn to be original by a clear agreement on this point between (what ap-
peared to be) independent versions, have been allowed to stand uncorrected
(cf. 1. 1. 5.^, 170'0. As a general rule, preference is given to a reading which
best suggests how other readings might have arisen. When such a reading
was not available the choice fell upon one which is common to (what prima
facie appeared to be) more or less independent versions and which is support-
ed by intrinsic probability ; the presumption of originality in such cases is fre-
quently confirmed by a lack of definite agreement between the dis-£ 7 }-cordant
versions. Occasionally one comes across variants where the matter is identical
but thei wording of a large part or of the whole of the line is differeint ; one
and the same primitive reading cannot in these cases account for the diver-
gence. In the presence of such alternatives, neither of which can have come
from the other and which have equal Extrinsic support and equal intrinsic



FOREWORD


merit, the criteria mentioned above fail to give a (positive result. A particular
instance of the variation contemplated here is that of a puzzling form of a
cross-agreement between the Northern and Southern versions ; when, for in-
stance, some Kasmiri and Malayalam manuscripts agree in opposition to say,
Bangali and Grantha (cf. 1. 1. 60^). In such cases, I have, owing to the
much greater correctness of the K version, mostly adopted, as stopgaps, the
readings of Ko.i, the manuscripts which present the archetype K in a rela-
tively pure form.

I have given in the constituted text whatever in each case appeared to
be supported by the balance of probabilities, indicating all the important ele-
ments — lines, phrases, significant words and word-parts —of the text that are
less than certain by a wavy line printed below them. Insignificant differences
of spelling (e.g. Naimisa-Naimi^^) are ignored for this purpose.

Doubt which cannot be resolved by a consideration of the documentary
or intrinsic probability, entailing the use of the wavy line, arises in the follow-
ing cases : (a) when the transmitted readings appe*ar to be corrupt and no
satisfactory emendation can be suggested ; (b) when there are several read-
ings of equal merit ; in paiticular where the Northern and the Southern reces-
sions offer twb different readings of equal value ; lastly (c) when the evidence
pro et contra of documentary’' and intrinsic probability is equally balanced.

As regards interpolations, the additional lines are so ingeniously fashion-
ed and cunningly fitted in, that in any given case the intrinsic evidence is
generally inconclusive. In other words, if we leave out of account the docu-
mentary evidence, no convincing proof can in general be brought forward to
establish either the originality or the spuriousness of the added lines. We
cannot, however, entirely ignore the e'vidence of tradition. Everything points
to the fact that what the epic has suffered from is inflation and elaboration,
and not depletion or curtailment. On principle, therefore, lines that are/ pecu-
liar to one recension, having nothing whatsoever corresponding to them, at the
same point, in the other recension, are to be/ viewed with grave suspicion.
Unless there is overwhelming evidence to prove their originality, they should
be treated as spurious ; because, the probability of error is far greater in ad-
mitting as authentic such one-recension lines on insufficient evidence of ori-
ginality (fcKjjth recensions being placed on an equal footing and treated with
impartiality) than in rejecting them on insufficient evidence of spuriousness.
It may be added that the presumption of unauthenticity is frequently confirm-
ed by the fact that in the recension in which such lines do occur, they are
found inserted' in different manuscripts (or different versions) at different
points of the text.


I am greatly indebted to Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, Chief of Aundh,
for uniform kindn’ess and courtesy ; but still more for the absolute confidence he is
pleased to repoise in me. I must also record my thanks, for help of various kinds, to

PH.D. ; Prof. Dr. V. G. Paranjpe, m.a., d.litt. ; and Mr. N. B. Utgikar, m.a.
But I desire to make a special mention of my indebtedness to Mr. Vaidya and to
Rev. Fr. Zimmermann, whose advice and ready help have accompanied my labours
from the time I first accepted the responsibilities of the work. Nothing has en-
couraged me more in this arduous and fascinating task than the unwavering interest
with which they have followed it. In connection with the help the Editorial Board
has' received from collaborators outside the Institute, I have to record the indebted-
ness of the Bolard to : Pandit Vidhushekhar Bhattacharya, m.a.,. Principal of the
Visvabharati, Bolpur ; Rajaguru Pandit Hemraj, Ehrector of Public Instruction,
Nepal ; M. R. Ry. Sambamurti Row, Honorlary Secretary, Palace Library, Tanjore ;
and Prof. K. Rama Pisharoti, m.a.. Principal of the Sanskrit College, Trippunit-
tura. Cochin. These gentlemen have been good enough to supply the Institute with
carefully prepared collations of manuscripts which are in their charge or which were
kindly procnjced for the purpose by them. The Nirnaya Sagar Pres's has rendered
ungrudgingly every assistance in carrying out the typographical anangements which
appeared to me best suited for the purposes of the work. The illustration accom-
panying this fascicule is prepared from a w'ater-cdjlour painting kindly supplied by
the Chief of Aundh.


In conclusion, I may be permitted to remark that the renown of the
Bharatavar^a; of its Princes and its People, is for all time inseparably linked
with the' Mahabharata, which is, in more senses than one the greatest epic the
world has produced. It must be manifest to anyone who bestows a thought
on the' subject that the monumental work of preparing the first critical edition
of this colossal encyclopaedia of ancient India could be carried on and com-
pleted by the young Institute by which it has been undertaken only if it can
count upon substantial aid from other sources and upon co-operation on a
much wider scale'. If the Princes and the People of India were to associate
themselves with this imposing enterprise, they would indeed be supporting
a national work. On behalf of the Institute which I represent, I appeal to
all true Indians to ally themselves with the Institute in supporting the publi-
cation of a work which is in a unique manner bound up with the history of
the Indian pePple and the prestige of Indian scholarship.

POSTCRIPT

Since the manuscript of this fascicule was sent to the press, I was able
to make arrangements for securing collations of Sarada and! Nepali manuscripts
of the Adiparvan. These collations will be published later. Here it may just
be' remarked that the collations so far received wholly support the constituted
text, especially as regards the interpolated stanzas, proving the correctness of
the method adopted in setting the text.

## PROLEGOMENA


The need of a critical or as it was sometimes called a correct edition
of the Mahabharata has been felt (at first, of course, rather vaguely) by
Sanskritists for over half a century.^ It was voiced., however, in a clear and
emphatic manner, for the first time, by Professor M. Winternitz, at the
Xlth International Congress of Orientalists., held at Paris, in 1897, when he
read a paper drawing attention to the South Indian manuscripts of the
Great Epic and ending with the remark that a critical edition of the Maha-
bharata was “ wanted as the only sound basis for all Mahabharata studies,
nay, for all studies connected with the epic literature of India The idea
received a concrete shape in his proposal for the foundation of a Sanskrit
Epic Text Society, which he laid before the very next session of the Oriental
Congress (Xllth), held in Rome (1899). Again, three years later, at the
following session of the Congress (Xlllth), held in Hamburg (1902), Pro-
fessor Winternitz reiterated his requisition and endeavoured to impress
again upon the assembled savants that a critical edition of the Mahablia-
rata was a sine qua non for all historical and critical research regarding the
Great Epic of India

The reception accorded to the! various proposals made by Professor
Winternitz in connection with his favourite project was not as cordial as
might have been expected from an enlightened, international assemblage of
Sanskritists. “ At first ”, writes Professor Winternitz himself,'^ “ the idea
of a critical edition of the Mahabharata met with great scepticism. Most
scholars were of opinion that it was impossible to restore a critical text of
the Great Epic, and that we should have to be satisfied with editing the
Scuth Indian text, while the North Indian text was represented well enough
by the Calcutta and Bombay editions. Only few scholars were in full agree-
ment with the plan of one critical edition”.

Notwithstanding this general apathy, a committee was appointed by the
Indian Seclion of the International Congress of Orientalists in Rome (1899)
to consider the proposal of Professor Winternitz for the foundation of a
Sanskrit Epic Text Society, already mentioned. This committee was not in
favour of the said proposal. It recommended instead that the work of
preparing the critical edition should be undertaken by the International
Association of Academies. The London session of this Association, held in

1904, adopted the above suggestion and resolved “to make the critical edi-
tion of the Mahabharata one of the tasks to be undertaken under its auspices
and with the help of funds to be raised by the Academies.” In pursuance
of this decision, the Academies of Berlin and Vienna sanctioned certain
funds earmarked for the Mahabharata work, with whose help the prelimi-
nary work for the critical edition was actually begun.

£2} In furtherance of this project, then, Professor H. Luders prepared
a “Specimen” of a critical edition of the Mahabharata (Druckprobe einer
kritischen Ausgabe des Mahabharata, Leipzig 1908) with the funds provid-
ed for the purpose by the Konigliche Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften in
Gottingen.^ The Specimen, which was meant only for private circulation,-
consisted of 18 pages, comprising the constituted text (pp. l-ll)of the first
67 stanzas of the Adiparvan with their various readings (printed as foot-
notes), an Appendix (pp. 12-17), on a similar plan, containing the text of
the Brahma -Ganesa interpolation (with its variants), and finally a list
(p. 18) of the 29 manuscripts, selected exclusively from European libraries,
which formed the specimen apparatus criticm^'^ This little brochure, which
must rank in the annals of Mahabharata studies as the first tentative criti
cal edition of the Mahabharata, was laid before the Indian Section of the
XVth International Congress of Orientalists, held in Copenhagen (1908).
The tender seedling, planted with infinite care, did not, however, thrive in the
uncongenial European soil. Twenty years later, in 1928, at the XVIIth
International Congress of Orientalists, held at Oxford', Professor Winter-
NiTZ reported that, under the scheme of the International Association of
Academies, “except this specimen (Druckprobe) nothing has been
printed ”.^

However, in the interval some preliminary wwk, such as the classifying
and collating of manuscripts had been done by Professor Luders and some
of his pupils (among them my fellow-student and friend Dr. Johannes
Nobel, now Professor in the University of Marburg), by Professor Win-
TERNITZ and his pupil Dr. Otto‘ Stein, and by Dr. Bernhard Geiger
(Vienna). The last great World War gave its quietus to this ambitious
project, sponsored by the Associated Academies of Europe and America, and
finally diverted the attention of European scholars from the Mahabharata
Problem.


^ It was printed by the firm of W. Drugulin.

2 Professor Winternitz had sent me, in 1926, his copy, on loan, for perusal,
which I returned to him almost immediately afterwards.

^ The brochure did not contain any preface, or explanatory notes.

After the war, the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, then in its
early infancy, enthusiastically undertook the work, making a fresh start,
fortunately without realizing fully the enormousness of the project or the
complicacies of the problem. At a meeting of the General Body of the
Institute, held on July 6, 1918, Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, Chief
(now Ruler) of Aundh — the liberal and enthusiastic patron of diverse' projects
calculated to stimulate research, advance knowledge, and enhance Indian
prestige — the president elect on the occasion, easily persuaded by a band of
young and hopeful Sanskritists who had returned to India after completing
their philological training abroad, with their heads full of new ideas, urged
upon the audience the need of preparing a Critical and Illustrated Edition
of the Mahabharata, offering to contribute, personally, a lakh of rupees, by
annual grants, towards the expenses of producing the edition.^ The donor
was warmly thanked for this princely {3} gift and the offer was gratefully ac-
cepted by the spokesmen of the Institute, who in their turn undertook to
prepare an edition that would: meet with the high requirements of modem
critical scholarship. In accordance with this decision of the General Body
of the Institute, the late lamented Sir Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, the
doyen of the Sanskritists of Western India and' the inspirer of the critical
and rigorous scholarship of the present day, inaugurated, in April 1919, this
monumental work by formally beginning the collation of the opening jnmt-
tra of the works of the ancient Bhagavata sect, which is found also at the
beginning of sotne manuscripts of the Mahabharata

Then, on the basis of the premise of the donation of a lakh of rupees by the
Ruler of Aundh, the Institute appealed for the very large financial support
needed to Indian governments, princes, and men of wealth. Not as many
favourable responses were received as might have been expected ; but very
generous aid wais and is being given by some, whose names are recorded
elsewhere.

The reasons which have induced Sanskritists both here and abroad to
undertake Ihis gigantic enterprise are easy to understand. The pre-emi-
nent importance of the epic is universally acknowledged. Next to the
Vedas, it is the most valuable product of the entire literature of ancient
India, so rich in notable works. Venerable for its very antiquity, it is one

of the most inspiring monuments of the world, and an inexhaustible mine
for the investigation of the religion, mythology, legend, philosophy, law,
custom, and political and social institutions of ancient India.

As a result of researches that have been carried on during the last
thirty-five years or so, there is now no doubt whatsoever that the text of
the Mahabhiarata has undergone numerous changes.^ The texts of the
Northern and Southern manuscripts — ^to mention only two of the manus-
cript classes — are widely divergent, and much uncertainty prevails regarding
the correctness and originality of the texts preserved by them. The exist-
ing editions — which either merely reproduce the version of a particular type
of manuscripts, like the Bombay edition,^ or else are eclectic on no recog-
nizable principles, like the Kumbhakonam edition — fail to remove the uncer-
tainty of the text.

The present edition of the epic is intended chiefly to remedy this un-
satisfactory state of things. What the promoters of this ^heme desire to
produce and supply is briefly this : a critical edition of the Mahabharata
in the preparation of which all important versions of the Great Epic shall
have been taken into consideration, and all important manuscripts collated,
estimated and turned to account. Since all divergent readings of any im-
portance will be given in the critical notes, printed at the foot of the page,
this £4} edition will, for the first time,, render it possible for the reader to have
before him the entire significant evidence for each individual passage. The
value of this method for scientific investigation of the epic is obvious.
Another feature of the new edition will be this. Since not even the seem-
ingly most irrelevant line or stanza, actually found in a Mahabharata
manuscript collated for the edition, is on any account omitted, this edition
of the Mahabharata' will be, in a sense, more complete than any previous
edition.'^ It will be a veritable thesaurus of the Mahabharata tradition.

Undc'r the scheme outlined above, a tentative edition of the Viratapar-
van was prepared by the late Mr. Narayan Bapuji Utgikar, M.A., and
published by the Institute in 1923. Copies of this edition were distributed
gratis among leading Sanskritists — Indian, European and American — ^with
a view to eliciting from them a frank expression of their opinipo on the
method worked out by the then editor-in-chief. The opinions received were
very favourable and highly encouraging. The valuable suggestions made

by many eminent authorities have been to a great extent followed in the
subsequent work.


COLLATION OF MANUSCRIPTS

Collation of the manuscripts is being done, regularly, not merely at the Insti-
tute, but also at the Visvabharati of Rabindranath Tagore in Bengal under the
supervision of Pandit Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya, and at the Saraswati Mahal
in Tanjore under the supervision of M. R. Ry. Rao Saheb T. Sambamurthi Rao
Avl., B.A., B.L. These outside centres were at first intended chiefly for the colla-
tion of the Bengali and the Telugu-Grantha manuscripts respectively. But provi-
sion has now been made at the Institute itself for the collation of manuscripts
written in any of the seven scripts (Sarada, Nepiall, Maithili, Bengali, Telugu,
Grantha and Malayalam), besides Devanagari, which are ordinarily required for
our Mahabharata work.

The entire Mahabharata stands now collated from a minimum of ten manus-
cripts ; many parvans have been completely collated from twenty manuscripts ;
some from thirty ; a few from as many as forty ; while the first two adhyiayas of the
Adi, which have special importance for the critical constitution of the text of the
entire epic, were collated from no less than sixty manuscripts.

The collation is done by a permanent staff of specially trained Shastris (Nor-
thern as well as Southern) and University graduates. For the purposes of oolla'
tion, each Mahabharata stanza (according to the Bombay edition of Ganpat
Krishna ji, ^aka 1799) is first ^^Titten out, in bold characters, on the top line of
a standard, horizontally and vertically ruled foolscap sheet. The variant read-
ings are entered by the collator horizontally along a line allotted to the manus-
cript collated, ak§ara by aki§ara, in the appropriate column, vertically below the
corresponding portion of the original reading of the “ Vulgate On the right
of each of these collation sheets, there is a column four inches wide reserved for
remarks (regarding corrections, marginal additions etc.), and for ‘'additional”
stanzas found in the manuscripts collated, either immediately before or after £5} the
stanza in question. Very long “ additions ” are written out on separate “ .sodha-
patras ” and attached to the collation sheets. Tlie collations are regularly checked
by a batch of collators different from the one which did the collation in the first
instance, before they are handed over to the editor for the constitution of the text.

THE CRITICAL APPARATUS

GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

It is by no means easy to answer the question how many manuscripts of
the MahaBharata there are in existence ; firstly, because, no complete list of
these manuscripts has ever been compiled ; and, secondly, because the ex-
pression “Mahabharata manuscript’’, as ordinarily used, is ambiguous in
the extreme ; it may apply to a small manuscript of the Bhagavadgita alone,
as well as to a complete manuscript of the Mahabharata, in several volumes,
containing all the eighteen parvans. Moreover, the parvans are mostly
handed down separately, or in groups of few parvans at a time, at least in
the oldest manuscripts now preserved. Therefore, in taking stock of Maiia-
bharata manuscripts, it is best to take as unit of measurement a manuscript
of a single parvan.



PROLEGOMENA

As a very approximate computation, I may state that there are known
to be about 235 manuscripts of the Adi, counting only such as have
come within my knowledge from catalogues of private and public libraries
accessible to me, as also those manuscripts whose owners have sent them to
the Institute for collation or inspection. But this is probably by a long
way not the total number of extant manuscripts of this parvan, because
there must be quite a large number of manuscripts in ‘private hands, of
which we know next to nothing. It has been the experience of most
manuscript collectors in India that when one takes the trouble to look for
the manuscripts, they^ turn up in quite astonishing numbers, though they
are as a rule late and of questionable worth. Of these 235 manuscripts of
the Adi, a little less than half (107) are in the Devanagarl script alone. The
other scripts are represented in this collection as follows : Bengali 32,
Grantha 31, Telugu 28, Malayalam 26, Nepali 5, iSarada 3,^ Maithili 1,
Kannada 1, and Nandiniagari 1.

Of these manuscripts of the Adi about 70 (i.e. a little more than 29
per cent of the total) were fully or partly examined and collated for this
edition. And of these again about 60 were actually utilized in preparing
the text. The critical apparatus of the first two adhyayas gives the colla-
tions of 50 manuscripts. Many of these were, however, discarded in the
sequel as misch-codices of small trustworthiness and of no special value for
critical purposes. At the same time a few other manuscripts (such as the
Sarada and Nepali codices), which were not available in the beginning,
were added to the critical apparatus subsequently. A table given below
supplies all the necessary details of the critical apparatus as to where the
collations of the different manuscripts begin, where theyi end, and so on and
so forth.

£6} The choice of the' critical apparatus is not easy matter, owing to
the astonishing bulk and the amazing variety of the material. The number of
exact duplicates among these is decidedly small and almost negligible. An
exception to this rule is formed only by manuscripts of commentators' ver-
sions, which show inter se little difference. So that what has been said by
Kosegarten with respect to the manuscripts of the Pahcatantra,, applies,
generally speaking, equally well to the Mahabharata manuscripts'*: quot co-
dices, tot textus. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the choice of our criti-
cal apparatus has not been entirely arbitrary. Efforts were made to secure
manuscripts written in as many different Indian scripts as possible, which
is the same as saying, manuscripts belonging to as many different Indian


^ Of these three, our is one, while the other two are paper manuscripts,
written in madem <Saradla characters, with Nilakantha’s commentary, in the
Raghunatha Temple Library; cf. Stein’s Catalogue (1894), p. 196, Nos. 3712-32,
3951-79. They represent probably the Nilakantha version.

provinces as possible. Old manuscripts, even though fragmentary and
partly illegible, were selected in preference to moderndooking manuscripts,
though complete, neatly written and well preserved. Within the version,
discrepant type's were chosen in preference to similar types.^ Of the Nila-
kantha version, only three were selected, though it is by far the most nume-
rous group ; because, firstly, it is one of the late^ versions ; and, secondly it
has been edited several times already, though not as well as it should be ;
and, thirdly, there is little difference between the individual manuscripts of
the group. The only important scripts unrepresented in our critical appa-
ratus are : Kannada, Uriya and Nahdinagarl.

Besides the manuscripts collated specially for this edition, I have made
occasional use of the collations of manuscripts preserved in European libra-
ries made by Theodor Goldstucker, photographic copies of which were
presented to the Institute, for use in connection with this project by the
University of Strassburg, through the kind offices of the late Professor Emile
Senart, as also of the collations intended for the edition planned by the
International Association of Academies and made by the pupils of Geheim-
rat Professor Dr. Heinrich Luders, which have been plated at the disposal
of the Institute in pursuance of a resolution on the subject passed by the
Indian Section of the XVIIth International Congress of Orientalists, held
at Oxford, in 1928.^

Sixteen of the manuscripts collated bear dates, ranging from the 16th to
the 19th century. The oldest dated manuscript of our critical apparatus is a
Nepali manuscript which bears a date corresponding to a.d. 1511.*

The other dates are: a.d. 1519 (K3), 1528 (VJ, 1598 (DJ, 1620 (Da^),

1638 (KJ, 1694 (KJ, 1701 (Dr3), 1739 (K,,), 1740 (BJ, 1759 (B.),

1786 (B,), 1802 (Dn), 1808 (Dn,), 1838 (Mo), and 1842 (M,). The

Nilakantha manuscripts are' not all dated, but they can scarcely be much
anterior to the beginning of the eighteenth century, since Nilakantha himself

^ Consequently, our critical apparatus tends to reflect greater diversity in the
material than what actually exists, but that was unavoidable.

2 Th^ Resolutions were worded as follows :

No. 2. That in view of the eminently satisfactory manner in which the work
is being done by the Institute, this Congress is of opinion that the MSS. collations
made, and the funds collected, for the critical edition of the epic planned by the
Association of Academies, be now utilized for the purposes of the critical edition
being prepared in India, without prejudice to the original project of the Asso-
ciation of Academies.

No. 3. That this Congress therefore recommends that : (a) such collations
of the Mahabharata text as have already been prepared by the Association of
Academies be placed, on loan, at the disposal of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research
Institute

manuscripts do bear dates, but since they refer to a cyclic era, it is difficult
to calculate their equivalents.

CLASSIFICATION OF MANUSCRIPTS

The manuscript material is divided naturally into recensions by the
scripts in which they are written. Corresponding to the two main types of
India'n scripts, Northern and Southern, we get two main recensions of the
epic. Each of these recensions is again divided into a number of sub-recen-
sions, which I have called “ versions ”, corresponding to the different provin-
cial scripts in which these texts are written. This principium divisionis is
net as arbitrary as it might at first sight appear. The superficial difference
of scripts corresponds, as a matter of fact, to deep underlying textual diffe-
rence's. It is common experience in India that when we have a work hand-
ed down in different versions, the script is invariably characteristic of the
version.! The reason for this concomitance between script and version ap-
pears to be that the scribes, being as a rule not conversant with any script
but that cf their own particular province, could copy only manuscripts
written in their special provincial scripts, exception being made only in favour
of Devanagari, which was a sort of a ” vulgar ” script, widely used and
understood in India.

While the principle mentioned above is not entirely mechanical or arbi-
trary, it is also not ideal or perfect. It is often contravened in practice,
mainly through the agency of the Devanagari, which is the chief medium cf
contamination between the different recensions and versions. Thus we come
across Devanagari copies of the commentary or version of Arjunamisra, who
was an Easterner ; similar copies of the commentary or version of Ratna-
garbha, who was a Southerner. There are again Devanagari copies of the
Grantha and the Sarada- versions. Dn the other hand, a popular version
like that of Nilakaintha may be copied in any script. I have come across
manuscripts of the Nilakantha (Devanagari) version written in Sarada,!^ Ben-
gali,'* Telugu and Grantha scripts. Another cause of disturbance was this.
Along the boundaries of provinces speaking different languages or using dif-
ferent scripts, there are invariably bi-lingual and bi-scriptal zones. In these
zones there was an ever operating impulse, tending to introduce iijpovations,
obliterating the' differentiae and normalizing the text. Nevertheless, though
nothing is impossible, it would be passing strange if we were to find a copy
of the pure Sarada version written, say, in the Malayalam script, or cf the
Grantha version in the Nepali script.

£10} DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

S,

Poona, Bombay Government Collection (deposited at the BORI), No. 159 of
1875'76. Total number of folios' 1,14 (some frajtmentary) , with about 24 lines to a
page ; size 12" X Clear Sarada characters (of perhaps the 16th or 17th century),
Birchbark ( bhurjapatra) .

This unique and valuable MS. was purchased for the Government of
Bombay, by Buhler, in Kasmir. It is listed on p. xi. and cursorily described
at p. 64, of his Detailed Report of a Tour in Search of Sanskrit MSS. made
in Kasmir, Rajputana and Central India, a report printed as Extra Number
of the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1877.
The lines of writing of the MS. run parallel to the narrow side of the leaf.
There are, on an average, 24 lines on a page, and 36 aksaras ( i.e. a little over
a sloka) in a line. A page, therefore, contains, on an average. 26 (anustubh)
stanzas. Each folio bears, on its reverse, in the left-hand margin, near the
bottom, a cipher representing the serial number of the folio and a signature
indicating the title of the work, as well as the name of the parvan. — The MS.,
which is unfortunately incomplete and fragmentary, must have originally con-
tained at le'ast the first three parvans (Adi, Sabha and Aranya), written, as
far as one can judge, by the same hand. The extant portion contains the
Sabha in its entirety, but only fragments of the other two parvans, the begin-
ning of Adi and the end of Aranya being lost. The Adi, which appears to have
extended from the beginning of the volume up to fol. 154, is particularly frag-
mentary ; a continuous text begins only* from fol. 63 (our adhy. 82). Of the
first 62 folios, the extant portion contains only the lower segments (with 10 to
15 lines of writing on each page) of fol. 24-25, 36-37, 39, 47-48, 53-57 and
61-62 ; the initial 23 folios as also 15 other intermediate folios (viz. 38, 40-46,
49-52, 58-60) are entirely missing ; while only 10 of these folios are complete.
Folio number 96 is repeated. The Adi ends at fol. 154a. The colophon repeats
the stanzas of the Parvasarhgraha giving the number of adhyayas (230) in this
paiwan, as also its extent in “ slokas ", i.e. granthas (7984). The writing is neat
and careful ; erasures and corrections are few and far between. Occasionally one
comes across variant readings (cf. fol. 115b), entered (probably by the same
hand) in fet smaller letters between the lines ; on fol. 116a, there is a stanza
written in the upper margin, which is meant to be added after 1. 162. 15, and
which is found, otherwise, only in K^, in other words is\n interpolation pecu-
liar to §1 Kj. Many of the marginal additions are glosses, which are rather
numerous in the first 15 (extant) folios, evidently note's made from some com-
mentary by a student who intended making a careful study of the text. In
a few places — perhaps about half a dozen— corrections have been made with
yellow pigment. Some of the adhyayas bear (serial) numbers, written pro-
bably by a different hand ; the first (legible) figure that we come across is 43,
corresponding to adhy. 32 of our edition, involving a difference of 11 in our



PROLEGOMENA


21


enumerations of adhyayas ! The last adhyaya number noted in this parvan
is 100, corresponding to our adhy. 87 : the difference between our enumera-
tions thus rises to 13 in 55 adhyayas. The Puranic raconteur is here called,
throughout, Suta, not Sauti. Moreover, the prose formula of reference gene-
rally omits [11} (resp. ^5:)^ and gives, as in S MSS., merely the name
or designation of the speaker, such as However, from the fact that

towards the middle and end of the parvan, the full forms containing
(resp. ) do occur sporadically, e.g. 1. 94. 64 (fol. 73a); 98. 1 (fol. 75b);

99. 36 (fol. 77a) etc. : it follows that the usual etc. are only abbre-

viations. The names of the sub-parvans are generally added, in the colo-
phons, agreeing mostly with the corresponding divisions of our edition. The
extant fragment begins (fol, 24a) with the words a^qq*. i ^?qw4

(cf. V. 1. 1. 26. 10). — A facsimile of the folio (154) containing the' end of the
Adi and the beginning of the Sabha is given, facing p. 880.

Ko

Poona, Bombay Government Collection (deposited at the BORI), No. 229 of
1895-1902. Folios 181, with about 15 lines to a page ; size 147" X 6 7". Devana-
garl characters ; dated V. Samvat 1795 (ca. a.d. 1739). Old Indian paper.

The- MS. contains the first three parvans written in the same hand, the
date coming at the end of the Aranya. The writing is clear and fairly correct ;
a few corrections of scribe’s errors are noted in the margin, probably by the
same hand ; otherwise the margins are clean. The colophons give adhyaya
numbers sporadically, and names of adhyayas, sub-parvans or upakhyianas
generally. On the last folio (181) of the Adi is given, in different hand, a list
of major parvans with the corres[X)nding number of their adhyayas and
stanzas, in a tabular form.

London, India Office Library, No. 3226 (2137). Folios 169, with about 33

Indian Paper.

A moderately trustworthy, though some’what modern and very incorrect
transcript of a :^rada exemplar. Even the outward form and get-up of this
MS. are suggestive of Kasmiri origin. The lines of writing, as^in Sarada
(bhurjapatra) MSS. run parallel to the narrow side of the folio. The signa-
tures in the margin are like those found in Kasmiri books. The numerous
clerical errors, which disfigure every page, betray the writer to be a profes-
sional scribe, not thoroughly familiar with the awkward Sarada script, and
still less so with the language of the text, easily misled by the deceptive simi-
larity between certain letters of the Sarada and Devanagari alphabets. He

frequently writes ^ for ^ (e. g. for ^f%); ^ for ^ and e. g. m\ for

sional corrections, in the body of the text, by yellow pigment. The pages from
42 to 45 are left blank, while 41b and 46a contain only a few lines of writing.
Besides Adi, the codex contains also Virata, Bhi§ma and a portion of Anu^-
sana (Danadharma), breaking off at the first half of stanza 39 of adhy. 83 of
the Bombay ed. According to statements at the end of the Bhisma and the
beginning of the Anusasana, the MS. was written in V. Sarhvat 1839 (ca. a.d.
1783), by a Brahmaaia named Gopala, residing in Laksmimatha ; but the
writing of the volume is not quite uniform. It is, therefore, uncertain, in my
opinion, whether the Adi was written by this same Gopala, in the said year ;
contra Eggeling, Catalogue of the Skt. MSS. £12} in the Library of the In-
dia Office, Part VI (1899), p. 1158, who regards the entire volume as written
by the same scribe. The colophons, which are short, sporadically give the
adhyaya numbers. This is the' only MS. of the Adi belonging to a European
Library that was available for collation at the Institute and used for this edi-
tion !— The reference ^ f before stanza 8 of adhy. 1 indicates the inten-
tion of the scribe to “ illuminate ” the MS. by writing the alternate letters
( fl, ) which are missing, in red ink.

Poona, Bombay Government Collection (deposited at the BORI), No. 182 of
1891-96. Folios' 296 (of which 220, 226-30, 232-33^ 239-40 appear to be written by a
different hand), with about 11 lines to a page; size 10*8" X 4*8". Devanagari
characters (with sporadic prsthamatras) ; dated V. Sam 1694 (ca. a.d. 1638). Indian
paper.

Marginal corrections, as also other corrections in the body of the text, are
made by using yellow pigment ; the colophons give names of sub-parvans,
adhyaya names, and adhyaya numbers sporadically. In the marginal notes
one occasionally come's across variants and glosses, and additional passages
from MSS. of the central sub-recension (y). The first folio and a part of the
second (the latter stuck on to the original torn) are written in a different
hand. Our fol. 186b, three lines are left blank by the ^ribe. After the four
stanzas of “ phalasruti ” mentioned on p. 879, there follow two stanzas of the
parva-samgraha, giving the number of adhyayas (218) and slokas (8984) and,

whose point of insertion is indicated by a small mark made in the body of
the’ text, and the marginal remark (cf. 1. 1. 1. 53). There

are some excerpts in margins, intended as glosses. Marginal additions of lines
and stanzas are frequent only in the first 35 folios, afterwards few and far
between. Corrections are made with yellow pigment. Colophons frequently
contain adhyaya names, sub-parvan names, but no adhyaya number. The

scribe’s errors, additional lines and stanzas (some of them probably omitted
while copying), and various readings, which are decidedly more numerous in
the beginning. On some folios (after fol. 105) yellow pigment fias been used
for correction. Here and there, lacunae mark the‘ syllables which the scribe
could not decipher, or which were missing in the exemplar. The colophons
generally give the adhyaya or sub-parvan names ; the adhyaya numbers were
added afterwards, perhaps by a different hand, and are often crowded out or
squeezed in with difficulty. — Collated up to the end of adhy. 2 only.

1879-80. Folios 416, with about 7-10 lines' to a page ; size 15|" .X 6|". Devaniagari
characters. Old Indian glossy paper.

Text with commentary of Arjunamisra ; written neatly but extremely
corrupt and unintelligible in iilaces, on account of the scribe’s inability to read
the exemplar correctly. The' MS. has many short and long blanks in the text,
which support the latter surmise. It has very few glosses and corrections,
but a large number of variants noted in the margin. The text is written in
three strips : the upper and lower ones comprise the commentary, while the
central band, which has generally a still wider margin, is the (epic) text. The
references to speaker (such as colophons are' written in

red ink. The colophons give generally adhyaya and sub-parvan names.
Slokas are generally numbered ; adhyayas are almost regularly numbered from
adhy. 45 to 109. The MS. is almost consistent in writing ( for

Punctuation is most imperfect. In the numbering of the folios, num-
ber 2 is repeated.

The date of the MS. is giveh as a chronogram corresponding to V. Sahivat
1676 (ca. A.D. 1620). Double dandas in red ink are inserted indiscriminately
in the middle of the text. The writing, which is full of mistakes, is uniform
but not neat. No corrections are, however, to be seen, the MS. being, per-
haps, not much used. Notwithstanding the fact that this MS. agrees, page
for page, with Daj, there are many small differences between them ; neither
can be a direct copy of the other ; they must go back to a more remote com-
mon source. It appears to be older, and is less corrupt, than Daj. In the
numbering of the folios, figure 1 is repeated. The colophons contain the
names of adh5^yas and sub-parvans generally ; but sloka numbers or adhyaya
numbers only sporadically. The MS. has a few blanks in the text and com-
mentary.


Dn^

Ms, belonging to Sardar M, V, KiftE of Indore. Folios 446, with about 8-10

Text with commentary of Nilakantha. Folios 439, 442, 444-5 are written
by a different hand. The commentary, and even the text, is sometimes con-
tinued on the margin. Sporadically one comes across corrections or readings
noted in the margin ; occasionally also corrections in the body are made by
scoring out the portion to be deleted or by writing over, or with yellow pig-
ment. The MS. is, on the whole, correct and very clearly written, Da{ndas are
marked in red ink. What would have been blanks in the space left for the
text or commentary are often filled up by the addition of pious invocations
such as W: I Adhyayas are sporadi-

cally numbered and slokas are regularly numbered in both the text and the
commentary. The' c<iJophons give, in general, the adhyaya name or sub-par-
van name. The last colophon contains the date : Isvara sairhvatsara, marga-
slr^a suddha 13, which cannot be identified',

For the first 140 folios or so, colophons and part references to speakers

sporadically give adhyaya or sub-parvan name and number of adhyayas (es-

is generally correct ; margins are clean. — This is a complete MS. oj Mbh.,
copied apparently from different exemplars ; some parvans have the com-

date, being written cn paper with water-marks. Some of the parvans bear
dates at the end, but these seem to be copied from the originals ; thus, Santi

In view of the great unevenness of the critical apparatus, and of the con-
sequent difficulty likely to be experienced by readers using the critical notes
(printed at the foot of the page) in ascertaining what manuscripts have been
added, discontinued, or discarded at different points of the text, I append, on
the following page, a table which shows at a glance just what manuscripts have
been actually collated for different portions of the text. Even the larger lacu-
nae of the manuscripts, which cannot be easily ascertained, have' been exhi-
bited in this table. Only such (small) omissions have been, as a rule, ignored
as are specifically mentioned in the footnote itself pertaining to the particular
stanza, and which are therefore brought to the notice of the reader as soon
as he reads the' footnote.

£25} TESTIMONIA

As testimonia, or aids of a partial or subsidiary character, there are
available, besides the numerous commentaries, the following three important
epitomes of the eleventh century : (i) the Javanese adaptation BMraiam
(ca. A.D. 1000), (ii) the Telugu adaptation Andihra Bhdmtamu by the
Telugu poet Nannaya Bhatta (ca. a.d. 1025), and (iii) the Sanskrit adapta*
tion Bhdrai\amanjari by the Kasmiri poet K^emendra (ca. A.D. 1050) ; as
' also an important Persian rendering made some centuries later (ca. a.d. 1580)
at the instance of that enlightened and sagacious Emperor of India with
catholic sympathies, the great Akbar.

The commentaries collated for this edition are dealt with below, under
the Devanagari versions. Here it will suffice to observe that, even when
accompanied by the (epic) text, the commentaries are, for reasons which
will be explained later on, evidence only for the actual lemmata and the
pafhantaras cited. The absence of commentary on a stanza or a group of
stanzas or even on an adhyaya is, in general, no proof that that particular
passage was lacking in the text used by the commentator. For, clearly, his
text may have contained the passage in question, but he may not have
deemed it necessary to comment upon any portion of it. Nevertheless when
the commentary ignores a lengthy and difficult passage, then there is a strong
presumption that the text of the commentator did not contain the passage.
A case in point is the Kanikaniti, a passage of 186 lines, which is entirely
ignored in Devabodha’s commentary (but has evoked lengthy comments from
both Arjunamisra and Nilakantha), and which is missing in the Kasmiri
version.

As regards the old Javanese adaptation, from the reports of Dutch
scholars^ who have studied the original Javanese text, it apix^ars that only
eight out of the eighteen parvans of the Mahabhiarata have been traced so
far ; namely, Adi, Virata, Udyoga, Bhi:§ma, Asramavasa, Mausala, Maha>
prasthana and Svargarohana. Three of these (Asramavasa, Mausala,
Mahaprasthana) were the subject of a doctor dissertation, submitted to the
Leyden University by Dr. H. H. Juynboll, as early as 1893. The Javanese
original was edited by the doctor in Roman characters and rendered into
Dutch. iTiirteen years later (1996) the same scholar published the text of
the Adi (with different readings) in Roman transcript.^ Of the old Javanese
Adiparvan, only a few episodes have been as yet translated, to wit : the
Parvasairhgraha, the Paui§ya, the Amrtamanthana, the story of Parik^it and

the Sauparna. Unfortunately these translations are not available in India ;
at least they were not available to me.

The chief value of the Javanese adaptation for us lies in the fact that
throughout the old Javanese text are scattered Sanskrit quotations, which
appear to have “ served as landmarks for writers and hearers or readers.”
The text prepared by Dr. Juynboll, which is based upon eight manuscripts,
is reputed to be very accurate. But it is admitted that the Sanskrit excerpts
in the extant Javanese manuscripts are extremely corrupt, and it is a {26}
que'stion how far the conjectural restorations by the editor correctly represent
the original readings. It seems to me likely that in his reconstructions
Dr. Juynboll was to a certain extent influenced by the wording of the Vulgate,
which is certainly not always original. To give only one instance. On p. 70,
the Javanese manuscripts read (in the sakuntala episode) :

paripatyadayah sunu, harajnirenugunditali |,
which is corrupt ; it conveys no sense. In the text the editor gives :
pratipadya pada sunur, dharanirenu gunthitah 1 ,

which is nearly the reading of the Calcutta edition (3040). Though the
Javanese manuscripts are palpably corrupt, yet they have preserved the cor-
rect patipatya (for pratipadya of the Vulgate), which is the reading of the
Sarada and K manuscripts of our edition. We have here to thank the Vul-
gate for the pratipadya of Dr. Juynboll’s text !

Notwithstanding, that the period from which this adaptation dates is
comparatively speaking recent, it yet precedes the known date of the manus-
cripts by several centuries and is hence of considerable importance for critical
purposes, as a witness^' independent of and uninfluenced by the main line of
our extant Indian witnesses. Most of the Sanskrit quotations of the Javanese
text can be traced both in the Northern and the Southern recensions, as may
be seen from our Appendix II, at the end of this volume, which contains a
concordance of the Javanese extracts with the Critical Edition, the Calcutta
Edition, and Sastri’s Southern Recension. A few of the quotations are to
be traced to the ” additional ” passages in the Northern manuscripts, but
none to the specific Southern “ additions.” The conclusion is inevitable that
the text of the Sanskrit Adiparvan used by the Javanese writers* must have
belonged to the Northern recension, a conclusion already suggested by the
sequence of the Sakuntala and Yayati episodes, which is the Northern
sequence. This does not necessarily mean that the entire Javanese Bharatam
represents the Northern recension. It is quite likely that some of the parvans
utilized by the Javanese adapters belonged to the Southern recension. The
late Mr. Utgikar^ was inclined to think that the Javanese Viriataparvan

was of the Southern type. The point will have to be re-examined in the
light of further evidence.* The books were preserved and handed down
separately ; consequently the genesis of each parvan must be investigated
separately.

The Telugu adaptation, the Andhra Bhdratamu} is a metrical epitome
of the Mahabharata, commenced by Nannaya Bhatta, a court poet of the
Eastern Calukya king Vi^uvardhana, who had his capital at Rajahmundry,
on the East Coast of India, and who appears to have ruled between 1022
and 1066.2 The torso of the Telugu rendering left behind by Nannaya,
consisting of a version of the first two parvans and of a part of the third, was
completed many years later by two others poets. Nannaya’s version is valuable
for the light it throws on the condition of the Southern recension — or, strictly
speaking, of the Telugu version — in the eleventh century of the Christian era,
especially in view of {27} the fact that Nannaya has included in his poem an
accurate rendering of the Parvasamgraha, giving the number of slokas in
each of the parvans of his Mahabharata.-' The figure for the stanzas of the
Adi is 9984, which shows that the text used by Nannaya must have been
substantially of the same size as that preserved in the extant Southern
manuscripts. The poet is reported to have followed the original fairly closely.
Notable is consequently his omission of Brahma s visit to Vyasa.^*

Curiously enough, the third old important epitome of the Mahabharata
which we possess, the Bharat amah jari by Ksemendra," belongs to the same
century as the two epitomes mentioned above, since this Kasmiri poet must
also be assigned to the middle of the eleventh century.^* Buhler and Kirste
have given in their Indian Studies, No. 2 (pp. 30 ff.), the results of a careful
comparison of K^mendra’s abstract with the Bombay text of the Maha-
bharata. They show that K^emendra’s text contains both additions and
omissions as compared with the latter." Of the omissions they note : adhy,
4, 24, 45-48, 66, 94, 139, and parts of adhy^ 141 and 197 of the Vulgate.
Of these, adhy. 4 is, as pointed out by Buhler and Kirste, a short introduc-
tory chapter, a variant of adhy. 1 ; adhy. 45-48 are a repetition (with
variations) of adhy. 13-15 ; adhy. 66 is a variant of the preceding adhyaya ;
adhy. 94 is a variant of adhy. 95 (prose), which is selected by Ksemendra

for his purpose finally, stanzas 44 to end of adhy. 197 are a repetition of
a part of adhy. 169. The reason for the omission of these adhyayas is thus
clear : they are mere repetitions. The remaining adhyayas, which are missing
and whose omission Buhler-Kirste could not account for, namely, adhy.
24, 139, and 141 (stanzas 1-19) are also missing in many of our Maha-
bharata manuscripts and have accordingly been omitted in the constituted
text as well. To these must be added the important omission of adhy. 140
of the Vulgate, the Kanikaniti, which is likewise omitted by Ki^emendra, an
omission which appears to have been overlooked by Buhler and Kirste.

The collaborating authors felt justified in concluding that the omissions
and additions “ are just such liberties as any Kavya poet would take in
making a similar abridgement.” They were also of opinion that the original
cannot have differed very essentially from our current texts, that is, the
Vulgate. This is correct up to a certain point. A comparison with the
different versions shows that K^mendra’s version agrees, as was to be ex-
p)ected, most closely with the Sarada. On comparing the divisions of the
Mahjari with those given in Bombay or Calcutta editions of the Mahabharata,
Buhler and Kirste were struck by the fact that the Mmjari divisions
agreed better with the course of the narrative ; and they give examples to
show tiiat the arrangement of the Manjari is more logical. That is quite
natural, because the' old Northern manuscripts, which this edition £28} fol-
lows, fully support the arrangement of the Manjm, whereas the divisions
adopted in the Vulgate are secondary and quite corrupt.

The Persian translation^ of the Mahabharata, made in the reign of
Emperor Akbar, being still unedited, could not be consulted. A very full
account of this rendering has, however, been given by the late Dr. Sir Jivanji
Jamshedji Modi in a paper read before the First Oriental Conference at
Poona in November 1919 and published in the Annals of this Institute.'^ Of
all the Sanskrit works Akbar got translated, the Mahabharata, it appears,
had his most earnest attention.

Several eminent poets and scholars had a hand in translating the Great
Epic of India into Persian. The A'in-e-Akbari gives the following namqs :
Naqib Khan, Maulana ‘ Abdu’l-Qadir Badayuni, and Shaikh Sultan of
Thanesar, to which the Muntakhab-ut-Tawankh adds the names of Mulla
Sheri, and Shaikh Faizi (the brother of Abu’l-Fazl).

ity of contemporaneous chronicles, “ two out of the eighteen sections. Mulla
Sheri and Naqib Khan did a part of the work andi the rest was completed
by Sultan Haji of Thanessar. Shaikh Faizi converted their ‘ rough trans-
lation into elegant prose and verse, but he did not complete more than two
sections.’ Sultan HajI then revised these two sections and verse. Not only
did he do so, but he also revised his work which formed a large share of
the work.” Quoting Badauna, Sir Jivanji continues ; “ The Haji aforesaid

revised these two sections, and as for the omissions which had taken place
in his first edition, those defects he put right, and comparing it word for
word was brought to such a point of perfection that not a fly-mark of the
original was omitted ” ! The preface to this translation was from the pen
of that gifted courtiet of Akbar who has left us such an admirable account
of the Emperor’s reign, Abu’l-Fazl. This Persian version appears to have
been a free rendering of the original, made by Muslim poets and scholars
at the Court of Akbar, to whom the sense of the original had been explained
by Hindu pandits, under the orders of the Emperor.

There are numerous other vernacular abstracts of the Mahabharata
besides the Telugu abstract mentioned above, but most of them are of a
late date. Moreover, they are all far too free to be of much use to us in
reconstructing the text of the Mahabharata.

Besides these abstracts and adaptations, there are parallel versions of
certain passages or even of whole episodes to be met with in other works.
Thus we have a parallel version of the Sakuntala episode (adhyf 62 ff.), in
the PadmapuiSiija of the Yayati episode (adhy. Ti ff.), in the Matsya-
purana of the story of Rum (adhy. 81T.), in the Devibhagavata ; of a
portion of Samudramanthana (adhy. 16 f.), again in the Matsyapurana ; of
a portion of a cosmogonic passage (1. 60. 54 ff.) , in the Raimayana. {29} There
is more distant connection between our Saupanja (adhy. 14 ff.) and the
peseudo-vedic Supamiadhyaya.'’ Some of the stanzas of thv Adi are cited, with
or without mention of the source, in the Tantravarttika of Kumarila Bhatta
(e.g. our 1. 1. 209), as also in the Bhasyas of Aoarya Sathkara (e.g. our 1.
1. 37). A few of the sententious stanzas (e.g. our 1. 74. IffJ) recur, with
   variation, in Buddhist literature,^ while stray stanzas are' to be found again

(1. 119. 6) has been cited in the Dhvanyaloka of Anandavardhana, as by
Maharii Vyasa. There are probably many stanzas which remain to be
identified.

It is perhaps well to add in this place that a certain amount of caution
is necessary in making any critical use of citations of stray Mahabharata
stanzas we meet with again in other works. We must, in the first place,
bear in mind that most of the other works have yet tjo be properly edited.
Even in critically edited texts we must take into account the various readings
of the passage in question in the manuscripts collatedi Then in the case of
citations we must allow for failures of memory ; since in ancient times the
stanzas were almost invariably quoted from memory, and the quotation was
never compared with the original. Moreover we must never forget that
probably from time immemorial there have existed local versions of the
Mahabharata. The citations made even by very old writers were from these
local versions. A citation by a writer of the eighth century or even the sixth
century proves nothing for the Ur-Mahabharata, that ideal but impossible
desideratum ; though the citation is far older than our manuscripts, it is
evidence only for the text of the local Mahabharata in the eighth, respectively
the sixth century, notwithstanding that the differences between the various
recensions and versions of the Mahabharata must diminish as we go back
further and further.

N .is the ultimate source from* which all versions of the Northern recen-
sion are, directly or indirectly, derived.

V is the lost archetype of the North-Western group, appreciably shorter
than any of the other known versions {textus simplkior),

K is a specific Devanagarl version allied to the Sarada (or Kasmiri)
version (sharply distinguished from other Devanagarl versions), of which
one MS. (Ki) is the direct copy of a Sarada original. The version is largely
contaminated from MSS. of the (central) sub-recension (y), and in part,
also from some unknown Southern sources. Exact provenance of the version
is unknown.

y is the intermediate (inflated) source from which all versions of the
central sub- recension are derived (comprising the Eastern and Western
groups), occupying a position intermediate between the North-Western and
the Southern groups. It contains a considerable number of secondary addi-
tions (including repetitions), as also a very large number of verbal altera-
tions and corruptions.

£ is the lost archetype of the Eastern group (comprising the Nepali,
Maithill and Bengali versions), which is free from the additions and altera-
tions made later in certain Devanagarl MSS.

S is the ultimate source from which all versions of the Southern recension
are, directly or indirectly, derived and which is appreciably longer than N,
and far more elaborate {textus ornatior).

a is the lost archetype of T G, containing a large number of corruptions
and secondary additions, from which M is free.

{31} A CRITICAL SURVEY OF THE RECENSIONS AND THEIR

VERSIONS

THE TWO RECENSIONS

The textual criticism of the Mahabharata proceeds from the incontro-
vertible fact that the text of the Great Epic has been handed down in two
divergent forms, a Northern and a Southern recension, texts typical of the
Aryavarta and the Daksiniapatha. With the realization of this patent con-
trast began the Mahabharata textual criticism nearly fifty years ago, when
Protap Chandra Roy brought out his popular edition of the Mahabharata
(1883-96), under the auspices of the Diatavya Bharata Karyalaya. A brief
account of the controversy to which the publication of this edition of the
Mahabharata gave rise is to be found in Roy’s writings.^ We are told there

^ Cf. the letter addressed by Roy to the Editor of The Hindu (Madras) and

that the appearance of his edition was hailed by The Hindu of Madras,
that great bulwark of Dravidian Hinduism, in its issue dated November 22,
1885, with the publication of a bellicose letter, headed “ Another edition of
the Mahabharata'\ purporting to give an account of the proceedings of a
public meeting held at Mayaveram, and containing an outspoken and trench-
ant criticism of Roy’s edition by one Mr. Sreenivasa Sastrial. This worthy
gentleman thought Roy’s edition to be “ sadly defective in the text and that
this defect is detrimental to the religious interests as many portions support-
ing the Advaita and Vdsishta-advaita (sic) doctrines, but unfavourable to
the Sakti worshippers of the North, have been omitted “ It was sad,
therefore,” bemoaned this aggrieved protagonist of the Southern Recension,
“ that the generous gentleman of the North, Protapa Chandra Roy, that
undertook to edit the text, should decline the responsibility of editing the
text as correctly as possible and to compare various manuscripts of the text
from Southern India.” Mr. Sreenivasa Sastrial, it is reported, “ instanced one
or two portions of the Mahdbhdrata, omitted in the Calcutta edition, which
can be proved by indisputable testimony to have existed in the earliest copies
of the work.” One wonders, where and how this estimable gentleman could
have got hold of “ the earliest copies” of the work ; or rather, just how early
were the copies he was referring to. ” Again, many verses ”, complained this
Vaisnava propagandist, ” quoted by the great philosophers of the South in
support of their respective doctrines, are not to be found in Mr. Protapa
Chandra Roy’s edition ” !

The reply of Protap Chandra Roy is not altogether without interest.
He ruefully admitted — what we must even now admit — ^that “ there can be
no edition of the Mahabharata how carefully edited soever, that would please

scholars of every part of India Like other ancient works that have come

down to us from century to century by the method of manual transcription,
large interpolations have been inserted in this great work,^ To settle, at this
fag-end of the nineteenth century, what portions are genuine and what other-
wise, is, except in a very few instances, simply impossible”. With highly
commendable {32} objectivity, Roy then proceeds to enunciate a critical prin-
ciple, which, simple — ^nay, obvious — as it is, many a reputable scholar of India
will find it difficult to appreciate even at the present day. “ / know of no
method ”, wrote Roy, nearly fifty years ago, “ except that of taking that only
fli5 undoubtedly genuine which occurs in all the manuscripts of the East, the
North, the West, and the South ” ! “ As far as my edition is concerned ”,
he continued, “ it is substantially based on that of the Royal Asiatic Society
of Bengal, published about forty-five years ago under the superintendence of
a few learned Pandits of Bengal aided, as I believe, by an English orientalist
of repute. . . . Manuscripts had been procured from all parts of India (the
South unexcepted) and these were carefully collated. Although editedi with

such care, I have not, however, slavishly followed the Society’s edition. I
have compared it carefully with the Mahalrajah of Burdwan's text in the
Bengalee character which was edited with still greater care. About 18 manus-
cripts procured from different parts of India (the South not excepted) were
carefully collated by the Burdwan Pundits before they admitted a single slaka
as genuine. I have very frequently referred to this Burdwan edition also for
checking the Society’s text. . . . Besides the published texts, I have now and
then referred to certain manuscripts. These, however, are all of Bengal. I
am willing to consult any approved manuscript of Southern India.... I
conclude' by repeating that I have ncV complaint against Mr. Sreenivasa. On
the other hand, I freely admit that ah edition like the one projected by him
will be a valuable accession to the libraries of all scholars in India and in
countries out of India. Only the same remarks that he has applied to my
edition will, I am confident, apply tci his, when a Pundit of Northern or
Western India takes it up for notice or review, unless, of course, the learned
Sastrial includes, without critical examiation, every passage bearing on both
the Advmta and the Qdkta worship. I; may assure Mr. Sastrial, however,
that in that case, in his attempt to ple'ase everybody he will, like the painter
in the fable, please none, particularly among readers of judgment an<r critical
discrimination. The fact is, that the divergences of manuscripts are so great
that it is perfectly impossible to produce an edition that could at once satisfy
both Arydvarta and Ddkshindtya'* That edition, alas, so bravely and enthu-
siastically planned by Mr. Sreenivasa Sastrial, to which reference is made
in the above extract, appears never to have seen the interior of any printing
establishment !

I have quoted Protap Chandra Roy in extenso, not merely because of
the interesting sidelight his remarks throw on the question of the different
editions of the Mahabharata, projected or planned, in or just before his time,
but also because of some remarkably sound principles of textual criticism,
briefly, but clearly, propounded therein by him. Protap Chandra Roy had
grasped the Mahabharata Problem in all its essentials. But the time was not
yet ripe for the actual preparation of a critical edition of the Mahabharata.

The differences between the two recensions of the Mahabharata must not
be underrated. Between them there lies, to start with, the irksome barrier
of scripts. It is no exaggeration to say that in India to the Northerners, the
Southern versions written in Southern scripts, ordinarily speaking, were and
are sealed books ; on the other hand, the Southerners, with the possible
exception of a few learned Pandits — who, in fact, after a half-hearted admis-
sion of epic poetry into the realm of literature, cheerfully leave the {33} study
of the bulk of the Mahabharata text to their less gifted brethren — could not
and cannot decipher the Northern scripts, perhaps with the exception of the
Devanagan.

When one laboriously surmounts this initial obstacle, and starts to com-



f^RoLEGOMENA 45

pare the two recensions, one finds, to one’s surprise, that the difference be-
tween them begins, as a matter of fact, with the very division of the Maha-
bharata into its various parvans ! Against the commonly accepted, conven-
tional division of the epic into eighteen books (parvans), there is the Southern
division into twenty-four.^ More surprising still is the fa'ct that the Adi-
parvan itself, the very first book of the epic (with which alone we are, in
fact, here concerned), is sub-divided in Southern manuscripts into three (Adi,
Astika and Sarhbhava), or at least into two (Adi and Sariibhava) separate
major parvans.- Let me emphasize that it is the main large divisions (par-
vans) of the epic I am here referring to, and not the hundred (sub-) parvans
(also called upaparvans or antahparvans). The sub-parvans, in point of fact,
could not come into question here at all. Only the Northern manuscripts, as
a rule, mention in their colophons the names of the sub-parvans ; the South-
ern manuscripts ignore (as far as I can say at present, uniformly) this detail,
very rarely mentioning, in their colophons, the name of the corresponding
sub-parvan.^ We have, therefore, no means of knowing precisely the number
and the limits of the sub-parvans in the Southern scheme, except, of course,
the meagre and ambiguous data of the Parvasarhgraha (Adi 2) itself.^

It is true that the Southern (printed) editions (not excepting Professor
P. P. S. Sastri’s critical edition of the Southern recension, as far as it has
gone) follow the division of the epic uniformly into the conventional eighteen
books.^ But in so far as they do that, the editors, it seems to me, must be
overriding knowingly (but without giving the fact inexpedient prominence)
the clear and unmistakable testimony of Southern manuscripts. They prefer
to sacrifice the Southern manuscript tradition and make their editions har-
monize with the data of the Parvasairhgraha : always a grave blunder ;
because, clearly, the data of the Parvasamgraha can be manipulated far more
easily than those of the manuscripts of the text. The Parvasairhgraha, if

In most Southern manuscripts the adhyayas of these different parts of our
Adiparvan are separately numbered. In our critical apparatus a new beginning is
made with (our) adhy. 54 in all Southern MSS. except T^ (which is a misch-
codex), an adhyaya which marks the beginning of our Adivarhsavataraiiaparvan ;
in the colophons of the Southern MSS. it is called the first adhyaya of the Sarii-
bhavaparvan.

^ On the other hand, the Southern MSS. (and in fact even most of the
Northern MSS.) frequently mention the name of the Upakhyana or the name of
the adhyaya ; but even this is never done regularly and systematically.

4 ilie Parvasarhgraha gives only the names of the (100) sub-parvans, and
the contents of the (18) major parvans. But from these data, we cannot say from
what adhyaya to what adhyaya a particular sub-parvan extends.

5 Thus, from these Southern ed., one can never elicit the fact that in the
Southern Recension our Adi is divided into two parts (parvans) and that these
parts have separate numbering of adhyayas !

compiled, originally, on the basis of some Northern version,^ would certainly
liOt fit the Southern recension exactly, even when the Parvasamgraha was first
compiled.

{34} The! difference! between the recensions does not end there by any
means, unhappily. The manuscripts of the two recensions show numerous
other, big and small, discrepancies : discrepancies in the spelling of most ordi-
nary words (e.g. N 3^|^or^o5r ), especially of proper names (e.g.

S ii^ the readings of words, phrases, lines, stanzas, groups of

stanzas (passim) ; in the sequence of all these elements (passim) ; in the rela-
tive position of single adhyayas or of a small group of adhyayas (passim) ; in
the relative sequence of whole episodes (e.g. the Sakuntala and Yayati episodes,
Adi, 62 If., and 70 ff.). What is more disconcerting still is that the recensions
show also complicated displacements of portions of adhyayas ; cf., for ex-
ample, the long notes on 1. 106. 11 (p. 474 f.)„ and 1. 144. 20 (p. 624).
Besides these variations in spellings, readings and sequences, there are addi-
tions (or omissions, just as one may happen to regard them) of single lines
(often “ inorganic ”, i.e. such as can be added or omitted with no effect upon
the grammar or continuity), of short passages (passim) and long passages
comprising more than a hundred lines (cf. App. I, No. 55, a passage of 125
lines, setting forth the story of the Kasi princess Amba). These additions
(respectively omissions) and verbal variants sometimes go to such a length
that, at times, there emerges in the end an entirely different story. Compare,
for instance, the two versions of the highly popular episode “ Rape of Subha-
dra” (Subhadraharana) in adhy. 211-212 of our edition and passage No. 114
of App. I (comprising over 460 lines !).- We find that the Southern version
of this story is enriched with many entirely novel and startling features, such
as Arjuna’s masquerading as a peripatetic monk (yati), or his fierce battle
with the Yadava forces led by Viprthu, which he, of course, routs, alone and
unaided, or rather merely with the help of his newly acquired, valiant and
resourceful wife, who acts as his charioteer !

A notable feature of the Southern recension is that it is considerably
longer than the Northern. The constituted text of the Parvasalrhgraha (1. 2.
96) gives 7984 “slckas” (that is, probably, what is technically called
    grant has) as the extent of the Adi :

1 This is! clearly suggested by the fact that the longer Table of Contents (1. 2.
72-233) follows the eighteen-parvan division, which does not harmonize with the
data of the colophons of the Southern MSS., which have the twenty-four-parvan
division.

2 Even the Sakuntala episode gets a somewhat different colouring in the
Southern recension.



J^kOLiiGOMliNA

The extent of the Vulgate is computed to be about 8460 “ stanzas'’. The
length of the Southern text of the Adi edited by Professor P. P. S. Sastri is
given by himself as 9984 “ stanzas ”, slightly in excess of his own Parva-
satrhgraha figure (M. 1. 2. 102)., which differs as regards this figure (as in
many other figures in adhy. 2) from our edition. This latter figure (9984)
is perhaps a trifle in excess of the presumable extent of the (normal) Southern
recension, since P. P. S. SastrTs text contains some clear instances of inter-
polation (from Telugu, Tamil and even Northetn sources),^ which need not
necessarily be put down to the already swollen account of the Southern recen-
sion. The difference between the Vulgate and Sastri’s text is about 1524
” stanzas ”. But even the common Southern text, which will be appreciably
shorter than SastrTs, may confidently be £35} reckoned to contain approxi-
mately 1300 “slokas” (i.e. granthas) more than the longest Northern version
of the Adi !

This excess in the Southern recension is not due to the addition of any
single lengthy passage or just a few of such passages even, though there are
undoubtedly among them some fairly long passages. The excess is due to
additions, large and small, distributed almost evenly throughout the parvan.

Not only is the Southern text thus appreciably longer than the other,
the story itself of the Southern recension, as compared with that of the
Northern, is, owing to many of these additions, much richer in details, leav-
ing little or nothing to the imagination of the reader or the hearer. Thus, for
example, in the. Northern recension, the father of Satyavati or Matsyagandha
(Vyasa’s own mother) is a nameless king of fisher- folk, making a living, on
the banks of the Yamuna, by fishing. This is rather unsatisfactory. That
the name of Matsyagandlia’s father — he is really only her foster father —
according to the fable — should not have been preserved, seems a shocking
piece of negligence on the part of the historian, that is, the story-teller, since
history as it is narrated (as has been well said) is a kind of roman a these.
The Southern recension here comes to our help. It has carefully procured
the nahic of the foster-father of Kali Matsyagandha alias Satyavati : it was
Uccaihsravas (a high-sounding Aryan name), if we are to believe the South-
ern recension. He was named after the great snow-white Stallion of the
Gods, which came out of the ocean when it was being churned for Ambrosia
by the Gods and the Titans.

Then again, the Purohita sent by the Yadavas to the forest retreat of
Pajiiidu in the Himalayas was a Kasyapa. He was required, of course, to
perform all the little Aryan rites for the Papdavas. Moreover, it is best that
kings always have their Riajaguru by their side, to advise and help them on
all occasions. The Nothem recension does not even tell us that the Yadavas

1 For instance the iSvetaki episdde (M. 1. 214, 29-98H» which, in the form
printed there, is missing in all MSS. of his own critical apparatus !



48


J’kOLEGOMENA


had sent any Purohita at all to Paidu'sl hermitage ; so there, no question of
his name arises.

But a really illuminating instance of the richness of information fur-
nished by the Southern recension is supplied by an “ additional ” adhyaya’
in this recension, which gives us some new and interesting chrmological de-
tails about the Paindavas themselves. These details disperse that haze of un-
certainty and vagueness which overspreads the ordinary account.

The Southern recension informs us that when the P^nidavas first arriv-
ed at the Court of Hastinapura from the forest retreat, after the death of
their father, Yudhi§thira was exactly slixteen years old, Bhima fifteen, Arjuna
fourteen, the twins thirteen. We are further told exactly how long the
P^^iTicJu brothers stayed at the Kaurava Court, in the Lac House (Jatug^'ha),
in Ekacakra, at the Court of the Paficala King, then again at the Kaurava
Court, then in Indraprastha, and so on. Yudhi§thira died at the ripe old
age of 108, which is a mystic number. Arjuna was younger than Kr$na by
three months, which was also exactly the difference between the' ages of Kr?na
and Balarama. And so on and so forth. Almost all these useful details are
lacking in the Northern recension, and I doubt whether they can even be
reconstructed from the meagre data of this recension on the^ points.

{36} The Southern recension impresses us thus by its prmsuM, schema-
tization, and thoroughly practical outlook. Q)mpared with it, the Northern
recension is distinctly vague, unsystematic, sometimes even inconsequent, fnorc
like a story rather naively narrated, as we find in actual experience.

The Southern recension of the Adi at least is thus not merely longer, but
also fuller, more exuberent, more ornate than the Northern. It may there-
fore be fitly styled, in relation to the Northern, the iextus ornatior.

Notwithstanding these and other discrepancies, there persists through-
out, between the recensions, a distinct and undeniable family resemblance,
and there cannot be the slightest doubt that they both spring from a com-
mon source, albeit a distant and somewhat nebulous source. Follow the
course of these divergent streams as far back as one will, the elusive source
seems to recede still further and lose itself in the mists of antiquity.

It was pointed out above that a noteworthy feature of the Southern re-
cension was that it was appreciably longer than the Northern. The charac-
ter of the principal Additions may be seen from the following list of some of
the more important and lengthy passages peculiar to the Southern recension,
whose texts are given in Appendix I.

(1) No. 9 (S except M,) : God Siva (Rudra) drinks up the poison (halahala)
which exudes from the mouth of Vasuki, while the Devas and Asuras are churning

These passages alone comprise 2250 lines or 1125 stanzas approximately 1

The discrepancies between the two recensions, as already observed, are
so numerous and so multifarious, that any attempt to enumerate and classify
them must remain incomplete and unsatisfactory. Nevertheless it may be
useful to begin a cursory survey of the divergences, noting at the same time
the typical characteristics of the Southern additions ”, characteristics which
recur with fair frequency in the Adi, and which are likely to reappear in
other parvans. These notes may prove useful for distinguishing between
the different ** hands ” which haVe been at work in shaping this imposing
monument of Indian antiquity, when the entire text has been treated in the
manner proposed here, and we have sufficient data for undertaking a minute
and systematic study of the variations and evaluating them.

PROLEGOMENA


The deviations of the Southern recension from the Northern (taking for
purposes of exposition the latter to represent the norm) are of the following
kind.

1. Variants of isolated words or phrases, (a) unimportant and (b) im-
   portant,

(a) Unimportant, such as one comes across in line after line. They
are far too numerous to be listed even approximately completely, but from
among them we may single out these for specific mention :

( i ) fluctuations in the spelling of proper names, e. g. S

), ^ ^ ), ), 3 ^

( ), etc., etc.

( ii ) variations mainly due to mere transpositions of words, e. g. S

( N *1° ) 1. 1. 23 ;

?ntr ( 33; SRfHt 3 ) 92. l ; etc., etc.

(iii) unremitting variation of: monosyllabic particles and verse-fillers,

which are among the most unstable elements of the received text, such as
% ^ common adverbs and conjunctions, such as

3^, 3T3:, 3^, 33T, 3^, 3T3, 313:, |3:, ST^T, 3lf^, ^3 ; and prepositions 3TfSr-3liM-
l^-3Ti^, 313-33, etc., etc.

( iv ) substitution of metrically equivalent synonyms, or words and
phrases of similcir significance; e, g. ^3-^-#!;

(ar)^; 1^33-3^; 3?f3-g5r3; 3^?-3^-33f33-!R?^ ;

l|5RR13-%3i^3-l%5RRW ; 33^l!«PC-3?3Tt33 ( and similar compounds with

and 333); 3T3r&y«^-^i^5iR^-5ll3(fif?lK<^-34l'^5IR3-3f33i^^1K3; JRlft33c-

3 ; etc., etc.

( V ) substitution of equivalent epic iterata ; e. g. 3313 3333Tt, 33^31-
W13t33; 3WRf^l3T331, 33E3^f^: ; fJl;;33?3 331 313, ;^3?3ft3 333 ; etc., etc.
For other examples, see {38} Hopkins’s collection of “Parallel phras4 in
the two Epics” in the Great Epic, pp. 403 ff. (Appendix A).

(b) Important variants, which make a considerable difference in the
sense, and of which the critique must take account. Of such variants, rela-
tively speaking, there are only a few ; e. g. discrepant divisions of the epic
into parvans and adhyayas ; variants of the titles of the sub-parvans (e. g.
S 3I3t3^513 : N g3?3R33), ^ numbers of adhyayaS and ^Idcas in
the Parvasairhgraha (the figures for slokas differ, at times, by thousands).

— An exatnple of a different character from another part of the Adi is the
variant jjrj in the stanzas which refer to the duration of Arjuna’s
exile. According to the Northern recension it is thirteen yeafs ; according to
the Southern, only thirteen months ! Cf. 1 . 204. 28. ^ ^ g[j^ ( S%

JfraRC., we# etc. ) ^( S WT 205. 30 # ( S weiW,

we#,WeR;. ^ ).* — Then we have in 1. 3. 21 the variant How

was the infinitive really made ? — And so on.

2. Larger variations between continuous passages, as a whole, the total
   extent remaining approximately the same.

We find them (a) mostly in the long lists of names : e. g. of the hundred
sons of Dhrtara^tra (adhy. 108),, of ancient kings ( 1 . 1 . 166 ff.), or serpents
( 1 . 52. 5ff.), of kings present at Draupadi’s svayalmvara (adhy. 177) ; but
(b) also when there are transpositions of whole or parts of adhyayas (e. g.
the prose genealogy, adhy. 90) ; or again (c) when there is free paraphrase
of a passage (passim).

3. Expansion of the text in S without materially altering the nature of
   the contents or the course of the narrative.

(<i) By multiplication of the items of a list. For instance :

In adhy. 20, S (with K 4 marg. Dn marg.) adds seven lines of praise
to an existing hymn addressed to Garuda. In these lines, Garueja

is identified, in turn, with all the principal gods, and with everything that is
pre-eminent in the world :

In adhy. 64, S (with K 4 Dn D^.g) gives an additional short list of sciences

In adhy. 165, a Southern passage expands in hyperbolic language the list of

In adhy. 213, the Southern recension furnishes us with a supplementary list
of items in Subhadra's dowry, which, taken along with what has gone be-
fore, exhausts almost all the things worth possessing in this world :

(b) By anticipation or repetition of stories, motives or discourses. For
example :

(i) the miraculous birth of KjT§iua and Dhr§tadyumha is narrated twice in S ;
in a^y. 155 and in App. I, No. 79 (after adhy. 128) ;


(ii) the theme of the amuang experience of a maiden, who, on praying to
Mahadeva for one husband five times, was granted, as a boon, five husbands at one
time— a story which seems to have been very popular in the South— is used, with

53


variation, in S, no less than three times in the course of the Adi ; cf. adhy. 157, 189
and passage No. 100 (of App. I)

(iii) account of the tragi-oomic experiences of the Ka^i princess Amba, who
was passed on in turn by Bhi§ma to iSalva and Salva to Bhi§ma, repeatedly, like a
shuttle-cock, a story which is really the subject-matter of the Ambopakhyana in Ud-
yoga 173 ff. (Bom. [40] ed.), apparently a favourite piece, is anticipated in
passage No. 55 of App. I (cf. adhy. 96) and forms a bulky addition of 125 lines !

(iv) the future of the royal family, which is the subjectrmatter of the addi-
tional dialogue between Bhi'§ma and his step-mother, Satyavatl, in S, in passage
No. 57 (of App. I) is only a continuaition and repetition (with v. 1.) of the dis-
course between the same parties in adhy. 99.

(v) Surya’s warning to Karna about the designs of India to supplicate Kanja
in the disguise of a Brahman, in passage No. 60 of App. I, which is an anticipation
of the story told in Aranya 300 (Bom. ed.).

(c) Additions in S, due to the explicit mention of the observance of the
correct and complete Brahmanic ritual and ceremonial on the proper oc-
casions. Thus, in adhy. 68, at the birth of Bharata :

(d) Expansion in S of existing scenes by the addition of speeches or

detailed descriptions and by other digressions. Examples :

[41] (i) in App. I, No. 9, in the account of the churning of the ocean

(samudramanthana), we are incidentally told of the drinking of poison by Siva, which
had exuded from the mouth of Vasuki during the churning ;

(ii) in 998*, we have nine additional lines depicting the humiliating treat-
ment meted out to Bhi^ma at the court of the king of Ka^i, during the Svayaihvara
of his daughters ;

(iii) passage No. 59 (of App. I) depicts the persuasion of the shy and re-
luctant Kunti by Surya for intercourse, by alternate threats and promises, like a
real Don Juan ;

(iv) in passages No. 68-69, the Southern recension has tried to develop a very
pathetic scene indeed, depicting the death of the father of the heroes, P^du : an
incident which must have been considered as deserving fuller and more sympatlie-
tic treatment than the perfunctory notice we find preserved in the Northern re-
cension. At the sight of the corpse of her husband, Kunti falls to the ground in a
swoon, like a felled tree. Then the five brothers come up in a single file, and in
the order of their ages, and recite their little mournful dirges : Yudhi^thira gets
8 lines, Bhima 7, Arjuna 4, the twins' (in chorus) only 3 lines together.^ Then
follow long-winded farewell orations by Kunti, Madri and the reist of the company,
which are followed by a touching scene describing Aladri mounting the funeral
pyre ;

(v) passage No. 78 gives, in 119 lines, the details of a fight, which, in the
Northern recension, at least originally, is cfisposed of in two lines ! The latter I
consider adequate treatment, taking everything into consideration ;

(vi) passage No. 93 is a Southern addition of 37 lines giving fuller details of
the titanic struggle between Bhima and the cannibal Baka ;

(vii) 1737* adds a hymn (in Trii§trA)h metre and pseudo-vedic style) by Va-
si§tha, addressed to Surya, when Vaa^ha presents himself before that luminary
on behalf of Samvaraija ;

(viii) 1828* ff. describe in turn the discomfiture of each of the suitors for the
hand of Draupadi ;

(ix) pasisages No. 100-101 add to the existing stock two new anecdotes — al-
ternative explanations — ^narrated by Vyasa to prove to Drupada and his son, that

the polyandrous marriage proposed by Yudhi^thira, though apparently immoral and
illegal, is a most righteous and necessary union, being pre-ordained by the gods
themselves for the accomplishment of their cosmic plans : these are the well-known
legends of Najayani and Bhauma^vi ;

(x) passage No. 106 gives an almost complete inventory of the presents Dru-
pada gave to the PSndu brothers when they left with Draupadi, for the Kaurava
Court, at the invitation of Dhrtar^tra. The Northern recension ignores this huge
mass of presents completely !

(xi) passage No. 110 is a farewell scene containing short orations by Kr^na,
Yudhi^thira and Kuntl, when Kr§iia sets out for Dvaraka ;

£42} ( xii) passage No. 112 contains the farewell of Arjuna to Citr^gac^,

telling her that she must not give way to sorrow in his absence, as they would meet
again vsoon at the Rajasuya, which is going to be performed by Yudhi^fhira : a pro-
phetic utterance ! And so on and so forth.

(e) Additions of little ethical, moral and sententious maxims, to which
S, permeated as it is by a conscious didactic purpose, is particularly partial.
We meet with the same old proverbs over and over again in S :

4. Southern additions which alter the purport of the fabU as narrated in
   the Nmchern recension.


Made apparently with the object of correcting the laxity of sexual re-
lations implied in the old narrative. In adhy. 67, the royal Purohita, a handy
person, quickly but surely and secretly, performed the marriage of I>ub?anta
and Sakuntala, in order to legitimize Bharata, the eponymous ancestor of the
Bharatas, who has given his name to the country of his birth and to the
Great Epic of India, altogether an important personage in ancient Indian
history :

In adhy. 77, the marriage of Yayati and iSarmi^fha is celebrated semi-
secretly, in a secluded comer of the Asoka grove, in the palace grounds, with
the usual baksheesh to the Brahmins, in the presence of counsellors, chap-
lains, priests and so on, but unknown to Devayam ! All this was done to
legitimize Puru, the eponymous ancestor of the Pauravas :

In passage No. 114 of App. I, Subhadra and Arjuna were likewise secret-
ly and hastily married in the presence of gods, r§is, and elders, while Bala-
rdma was away jrom the scene, to legitimize Abhimanyu (the father of tlie
famous Parifc§it and grandfather of Janamejaya, to whom the epic was nar-
rated). Cf. lines 281-286 of the passage :

Most Grantha manuscripts (G^.^ of our critical apparatus : ^ and

were secretly but regularly married. Cf. passage No. 36 of App. I, which is
a somewhat lengthy passage describing with circumstantial detail the nup-
tial ceremony at which the ancestors of both the bride and the bridegroom
are invoked, all the details of the regular Hindu marital rite are scrupulously
gone through, and the marriage is solemnized in the presence of Vasi§tha,
Yajfiavalkya and other great Ri§is living in the Naimi^ forest !

5. Additions in S, due to the 0mg out of lacunae {real or imaginary) .

Examples of such additions are :

482* whidi gives a summary of the last five parvans of our Mahabharata
text, and passage No. 79 (of App, I) giving an account of Drupada's birth.
It appears, from the latter account, that Drupada was bom in the sa!me mira-
culous way as two of his contemporaries Drooa a!nd Krpa, due to the per-
turbation of his father at the sight of a beautiful Apsaras. Ascetics invo-
luntarily emitting semen at the sight of heavenly nymphs, broad-hipped, fat-
breasted, fair-clad, pleasure-fraught, and the miraculous germination of the
semen into human beings, is the regular Puilajoic appatatusJ for the genera'-
tion, of the great men of the past, about wHose birth nothing exciting was
specially known to the chronicler.

{45} 6. Multiplication of fights and battle-scenes,

I have drawn attention above to the expansion of the description of a
battle (in which the Kurus and the Paji^lus calpture Drupada), and of a fight
(betweai Bhima and Baka).^ Analogous to it is a battle scene described in


^ App, I, Nos. 78 and 92-93 respectively.



PROLEGOMENA


59


an additiofial adhyaya in the Southern recension (App. I, No. 1!03). This
stages a little war between the cousins, a miniature replica of the Great War
to colne. Here also Kurus plan the destruction of the PiiOKjavas, who are re-
siding in Kampilya as the guests of Drupada. A regular council of war is
held, in which iSakuni and Karina advocate hostilities, while the nameless &yn
of Solmadatta counsels peace and conciliation. The bellicose party has the
upper hand in the council chamber. The Kuru army matches against the
Paodavas with their allies, the P^calas. The Kaurava forces are, of course,
easily repulsed. No great damage is done. The status quo is immediately
restored : things go on just the same as before, as though no battle had ever
taken place. There is also no other reference to this battle in the whole of
the Mahabharata, The present parvan does not offer much scope for the
full development of this tendency. We shall probably meet with it again in
the battle-books (6-9).

7. Omissions in S, as compared with N.

These are quite numerous and scattered almost evenly over the whole
parvan, but short and contextually unimportant, as a rule. An exception is
the somewhat lengthy iSvetaki episode (App. I, No. 118). Since, on the one
hand, all reference to the episode is missing in the whole of the Malayalam
version, as also in some manuscripts of each of the reimaining two versions
(T G) of the Southern recension, while, on the other hand, those T G manus-
cripts that do contain some mention of it insert a variant version at an entire-
ly different place, therefore the episode may legitimately be considered a
Northern interpolation which has insinuated its way, by conflation, into some
Southern manuscripts. It is a story in true Purple style. King iSvetaki sac-
rificed with such phenomenal zeal ahd keenness that his priests, in the end,
refuse to sacrifice any more ! Svetaki practised penance on the Himalayas
with the object of making Rudra his satrificial priest. Rudra, however, ex-
cused himself, asking iSvetaki to apply to Durvasas, who was his part-incarna-
tion (amsa). Durvasas completed the sacrifice, and Svetaki poured libations
of clarified butter into the fire for twelve years continuously. As a result,
Agni had a severe attack of indigestion ! He refused after that every offer-
ing, and became enfeebled. At Brahnra's direction, he set the Khl^ijdava
forest on fire, ahd tried his best to bum the forest down ; but the denizens of
the forest put the fire out, over and over again. He reported his discom-
fiture to Brahma, who then asked him to betake himself to Arjuna and
Kr5|i>a, the part incarnations of Nara and Namyana, with whose help alone
Agni would be in a position to bum the KhaOdava forest.

It diould be made clear that the variants and passages cited here are
merely by way af illustration, and comprise only a small fraction of the total
number of deviations.

The presence of an astonishingly large number of additions, some of
which are undoubtedly late and spurious, should not be allowed to impair

our appreciation of some real merits of the Southern recension. It would be,
in fact, a grievous error to ignore on that account the Southern recension or
underestimate its value. This recension is an {46} indispensable aid for con-
trolling the deviations of the Northern recension, both in point of readings
and sequence. In comparison with y it has unquestionably preserved a very
large number of original readings, proved by actual agreements between S
and V, as well as by their intrinsic merits. The superiority of the Southern
recension in comparision to the Vulgate may be said to be quite evident. It
may, however, quite easily happen that in a particular instance, the whole of
the Northern recension is corrupt, and the true reading is preserved only in
the Southern recension.^ An instance of this is 1. 214. 5. The Vulgate reads
(B. 1. 222. 5) :

Nilakaijtha’s gloss is ; qt 3?^^ 1 I

The stanza has been translated by Manmath Nath Dutta as follows :
“ Having obtained him as their king, they obtained a monarch who was de-
voted to the study of the Vedas, who was a performer of great sacrifices, and
who was the protector of all good works.” Protap Chandra Roy's transla-
tion reads similarly : And the subjects having obtained Yudhisthira as their
king, obtained in him one that was devoted to the study of the Vedas, one
that was a performer of great sacrificed, and one that was the protector of all
good people. ”

But the translations of both these scholars are generally free and arbi-
trary. As it stands, the stanza can be translated only as follows :

“They, (i.e. the people) obtain for a king, one who studied Brahma
(para)y employed the Vedas in a great sacrifice, and protected the blessed
words.”

This pedestrian stanza will satisfy most people as it has satisfied a long
succession of critics, commentators and translators in the past. About it one
can only say that there are worse dtanzas in the Mahabharata. Only a reader
endowed with a fine sensibility and critical acumen will feel that there is
something amiss here. We are face -to face with the danger of acquiescing
in a seinse which might satisfy us, but which would not have satisfied the an-
cient writer. The Northern variants do not offer much help ; even the ^Srada
and K manuscripts have Substantially the same readings. It would, conse-
quently, not be easy to reconstruct from this sad wreck of a Dipaka, the epi-
grammatic original, which is preserved intact only in the Southern recension,
which the constituted text here follows (1. 214. 5) :

No glosses, translations, exegetical notes, and such other accessories are
necessary for the elucidation of this stanza ; for it is self-luminuous. The
correctness of the Southern reading is confirmed by the very next stanza (1.
214. 6), which is also an epigrammatic period of the same type :

It should thus seem that the infidelities of the Southern recension are
confined mainly to a tendency to inflation and elaboration. In parts unaffect-
ed by this tendency, £47} it is likely to prove, on the whole, purer, more con-
servative and more archaic than even the best Northern version. The
Southern variants, therefore, deserve the closest attention and most sympa-
thetic study.

After this brief survey of the interrelationship between the two recensions,
we shall proceed to the consideration of the various provincial versions, into
which each of the recensions breaks up.


CHARACTER AND MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE VERSIONS AND THEIR

MANUSCRIPTS

THE ARCHETYPE v
The §dradd Version.

The archetype v comprises the two versions : Sarada and K

The iSarada version is represented in our critical apparatus by the frag-
mentary codex Sj, belonging to the Bombay Government Collection (No. 159
of 1875-76), which sefems to be the only extant genuine representative of the
old version of KasmTr. The manuscript, which is undated, may be three to
four centuries old. For reasons which will appear in the sequel, I have made
the Sarada version the norm to follow.

The text of the Adi (as of other parvans of the Mahabharata) according
to the different printed editions, as is well-knowp, varies considerably, not
merely a's regards the readings, but also as regards; the extent. The length
of the Adi, according to the Calcutta edition, as already observed, is esti-
mated to be about 8460 “stanzas”, of the Bombay edition, 8620,^ of the
Madras edition (i.e. Sastri’s Southern Recension) 9984 (according to
Sastri’s data), of the Kumbhakonam edition 10889.^ Now, in a statement
following the colophon (or forming part of the long colophon) of our &rada
manuscript, the length of its text is given as 7984 in a stanza cited from the


^ This is the figure given in Lele’s edition of the text with Marathi transla-
tion (Wai, Saka 1818).

PROLEGOMENA


Parvasaimgraha ; cf. the accompanying facsimile of fol. 155 a of the Sarada
codex. To judge by the amount of textual matter which an average folio of
the fragmentary iSarada codex holds, this estimate of its extent appears to be
approximately correct.* Assuming then that to be the length of the Sarada
Version, it becomes the shortest known version of the Adi, and may, there-
fore, appropriately be called the textus simplicior.

While it is the shortest extant version, it is a demonstrable fact that it
contains relatively little matter that is not found, at the same time, in all
other versions of both recendons. It is clear, therefore, that it must contain,
relatively, less spurious matter than any other known version. That is pre-
cisely the main reason why it is! taken as the norm for this edition.

Since our codex (i§i) is fragmentary, it must !be considered a piece of
singularly good fortune that there has been preserved at least one nearly com-
plete Devanagari manuscript of the Adi. namely, Indial Office No. 2137, tliat
may, as will presently be shown, be used, without hesitation, to supplement
the missing portions, since it undoubtedly is a moderately trustworthy,
though comparatively late and slightly contaminated and incorrect transcript
of a Sarada exemplar.

m Further particulars of the Sarada version will be found under the
account of the ‘‘ K '' version.

The accompanying facsimile of a page of the Saradia codex (fol. 155a)
contains the end of the Adi and the beginning of the* Sabha. The Parvasarh-
graha stanza, mentioned above, giving the extent of the Adi, will be* found
in lines 2-3 of the facsimile.


The “X” Version.

This version, as already explained, is a specific Devanagari version,
closely akin to the iSarada version and clearly differentiated from the (so-
called) Devanagari version.

These concordances are sufficient for postulating the archetype v, com-
prising the versions !§aradia and K, a hypothesis which will be confirmed by
further agreements which are mentioned below.

The K version, though comprising manuscripts akin to each other and
clearly distinguishable from those of the Devanagari version, is by no means—
as is natural— quite homogeneous. Only Ko.i represent the version K in a
comparatively pure form, while the £51} remaining manuscripts of the group
(i.e. K 2 -^) are really nothing more than misch-codices, being conflated either
with y or with S. On the other hand, just owing to this conflation, some of
the other composite Devanagari manuscripts (particularly D 2 . 5 ) have so many
features in common with K, that they may as well be separated from D and
classed under K.

The contamination of with y is illustrated by the following passages :
No. 14 of App. I (found in K4 marg., and R Vj B D ) ; No. 41 (in K3.4 and
^^ 2.3 Vi B D except Dg) ; No. 42-43 (in K 3.4 and Vi B D except D 5 ). K 4
includes passage No. 61 (of App. I) and 1131*, like N B D. The contami-
natiop of K 2 _ 4 ,« with y is illustrated by 116*, 119*, 122*, 124*, 125*, 128*,
132*, 137*, 139*, 142*, 143*, 144*, 145*, 151*, 157*, 160*, 162*, 166*, 167*,
168*, 172*, 173*, 189*, 190*, 191*, 221*, 228*, 245*, 281*, 305*, 354*,

372*, 405*, 416*, 417*, 438*, 487*, 490*, 523*, 536*, 564*, 692*, 694*,

824*, 1000*, 1035*, etc., etc.

The contamination of K 4 _e with S is exemplified by the following among
other facts, Kg.g contain 22*, ^ 25*, K 4 49*, K 4 (suppl. fol.) passage No. 55

(125 lines) and No. IDO (118 lines), of App. I. : all of these are Southern

passages.

K 4 _^, moreover, contain the Brahma episode*^ in adhy. 1 (a slippery pass-
age, which migrates from place to place), while K 4.6 have found place even
for the venerable elephant-headed Gainesa, who is unquestionably a late Nor-
thern intruder. In K 4 these interpolations are written out on separate folios
(called here ) , and inserted at appropriate places, which shows the in-
terpolations on the high road to recognition as genuine parts of the Maha-
bharata.

Important omissions which distinguish v (really only t§i Ko-^) from all
other manuscripts are these :

(i) the adhyaya giving a naive account of the' birth of Dublialia (Bom.
adhy. 116), which uncommonly looksf like being an afterthought (App. I,
No. 63) ;

(ii) a passage of about 25 lines describing how Drama’s son A^vatthaman
is given flour mixed with water, which he drinks in the belief that it is milk
(App. I, No. 75);

^ See notes on passage No. 1 of App. I.



PROLEGOMENA


67


(iii) an adhy. (Bolm. adhy. 139), in which there is an incidental allusion
to the installation of Yudhii^thira as Yuvaraja,^ and which is repetitious and
incoherent (App. I, No. 80) ;

(iv) the so-called polity of Ka|ni(ih)ka, Kaii}i(!h)kaniti (Bom. adhy.
140), which is a replica (naturally with many additions, omissions and vari-
ant readings) of the advice given by Bharadvaja (apparently a gotra name
of this very individual) to tSatrumjaya, and duly communicated by Bhi§ma to
Yudhisthira in the tSanti (App. I, No. 811) ;

(v) the crossing of the Ganges by the Painidavas (Bom. adhy. 149), a
superfluous adhyiaya, which only serves to confound the already confused
geography of the narrative (App. I, No. 85).

These five passages are found in all manuscripts collated except Ka-^,
but it is worthy of note that even apart from their omission in v the docu-
mentary evidence with regard to at least two of them, is confused and
unsatisfactory. Nq. v (crossing of the {52} Ganges) is inserted in different
groups of manuscripts at different points of the text. In No. iv (Ka(nikaniti),
on the other hand, most of the Southern manuscripts repeat, after the' inter-
polation, the imm^iately preceding portion of the original, apparently in
order to restore the context broken by the intrusion of extraneous matter.^

Of important additions in v, I can recall only one, that of an adhyaya
of 42 lines, at the very end of the Adi (added probably as an Appendix),
which is a variant, abbreviated version of the Svetaki interpolation. It is
found only in !§i Kq 1.4 and therefore cannot even be said to be characteristic
of the whole of v (App. I, No. 121). Instances of small additions are
Nos. 349*, 449*, 451*, 516*, 565*, etc. etc. found in K with or without some
Devanagari manuscripts ; while 969*, 1855*, 2077*, etc., are found in iSj K,
with or without some! Devanagari manuscripts : all these passages are miss-
ing in B. S.

That §1 and K are not identical but independent (though allied) sources,
may be concluded, for example, from 449*, 452*, 491*, 492*, 516*, 565*,
750*, 866 * etc., which are found inserted in some cr all manuscripts of the
K version, but which are conspicuous/ by their absence in iSi (sometimes
with Ki).

It was remarked above that v is the shortest of the extant versions of
the Adi. Let us examine, without bias, this feature of v. Those passages
that are lacking in v in comparison with the other versions, cannot all be
omissions in v whether accidental or intentional.

They cannot be intentional omissions, notwithstanding that these missing
passages are mostly of inferior character, intrinsically worthless, repetitious,
superfluous, or finally such as scholars have already (even before the discovery
of this version) marked as likely interpolations.^ For, this Saradia (KaSmiri)
version of the Adi is not a!n abstract or an adaptation. It claims to be the
unabridged text itself, in all its fullness, and I see no suffllcient reason to
doubt the a priori presumption that it is riot an abridged version.

The explanation that primarily with the very object of excising what
seems to us to be superfluous or repetitious matter, and abridgement might
have been intentionally made in the past by some Kasmiri redactor or a
syndicate of redactors, would be a grotesque distortion of Indian literary
and religious tradition. No one in the past found the epic text too long.
Far from it. It was perhaps not long enough.

Taking away something from the received text of the Mahabharata and
passing it off as the original work is a thing categorically different from
adding something to it. To add small details here and there, embellishing
and amplifying the original, would be merely a gentle and lowly service
ad mujorem glorui\m dei. Even long pieces may sometimes be added, if
they are actually found in other Mahabharata manuscripts ; and occasionally,
even if they are not found in the current manuscripts, provided there is at
least oral tradition to support their claims.

£53} No doubt the received text contained difficulties and obscurities
and repetitions. But they would be merely due to corruptions of the text ;
the difficulties could be solved and the purpose of the repetitions explained by
a really learned Pandit, who knows and understands everything.

That the omisiSions cannot be the result of a preconceived plan to shorten
or to improve the text, follows further from two other facts : firstly, enough
digressions and superfluities still remain in v, which would have all been
swept away in pursuance of the alleged plan ; an.d, secondly, v has its own
interpolations, albeit they are few in number and short in extent, such
as 349* (in K Da 451* (K D 2 ), 516* (K except Dn D,).,

565* (K except KJ, 1499* (S^ K D,), 1735* (S, only), 1855*
(§1 K Ni), 2077* (.§i K except and 3 Vi D^-s), etc.

While these so-called “omissions” cannot be all intentional, they can
also not be all accidental. The text is continuous and complete in itself.
It has no apparent lacunaq, as it surely would have had, if the omissions
had been due to fortuitous less or destruction of some intermediate folios of
a parent manuscript.

It may further be pointed out that many of the a^pparent ‘‘ omissions ”
of V, in relation to y or the Vulgate (i.e. Nilakaiptha’s text) are confirmed
by the rival recension, the Southern recension ; e.g. the Gape^ episode
(App. I, No. 1), or the anticipation of the list of the hundred sons of
Dhrtara^trai (No. 41), or again the story of the birth of Abhimanyu (No. 42),
or finally the anticipation of the story of the birth of Kama (No. 43) in
the Saniibhavaparvan. These passages ate omitted in S no less than in K.

In these instances, moreover, the intrinsic probability is wholly on the
side of those manuscripts that lack these accretions. It is unnecessary to
dilate on the Ga^jiesa episode, which, on the face of it, is a later addition,
and which has been dealt with so often by different critics.^ As for the
two passages, Nos. 42-43 of App. I., it is sufficient to observe that the adhyaya
in which they occur is meant to be a mere list of the dramatis personae, in
which each aictor in the great drama is identified as the incarnation of some
god, goddess, or titan, taking this or that part in one momentous phase of
an all-embracing cosmic movement. The adhyaya being originally a mere
(metrical) list (as it is in the constituted text and the Southern recension), ^
such storid^ as the account of the birth of Abhimanyu and Kariija are wholly
out place here, and could not possibly have belonged to the original
scheme of the adhyaya. The contrslry supposition only stultifies the original
writer, making him out to be an irresponsible lunatic, scarcely a desirable
conclusion from the orthodox view-point.

Likewise many of the apparent omissions in v in relation to the Southern
recension are confirmed by otlier Northern versions ; e.g. the anticipation
of the birth of Kr§na and Dhr^tadyumna (App. I, No. 79), or the Nalayani
episode (No. lOO), or the account of a battle between the Kauravas and
the Pandavais! (No. 103), which are peculiar to S. In other words, these
“ omissions ” are documented by the whole of N.

£54} One notable feature of v to which I must now draw attention is its
frequent agreement with S against y, especially in’ the matter of isolated and
even unimportant readings, scattered throughout this parvan. I shall cite
a few (out of the hundreds of possible) instahce^ to exemplify this interesting
and important characteristic of v. The readings of conflated manuscripts
which serve only to confuse the issue, have been ignored ; the references are,
as usual, to the adhyayal and sloka.

     Such extensive agreements in petty verbal details must nea‘ssarily be,
     in the main, an original inheritance, and could never be, in their totality, the
     result of contamination or conflation, as one may vaguely imagine they are
     because to acheive them would necessitate more expenditure of energy than
     an ancient Indian redactor or reciter or commentator of the epic would
     bargain Tor. And even if one or the other of them had the requisite amount
     £55} of energy to use in this way, it would appear to him td be a ludicrous
     waste o^ it. We in the present century are apt to get nervous and irritable
     over misprints and varriae lectiones. But an ancient Indian scribe, redactor

or even commentator, not to speak of the common r^iter {pathaka)-A{ I
read aright Indian literary history— was not perturbed in the least by a little
difference in wording or in sequence, especially if -the variant did not give
an appreciably better or appreciably worse sense. The enormous and com-
plicated critical apparatus assembled here, moreover, can leave us in no
doubt as to the attitude of the custodians of the epic tradition towards
paltry verbal details : it was that of total indifference.

Addition or omission of passages is, I naay add, a variation of an entirely
different order. If a reciter or commentator came across, in another manus-
cript, an additional passage, there was every chance of his copying it down
somewhere, either in the margin of his own copy, or on a supplementary
folio ; for there would be,, in his mind, always present the possibility that
the passage in question was some part of the original that his own manus-
cript had unaccountably lost. How el^» forsooth, could the passage get
into the other manuscript?

In my opinion, therefore, this fact of the concord between v and S in
small details, coupled with the almost entire lack of agreement as regards
the additions peculiar to v or S, is the strongest argument imaginable for the
indep^.ndence of these two versions, and consequently for the primitive char-
acter of their concordant readings. It is needless to point out that this is a
factor of supreme importance for the reconstruction of the original.

The text of v is throughout of such a character as to inspire confidence. Its
conservatism is proved by its preserving archaisms and the lectio difficilior
1. 2. 144;3^^i 1. 2. 177, 189 ; “frankly” 1. 10. 6;

1. 98. 13 ; 1. 98. 18), often in a corrupt form, while other manus-

cripts have discarded them in favour of modem forms or easy paraphrases.
It is well known that, for purposes of textual reconstruction, the mechanical
corruptions of a stupid but faithful copyist are to be preferred to the intel-
ligent copying of a less faithful one.

Again, v is often the only version that has preserved the correct reading :
e.g. 1. 2. 102 :

where the Vulgate version reads (1.3.138 f.):

Obviously, the stumbling block was apcT^ of the constituted text, which
is a krt. diff , ; here it means ‘‘ forgotten ", a meaning cited in our dictionaries
g^erally as an uncommon meaning given only by Indian lexicographers !
Unless one here assumes v to be original, it is impossible to explain this
divergence of v, y and S, both of which give a possible though weak sense.

An unbiassed comparative survey of the different versions leads one to
the conclusion that the Sarada (Kasmirl) version is certainly the best North-
ern version, and probably, taken as a whole, the best extant version^ of the
Adi, a conclusion not based on abstract considerations, but one that may be
verified inductively and pragmatically. As is natural, this version is, not by
any mean^, entirely free from corruptions and interpolations. These must be
carefully corrected and controlled with the help of the other versions, parti-
cularly of those of the rival recension.


Sub-Recension y.

This sub-recension comprises the four versions : Nepali, Maithili, Ben-
gali and Devanagari, and is represented by a very large number of manu-

scripts ; it is, in fact, the most numerous group. Instances of reading which
distinguish y from v S, have been adduced above (p. Liv), to show the agree-
ment between v and S against y. The versions comprising this sub-recension
have, moreover, quite a considerable number of “ additional passages in
common, which clearly differentiate it from other versions. Noteworthy is
the substitution of a lengthy passage of 56 lines (App. I, No. 61) for 1. 105.
4-7, giving a detailed account of the marriage of Pajndu with Kunti and
Madii. This detailed account is obviously secondary. On no other supposi-
tion can one, it seems to me, account for the circumstance that !§i Kq-s and
S should agree in having a short version for the episode for which K4 B D
substitute a considerably longer and more elaborate version, both versions
being embedded in a portion of descriptive text with minimal variation. For,
while it is inconceivable that two (more or less) independent groupjs of manus-
cripts such as Sj Ko-a and S could arrive at the same short account independ-
ently of each other, it is, at the same time, extremely improbable that either
group (■§! Ko -3 or S) should have copied the short summary from the other,
discarding altogether its own original detailed account.

C57) The secondary interrelationship of the various versions comprising
subrecension y is documented sufficiently clearly by their having in common
quite a large number of lengthy passages which are missing in v S, and which,
on independent (intrinsic) grounds, have been or may be declared spurious.
The following passages, given in App. I, are instances of such interpolations :

(1) No, 12 (N1.2 Vi B D), a duplicate and superfluous description of
the ocean, a similarly worded description having occurred only in the preced-
ing adhyaya ;

(2) No. 14 (K4 N Vi B D except D^, D. on suppl. fol.), a short Pura-
nic story relating how Surya resolves to bum the world down, whereupon
Garuda, at Brahma’s behest, brings his brother Aruina, over the east that he
might act as Surya’s charioteer, shielding the world from the heat of the
enraged Sun — a digression suggested by the casual mention of Aruina in
adhy. 14 ;

(3) No. 41 (K3.4 Vi B D except D^), a list of the hundred sons
of Dhrtar^tra^ — an anticipation of adhy. 108, whose occurrence here (like
that of the two following interpolations in the same adhyaya), as has been
explained above, is obviously contrary to the original plan of the adhyaya ,

(4) No. 42 (K3.4 N Vi B D except D5), an account of the scene which
was enacted in heaven before the birth of Abhimanyu, a story which is really
meant to explain the mystery of his premature death ;

(5) No. 43 (K4 N Vi B D except D^), the open secret of the mysteri-
ous birth of Karpa, which is an anticipation of adhy. 104 ; and, finally,

(6) No. 81, lines 193-230 (K4 N B D T^), meant to be a summary



74


PROLEGOMENA


of tte Jatugfha -episode, which is, however, a gtxrbled md incohmnt version
of the original story.

' The view that v and y may stand in genetic relation to each other does
not receive much support from the facts of the case. Neither v nor y can be
derived from the other. Each possesses original features that the other lacks,
as is evidenced by their alternate agreement mth S, even in the matter of
petty verbal details. All these coincidences need not, of course, be original.
Some could be indeed secondary changes, made independently in the same
direction ; others again may possibly be explained as the result of contami-
nation. There will remain still an obstinate residue of agreemoits between
V and S, or between y and S, that must be set down as the expression of the
ultimate connection of the respective concordant versions through the lost
original source.

Contamination between v and y, owing to the contiguity of the areas in
which the respective versions were current, was inevitable, and must, in any
case, be assumed to have existed ; on the other hand, contamination between
y and S cannot be altogether denied.

Particularly interesting is a small group of passages of doubtful character,
to which reference has already been made. These are certain passages that are
common to y and S. and are missing in Sj K 0-3 only ; in other words, they arc
found in all manuscripts collated except K 0 - 3 ; for example, the Kajnika-
nlti. There is usually other evidence against the passages. Thus the second-
ary character of the Kanikaniti is quite unexpectedly confirmed ; firstly, by
the illogical repetition in certain Southern manuscripts (T^, G 2 . 4 .:,) of two
preceding adhyayas (129-130) ; and, secondly, from the fact there is no
reference to the Kajnikaniti in K§emendra’s Bhdtatamanjari, in the Javanese
version, as also in Devabodha's {583 commentary. It may, of course, happen
that in particular cases there is no collateral (confirmatory) evidence of this
character available ; e.g. in the puerile account of the birth of Duhsala (App.
I, No. 63). Here the evidence of documentary and intrinsic probability is
almost equally balanced ; and documentary probability points in one direc-
tion, while intrinsic probability points in the other.

I have in such cases hesitatingly followed v ( =§i K), taking into
account, on the on^ hand, the superiority of v in general trustworthiness, and,
on the other hand, the special characteristics of y and S, which are versions
rather of the inclusive than of the exclusive type, prone to amplification and
elaboration. Fortunately for us such cases are comparatively rare

The rejection, on the evidence of v alone of the whole of the incoherent
adhy. 139 of the Bombay edition (our App. I, No. 80), an adhyaya which
contains only some needless repetition, besides minor absurdities, would not
have called forth any comment from me, but for the fact that with its omis-
sion disappears the only reference, I think, in the whole epic to this alleged

installation of Yudhi^thira as heir apparent to the throne of Hastinapura.
The Kasmiii version, which omits the entire adhyaya containing the reference,
unexpectedly justifies the indignant outburst of Holtzmann {Das Mahd-
bhdrata, Bd. 2, p. 33) : “Geradezu Falschung ist es, wenn 1, 139, 1=5517
behauptet wird, der blinde Dhrtardshtfa habe mit Uebergehung seiner eigenen

of the main objects in interpolating this adhyaya seems to have been to exo-
nerate Arjuna from the blame or sin of fighting with his own guru (Acarya
Drcjria) in the Great War, by making the Acarya himself exact from his pupil
in the presence of all his kinsfolk — for no reason that is adduced or can be

with which the agreement of one or the other of the three manuscripts is al-
most constant. That even the manuscripts of distant Nepal are not wholly

some of the Nepali manusaipts. One of these manuscripts (fsTs) happens to
be the oldest of the dated manuscripts (a.d. 1511) belonging to our critical
apparatus.*


The MmthiR Version.

Of the Maithili version, which is the version of North Bihar, only one
manuscript (Vi) was collated for this edition. Vi and K agree sporadically
against all other manuscripts (cf. for instance, 1. 1. 8, 49, 162), but such
agreements are few and far between, and it would not be safe to draw from
them any far-reaching conclusion regarding the relationship of Vj and K. As
in 306*, 321*, 328*, 346*, 378*, 418*, 450*, 541*, agrees, on the other
hand, with the typical Bengali-Devanagari group against all other manus-
cripts. Vj contains 1548*, a Southern passage, found otherwise only in Dn


The Bengali Version.

The Bengali version of sub-recension y was studied more carefully than
either the Nepali or Maithili. The study of this version was facilitated by
the extreme courtesy and kindness of Pandit Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya,
who has, now for many years, kindly and unselfishly supervised the work of
our collation centre at the Visvabharati, a centre organised by Professor M.
WiNTERNiTZ, when he was residing at Bolpur as a Guest Professor in Rabindra-
nath Tagore’s University. With the co-operation of a select batch of advanced
students, Pandit Vidhushekhara has been good enough to supply the Insti-
tute regularly with carefully prepared collations of a large number of valuable
old Bengali manuscripts in the rich collection of the Visvabharati, as also
of other manuscripts placed at his disposal by different Bengali Institutes
and scholars, among the latter, my kind friend Professor Sushil Kumar De,
of the University of Dacca. Of the large number of manuscripts thus collat-
ed, ultimately five were selected for inclusion in the critical apparatus

of the edition. Notwithstanding considerable variation in these manuscripts
as regards petty verbal details, the material appears sufficient to settle the
text of this important version.

{60} The Bengali version is closely allied to the Vulgate, but is un-
questionably superior to the latter in so far that it is happily free from a large
number of late accretions which encumber the Vulgate. Of such “omis-
sions ”, exhibiting the superiority of the Bengali version, the following will
serve as illustrations :

(1) The entire Brahma-Ga)nesa complex in adhy. 1, of which the
Bengali version contains not the remotest trace. The spurious character of
this passage has been discussed and demonstrated so often that it is unneces-
sary to dilate upon it here.'^

(2) The short dialogue of 8 lines (71*) between Parasurama and the
shades of his ancestors, in the beginning of adhy 2, which is wholly unneces-
sary here, and is, as a matter of fact, only an excerpt from a detailed des-
cription of the principal Indian tirthas, which occurs in the Ara|nya (B. 3.
83. 29ffi).*

(3) ‘A short passage of only six lines (cf. App. I, No. 13), which
represents a somewhat feeble attempt (as unnecessary as it is unsuccessful)
to fill out an apparent lacuna in the original.^

(4) A long interpolation (App. I, No. 78) of 119 lines in adhy. 138
(Bom. ed.), which gives an inflated account of the defeat and the ultimate
capture' of Drupada by the Pl^davas. It is one of the miniature Bharata-
yuddhas — mere by-play for the benefit of the gallery — which expand and em-
bellish the Southern recension and the Vulgate. The older version disposes
of the battle in two lines, which, taking everything into consideration, is after
all perhaps not a very inadequate treatment, as already remarked.

(5) More than usual interest attaches to another omission in the Ben-
gali version, which concerns a well-known and popular scene describing the
discomfiture of Kaiina at Draupadi’s svayarhvara, which is commonly be-
lieved to be one of the main reasons why he always entertained feelings of
such deep and implacable hatred towards Kr§!na (DraupadI), and lost
thereafter no opportunity to hurt and humiliate her.

This passage deserves a detailed consideration. Ramesh Chandra Dutt,
who had to make a very careful selection of the incidents of the epic in com-
pressing the story, has made this scene the centre of his poetic account of

the marriage of Draupadi, and given a vivid rendering of the passage in
his Epic of the Bharotas :

** Uprose Kama, peerless archer, proudest of the archers he,

And he went and strung the weapon, fixed the arrows gallantly,

Stood like Surya in his splendour and like Agni in his flame', —
Pandu's sons in terror whispered, Kama sure must hit the aim !

But in proud and queenly accent Dmpad’s queenly daughter said :

' Monarch's daughter, bom a Kshatra, Suta’s son I will not wed.'
Kama heard with crimsoned forehead, left the emprise almost done,
Left the bow already circled, silent gazed upon the Sun ! "

The situation is, undoubtedly, full of dramatic possibilities. Just at the
moment when the prize was going to be snatched away from the heroes of
the epic by an upstart, £ 61 } the brave little Draupadi comes to the rescue
and snubs openly, in the presence of the assembled princes, the* semi-divine
bastard, the understudy of the Villain of the piece, the unwanted suitor, who
thereupon withdraws discomfited ; and everybody breathes a sigh of relief.
A tense scene !

Unfortunately, this melo-dramatic interlude, to judge by the documen-
tary evidence, appears to be the handiwork of a very late Vylasai'd, as it is
found only in K4 5^2 Dn D2, 4. 5, that is, one manuscript of the K group,
one Nepali manuscript, and three composite Devanagari manuscripts, besides
the Nilakantha version ! All of these are late and inferior or conflated manus-
cripts. It is missing, on the' other hand, not only in the Saradia version and
the Southern recension (as in the case of many of the interpolations of the
Vulgate), but for once, also in the entire Bengali version !

It might seem a piece of sheer vandalism or perverseness to omit this
seemingly beautiful little passage, which has won its way into people's hearts,
from any edition of the Great Epic of India, relying merely upon documen-
tary evidence. A little' reflection will, however, convince any one that the
loss to the epic is not as serious as one might, at first, suppose, since it is a
palpably faked and thoroughly unreal situation. If one thinks about it at all,
one fails to understand how Draupadi, who was, after all, then only an unexpe-
rienced maiden in her teens, had recognized the King of Ahgas (whom she had
probably never seen before) and known him for the son of a coachman, unfit
to wed a princess. He had been invited by her father. At least he was
given a seat of honour among the princes. He is specifically named by
Dhr^tadyumna among the suitors ( 1 . 177 . 4 ). Moreover, it does not appear
as if the bride elect had much choice or voice in the matter, at the time of
these elaborate and formal state functions notwithstanding that they were
called svayamvaras. She had to wed any competitor who excelled in the
particular proficiency test which had bden arranged by her father or guardian.
She was vtryaStdkd : she was given by her guardian to the highest bidder.

the price paid being heroism, or rather proficiency in marksmanship. This
is quite evident from the words of Yudhisfhira, addressed later to the Purohita
of Ehupada ( 1 . 185. 23 f.) :

We accordingly find, as a matter of fact, that without murmur or hesitation,
she follows an unknown and apparently undistinguished Brahman boy —
Arjuna in disguise — ^who happens to have hit the mark. She does not know
him from Adam, but she makers no inquiries about his status or lineage.
Even if this were regarded as a case of romantic love at first sight for the
handsome and heroic bowman (which it certainly is not), she never opens
her lips when Yudhi$thira proposes that she should be the common wife of
the five brothers, which must have shatt^ed her romance to smithereens, but
quietly submits to (what is made to appear) as a most unusual and un-
natural, if not a shocking, proposal, and from which even her old father and
brother r^oil with perplexity and amazement. It seems to me, therefore,
that the documentary evidence* is amiply supported here by intrinsic probabi-
lity.

£62} Examples of other important '' omissions in the Bengali version
which distinguish it from the Devanagari are : 54*, 60*, 71*, 152*, 171*, 274,
277*, 689*, 1171*, 1205*, 1270*, 1614* (proverbs, one of them being a
citaticMi from Manu), 1714* (a short list of sacred rivers), 1788*, 1827*,
1841*, all of which occur in the Vulgate, but are missing in the Bengali
version.

Occasionally Bengali manuscripts agree in their readings with the South-
ern recension, standing in opposition to K (with or without D) ; e.g. ;

1. 22 B S : K ( mostly ) D ( mostly )

1 . 42 B S • ^ 0 - 2-4 D ( mostly )

7. 3 B D ( mostly ) S : K

39. 10 B D ( mostly ) S K ( with a few D ) 3 ^:.

64. 29 N B D S wm : K etc., etc., etc.

Other examples have been cited under the description of the K version.

In these cases, I have, as a rule, given preference to the agreement bet-
ween B and S, on the postulated principle of the originality of the* agreement
between independent versions, adopting in the constituted text, the concor-
dant reading ; but owing to the circumstance, that sporadic contamination
between B and S, as a whole, cannot be altogether denied and that there are,
as a matter of fact, some Bengali manuscripts that stand, palpably, under

the influence of the Southern tradition, even in the matter of minor readings,
it is impossible to be perfectly certain about the' originality of a reading com-
mon to B and S. I am, however, of opinion that the probability is always
on the side of the concordant reading, though the evidence of this agreement
may be rebutted by other considerations, such as intrinsic probability or the
evidence' of pertinent testimonia.

The Devmdgarl Version.

The Devarfigari script plays in the Mahabharata textual tradition the
important role of being the commonest medium of the contamination of
different Mahiabharata versions. A Devanagaif manuscript of the Maha-
bharata may, in fact, contain practically any version or combination of ver-
sions.

Of the four “ Devanagari ” scholiasts whose commentaries were collated
for the Adi, Arjunamisra is certainly an Easterner, and bases his commentary
on the Bengali text ; Ratnagarbha appears to be a Southerner, and his text
is evidently a blend between the Northern and the Southern texts ; while
Nilakaiotba is quite definitely a Westerner, though he seems to have written
his commentary in Benares. The provenance of the fourth and the last
commentator mentioned above cannot be determined with certainty ; but it
might be surmised that Devabodha was a ‘‘ Northerner ” ; in any case, his
text (to judge by the lemmata in his commentary) shows remarkable affinities
with the North-western or Kasmiri version (v).

Most of the Devanagari manuscripts, as already remarked, are eclectic
on no recognizable principle : now they approach the Southern tradition (S),
now the purer Northern (v). If any one were to maintain that just this
composite' text was the original, a patchwork of disjointed ancient passages,
which had later split up into the Northern ahd Southern recensions (as might
easily be implicitly assumed by the protagonist, say, of Nilakantha’s version),
it would) be a thesis difficult to substantiate. It (63} seems more natural to re-
gard, as already observed, the Devanagari as a sort of “ vulgar” script (like
the Latin, in Europe), the script understood by the savants all over India,
into which many of the local versions were, from time to time, transcribed,
a circumstance which facilitated contamination and conflation.

It has befen mentioned above that the Devanagari version contains many
more interpolations than even the Bengali. It would be no exaggeration to
say that the Devanagari manuscripts, which are by far the most numerous
of Mahiabharata manuscripts, are, at the same time, the least important of
them, with the possible exception of those of the adjoining version, Telugu.

Thei Devanagari Version of Arjunamisra.

This is in a sense a mi^omer, because this Devanagari version, as already
remarked, is nothing but a Devanagari transcript of the Bengali version.

The name of the commentary is variously given as {Mahd) Bharatdrtha-
{pra)dipikd and BhdratmmhgraUadipikd^ The commentary on the different
parvans has been handed down singly or in groups of a few parvans at a
time*. Complete manuscripts of the commentary are said to exist in Bengal,
but even there they are not common. The manuscripts, which are written
in Bengali or Devanagarl characters, have various dates in the seventeenth
or later centuries ; the earliest hitherto reported date is V. Samvat 1676
(ca. A.D. 1620). Arjunami^ra, who styles himself Bharatacarya in the colo-
phons of his commentary, was the son of isana, who was a “ Reciter ''
(pathaka) or “Prince of Reciters'' (pathakaraja) of the Mahabharata, and
who appears to have borne, like his son, the title Bharatacarya. Arjunamisra
is cited by name' by Nilakantha once in his commentary on the Mahabharata
{ad B. 3. 291. 70) and was, therefore, certainly anterior to Nilakantha, who
belongs to the last quarter of the seventeenth century. Arjuna, in turn, men-
tions, among his predecessors : Devabodha, Vimalabodha, Sandilya, Sarvajna-
Narayana (also known as Narayana-Sarvajna or merely Narayana). He
appears to have based his scholium closely on that of Devabodha, from whose
commentary Arjuna often cites, verbatim long extracts, without specifically
naming the source. Arjuna wrote also a commentary on the Puru^asukta,
to which he himself refers in the Dipikd on B. 14. 25. 26. Telang^ surmises
that he is posterior to the Vedantist Sairhkaracarya ; and Holtzmann^ assigns
him to the thirteenth or fourteenth century, both without mentioning any
cogent reasons for their assumptions. Arjuna has treated the Harivarhsa as
an integral part of the epic, elaborately defending this position ; his commen-
tary, therefore, embraces the Harivarhsa also.^

{64} Following the example of my predecessors, I have utilized Deva-
nagari manuscripts of his commentary and treated his version as a sub-division
of the Devanagarl version. The two Devanagari manuscripts utilized by me
are, however, extremely corrupt. Moreover, the text they contain is evidently
contaminated from the Vulgate, as proved by the glaring discrepancies that
e'xist between the readings of the text and the lemmata in the commentary

(e. g. 1. 1. 17, 22). This corruption of the Arjunamisra manuscripts, I could
not explain at first, but now it is clear that it is due to their being faulty
transcripts of Bengali originals. Two such Bengali manuscripts^ (unaccom-
panied by the epic text) were sent to me subsequently by my kind friend Pro-
fessor Sushil Kumar De of the' University of Dacca from the collection of
the Dacca University. These manuscripts are far superior, as is but natural,
to the Devaniagari manuscripts. It would seem, therefore, expedient to secure
and use, whenever possible, good old Bengali manuscripts of Arjunamisra's
commentary, treating his version as an offshoot of the Bengali version (with
the symbol Ba) ; or, still better, such Bengali manuscripts of his commentary
as are unaccompanied by the epic text. The reason of the last precaution
will be presently explained.

A word of caution is here necessary in regard to what are cited in the
critical notes as the readings of Arjunamisra. The readings found in the
(epic) text accompanying the commentary have, as a rule, been taken to re-
present the readings of Arjunamisra. The commentary was consulted by me
only occasionally, in case of doubt or difficulty, or when a pathantara was
noticed during a hurried perusal of the commentary. It is, therefore, more
than likely that, since the (epic) text of our Arjunamisra manuscripts is con-
flated with various types of texts, in particular with the Nilakaiiitha type,
some errors in our readings have crept in.^ Such errors can, however, be
rectified only by carefully working through the whole commentary word for
word, and comparing the lemmata with the (epic) text of the manuscripts.
Even then one can, of course, be sure only of the words and passages actually
cited by the scholiast.

In passing, it may be mentioned that the practice of combining text and
commentary in one manuscript is probably not very old. It is almost cer-
tain that the autograph copy of the commentator was not made up on the
tripartite' system' of combining the epic text and commentary in such a way
that [the] text occupies a central strip of the folio, while* the commentary is
written in two narrow strips, one at the top and the other at the bottom of
the folio, which is the proftotype of the Bombay pothi-ioxm editions. The
scholiast must have written his commentary, certainly at first, on separate
leaves, especially in the case of voluminous texts like those of the two epics.
Accordingly the commentaries of Devabodha and Vimalabodha have been
handed down always unaccompanied by the epic text. Those of Arjunamisra
and Nllakaintha, on the other hand, are generally accompanied by the epic
text, but the two Dacca manuscripts (lent to me by Professor De), as was
mentioned above, contained only the commentary. The two elements— text and

commaitary — appear to have been combined into the tripartite form by pro-
fessional scribes. If this combination was done under the supervision of the
commentator or at £65} least in his lifetime, there is some chance of the
scribe’s reproducing, in an approximately correct form, the text of the com-
mentator. But if the combination is made independently of him and especially
if made some time after the death of the commentator, there is every chance
that the scribe would combine the commentary he was copying with some
text known better to himself than to the scholiast. In the latter case, there-
fore, it must remain doubtful how far the epic text of such a manuscript re-
sembles the text actually commented upon by the ^holiast. It is conse-
quently best to use always texts of the commentary unaccompanied by the
epic text, though it is an extremely laborious process to collate such a manus-
cript with any given Mahabharata text ; but we eliminate in this way auto-
matically all chances of avoidable errors of commission and omission.

The Devandgmi Version of Nilakantha : the Vulgate.

Nilakantha, considered until lately, at least in India, as the most trust-
worthy guide for the exposition of the Mahabharata, was a Brahmin scholar
of Mahara§tra, with the surname Caturdhara (modem Chaudhari), son of
Govinda Suri and Phullambika, residing at Kurparagrama (modern Kopar-
gaon) on the Godavari.^ Nilakantha wrote his commentary on the Maha-
bharata (and another work called the Gainesa^ta), in Benares, in the last
quarter of the seventeenth century. He appears to be the author also of a
work called Mantrarahasyaprakdsikd.

At the beginning of his commentary on the Great Epic, Nilakaintha tells
us that before writing his scholium, the Bhdratabhdvadlpa, he had compared
many copies of the Mahabharata, collected from different parts of India,
with a view to determining the “best” readings and even consulted the
scholia of old authorities :

sirar ll

We accordingly find that he occasionally mentions (in about 125 places) va-
riant readings and additional passages found in different provincial versions
(most of which can be identified among the readings of the manuscripts com-
prising our critical apparatus), and cites (as a rule, without naming the
source) the explanations given by other scholiasts — information, scknty
though it is, yet of immense interest and value for the history of the received
text. Variants cited by Nilakantha will be found in the footnotes under :

Nilakantha refers to Devabodha, Vimalabodha, Arjunamisra, Ratna-
garbha, and Sarvajna-Narayana, in the course pf his comments on the differ-
ent parvans. Devabodha, who is one of the oldest (if not the oldest) com-
mentators of the Mahabharata hitherto known, he refers while commenting
on 1. 158. 14 ( = B. 1. 170. 15.) :

Not a single word of this stanza, as cited here, is commented on, how-
ever, by Devabodha ! The only word in Devabodha's scholium which might
possibly have been taken from some reading of the stanza before Devabo-
dha is (= 2 ind that does not occur in the reading of the stanza

cited by Nilakaintha. The mention of Devabodha by Nnakantha here, is,
therefore, surely honoris causa. Such mistakes by commentators are far too
frequent to cause surprise or need comment.^ It is, however, noteworthy
that the reason Nilakaintha assigns for considering this as an ancient variant
is that it had been commented on by Devabodha and others. This shows
that^ Nilakantha held Devabodha in high esteem, and reckons him among
the ancient authorities. What Nilakaintha regards as ancient (pradna)
is of course a matter for speculation. Nevertheless I do not think that he
would have called Devabodha a ‘‘ prMna '' commentator, unless the inter-

ArjunamiSra he cites in his comment on B. 3. 291. 70 :

Since Arjunahiisra also cites Devabodha, we can arrange the three com-
mentators in an incontrovertible sequence ; Devabodha — Arjunami^ra — ^NUa-

Nilakaptha's text has acquired in modern times an importance out of all
proportion to its critical value,- to the utter neglect of far superior texts, such
as the Ka^nurl or Bengali.

Nilakaiptha’s guiding principle, on his own admission, was to make the
MahSbharata a thesaurus, of all excellences (culled no matter from what
source). At the beginning of his commentary on the Sanatsujatiya, Nila-
kaijtha naively remarks (Bom. ed. Udyoga 42) :

It would, however, hardly repay, now, the trouble to re-edit, from ma-
nuscripts, the version of Nilakaptha, as there are far better versions that
(xmld be edited instead, for instance, the Kasmrrl.

The manuscripts of the Nilakaptha version (which Show among them-
selves slight discrepancies) contain a number of lines which are not found in
any of the other versions (except occasionally in a few manuscripts of the

Vyasa at different places in his poem, in order to puzzle and confuse his di-
vine amanuensis, but is, un-{69}-fortunately, nothing of the kind. The
passage is only one of the common instances of “ conflate readings. The
stanza cited above is the Southern variant (473*) of the Northern stanza,
which, in our edition, reads (1. 55. 8) :

Wg-wNa: I

The in the former stanza is only a mhlection of the original

(often mis-written which is the Southern equivalent

the reference being, no doubt, to the minister cr statesman (mantrin)
Kahika (named after the famous authority Kainika or Kaninka cited in the
Artha^astra of Kautilya), who appears only once in the epic, and that express-
ly for the purpose of expounding his political philosophy to the Kauravas.

As another instance of conflation which has had a rather disastrous effect
on his text, I may cite Nilakaajtha’s version of the story of Dirghatamas.
The addition has been made in such a manner that one sentence oj the ori-
ginal has remained hanging in the air and cannot be construed at all ! The
story begins at B, 1. 104. 9. All goes well till stanza 28 :

qwirflR II

Then we read 29 :

si am ii

“ Having spoken thus among themselves, they [sct7. the inmates of the
hermitage] to the anchorite Krghatamas. Then that wife also, having
(already) obtained sons (?) (from him) did not (seek to) please the hus-
band.”

Kiisma, who is narrating the story, then goes on quite unconcernedly to
speak about the wife (of Dirghatamas) Pradveji or Pradvi§anti ; about the
maryada made by the exasperated Dirghatamas, and so on. But what the
inmatpg of the hermitage (aSramavasinah) did to Dirghatamas, we never
learn fr<«n the Vulgate. All modem translators try to eke out a sense by
interpolating into the text some words to complete the sense. A reference to

the constituted text and the critical notes will, however, show that the text
of the Vulgate is conflated ; it is a most clumsy blend of interpolations from
two entirely different sources (y and S)., which, as is but natural, alters the
situation considerably and confuses the narrative hopelessly. By athetizing
either passage we get a tolerable text ; by athetizing both we get the original,
which is the constituted text.

The Devandgarl Version of Ratnagarbha.

The critical notes contain only specimen collations of this version, which
is a blend between the Northern and Southern recensions. Like the Tdugu
manuscripts, which will be described presently, it is eclectic, following now
the Northern tradition, now the Southern. It seems to be an attempt to
combine the two recensions by superposition, like the Kumbhakonam edition.
Its composite character may be seen from 24*, 25*, 27*, 114*, 138*, 149*,
170*, etc., etc. It contains the additional passages of the Southern recen-
sion, as well as the Ganesa episode, which latter is found only in late Nor-
thern {70} (Devanagaii) manuscripts : exactly like the Kumbhakonam edi-
tion. The collation of this version was discontinued after the second adhyaya.
The version may be safely ignored as useless for critical purposes.

The Devandgarl Version of Devabodha,

A commentary older and more important than the Arthadipikd of Ar-
junami^ra, and one more neglected still, is the Jndnadipikd of Devabodha,
cited here as Cd. Devabodha is certainly earlier than Vimalabodha, Arjuna-
mi^ra and Nilakaijtha, all of whom cite him with great respect, and probably
earlier than Sarvajha-Narayaira and Vadiraja. He is, therefore, most likely,
the earliest commentator of the Mahabharata hitherto known, and, in my
opinion, also the best. The commentary is in any case most valuable, and its
evidence, both positive and negative, of supreme importance for the consti-
tution of the text.

The Jndnadipikd is a concise tika ; that is, a running commentary, ex-
plaining, as a rule, only the difficult words and passages in the text. Occa-
sionally it offers explanations of constructional obscurities and grammatical
difficulties, and gives the gist of passages ; in the latter case, usually, under
citation of entire verses (i.e. half slokas) from the text. The extent of the
commentary on the Adi is given in one manuscript as 1400 granthas. The
homage which Arjuna pays to Devabodha in the Introduction to his scholium
is not a mere matter of form. Arjuna has in fact based his commentary
largely on that of his predecessor. He has copied very large portions of Deva-
bodha's commentary, sometimes verbatim, sometimes in extract. Moreover
even when the two commentaries differ, the influence of Devabodha is plainly
discernible. In fact, the Arthadipikd may be considered as a revised and



90


PROU^MENA


enlarged edition of the Jndnadipikd. The similarity of the names is sugges-
tive and worthy of ncte.

Unlike the commentaries of Arjunami^ra, Nilakantha and Ratnagari>ha,
that of Devabodha is unaccompanied by the epic text. The question what
was Devabodha's text cannot, therefore, be answered with any high degree of
certainty. The entire Southern recension and even the Vulgate may, how-
ever, be* definitely ruled out. There remain the Bengali, §arada and “ K
versions. With the latter two, the pratikas of Devabodha seem to show
greater affinity than with the Bengali version. For instance, Devabodha has
no comment on any of the six adhyayas (including the Kanikaniti) of the cen-
tral subrecension (7), which are missing in sarada and K. Wortliy of special
note is the absence of all reference to the Kanikaniti in Devabodha's commen-
tary, since the passage has evoked lengthy comments from both Arjunami§ra
and Nilakantha. Still greater probative value has an addition which is peculiar
to the Ka^mlrl version. This version adds at the very end of the Adi a sup-
plementary and superfluous adhyaya, — an addition which is only a variant
of the well-known Purainic tale of Svetaki’s sacrifice., occurring earlier in the
course of the same parvan. Curiously enough, the king who is called Svetaki
in the first version is here called Svetaketu ! That the version of Devabodha
contained this additional adhyaya is revealed by the concluding remark of
Devabodha’s commentary on the Adi : TOT This remark will

not apply to any version which has not the additional adhyaya peculiar to the
Ka^miri version. These considerations tend to show that the version of De-
vabodha was of the Sarada-K type. And the inference is confirmed by many
minor agreements, which need not be cited here.

{71} The Composite Devandgan Version.

The fourteen manuscripts comprising this version are misch-

codices of small trustworthiness and of no special value for critical purposes.
Consequently, half of them {D8.14) were disccntinued already after adhyaya 2.
The characteristics of these manuscripts may be briefly noticed here.

Dj is akin to Dn and looks imcommonly like a Nilakaiptha manuscript
7ninus the commentary. Yet it differs conspicuously from the ordinary Nila-
kaihtha manuscripts by the unaccountable omission of the entire Brahma-
Gane^a complex (that is, both the visit of Brahma and the employment of
Gape§a as a scribe, which arises out of the visit) as well as the description
of the battle in which the P^i>(Javas capture Drupada and hand him over as
gurudak§ipa to their preceptor, Acarya Drona (App I, No. 78). The omis-
sion of these episodes points rather in the direction of Bengal, since Ka§mir
is excluded by the mass of other interpolations which Di contains, as also by
the almost complete lack therein of readings peculiar to i§i K. The manus-
cript may be a blend of Bengali and some composite Devanagari manuscript

or manuscripts.— D 2 (like Dg) is akin to and might have been with
advantage classed with them : see, for instance, the critical apparatus per-
taining to the list of the contents of the Arapyaparvan in adhy. 2. — D 3 is
palpably under Southern influence, to prove which it is sufficient to point out
that it transposes the ^kuntalS and Yayati episodes, a transposition which
is quite peculiar to the Southern tradition. — D 4 contains notably large addi-
tions from Southern manuscripts, additions which are either altered on the
margin or, when the marginal space would net suffice, written on suppleroen*
tary folios. The Southern influence is illustrated by the following passages ;
587*. 594*, 596*, 598*, 599*, 602*, 603*. 604*, 605*, 609*, 610*, 611*,

612*, 613*. 617*, 621*, 623*, 624*. 628*, 629*, 630*, 633*. 634*, 635*,

637*, 670*, 671*, 713*, 715*. 1255*,. 1256*, 1257*, and scores of others.

Cf. also the following passages given in App. I : 35, 46-48, 52, 53, 55, 56,

59, 64, 67-69, etc., etc. — Dg (like D,) often stands in oppesition to other
manuscripts of this composite class, agreeing with K-.,,, with which it might
have been with advantage classed. Like K 4 . 3 , it contains Southern additions
as well, e.g. 1565*, 1579*, 1580*, etc., and passage No. 89 of App. I. — The
manuscripts were discontinued after adhy. 53. Frequently they are
found tc- be in opposition to the Vulgate and agreeing with the manuscripts
of the c group. They also show 230*, which is a Southern passage.

D«-14. as already remarked, were collated only as speciniMS for the first
two adhySyas and discontinued thereafter. — Of these, Ds. 12.14 are palpably
under Southern influence, as is evidenced by their containing one or the other
of the following typical Southern insertions : 18*, 21*, 22*, 24*, 32*, 42*.
45*, 48*, 49*, 56*. 80*, 81*, 89*, 114*, 117*, 138*, 149*, 170*.-D,3,
which is a fragmentary manuscript, beginning almost at the end of adhy. 1 ,
is used in this edition practically only for adhy. 2 , as it is discontinued at the
end of that adhyaya. The text shows strong affinities with the version of Ar-
junamisra. — The text of D 14 is a ocmplex. It contains some old readings
such as are preserved only in the KaSmlri manuscripts, but also an ^ra-
ordinarily large number of individual readings, not found elsewhere (cf. 1 . 1 .
50, 63 ; 2. 101, etc ). At the same time, it is contaminated from some Sou-
thern source, perhaps the MalaySlam version !

£72} The Devanagari manuscripts of the Mahabharata in the Tanjore
Library seem to have been all copied during the regime of the Maratha Chiefs
of Tanjore, and are a blerid of the Northern and Southern recensions, and as
such, of little value for text-critical purposes.

The Tebiiu Version.

The Tdugu version, situated as it is on the boundary line which divides
the Northern from the Southern recension, was particularly open to contami-
natiem from the Northern tradition. We accordingly find that the majerity
of Telugu manuscripts are eclectic on no recognizable principlesi presenting

somewhat the aspect of a mosaic of the texts of the Northern and Southern
recensionSi, not unlike the Kumbhakcnam edition. Tj is one of the extremely
few Southern manuscripts which contain the (Northern) salutational stanza
^or the Northern element in the make-up of Tj, cf. 29*, 30*,
95*, 97*, 98*, 106*, etc., etc. As compared with Tj, To shows a purer Sou-
thern tradition and has distinct leanings towards the Grantha version. — T 3 only
replaces the fragmentary manuscripts To, which breaks off at the end of
adhy. 181.

Important variants of one other Telugu manuscript (Tanjore 11809) are
now given by Professor P. P. S. Sastri in his edition of the Southern recen-
sion. It does not differ appreciably from our Telugu manuscripts.

The Grantha Version.

The Grantha version is the version of the Tamil country, and is written
in the so-called Grantha script. It is one of the two important Southern ver-
sions. the other being the MalayMam. The Grantha version — to judge by the
manuscripts utilized for the Critical Exlition, and for Professor P. P. S.
Sastri’s Southern Recension — is more heavily interpolated than the Mala*
yalam, and is also more influenced, on the whole, by the Northern recension.

For the beginning of the Adi. we get, temporarily, the sub-groups Gi _3
and G 4 .ft, but soon the configuration changes to Gi. 2 . 4 . 5 . versus G 3 . g- The
latter group (Gg.g) represents the purer Southern tradition, agreeing with M
against the other Southern manuscripts, whereas the four MSS. Gi-a^-s
not merely heavily interpolated but stand palpably under Northern influence.
All Grantha manuscripts are probably contaminated (directly or indirectly)
from Northern sources in different degrees. Gg shows, on the whole, little Nor-
thern influence, but 419*, 494*, 603*, 1310*, 1312*, 1885*, 1975*, and pas-
sage No. 73 of App. I, show that even Gg is probably net entirely free from
contamination, since all these (Northern) passages are missing in M.

Sastri’s edition of the Southern recension gives the (most important)
variants of five Grantha manuscripts of which three, and 31 (the latter
being Sastri’s “principal text”) are identical with our G^, G^ and Gg res-
pectively. Extracts from a Grantha manuscript belonging to the Royal
Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland (Whish Collection, No. 65) have
been given by Professor Winternitz^ and compared with the text of the
Bombay edition (t^ka 1799). The passages which differ from the Bombay
edition { 73 } have been underlined in his extracts, and the corresponding
passages of the latter are given opposite each line : a convenient arrangement
which shows, at a glance, the relation of the two texts to each other for the

passages excerpted.^

The clearest proofs of the contamination of Gi. 2 . 4.5 from some Northern
source is furnished by 294*, a Northern passage, added in this sub-group
irrelevmtly before 1. 20. 1. The two lines comprising this passage must have
been interpolated in a remote ancestor of Gi. 2 . 4.5 by a clumsy scribe, who had
missed the right place by four stanzas, and have remained there ever since,
fortunately. Another rather transparent interpolation in Gi. 2 . 4.5 from a late
Northern source is a passage referred to already, No. 14 of App. I, which des-
cribes the circumstances under which Arujna becomes the charioteer of the
Sun, an irrelevant digression. Cf. also 1373*, 1375*, 1377*, and passage No.
76 of App. I.

The sub-group contains an amaizingly large number of interpolations,
whiich have not been found, so far, elsewhere, and of which a few may be men-
tioned as illustration^ : 320*, 322*, 326*, 330*, 337*, 345*, 351* (third
line!), 357*, 363*. 364*, 368*. 371*, 373*, 382*, 386*, 387*, 388*, 406*,
519*, 584*, 636*, 705*, 706*, 741*, 755*, etc., etc.

But the Grantha version itself inclined to admit freely new lines. In-
stances 0 / rather lengthy interpolations of G are furnished by passages No. 35-
39, 73 and 93 of App. I . Most of the interpolations are however short, con-
sisting, as a rule, of less than 10 lines, e.g. 500*, 501*, 502*, 504*, 507*,
509*, 510*, 511*, 520*, 552*, 569*, 570*, 693*, 814*, 841*, 897*, 1259",
1268*, 1312*, 1313*, 1316*,, 1319*, 1320*, 1372*, 1435*, 1441*, 1447*,

1448*, 1452*, 1453*, 1476*, 1489*, 1531*, 1541*, 1542*, 1543*, 1544*, 1545*.
1547*, 1550*, 1551*, 1596*, 1597*, 1604*, 1631*, 1658*, 1666*, 1707*,

1868*, 2009*, 2040*, etc., etc.

G 7 , which is one of the few Southern manuscripts containing the (Northern)
mantra etc. is, like Tj, a typical blend of the Northern

and Southern tradition, and was, on that account, discontinued after adhy. 2.
Its composite character may be seen from : 29*, 30*, 96*, 97*^ 98*, 106*,
145*, etc., etc.


The Malaydlam Version,

This isi the version of Malabar, the Southernmost extremity of India.
It is, in tny opinion, the best Southern version. It is not only largely free
from the interpolations of a (=T G), but appears to be also less influenced
by N than cr, wherein lies its importance for us.


1 The collation of the text is accompanied by notes in which Winternitz
draws attention to the roost striking points of difference between the two versions,
without entering into a full discussion of all the various readings. The notes con-
tain nevertheless many valuable text-critical observations.

35-39 and 73.

{74} Ml often stands in antagonism to M 2 _ 4 , sometimes agreeing witli
manuscripts of the Northern recension ; and is, therefore, an untrustworthy
guide. Mi. 2.4 are incomplete manuscripts, ending with adhy. 53 ; in other
words, with the Asdkaparvan. replace these manuscripts in the Sambha-
vaparvan, which is the name under which the remaining portion of the Adi is
known in the Southern recension. This practice of writing the two portions
of the Adi in separate volumes is worthy of note, as an archaic survival. It
is, in my opinion, the reflex of some half-forgotten factor connected with the
cctmpilation of the Adi, and seems to me to be text-critically highly impor-
tant. It should seem that the South has never completely assimilated the
{Northern) division of the epic into the conventional eighteen parvems.

Instances of additional passages which distinguish M from all other ver-
sions are : 407*, 453*, 800*, 801*, 842*, 970*, 1051*, 1052*, 1278*,, 1437*,
1438*, 1613*, 1678*, 1709*, 1871*, etc.

Mg-s constitute really one manuscript, as is proved, for instance by
their repeating the following indubitable clerical errors ; (i) in 1 . 85. 25,

Repeat inconsequentially the words (ii) in 1 , 154.

13, they omit 13^ and 13"^, transposing 13*^ and 13^, which they read as one
line; (iii) in 1. 193. 1, they all read the meaningless (Text

adhy. 212 ; (v) in 1. 213. 6 , Mg.g omit the words text,

for which M 7 shows a lacuna. Instances of readings peculiar to Mg-s are

A careful study of the critical apparatus would easily furnish scores of other

This version has several striking agreements with Si, a fact all the more
impressive, because M, a Southern version, hails from the province at the op-
posite end of India from the province of Sj, a Northern version ; for instance,
Malayalam supports Si (against T G) in omiting the spurious parts of adhy.
128-129 of the Bombay edition.

WiNTERNiTZ has published, in Devanagarl transcript, portions of a frag-
mentary Malayalam manuscript belonging to the Royal Asiatic Society of
Great Britain and Ireland (Whish Collection,, No. 158), which contains
twelve chapters of the Sairhbhavaparvan.^ The extracts contain the beginning
of the Puruvamsanukirtana (our adhy. 90), the passage referring to Sakun-
tala and the birth of Bharata (our 1. 90. 27-34), and the end of the adhya-
ya (our 1. 90. 93-96). The manuscript correctly shows the Southern trans-
position of the Sakuntala and Yayati episodes. It is interesting to observe
that this manuscript also further shows the anticipation of 1. 89. 1-16, before
the YayMi episode, which is found in our Malayalam manuscripts? (cf. note
on p. 282) and in the conflated MSS. G4. 5 (cf. note on p. 992), and which
is text-critically highly important.

Readings or features which are peculiar to M or such as distinguish M
from G (with or without T) will be found under : 1. 1. 3. 35, 45, 122, 128, 168,
176, 179, 184, 189 ; 2. 100 ; 4. 4 ; 7. 10 ; 24. 1 ; 36. 3 ; 39. 2, 16 ; 53. 31 ;
54, 6, 7 ; 57. 81 ; 61. 98' ; 67. 28 ; 68. 16, 51 ; 69. 9 ; 73. 33 ; 77. 9 ; 78.
23 ; 80. 2 ; 84, 14 ; 86. 1 ; 92. 45 ; 93. 14 ; 94. 9, 27, 32 ; 95. 8 ; 96. 2, 57;
98. 5, 12 ; 113. 22 ; 117. 5, 23 ; 119. 30 ; 123. 39 ; 129. 9-11 (am. in M) ;
132. 1 ; 136. 1 ; 138, 10 ; 139. 11 (om. in M) ; 142. 19 ; 150. 10, 26 ; etc., etc.

With regard to the versions described above, it must be frankly admitted
that they do not, by any means, form water-tight compartments. The isolec-
tional boundaries, as is natural, do not coincide, but are independait of each
other ; in other words, the textual peculiarities, which are, in final analysis,
the real basis of our classification, never have, as a matter of fact, an identi-
cal area of distribution. The manuscripts cannot always be squeezed into the
same moulds consistently. Thus, for instance, in the beginning of the Adi,
the Grantha version, as already remarked, shows two sub-groups Gi_3 and
G4 _q ; but soon the configuration changes and, from about adhy. 25 onwards,
we get the grouping Gi.2.4.r, : G^.^. Not only that. Individual manuscripts,
groups, or even versions often overstep the boundaries of their particular re-
cension. Thus, for example, on the one hand, Gi.2.4.5- frequently agree with
5^ Vi B D ; M agrees with iSi ; iSi and Dn agree with S ; against other manus-
cripts of their respective recensions.

These discrepancies, as is shown in thte sequel, are due chiefly to two
different causes : firstly, initial fluidity of the text ; and, secondly, subsequait

contamination or conflation. As regards fluidity : to conceive of the Epic of
the Bharatas — or for that matter, of any true epic — as a rigid or fixed com-
position like the dramas or poems of Goethe or Milton, or even of K^i-
dasa or Bhavabhuti, would be manifestly grotesque. Such a view can origi-
nate only in a fundamental misconception of the origin, growth and function
of epic poetry.

In the case of the Mahabharata, we find, however, the fact of the fluidi-
ty of the original reflected in the tradition as preserved even to this day.
Only a very late interpolation in some inferior Devanagan manuscripts speaks
of the text as having been written down by Gainesa to the dictation of Vyasa,
a fantastic story that we may ignore with an eaisy conscience. On the otlier
hand, we are plainly told that the epic was first published, at an elaborate
sacrificial session, in the form of a free recitation by Vaisaimpayaina, a direct
pupil of the author, before king Janamejaya and the assembled guests. It
was again recited by Suta (or Sauti), who had heard it only at the first reci-
tation, and somehow committed the whole poem to memory. After just one
single hearing, he obviously could not reproduce such a voluminous text ver-
batim et literatim. In the b^inning, therefore, it is clear that the poem, which
was committed to memory, was recited freely, as faithfully as the particular
leciter could contrive. This mode of transmission is net calculated to pre-
serve rigid textual purity in any high degree, without stringent precautions,
such as were adopted in the case of Vedic texts, but which never existed, as
far as one knows, in the case of the epics. This fact also we find unexpectedly
preserved by tradition (1. 57. 74 f.). Vyasa, we are told, taught his Bharata
to his five pupils. Sumantu, Jaimini, Paila, Suka, and Vaisampayana. And
the five rhapsodists — the direct pupils of the aluthor — it is reported, publish-
ed five separate vermns of the epic :

{76} i

As is well known, there is preserved a work which actually passes for the
Asvamedhaparva of the Bharata of Jaimini (whether it is actually so or not)
and which is totally different froim our A4vamedhaparvan.

Here, I think, we have a clear glimpse of the early history of the text.
Two facts emerge rather clearly out of the chaos : firstly, the text was migi-
nally committed to memory and recited freely ; secondly, different rhapsodists
recited differently. This has indeed been aissumed by many writer's on the sub-
ject.^ All that is quite natural and intelligible. As a matter of fact, from
generation to generation, from place to placq, from bard to bard, the wording,
even the contents* would vaky a little, until the text is committed to writing,
which is the beginning of a different phase in its history. The view that the
epic has reached its present form by a gradual process of addition and alte-

ration receives strong support from the fact that this process is not stopped
even by scriptal fixation.^ The study of the manuscripts thetoselves, which
belong to a very late phase in the evolution of the text, shows that texts must
have been constantly amplified -and altered by conflation. Su^ derange-
ments, it may be observed, do not totally destroy, as might be imagiHed, the
value of our division of the manuscript material into recensions and versions,
but merely complicate its use and interpretation.

CRITICAL PRINCIPLES FOLLOWED IN THE CONSTITUTION

OF THE TEXT

As already remarked, the MahaWrarata versions when they first come
within our ken appear already dispersed in several distinct groups. The ori-
ginal, from which all these versions are derived, is itsdf preserved in no au-
thentic copy contemporaneous with, or even reasonably close to, its period
of compositimi. We can <Mily reconstruct the original, approximately., by
comcwuative methods. We recognize today, as already explained, two recen-
sions, descended from the original, each recension embracing a plurality of
versions, each version being divided into a multiplicity of sul>groups. The
ultimate-problem is to unify, as far as possible, this manuscript tradition : to
evolve, by comparative methodi a form of the text that will explain this phe-
nomenal wealth of divergent and conflicting texts, and justify it.

Before I elucidate the critical principles followed in preparing the cons-
tituted text of the Adi, I must review briefly other principles of textual cri-
ticism and textual reccmstruction, and discuss the applicability of these prin-
ciples to the Mahabharata Problem.

The Classical Model

The method that naturally presents itself first to our mind is the tioMi-
honoured method of Classical Philology The older school of classical frfii-
lologists distinguished four stages in the work of preparing a critical edition of
a classical text : (1) Heuristics, {77} i.e. assembling and arranging the aitire
material consisting of manuscripts and testimonia in the form of a genealogi-
cal tree ; (2) Recensio\, i.e. restoration of the text of the archetype ; (3) Emeu-
datw, i. e. restoration of the text of the author ; and, finally, (4) Higher Cri-
ticism, i.e. separation of the sources utilized by the author.

Excellent as this method is for the purpose for which it is devised, it
should not be forgotten that it depends ultimately upon there being a mOTe or
less complete concatenation of copies and exemplars reaching finally back to a
single authentic (written) archetype ; and, consequently, can be applied to

the MahabhSrata with great limitations.^ Indeed our ideal is the same as
that of the classical philologist : restoration of the text, as far as possible
to Its ongmal form. But the original of a Sanskrit poem and that of a classi-
^ P(^_ : how entirely different they are ! Particularly, in the case of the
MahSbharata, where, one may well ask, is the original of a whole literature?

In the Mahabharata we have a text with about a dozen, more or less
independent, versions, whose extreme types differ, in extent, by about 13,OQO
stanzas or 26,000 lines ; a work which, for centuries, must have been growing
not only upwards and downwards, but also laterally, like the Nyagrodha
trw, growing on all sides ; a codex which has been written in nearly a dozen
different scripts assiduously but negligently copied, chiefly as a source of reli-
^ous merit, throu^ long vistas of centuries by a legion of devout and per-
haps mostly uneducated and inefficient copyists, hailing from different comers
of a v^t sub-continent, and speaking different tongues ; a traditional boc4c
of inspiration, which in various shapes and sizes, has been the cherished
hentage of one people" crmtinuously for some millennia and which to the
present day is interwoven with the thoughts and beliefs and moral ideas of
a nation numbering over 300 million souls ! The classical philologist has
clearly no experience in dealing with a text of this description, an opus of
such gigantic dimensicms and complex character, with such a long and intri-
cate history behind it

THE DIFFICULTIES OF MAHABHARATA TEXTUAL CRITICISM

The capital difficulty of the Mahablfirata problem is just this that there
are hardly any clear objective criteria which may enaWe us to discriminate
with precision and certainty between the data of the rival recensions, to eva-
luate correctly and confidently the amazingly large mass of variants. Only
an inconsiderable fraction of these variants represents clear “ mistakes ”,
which can be corrected with confidence. As a rule, the variant readings, if
they are not mere synonyms, convey a slightly different meaning, but almost
always a possible meaning. From the grammatical point of view also, they
arc both equally valid. One of the variants may be a trifle more suitable
than the other ; for instance, in the diswiminatioo between the Simple and
the Periphrastic Future, or the Parasmaipada and the Atmanqiada. But
can we legitimately premise that the original must necessarily have been quite
flawless from the point of view of the PSininian grammar ? Is it not at loa s t
likely that the supposed solecism may be a genuine lapsus calami of the
author, or (should that suMXisitiai be considered inadmissible or unaccept-
able) that the usage fluctuated ?

Then again, as we have seen, there are numerous passages, short and Imig,
that are found in one recension and are lacking in the other, what I call'

zeitung, 1932, 276 f.

“ additional ” passages. No { 78 } convincing proof can in gmeral be given to
establish either the originality or the spuriousness of any given passage of
this type. What may fairly be regarded as interpolations are in general so
ingeniously fashioned and so cunningly fitted in that, except under very
favourable circumstances, the intrinsic (contextual) evidence is inccmclusive.

For these and other reasons it is n(A always easy to correlate the diverg-
ent recensions, to discriminate between the variants, and to constitute a wholly
unobjectionable single tert.

This difficulty , has its origin in the circumstance that in the MahatMrata
manuscript tradition, perhaps as much as in any literary tradition, the tex-
tual critic is faced with a bewildering profusion of versions as also with an
amazing mixture of versions. Contrary tendencies have been at work in the
evolution of the text. While, on the one hand, some elements have been work-
ing, from the earliest times, for the development of different types ; on the other
hand, there were not wanting elements that operated against the evolution of
sharply differentiated types. To understand the phenomenon of this luxuriant
growth and indiscriminate fusion of versions, one must appreciate certain de-
tails oi* historical moment, certain special factors in the transmissimi of the
Mahabharata, traits which distinguish our work from every other known
text except the Ramayapa and perhaps other similar ancient epopees.

Let us examine closely the character of the differences between the two
recensions to start with.^ The differences are Of three kinds. Broadly speak-
ing, each recension differs from the other, firstly, in point of readings of the
common stanzas ; secondly, in point of additions (or omissions) of short and
Irnig passages ; and, thirdly, in point of sequence of the text-units. How do
these differences at all arise ? .

Our first thought would be to attempt to explain the additions or omis-
sions as the result of conscious editorial revision, or of clerical error, or partly
of one and partly of the other. But the frequent differences in sequence, es-
pecially when no material gain is perceptible in either arrangement, rather
support the explanation suggested above that both recensi<ms are, in final
anal3rsis, independent copies cf an orally transmitted text. The suggestion
is confirmed by the consideration of the variation of the first type, namely,
minor differences in the readings of the stanzas common to the two recen-
sions, whidi confront us step by step throughout the parvan, nay, through-
out the qjic, as the i>artial cdlations of the other parvans now available at
the Institute clearly show.

It will be found for one thing perfectly useless to try to derive mechani-
cally one set of readings uniformly from the other. Hundreds and thousands

vealed by the researches of Jacobi ; see particularly. Das RamSyaifa, pp. 3 ff, and

of the mlpor readings are nothing more than mere synonyms or paraphrases,
grammatically and semantically equivalait, but graphically totally unrelated.
They, therefore, cannot be all corruptions, in the ordinary sense of the word,
of a written archetype. The vast majority of these variants cannot again be
due to the zeal of a purist trying to correct the solecisms of the received text,
or to the whim of a minor poet endeavouring to polish its diction or style.
Had that been the case, we should find that the enthusiasm of the reformer
had evaporated long before he had reached the middle or at least the end of the
first parvan. The £79} Herculean task of cleansing the Augean stables would
be child’s play compared to a systematic purification of the Mahabharata text,
according to later standards. Under these circumstances, however great might
be the divergence between the two recensions in the beginning, it is bound to
vanish or at least diminish towards the middle or the end of the poem. We
find, on the other hand, as already remarked, that the stream of variation
flows with unabated volume from the beginning to the end of the epic. This
fact can in no way be reconciled with the hypothesis of a single uniform re-
vision (or a series of them either) of a fixed and rigid text.

All the difficulties in the explanation of this phenomenal variation
vani^, however, as soon as we assume that the epic was handed down from
bard to bard originally by word oj mouth, as is clearly implied by tradition.
That would explain, without any strain or violence, the existence of the mass
of variants, of differences in sequence, and of additions or omissions. If the
text has been preserved, for any considerable period of time, only in memory
and handed down by word of mouth, those are just the changes that could
not possibly be avoided. It is evident that no gr^t care would be lavished
on the text by these custodians of the tradition to guard it against corruption
and elaboration, or against arbitrary emendation, and normalization : to re-
produce the received text, which was not guarded by canonical authority or
religious sanction, with any degree of precision would be neither attempted
by the bards nor required of them. Whenever and wherever the text was then
written down— and it was probably written down independently in different
epodis and under different circumstances— these transimissicMis by word of
mouth must have contaminated the written text and introduced innupierable
variations in it. The assumption of some of such complicated derangemait,
beyond the normal vicissitudes of transmission, is necessary to account for
the abnormal discrepancies and strange vagaries of the Mahabharata manus-
cript tradition. In other words, we are compelled to assume that evm in its
early phases the Mahabharata textual tradition must have been not uniform
and simple, but multiple and polygenous.

Moreover, a study of the critical apparatus shows that diere has inter-
vened a long period in the history of the Mahabharata in which there was a
free comparison of manu^ipts and ext^ive mutual borrowings. A natural
and inevitable source of confusion of the tradition has always been the

marginalia, comprising glosstes, variae lecHones and additions. The copyist
of a manuscript with such accretions copied sometimes the original readings
and sometimes the marginal. It may be incidentally remarked that an exami-
nation of the marginalia shows that the variant readings are taken mostly from
manuscripts belonging to the same version, or at least the same recension.
But there is no reason, theoretical at any rate, why readings of the rival recen-
sion could not creep into a manuscript of the text by the medium, say, of
a popular commentary such as Nflakantha’s. And, as a matter of fact, we
do find, occasionally, readings of the opposite recension noted in the margins
of manuscripts. Under these circumstances it was inevitable that the true
reading, especially if it was a lectio difficilior or an archaism or a solecism,
would be partly suppressed, being preserved to us in one or two manuscripts
only.

Furthermore, the texts may be improved by a comparison of manusaipts
is not by any means a modem discovery. The process has been known and
practised for ages : £80} the difference is merely in our ideas of what is meant
by “improvement” of the text. I have cited above the instance of Nila-
katittha, who himself says that he had collected and compared Mahabharata
manuscripts from different parts of India in order to ascertain the “best”
readings. The other com'mentators also, Devabodha, Arjunamisra and Ratna-
garbha, cite pdtkdntaras and speak apapdtkas (“bad readings”). These
they could have got only from a comparison of different manuscripts.

The text favoured by the ancients apikar to have been of the inclusive,
rather than of the exclusive, type. This is proved in the case of Nilakaiutba
by a remark of his cited above, where, he naively admits that he had put
together the stanzas which had been commented on by the ancient Bh^ya-
karas, and others he had found in modem manuscripts, with the idea of
making a “ thesaurus of exoellenoes.” The remark does not apply by any
means exclusively to the Sanatsujata episode, to which it is appended, at any
rate as far as Nilakaiotha is concerned. In the Adi, we have abuiidant evi-
dence that he has borrowed, according to his fancy, passages, short and long,
from the Southern recension. The critical notes will show that his text in-
cludes a large number of Southern passages which are not found in any other
Northern version, such as, for example, the catalogue of forest trees, which
serves in a modest way for a description of the sylvan scenery amidst which
Uparicara Vasu finds himself :

taining some details which did not fit into his own text. This he has done,
be it noted, at the risk of making his text wholly unintelligible, without a word
of apology or explanation. Professor Winternitz, while criticizing Dahl-
MANN’S Dm Mahdbharata, has pointed out this incongruity^ : The story. . .
which relates how Mrghatamas is insulted by his wife Pradvesi, aiid how he
consequently establishes the fixed rule {maty add) that henceforth a woman
shall always have to adhere to one husband, whether he be alive or dead, and
that a woman who goes to another man shall go to hell, thus forbidding any
kind of remarriage of widows. . . .is strangely out of placed in a chapter treat-
ing of Niyoga.” As was pointed out above, in consequence of the intrusion
of this foreign matter, the first half of the stanza of the original text is sepa-
rated from the second half by 27 lines ! That in itself is, however, not a very
serious matter in Mahabhiarata textual tradition, where such transpositions
are a common occurrence. But in the present instance, this transfer has Jiad
the unexpected and undesirable result that the subject of the sentence, which
was left behind in the first half of the stanza, remains the end without its
predicate, which latter, being shunted off to such a remote distance, was
furnished with a new and entirely different subject ! The effect of this
arrangement on the original story may be easily imagined.

{81} Conflation is in general not so easy to detect and prove as in the case
of NSlakaiotha. We can date Nilakaiotha with fair accuracy. Again, Nila*
kahtha, who is one of the latest of our commentators, has himself vouchsafed
some information as to how he has prepared his text. We have no such re-
liable data in the case of the majority of the manuscripts or versions of our
critical apparatus.

Take, for instance, the case of the sub-group Gi. 2 . 4.6 of the Grantha ver-
sion. In opposition to other manuscripts belonging to the same recension and
even the same version, Gi. 2 . 4.5 contain, as shown above, an astonishingly large
number of passages which are found otherwise only in some inferior manus-
cripts of the Northern recension. Now is this a case of contamination of the
four MSS. Gi. 2 . 4.5 21 Northern source ; or are the common passages a

remnant of the lost archetype, which were somehow lost in the remaining
manuscripts of the Southern recension There is apparent agreement here
between independent versions. But is this agreement original ? The clumsy
interpolator of a remote ancestor of Gi. 2 . 4.5 happens to have supplied us
with the means of answering these questions. He has left behind, quite un-
intentionally, an impress of his ‘‘ finger-prints,” so to say, by which we can
emity and confidently trace him and examine his handiwork. The said manus-

cripts contain a Northern stanza (belonging to manuscripts of class y) — 3,
mere string of attributes of Garuda^ — ^wedged in at a place where it can be
construed neither with what precedes nor with what follows. This proves
incontrovertibly that these four manuscripts Gi. 2 . 4.6 have been compared with
some Northern manuscripts, and makes it highly probable that the other
doubtful stanzas, which they have in common with the Northern recension,
have crept into their text in the same surreptitious way. At least this is the
most plausible explanation of the anomaly. But even such confirmatory
evidence is not always available.

The reader need not be sceptical about the possibilities of such indiscri-
minate conflation and addition. The critical apparatus, if closely scrutinized
and properly understood, will reveal numerous instances of a similar charac-
ter. Even a close study of the Kumbhakonam edition, prepared in our own
times by two excellent Southern Pandits, will throw some light on the men-
tality of the old redactors of the Mahabharata : parallel and even contradic-
tory versions are placed quite unconcernedly side by side, regardless of the
effect on the reader, regardless of the fact that sentences are left hanging in
the air, -that passages do not construe. Here one notices above all the
anxiety that nothing that was by any chance found in the Mahabharata
manuscript should be lost. Everything was carefully preserved, assembled in
a picturesque disarray.

Another important fact that must be kept in view in dealing with these
interpolations is this. The older the borrowal and the more interesting the
passage borrowed, the wider will be the area over which it will spread in its
new habitat. It then becomes difficult to prove the borrowal.

Thus there is a certain group of passages which are found in all ver-
sions except ini Sj and K (that is, in the group v), for example, the Kaiqi-
kamti.^ In the particular case of the Kaaiikaniti, there appears to be sufficient
extrinsic and intrinsic evidence to make it [82} highly probable that the pas-
sage is spurious, and the corresponding agreement between some of the
(more or less) independent versions is unoriginal.

There are indeed yet more difficult cases, where the evidence pf€ et cmtra
of documentary and intrinsic probability is equally balanced, as far as we
can at present judge. In sudi cases we are forced to look for small things
which look suspicious and lead us to probabilities, not facts.

The problem is clearly not solved by formulating a priori a hypothesis as
to the interrelationship of the different versions and fix the text in terms of
some preconceived formula ; for instance, by assuming as absolutely inde-
pendent a certain number of these divergent versions, and laying down an
arithmetical rule that whatever is ccwnmon to two or more of such and such


1 App. I, No, 81,



104 PROLEGOMENA

versions nmst be original. In this method, we can easily deceive ourselves and
others ; for the results arrived at will s^ppeav sounder than in reality they
are. Even though the formal operations may be a piece of flawless logic,
nevertheless the results, being based on premises possibly unsound though
apparently clear and definite, may be wholly fictitious. The study of the
manuscripts themselves must first teach us what their interrelationship is.
And they unmistakably indicate that their interrelationship is of most com-
plex character. The critical apparatus is a veritable labyrinth of complicated
and intermingled versions, each with a long and intricate history of its own
behind it. We have unfortunately no single thread to guide us out of the
maze, but rather a collection of strands intertwined and entangled and lead-
ing along divergent paths. With the epic text as preserved in the extant
Mahabharata manuscripts, we stand, I am fully persuaded, at the wrong
end of a long chain of successive syntheses of divergent texts, carried out —
providentially — in a haphazard fashion, through centuries of diaskeuastic
activities ; and that t4/ith the possible’* exception of the ^aradd {Kasmn)
version, which appears to have been protected by its largely unintelligible
script and by the difficulties of access to the province, all versions are indis-
criminately conflated.

Now it goes without saying that the genetic method (operating with an
archetype and a stemma ccdium) cannot strictly be applied to fluid texts
and conflated manuscripts ; for, in their case, it is extremely difficult, if not
utterly impossible, to disentangle completely, by means of purely objective
criteria, their intricate mutual relationships. The documentary evidence is no
doubt supremely important, but the results, arrived at from a consideration
of the documentary probability, must be further tested in the light of intrinsic
probability. No part of the text can be considered really exempt from the
latter scrutiny, when we are dealing with a carelesdy guarded text such as
we have in the present instance. A careful study of the critical notes will
show — if, indeed, the foregoing remarks have not made it abundantly clear—
that all the problems which present themselves for solution in editing any
text from manuscripts are present in the case of the Mahabharata on a colos-
sal scale and in an intensified form. We must, therefore, clearly recognize
that a wholly certain and satisfactory restoration of the text to its pristine
form — even the so-called satasdhasn samhitd form — may be a task now be^
yond the powers of criticism.

CRITICL EDITIONS OF THE DIFFERENT VERSIONS

No doubt, in view of some of these difficulties, one schdar has sug-
gested that to expedite and facilitate the work, we should, as ai first step,
before any attempt is made {83} to constitute the final text of the Mahfi*
bharata, critically edit all the different versions.^ That, it must be said, is a


Cf. Lesny, Archiv Orienfdltd, vol. 5 (1933), p. 159,

105


rather tall order, as any one will admit, who has any practical experience of
editing the Mahiabhlarata in any shape or form, critical or otherwise. But
perhaps funds and workers — not to speak of patience — can be found to edit a
dozen or more lakhs of stanzas comprising the dozen or more versions of the
Great Epic.i There remains, however, yet another and a more fundamental
difficulty, which appears to have wholly escaped the attention of the learned
critic. The difficulty is that it is practically impossible to edit even a single
version of the Mahabharata — or for that matter of any other text — ^wholly
satisfactorily, without considering the entire evidence, that is, without, at the
same time, consulting the readings of all other versions. Suppose we examine
six manuscripts of a version (Grantha) in order to prepare a critical text of
that version. It may happen that four of them (Gi.2.4.5), which are con-
flated manuscripts, have a “secondary’’ reading, while only two (G^.c) have
the correct reading. In these circumstances, the true character of the variants
could never be inferred from the readings of this version (G) itself ; it would
be shown only by other versions (T or M or N). In fact, there is no way
of finding out whether any of the manuscripts of a particular version are
conflated (if they happen to be conflated) without consulting the other
versions. And, if for the editing of each of the indivual versions, we have
to scrutinize and weigh the entire evidaice, we might as well get busy with
the work of preparing the final text, assuming of course that a final (critical)
text has to be prepared.

That consideration apart, even if we assume, for the sake of argument,
that all the dozen or more versions lie before us in a critically edited shape,
our main task is not made any easier on that account. One has to go through
the same mental processes in picking out or reconstructing the correct read-
ings, whether, as at present, the variae lectiones are concentrated on a single
page of the critical edition or have to be searched in a dozen or more different
provincial editions, arranged round about the critic in a semi-circle. Prepar-
ing all these different editions would not by itself give us the correct readings.
Some of them, moreover, would but slightly differ from each other, for
instance, the editions of the Bengali arid the Devaniagari versions, and it
would mean useless duplication of labour. All that is really needed to facili-
tate our work is a critical edition of the Southern recension. An attempt
to supply that need is now being made by Professor P. P. S. Sastri in his
edition of the Mahiabharata, referred to already.

THE VULGATE AS BASE

Another high authority, while full of apparent admiration for the
way in which the work is being done at present at the Institute, has with
much pathos and eloquence deprecated this hastily pr^ared, eclectic text.
All that we need to do at present, according to this scholar, is to reprint the
Vulgate, giving merely the variae lectiones of the manuscripts collated an 4

PROLEGOMENA


leaving each individual reader to constitute his own text, unhampered and
uninfluenced by the obtrusive personality of some editor who stands like a
monitor between the reader and his author. The learned critic is evidently
of opinion that any average reader, who picks up an edition of the Great
Epic for casual study is better qualified to reconstruct the text than the editor
who has made a special study of the £84} problem ! That is a paradox
natural to the subtle mentality of the learned critic. But we need not take
it too seriously. Whatever the Average Reader might or might not be able
to do, I beg to submit that the Critical Reader, like the learned scholar whose
opinion I am quoting, would not be any the worse off, if he is put in posses-
sion of this “ Recension of Poona For, who and what is to prevent him
from constituting his own text from this critical edition ? Whoever makes the
text — even if Brhaspati himself were to come down and constitute the text —
the Critical Reader would undoubtedly reject it as it would surely not fit
in with his ideas of what is right and what is wrong. The Critical Reader
has the same freedom of action whether he has before him the critical
text or the Vulgate. The Vulgate, as far as I can judge, is no better suited
for serving as the base than the present text.

It may, however, be that the hesitation of the learned authority is
really due to a categorical rejection to interfering in so definite a manner with
the received text. Should that be the case, it is certainly difficult to appre-
ciate the veneration of this scholar for the form of a text which was made up,
probably, also in great haste but with inadequate and insufficient materials,
only in the last quarter of the seventeenth CKitury, that is, early about 250
years ago. It is surely illc^cal to assume that a text which has been Iniilt
up largely on unscientific ocmjecture is now beyond the reach of conjecture.

A simpler and more probable explanation still of the hesitating attitude
of the learned critic might perhaps be that his theoretical misgivings are
based on a rather hasty study of both the Vulgate and the critical text. For,
the text of the Vulgate is so corrupted and so obviously contaminated that it
would be a criminal neglect of his duty for any intelligent editor now to re-
print the Vulgate, when he has at hand the material to control its vagaries
and to correct its absurdities.

ONE SELECTED MANUSCRIPT AS BASE.

No doubt to remedy the inherent defects in the last method as also to
avoid the dreaded semhara of pramai^as, it has been suggested by other
scholars that the best course would be to select one manuscript, the best
mmiuscript extant (of any versitoi presumably) and print it, with minimal
change, correcting caily the obvious and indispensable clerical o-rors and add-
ing the variants of the collated manuscripts.* This expedient, though un-

questionably simple and “safe”, and in most cases indubitably effective,
fails totally in the present instance, for two reasons : firstly and chiefly,
owing to the negligible age of our manuscripts, which are barely five hundred
years old ; and, secondly, owing to the systematic conflation which has been
carried on through ages of revisional and amplificatory activity. By follow-
ing any manuscript — even the oldest and the best — ^we shall be authenticating
just that arbitrary mixture of versions which it is the express aim of this
method to avoid !

This ^ggestion, however, has special interest, because the principle
underlying it has now been, partly and timidly, put into practice by Profes-
sor P. P. S. Sastri, in preparing his edition of the Southern recension, whereas
the three foregoing methods are mere castles in the air of theoretical critics.

£85} A CRITIQUE OF PROFESSOR SASTRl’S METHOD

Professor Sastri’s edition is an excellent demonstration of the inade-
quacy of the underlying principle, which has been repeatedly advocated,
showing up its defects as nothing else could. What Professor Sastri set out
to do is (to quote his own words) : to print the text as it is in the original
patm-leaf, liberty being taken only to correct scriptorial blunders,^ to weigh the
different readings in the additional n^nuscripts and choose the more import-
ant ones [scil. readings] for being added to the text by way of footnotes
How difficult it is to carry this out verbatim in practice and at the same time
to present a half-way readable text may be realized when we see how Sastri
has had to doctor his text. A few examples may be added to elucidate the
point. To begin with, Sastri does not follow the parvan division, nor the
adhyfiya division, of his basic manuscript, adding and omitting colophons
arbitrarily, in ordet to reach some imaginary norm. Secondly; he adds an
adhyaya of 40 lines after his adhy. 164, which is not found in his manus-
cript ! Thirdly, he omits one whole adhyaya of 40 lines, after his adhy. 180,
where ali Southern manuscripts, without exception (including his own exem-
plar) have it, and is moreover unaccountably silent about the omission !
Fourthly, in one place (his adhy. 122) he has omitted fourteen lin^ of the
text of his manuscript and added instead thirteen lines which are not found
in any Southern manuscript Fifthly and lastly, in yet another place (his
adhy. 214) he has added an interpolation {updkhydna) of 114 lines of which
not a singk tine (as actually printed in Sastri’s edition) is to be found in
any of the six manuscripts utilized by him ! These are some of the' things
that an extremely orthodox Southern Pandit actually does when he sets out
with the avowed object of printing up a Southern manuscript as it is, correct-
ing only “ scriptorial blunders.'’ I will not here speak of a certain number

of spurious lines which appear to have crept insidiously into his text from
the Vulgate and whose existence even he probably does not suspect.^ The
changes mentioned first are of a different order : they have been made' by
Sastri consciously and intentionally.

Let me not be misunderstood. I do not blame Sastri in the least for
taking such liberties with his manuscript, which is a tolerably good manus-
cript (though probably not very old), but has its faults like any other manus-
cript. I myself have had to proceed similarly, only more thoroughly, more
systematically. Our methods are similar in practice, though not in theory ;
that is, in hh theory. Sastri’s text is eclectic (an epithet often used by critics
with a tinge of reproach, the? ground of which it is not easy to perceive) :
as eclectic as any other Mahdbhdrata text, printed or in manuscript, that I
have seen. I have adduced the above instances chiefly to show what correct-
ing merely “scriptorial blunders” in Mahiabharata textual criticism really
ends in.

Thus it will be seen that the method of printing a Mahabharata manus-
cript as it is, viewed as a rigid principle, is a deplorable failure. The lateness
of our manuscript material {86} and the peculiar conditions of transmission
of the epic are responsible for the defection. They force upon us an eclectic
but cautious utilization of all manuscript classes. Since all categories of
manuscripts have their strong points and weak points, each variant must be
judged on its own merits.

WHAT IS THEN POSSIBLE ?

The Mahabharata problem is a problem sui generis. It is useless to
think of reconstructing a fluid text in a literally original shape, on the basis
of an archetype and a sternum codicum. What is then possible? Our ob-
jective can only be to reconstruct the oldest form of the text which it is pos-
sible to reach, on the basis of the manuscript material available.'^ With that
end in view, we must examine as many manuscripts — and above all as many
classes of manuscripts — as possible, and group them into families. We must
try to ascertain and evaluate the tradition of each family, eschewing late and
worthless material. We may then consider the relation of these traditions
in regard to the variae lectiones, and the genuine and spurious parts of the
text. Beyond that, we have to content ourselves with selecting the readings
apparently the earliest and choosing that form of the text which commends
itself by its documentary probability and intrinsic merit, recording again most
carefully the variants, and the additions and omissions. A little critical re-

must be admitted that, when compared with the mass of the text these interpola-
tions ard really negligible.

maniement of the text need causd no alarm. For, as I have already observed,
it is hardly logical to assume that a text which is largely based on conjecture
is now beyond the reach of that principle. Of course there will always re-
main many doubts, but that consideration should not prevent us from cor-
recting those parts which can be corrected with confidence’ ; moreover, that
limitation applies to our comparatively well preserved classical texts, despite
the guarantee of the careful editings they have? undergone. However, owing
partly to the fluid character of the original and parly to the fragmentary and
inadequate information we possess as regards the origin, growth and trans-
mission of the text, it is incumbent on us to make Conservatism our watch-
word. We must abstain from effecting any change which is not in some
measure supported by manuscript authority.^

THE METHOD OF RECONSTRUCTION EXPLAINED

The method I have followed in reconstructing the text cannot, unfortu-
nately, be presented in the shape of short general rules. I shall endeavour,
however, to explain it as briefly as possible.

The’ main principle underlying all speculation as to authenticity is the
postulated originality of agreement between what may be proved to be {more
or less) independent £87} versions. The principle I have tried to follow reli-
giously — and I hope I have never deviated from it — is to accept as original a
reading or feature which is documented uniformly by all manuscripts alike
(N=S).

For instance, we frequently come across three-linedl stanzas, one of whose
lines is an “ inorganic line ”, that is, a line which can be added or omitted
without detriment to sense or grammar. These seemingly superfluous lines,
if proved by both recensions, have not been deleted ; they have been kept
scrupulously intact. A more important instance is of the initial adhyayas
of this parvan. The connection betweai adhy. 1-3 and what follows, as also
the connection between the three adhyayas inter 5e, is of most loose character.
There is further the suspicious circumstance that adhy. 4 begins precisely in
the same way as adhy. 1 ; both adhyayas have in fact the identical opening
(prose) sentence :

^ Few scholars, I imagine, would endorse the view of Pandit Vidhushekhara
Bhattacharya {Modem Review, Calcutta, for August 1928, page 176), that the
first prose sentence of our Mahabharata etc.), though found
in mss. without exception, diould be deleted from the Criticil Edition, because
it is intrmsioaUy inappropriate in the context. He writes : " They Iscfl
those lines] are to be found in dll the different versions of which MSS. are
collated for the present edition, though with some variant readings, but can we be
satisfied only with this ground as to their being genuine ** ? That is a little too
radical ! This edition cannot and should not proceed so far.



no


PROLEGOMENA


In Other words, adhy. 4 begins as though nothing had gone before ! The prose
sojtence seems to fit better the context of adhy. 4 than the context of adhy. 1 ;
but that is not material to my argument. It would have been possible to
athetize the first three adhyayas in order to remove this anomaly, relegating
them to the Appendix. But as all the four adhyayas are handed down in
exactly the same form (with the usual amount of variants) in all manuscripts
of both recensions, they were left perfectly intact. Here we have an old con-
flation of two different beginnings. They were not harmwiious in juxtaposi-
tion, but each was too good to lose, in the opinion of the ancient redactors.
They therefore put both in, making but a poor compromise.*

Another passage that may be thought to need some radical treatment is
the account of the cremation of PSindu and Madri. We are first told that the
king died in the forest, and Madri mounted the funeral pyre and was burned
with him (1. 116. 31). After this we read that their “bodies” {dartre) are
brou^ to the capital of the Kurus (1. 117. 30), and an elaborate royal
funeral takes place. In the account given in the following adhyaya (118),
from the description of the annointing and dressing of the king’s body, and
from Ihe remark that the king Icoked as if he were alive (1. 118. 20) ;

it is clear that no former burning is imagined. After PSijdu had been burned
with his favourite queen J/Edri on the funeral pyre, there could not have
been (as Hopkins* has justly pointed out) much corpse left or not enough
to dreSs and smear with sandal paste ! But the manuscripts do not render
us any hdp here. The passage is handed down in identical form in all manus-
cripts of both recensions.

The above examples will show that the diaskeuasts did not always em-
ploy any great art — ^I may add, fortunately — in conflating two discrepant ac-
counts of an incident, which is by no means an easy task. To resolve such
anomalies, however, is beyond the scope of this edition, since the entire
manuscript evidence unanimously supports the conflation, which is too old
and deep-rooted to be treatal by the ordinary principles of t^ual criticism.
If we wdit about, at this stage of our work, athetizing such passages as were
self-contradictory or as contradicted the data of some otho: part of the epic,
there would not be much left of the MaMbhSrata to edit in the end.

critical notes ; of these about {91} thirty have no variants at all, while the
remaining (seventy) show only insi^ificant variants, such as transposition,
substituticm of synonyms, and so on. The number of the latter daiss of
stanzas could naturally be easily augmented, by increasing the latitude of
permissible variation. Being handed down uniformly in all manuscripts
alike, they may be regarded as authentic (as least as far as manuscript evi-
dence goes), forming so to say, pieces of firm bedrock in the shifting quick-
sands of Mahabharata poetry. As such they will be valuable for the study
of epic style, dicticm, vocabulary and so on.

To return to the question of text reconstruction. The rule arising out of
the agreement between independent recensions or versions is easy to compre-
hend and simple to api^y ; only its sphere of operation is rather restricted.
Difficulties arise when there is fluctuation ; and that is the normal state.
When there was ffuctuatbn, the choice fell, as a corollary of the previous
rule, upon a reading which is documented by the largest number of '{what
prima facie afiirear to be) or less independemt versions, and which is

The presumption of originality in these cases is frequently confirmed by a
lack of definite agreem^t between the discrepant versions. The commonest
application of this rule is when iSi K or B (with or without D) agree with
S against their own agnates. Numerous examples of this type of agreement
have been adduced above (pp. liv, lxii).

Occasionally we get “ double ” agreement, that is, agreement between two
or more groups of each recension (N^ = and Nj = Sj) ; for example, when
( 1 ) Si K = M, and simultaneously B = TG,

or (2) Si K = TG, and simultaneously B = M.

Here one, of the agreements must, generally speaking, be accidental, since
both can hardly be original ; and either may be ad(q>ted, if th^y have equal
intrinsic merit. Owing to the much greater correctness and reliaWlity of Si
K, I have, as a rule, adopted the readings of this group, other things being
equal.

When the two recensions have alternate readings neither of which can
have come from the other and which have equal intrinsic merit (N : S), I
have, for the sake of consistency and with a view to avoiding unnecessary
and indiscriminate fusion of versions, adopted, as a stop-gap, the reading
of N. This rule is of very common application, since one constantly comes
across readings which are but paraphrases of each other and between which
it is impossible to discriminate. Examples of such alternative readings are :

When the above tests break down or when they give only a negative
result, the expedient adopted by me was to find a reading which best explans
how the other readings may have arisen. The true reading in this case has
often proved to be a lectio diffeilior, or an archaism or a solecism, the desire
to eliminate them being the cause of the variation. Here follow some
examples of variation due to the lectio difficUior :

EMENDATION

Emoidatkxi has played a very incwi^icuous rSle in the preparation of
the constituted text. Interpretation has in general been given preference over
emendation. Even in the case of corrupt passages, the reading of some
manuscript or other gives sense, though it may not be the original sense, not
even a wholly satisfactory sense. Precipitate emendation is, however, to 1^
d^recated ; for experience has shown that but a small pri^rtion of sdiolars’
correctkms are really amendments. Moreover, in this special case, we know,
as yet, too little about the epic idiom and the epic world altogether ; as also
about the vicissitudes of the Q>ic text Besides, who can say that the original
was linguistically uniform, .and ccxiformed to any particular norm ? What

would be the style of a work which in the main is obviously a compilation ?

The text, as it has been fixed by me, contains about 35 emendations.
The corrections are generally very slight, being concerned mostly with single
isolated words, never with whole passages. Wherever even a single letter has
been added, omitted or altered, without the authority of any of the manus-
cripts, I have inserted an asterisk (*) in the text.

Only in very few instances do the emendations effected in this edition
make any difference to the sense , e. g. 1. 41. 5 nHss , where the

word ( an has been [93 ] added to the pMa, a word found only in D 2 ; the
other readings are :

( hypermetric ! ), seven combinations, each having a

different syllable between ^ and ! In a few cases the emendation affects
merely some grammatical form of the stanza in question; e. g. 1. 86 . 5
where the readings for are

( corruption of last ? ), ^ ( hypermetric 1 ).

But tiie large majority of our emendations concern merely metre and
sandhi My study of the manuscript material led nnte to the conclusion that
there was an ever growing antipathy, firstly, to hypermetric padas, in fact to
any form of metrical irregularity ; and, secondly, to forms of sandhi not
sanctioned or countenanced by Pmiini's great grammar. In particular, there
is noticeable a strong aversion to hiatus, evett where it wm permitted by rules
of grammaf. Hiatus between padas also came to be disapproved and was
removed by such expedients as that of adding a meaningless g or ^
at the beginning of the posterior pada.

Manuscripts betray the surreptitious efforts of the scribes and redactors
to eliminate hiatus ( sometimes even when it is grammatically permissible )

It is important to remember that emendation has been resorted to merely
for the purpose of unifying divergent and conflicting manuscript evidence,
never in opposition to clear and unanimous testimony of manuscripts. The
emendations are thus not amendments of the text in the ordinary sense of the
word, made in order to eke out a better sense when the manuscripts yield no
sense or an unsatisfactory sense ; they are rather an effort to find, so to say,
a hypothetical focus towards which the discrepant readings converge.

THE ** ADDITIONAL '' PASSAGES

The uniformity of the interrelationship of the different manuscripts, ver-
sions or recensions, as has been already explained, is disturbed chiefly by
comparison and conflation of manuscripts. A constant and fruitful source
of confusion, as was pointed out above, has always been the marginalia.
A more dangerous and troublesome source was the practice of incorporating
into one’s text — ^without stating the source and without much explanatory
comment— passages found in other versions. It may be surmised that cele-
brated places of pilgrimage like Ujjayini,^ Ramesvaram, Kia^I, and others,
with recitations of the epics held periodically in their famous shrines, have
played an important role in the dissemination of the knowledge of local ver-
sions among the pious visiting pilgrims, whose number undoubtedly included
the bards and the professional reciters of the epics.

{95} Much light is thrown on the origin of these misch-codices by the
MS. K 4 , a manuscript belonging to the Bombay Government Collection depo-
sited at the Institute. In this manuscript we find long extracts from other
cognate versions (such as y) as also from the Southern recension, written out
on separate folios and inserted at appropriate places in the body of the ma-
nuscript, with the words written on the margin of the original

1 Baija’s Kddamban (ed. Peterson, p. 61) refers to a recitation of the Mbh.

folio, near the place where the passage is to be interpolated. Should this
manuscript happen to be copied again and should the copyist insert the
passage at the place indicated by the previous scribe, the interpolation would
become an integral part of thei new text which is exti/erwlly ^xbsolutely indis-
tinguiskable from the rest of the text.

This! leads us to the question of additional passages in general. Our
attitude with regard to them is quite clear, in my opinion. The first and
foremost source of our knowledge as to what the Mahabhiarata comprises, is
and must remain the manuscript evidaice itself. For example, the question
—which seems to trouble a great many people, judging by the inquiries on
the point received at the Institute — whether the Uttara^ta, Gajendramok§a
and Anusmrti are parts of the Mahiabharata, must be answered by the
manuscripts themselves. If none of our manuscripts contain these passages,
it is prima facie evidence that they are not parts of the Mahabharata. There is
nothing to suggest that our Mahabharata manuscripts have suffered any
serious loss at any time. There never was any lack of manuscripts, many of
which were preserved carefully in temples, and which must have been copied
repeatedly, for the enhancement of merit. There is no evidence of any break
in the tradition at any time or any place, within the confines of India at
least. The probable inference is that cur manuscripts contain all that was
there originally to hand down, and tnore. What late writers and commenta-
tors have said about passages not found in our manuscripts is always a mat-
ter of secondary importance ; it cannot ipso facto nullify or override the pri-
mary evidence of manuscripts. Such extrinsic testimony has only local or
personal value ; it can always be rebutted by the evidence of the Mahabhiarata
manuscripts.

Likewise, whether an episode, adhyaya, passage, stanza or line may be
regarded as belonging to the Mahabharata or not must primarily depend up-
on whether the manuscripts contain it. Extrinsic evidence, in so far as it is
valid, will principally hold good only for the period or locality to which it be-
longs. Intrinsic evidence may be considered ; but, being of a subjective cha-
racter, it must be used with caution. Our primary evideince being the ma-
nuscripts themselves, we are bound to view with suspicion, as a matter of
principle, any part of the text which is found only in one recension, or only
in a portion of our critical apparatus. Therefore, the evidence for such pas-
sages as are contained only in one manuscript, or a small group of manus-
cripts or versions, or even in a whole recension must be pronounced to be
defective. Consequently, all lines belonging to one recension only, and a
fortiori such as pertain to a combination of manuscripts amounting to less
than a recension, for which there is nothing corresponding in the other recen-
sion and which are not absolutely necessary for the context — all linesj, in
short, with a defective title— have been placed in the footnotes or tho Appen-
dix, pending further inquiry regarding their credentials.

Such passages are not all necessarily spurious. There might be a hun-
dred good reasons why the questionable passages are missing in a particular
recension or version. It Might conceivably be, for instance, that the shorter
recension represents (as certain {96} scholar has said) “a mutilated and
hastily put together compositicMi of the Middle Indian Redactors, who could
not lay their hands on all manuscripts of the Mahiabhiarata The shorter
version might again be, theoretically, a consciously abridged or expurgated
version. Or, more simply, the omission might be due to mere oversight of
some scribe who had quite unintentionally omitted the defaulting passage and
this mistake of the first scribe had been perpetuated by the other copyists.
And so on and so forth. But all these are mere possibilities. All these reasons
in general and particular must be adduced and proved, or at least made pro-
bable, in any given case. Moreover, the manuscripts clearly show that there
has been in progress, through centuries, constant comparison of manuscripts.
In view of this circumstance, the explanation that the omission of a passage
in la whole version might be due to a scribe’s omission loses much of its force.
Omission is as much a fact in Mahdbhdrata textual tradition as addition.
And it is( fair to demand of a person who alleges the authenticity of such
one-recension passages why the rival recension does not contain it.^

The general condemnation of a recension or version that it is mutilated,
merely on the ground that it lacks certain passages that are found in a rival
recension or version, is entirely meaningless ; for the argument might easily
be reversed, so that the controversy will resolve merely into mutual vitupe-
ration. What I mean is this. From the fact that one of the recensions, say
N, does not contain a certain passage or a certain set of passages found in
another, say S, it is illogical to argue that N is a mutilated version ; because
such an argument can with equal cogency be applied to S, in regard to certain
other passages that are missing in S but found in N. The ix)int isi so im-
portant and at the same time so difficult to grasp that I shall endeavour to
make my meaning clearer with the help of a concrete illustration. My con-
tention is this. From the fact that the Southern recension contains, say, the
Nalayani episode (App. I, No. lOD), which is mining in the Northern re-
cension, it would be illogical to argue that the Northern recension is defective

or "mutilated ; because one can, with equal cogency, seek to establish the muti-
lation or defection of the Southern recension by pointing, say, to the Gatije§a
passage, which is found only in certain Northern manuscripts and is entirely
missing in the Southern manuscripts. The argument could have been em-
ployed with greater semblance of reason and plausibility, had there been only
a "mere plus or minus on either side, but is entirely without cogency in the
present instance where there are both additions and omissions on both sides.

{97} Originality and authenticity are, unfortunately, not the prerogative
of any single recension or version or manuscript.^ They must be established,
laboriously, chapter by chapter, line by line, word by word, syllable by syll-
able.2 The optimistic view that any extant manuscript, however old and
trustworthy, of some favoured version or recension, could give us, with a
few additions and alterations, the text of Vyiasa*s Bharata or Mahabharata
is the index of a naive mentality and does! not need any elaborate refutation.

The argumant in favour of any particular recension or version or text
is frequently sought to be strengthened by a reference to the authority of the
Parvasalmgraha (Adi 2), a week reed on which every tyro leans rather heavi-
ly in the beginning, and it would be well to examine the argument here.

THE PARVASAMGRAHA ARGUMENT

Until lately high hopes had been entertained that the Parvasalmgraha-
parvan (Adi 2) would supply the clue to the solution of the perplexing ques-
tion of the reconstruction of the original Mahabharata. But the paradoxical
situation created by the circumstance that two different editors of the Virafa-
parvan, both of whom rely mainly on the data of the Parvasalmgraha for es-
tablishing the originality and authenticity of their respective texts, have pro-
duced critical editions of that palrvan which differ by no less than 1467
stanzas;^ has created grave misgivings in the minds of unbiassed critics as to
whether the Parvasalmgraha can render us any help at all in reconstructing the
text of the Mahabharata, and these misgivings appear justified by the facts
of the case.

The exaggerated importance which the late Mr. Utgikar was inclined to
attach to the numerical data of the Parvasatrhgraha, was, I believe, mainly,
if not wholly, due to his mistaken belief that there was complete agreement
between the two rival recensions in all material particulars as r^ards the
text of this adhyaya. This erroneous and wholly unfounded notion seems to

^ LuM3?s, op. ck. p. 43, justly asks : Wenn aber die Grantha-recension Zu-
satze erfuhr, warum sollen wir denn annehmen, dass die Nagari-recen^on von ihnen

have been induced by the ambiguous and thoroughly misleading character of
the text of the Khumbhakonam edition, which claims to be an edition “mainly
based on South Indian texts ”, but presents a version of this adhyaya which
has been unblushingly copied from the Bombay and Calcutta editions, ignor-
ing wholly the Southern divergences, which are quite considerable.

Not only are there discrepancies between the two recensions as regards
the numbers of the adhyayas and the slokas in the various parvans, there is no
complete agreement even between the different versions of the same recen-
sion. Take, for instance, the case of the Adiparvan itself. Our constituted
text (following the iS^rada codex) gives (1. 2. 96) the number of ^okas in
the Adi as 7884. But this is not the only reading of that number. For the
digit representing the thousands alone, the choice lies between seven, eight,
nine and ten ! There can, therefore, be no doubt that the text of this adh-
yaya also has been tampered with and designedly altered, from time to time
in various {98} ways, in order to make it harmonize with the inflated version
of a later epoch. It will thus have to be admitted that the parvasarhgraha
argument is of secondary importance and must not be pressed too far.

Be that as it ma!y, it is extremely problematic whether we could make
any use whatsoever of the Parvasaimgraha enumeration of Slokas in the case
of the Adi at leasts because it will be difficult to compute the extent of this
parvan and that for two reasons. Firstly, because this parvan, as is well
known, contains two lengthy prose adhyayas (3 and 90). Taking the figure
of the Parvasairhgraha to represent the exact extent of the whale of the Adi,
it is not clear how the prose portions were computed by the compilers of the
Parvasairhgraha. Most of the modem computers add the numbers of stmzas
to the number of their respective prose sections, and arrive at the length of
the Adi in slokas ! But this is bad arithmetic. P. P. S. Sastri offers a solu-
tion which is more ingenious than convincing. He holds the compiler of the
Parvasaimgraha down to the letter of his statement. The Parvasarhgraha
tells us, says Sastri, merely the number of slokas which the different parvans
contain. Nothing is said about the prose sections. He therefore ignores the
prose adhyayas in computing the extent of the Adi, and is satisfied that his
text exactly agrees with the data of the Parvasamgraha !

The other difficulty in the way of using the Parvasaimgraha figure in
the case of the Adi is that this parvan contains a large number of Tri^tubh
stanzas, which again introduce an element of uncertainty in the computation.
Was each Tri§tubh stanza counted as one sloka ; or did the Bharata-cintakas
(mentioned in 1. 2. 172) compute the exact equivalent of the long-metre
stanzas in Slokas ? It is difficult to say. The difference in the reckoning will
be, however, between 40 and 50 per cent, of the total ! As a very rough esti-
mate, the Adi may contain something like 5(X) long-metre stanzasL This fac-
tor alone would introduce a difference of about 225 stanzas !



124


PROI^GOMENA


These are some of the obvious difficulties in the way of making any prac-
tical use of the figure recorded in the Parvasarhgraha for text-critical purposes.
The computation ujay have some value in the case of a parvan in which
there is no prose at ail, which is almost wholly in anustubh metre, and for
which finally the Parvasaimgraha figure is certain, the manuscript evidence
being unanimous.

It is quite within the range of probability that the apparent extent of
the critical text of a parvan may fall appreciably below or rise appreciably
above the figure recorded in the Parvasalriigraha, as is actually the case with
other editions. Moreover, unless it can be made probable that the compi-
lation of this “ Table of Contents '' is nearly contemporaneous with tlie pre-
sent redaction of the Great Epic, these discrepancies will be without much co-
gency in matters relating to the constitution of the text. The value of a
manuscript}, version, oil printed text of the! Mahabhiarata must not
be thought to depend exclusively or even mainly upon its algreement with or
discrepancy from the numerical data of the Parvasalriigraha. It must in final
analysis be regarded as depending upon the place it occupies in a logical and
convincing scheme formulated to explain the evolution of the different extant
versions and types of Mahabharata manuscripts.

It should further be carefully borne in mind that even if there be exact
agreement as to extent between the Parvasalriigraha and any constituted text,
this fact alorie is no guarantee of the absolute correctness of the entire text,
line for line, because the samel £99} number of stanzas could be made up in
innumerable different ways by accepting and rejecting stanzas of doubtful au-
thenticity and uncertain documentation, of which there is always a plentiful
supply in every parvan. The difficulty will finally not be solved even if we
happen to light upon a unique manuscript which agrees with the Parvasarii-
graha exactly as to the number of stanzas in any particular parvan and we
should adopt its verbcUim ; because there is every probability that while
it satisfies the one criterion of extent given by the Parvasarhgraha, it may not
satisfy, in every respect, other and more exacting critical tests, when compar-
ed line by line and word by word with other extant manuscripts.

In the above discussion I have implicitly assumed, as is done by most
writers on the subject, that the word sloka in the Parvasariigraha chapter has
the usual meaning “ stanza This interpretation was called into question,
by the late Mahamahopadhyaya Haraprasad Shastri, who offered a new in-
terpretation, which I cannot but think is far more plausible, although I do
not agree with all the conclu^ons he deduces therefrom.

The really valuable discovery of the Mahamahopadhyaya, in my opi-
nion, is that the word ilcka cannot mean here stanza or verse of anything of
the kind, but must denote (as in the parlance of scribes and vendors of ma-
nuscripts) a unit of, meamemmt af written matter, comprising 32 syllaWes

of ak§aras.^ The difficulty of computing prose passages and the l<mg-metre-
stanzas mentioned above finds a satisfactory sdution at once in this interpre-
tation of the word “41oka”. And that is moreover the only interpretation
of the word which, as far as I can see, can successfully solve that difficulty,
in view of the circumstance that the text is heterogeneous, consisting of §lo-
kas, prose, and Icmg-metre stanzas. But in this supposition we shall have to
count, not only the actual text (consisting of prose and verse), but the whole
of the written matter. And that enumeration, whether it be 7884, 8884,
9884 or 9^4, will include not only the text properly so called but also the
colophons and the hundreds of the prose formulaic references (like

) besides perhaps the captions of adhyayas, sub-parvans and parvans,
and even the numerical figures denoting the numbers of 41(4ras, and so on.

The number of adhyayas in our editirm (225) does not tally with the

number given in the Parvasaimgraha (218), any more than in any of the

previous editions : the Calcutta edition of the Adi has 234 adhySyas, the

Bombay editions vary between 234 and 236, while the Kumbhakonam edi-

tion reaches the astcxiishing figure 260, though the Parvasarhgraha figure in
the case 'if each of these latter editions is the same, 227.

It may be pointed out that the adhyaya division in our extant manus-
cripts is extremely arbitrary. The average length of our adhyayas should be
about 35 stanzas ; but adhy. 12 and 22 of our edition contain only 5 stan-
zas each, while adhy. 57 (to mention only one instance) has over 100 stan-
zas. As regards the contents of the adhyayas also there is mudi inomsist-
ency. Thus we frequently find that one adhyaya ends with the remark that
a certain person spoke as follows, and his speech, which may be quite short,
forms the beginning of the following adhyaya. Then again the manuscripts
are far from being unanimous in the matter of marking the coloiffions :
they show in fact wild £100} fiuctuaticms. Even the reading of the Parva-
saihgraha figure is not entirely free from doubt (e.g. our Saradfi cod^ gives
the number of the adhySyas as 230 !), though the reading 218 seems highly
probaUe.

Under these circumstances, nothing would be easier than to manipulate
the colophons, by arbitrarily combining the conflicting data of the different
recensions or versions or even manuscripts and arriving at my required
figure. This has actually bear done by Professor P. P. S. Sastri in his
edition of the Southern Recension, which thereby adrieves the dubious dis-
tinction of being the only edition of the Adiparvan in which the adhyaya
number agrees exactly with the Parvasaimgraha figure but the colophons are
mostly at the wrong places. This procedure is the less excusable in his case

as he is at great pains to create the impression that he is just reprodudng
the text of one selected manuscript, correcting only “ scriptorial ” blunders.
Now his basic manuscript (i '= our G«) divides the Adi into two separate
major parvans, Adiparvan and Sanhbhavaparvan, with 40 and 200 num-
bered adhySyas respectively,' which makes a total of 240 adhyayas, and which
is nearer the Kumbhakonam figure (260) than the Parvasaihgraha figure
(218). While correcting “scriptorial blunders”. Professor Sastri has, so to
say, spirited away 22 colophons before our very eyes

A more careful study of the manuscript evidence may tend to reduce
the discrepancy between the constituted text and the data of the Parvasaih-
graha as regards the number of the adhyayas, or at any rate may enable us
to account for the difference, though at present it seems impossible to har-
monize the manuscript evidence (consisting of the actual colophrms) with
the Parvasamgraha.


INTERPOLATION

There has been an extraordinary reluctance among schc4ars to face the
fact that the Mahabharata manuscripts may contain and do contain quanti-
ties of spurious matter. But there is now no excuse for such recalcitrance.
The critical apparatus of this edition contains a unique record of hundreds
of lines which are evidently and unquestionably spurious. Here is a list of
passages from our Appendix, each found in one manuscript only : App. I,
No. 2 (in Kg marg. : containing 4 lines); No. 4 (Kj : 14 lines); No. 5
(B* : 23 lines) ; No. 7 (Gi : 4 lines) ; No. 16 (K^ : 9 lines) ; No. 25 (D^ : 4
lines) ; No. 26 (B^ : 6 lines) ; No. 31 (K 4 : 27 lines) ; No. 34 (K 4 : 6
lines) ; No. 44 (Dj : 24 lines) ; No. 49-50 Da^ : 21 lines) ; No. 66 (D« :
47 lines) : No. 70 (Gi : 8 lines) ; No. 74 (B^ : 9 lines) ; No. 94 (D^ : 31
lines) ; No. 98 (D^ : 50 lines) ; etc., etc. These are passages from the Ap-
pendix alone, to which many of them have been relegated on account of either
their, length or their irrelevancy ; but the foot-notes contain hundreds, nay
thousands, of lines of precisely the same character. Then there are also lines
whidi are found in <Hily two or three manuscripts, of which I have counted
some 300 instances. A number of new additions have been now given by
Professor Sastri, who has examined other Telugu and Grantha manuscripts
for his editicm of the Adi in the Southern recension. And I am fully persuad-
ed that if we examine yet other manuscripts, we diall still find fresh passages
which had never been seen or heard of before. No sane person would main-
tain that these are all original passages lost in all manuscripts except the few
late and inferior manuscripts in which they happen to occur.

{ 101 } It is not always easy, as has already been remarked, to prove
that these “ additional ” passages are interpolations. The epic metre is easy
to imitate ; the epk grammar is flexible ; the epic style is nondescript. The
additional lines are generally fashioned with skill, and fitted in with curaflng.

An interesting instance of a passage which is betrayed by its contents is
an extravaganza in some Grantha manuscripts. This bizarre interpolation^
describes among other things, with circumstantial detail, the marriage of Pa-
rasara and Satyavati (alias Matsyagandha). At this ceremony, the shades
of the ancestors of both the bride and the bridegroom are invoked, all the de-
tails of a r^lar Hindu marital rite are minutely observed, and the marriage
is solemnized in the presence of Vasi§tha, Yajnavalkya and other great R§is
living in the Naimi§a forest, with the distribution of baksheesh to Brahmins.
It is an interesting speculation whether credulity can go so far as to regard
e\’en such passages as an authentic part of the original Mahabharata or Bha-
rata of Vyiasa, just because the passage is found in some MahabhSrata
manuscripts.

The foot-notes contain a rare selection of passages that are either palpab-
ly absurd, sometimes ccmtradicting the immediate context, or else have little
connection with the ccmtext in which they lie embedded : quotations, glosses,
fanciful additions of details, the jetsam and flotsam of Mahabharata poesie.

These bewildering fluctuations in the text are quite unique, being pecu-
liar to the Mahabharata. TTiey are not found in the manuscripts of the Vedic
literature or in those of grammatical, philosophical, or rhetorical texts or of
the works of the classical poets and dramatists. This only proves that the
Mahabharata was peculiarly liable to inflation and elaboration.

When I say that the MaMbharata manusaipts contain quantities of
spurious additional, I intend no disparagement or condemnation of the text
or of the manuscripts. The process is normal, inevitable and in a wider sense
wholly right. If the epic is to continue to tie a ^ital force in the life of any
progressive people, it tmist be a slow-changing hook ! The fact of expurga-

tion and elaboration is ony an outward indication of its being a book of inspi-
ration and guidance in life, and not merely a book lying unused and forgotten
on a dusty book-shelf. Those are probably just the touches that have saved
the Mahabharata from the fate of being consigned to the. limbo of oblivion,
which has befallen its sister epics like the Gilgamesh.

£102} To give only one illustration. The awkwardness of the sexual
relations of some of those epic characters of bygone ages must have been in-
deed a puzzle and a source of constant tribulation to the reciter of the epics
(IPauraipika) , who was called upon to narrate, explain and justify those old-
world stories to his devout and impressionable audiences, in the course of his
recitations, which were, in the post-epic period, nothing more than edifying
popular sermons. It is then no wonder that the shrewd ones among these pas-
tors of the people, these professicKial keepers of their morals, should have oc-
casionally taken the bull by the horn, so to say, and boldly added or subs-
tituted, bona fide, details which harmonized better with their own conceptions
of right and wrong or with those of their pious flock.

A PROBLEM IN “TEXTUAL DYNAMICS”

After what has been said above, it is needless to add that the constituted
text is based on all versions of both recensicms and prepared on eclectic prin-
ciples. I have given in the text whatever in each case appeared to be support-
ed by the balance of probabilities, but all important deviations in the manus-
cripts are noted in the critical ai^ratus, so that every reader has, at his dis-
posal, the entire material for controlling and correcting the constituted text,
where necessary. All important elements of the text — lines, phrases, signi-
ficant words and even word-parts^— that are less than certain, are indicated by
a wavy line printed below them. Sli^t differences in the spellings of words,
of pro^r names (e.g. ) and some minor details (such as the ex-
pletives or the prose formulae ^ are ignored for this

purpose. This device is, by nature, hard to apply strictly, and there are
bound to be many inconsistencies in its application. I have retained it all
the same with the express object of obviating all false sense of security. This
wavy line, running through the entire length of the text is, to my mind, the
symbol and constant remembrancer of this essential fact in MahabhSrata
textual criticism that the MaMbharata is not and never was a fixed rigid teM,
but is fluctuating q>ic tradition, a theme mec variations, not unlike a popular
Indian melody. Our objective ^ould consequently not to be to arrive at an
archetype (which practically never existed), but to represent, view and explain
the epic tradition in all its variety, in all its fullness, in all its ramifications.
Ours is a problem in textual dynamics, rather than in textual statics.

To put it in other woras, the Mahabharata is the whde of the q>ic tra-
dition : the entire Critical Apparatus. Its separation into the constituted text
and the critical notes is only a static representation of a constantly dianging

epic text — a representaticti made for purpose of visualizing, studying and ana-
lyzing the panorama of the more grand and less grand thought-movetnents
that have crystallized in the shape of the texts handed down to us in our
Mahabharata manuscripts.

WHAT IS THE CONSTITUTED TEXT?

To prevent misconception in the mind of the casual reader, it is best to
state at first what the constituted text is not.^ The editor is firmly convinced
that the text {103} presented in this edition is not anything like the auto-
graph copy of the work of its mythical author, Maharsi Vyasa. It is not, in
any sense, a reconstruction of the Ur-Mahabharata or of the Ur-Bharata, that
ideal but impossible desideratum. It is also not an exact replica of the poem
recited by Vaisairhpayana before Janamejaya. It is further wholly uncertain
how close it approaches the text of the ix)em said to be recited by the Suta
(or Sauti) before iSaunaka and the other dwellers of the Naimisa forest.

It is but a modest attempt to present a version oj the epic as old as the
extant mmuscript 7mieriai will permit us to reach with some semblance of
confidence. It is, in all probability, not the best text of the Great Epic, pos-
sible or existing, nor necessarily even a good one. It only claims to be the
most ancient one according to the direct line of transmission, purer than the
others in ^ far as it is free from the obvious errors of copying and spurious
additions. It may be regarded, if the editor has done his work properly, the
ancestor of all extant manuscripts, or, to be precise, of the manuscripts exa-
mined and collated for this edition. The constituted text cannot be accurate-
ly dated, nor labelled as pertaining to any particular place or personality.
Since our manuscripts are comparatively modern, our text cannot claim to be
very cld. It goes without saying that (precisely like every other edition) it
is a mosaic of old and new matter. Thait is to say, in an average adhyaya
of this edition (as of any other edition) we my read a stanza of the second
century B.c. followed by one written in the second century a.d. Sometimes
the gap will occur in the middle of a line, precisely a's in every other edition.
This unevenness and these inequalities are inevitable, conditioned as they are
by the very nature of the text and the tradition.

^ The Vulgate text of the Mahabharata is fairly readable and will appear
in places, at first sight, to be even “ better ” than the critical text, because the

^ Thus Professor Sastri (Southern Recension, Vol. I, Introduction, p. xiii)
writes about this edition : “Whilst the Poona edition lays claim, to constitute tlie
text of the Mahabharata as closely as {103} possible W Vydsai'^^ version of the
same, the principle underlying this edition ” etc. Even Professor Sylvain L^:vi, in
a revieM of this edition (//I. ‘Oct. — ^Dec. 1929, p. 347) wrote : “Si j’osais me per-
mettre une suggestion dans ce domaine, je conseillerais a I’editeur de renoncer, par
piti^. pour nous, a la part meme du; travail qui lui tient le pius' a coeur et qui apporte
k son esprit le plus de satisfaction, la v 0 construcHon de VUr-Mahdbhdrata** comme

former has been purged by the cQntinuous emendations of scholars for cem
turies. A whole army of anonymous scholars aind poets must have worked
at the text to make it smooth and easy of comprehension, and to increase its
popularity and usefulness by adding to it interesting anecdotes, incoirporating
into it current and popular versions and explanations, bringing it in a line with
the ethical, moral, religious and political ideas of essentially different ages.

The reader will find that the cc«istituted text is by no means smooth. It
contains fresh instances of loose and archaic linguistic forms and construc-
tions, anacoluthons and lack of syntactical concord. There remain many
contradictions and superfluities There is evident lack of finish in the hidden
parts. These blemishes — if they be blemishes in epic poetry, which is dyna-
mic poetry, with no necessary pretensions to niceties of style, in the narrower
sense of the term — must have been inherent in the old poem. Where they
are met with in the critical text, they are not speculative fiction ; they are do-
cumented by the manuscripts themselves or at least are inferable from them
with a high degree of probability.

[104} For the shortcomings mentioned above, the constituted text has
merits also. It cleanses the text of puerile modern accretions and obvious
errors of repetition, which lengthen and weaken the text. It solves a certain
number of textual riddles (bogus kutas), which were the outcome of long
standing corruptions and unskilful conflation. It rescues from undeserved
oblivion many an authentic archaism, which had been gradually ousted in the
course of transmission of the text.

Sooner than print up the text of one manuscript, however reliable it
may be, declining to shoulder the responsibilities attaching to the work of an
editor, I have ventured on the perilous path of text reconstruction, in the
hope and belief that it will present a more faithful picture of the original
than any extant manuscript could do. That to prepare such a text is a phe-
nomenally difficult task, no one can realize bettei than the editor himself. It
is as certain afe inevitable that in preparing a text like this the editor will
frequently make blunders, even gross blunders.

It is to be feared that there is no royal road in this incomparably diffi-
cult field. The only path left open to us by which we may return to the ori-
ginal Mahabharata or Bharata is the rough, narrow, scientific foot-path of
repeated trial and error. More than one attempt will probably have to be
made before the ideal is attained. It will, therefore, be prudent not to claim
too much for the first critical edition, nor to expect too much from it.

OTHER EDITIONS

Of the old editions it must be said that they are creditable performances,
but they lack the critical apparatus. We do not know on what manuscripts
they are based, according to what principles the editors have prepared the

text, information essential on account of the wild fluctuations of the manus-
cripts. That is why they have been almost wholly ignored in the present
edition.

The editia princeps (Calcutta 1836) remains the best edition of the Vul-
gate, after the laipse of nearly a century. The later text editions, as is unfor-
tunatdy too often the case with our editions, add to the editio princeps only
a fresh crop of spurious lines and misprints.

The well-known potlfi-iorm Bombay editions (published by Ganpat
Krishnaji in Saka 1799,, and Gopal Narayan in 1913, and others), which
include NJlakan'tha’s scholium, are supposed to represent Nalakaiotha's text ;
but they contain many readings and lines which are not to be found in the
Nilakantha manuscripts, and are therefore net wholly reliable.

The Kumbhakooam edition, which is said to be “ mainly based on the
South Indian texts ”, is a fine representative of the composite Telugu version ;
it has been of immense help to me in the study of what may be called “ con-
flate ” readings. In former years its chief value lay in that it gave the reader
glimpses, however imperfect and confused, of the important Southern recen-
sion. IlTs now rendered obsolete and superfluous by P. P. S. Sastri’s new
edition of the Mahabharata, which will presently be described, and which is
unquestionably a better representative of the Southern tradition.

005} The Grantha edition (Sarfojirajapuram 1896) and the old
Telugu edition (Madras 1855) were not examined : they are not likely to
contain anything of high importance that is not found in the other editions
or manuscripts collated for this edition.

The editions accompanied by vernacular translations, which form a very
numerous class, are mostly bald reprints of one or the other of the earlier
(printed) editions and may be completely ignored here ; they are perfectly
useless for critical purposes.

The new edition^ of the Southern recension of the Mahabharata by Pro-
fessor P. P. Subrahmanya Sastri of Madras, now in the course of publica-
tion, which has been referred to several times already, is a laudable attempt
to supply a long-felt want. He deserves the cordial thanks of all lovers of
Sanskrit literature in general and of the Great Epic in particular, for his
courageously undertaking such a stupendous and exacting task and pursu-
ing it steadfastly, single-handed, during the sicanty leisure permitted by his
official duties as •Professor of Sanskrit in the Presidency College of Madras,
and Editor of the Descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in the ex-
tensive library of the Saraswathi Mahal at Tanjore. The edition is in no

sense rendered superfluous by the Critical Edition, although most of the in-
formation it contains is cr will be included, in some shape or other, in the
present edition. The gulf between the Northern and the Southern recensions
is so vast, that it is extremely difficult, if not practically impossible, to re-
construct the Southern text, completely and correctly, from the critical notes
of this edition.

The principles on which the text of this edition of the Southern recension
of the Mahabharata is prepared have been set forth and briefly discussed
above. The editor, it was pointed out, fondly cherishes the unfounded be-
lief that he is printing a Grantha manuscript as it is, but consciously and un-
consciously he has introduced so many important innovations, that the text,
as a whole, must be pronounced to be eclectic; as eclectic as any text — at least
as far as the Adiparvan is concerned— published so far. For far less important
deviations from the manuscripts have I condemned, above, the editions of
the Vulgate. Judged as an eclectic edition, it must be pronounced to be in-
ferior. The i>rinciple Sastri has laid down is a simple one to follow ; in
fact nothing could be simpler ; he is to print the text of a selected manuscript
as it is, only correcting clerical errors. And it is to be greatly regretted that he
dees not follow rigorously this principle. Fie constantly flouts it, in pursuit of
some imaginary norm. Clear as his principle is, his actual procedure is some-
what paradoxical. He has left innumerable minor “inferior” readings in
possession of the text (when he could have with perfect confidence, if net
certainty, put into his text the correct readings), because he ostensibly wants
to present the text as it is in one selected manuscript ; on the ether hand, he
has light-heartedly, on utterly insufficient grounds, effected very substantial
additions (in one instance extending to 140 lines), omissions and other un-
warranted alterations (such as transpositions of adhyayas), in the utterly mis-
taken (though unquestionably bona fide) belief that he is correcting only the
“ scriptorial blunders” of his exemplar, when the> are in reality (as is shown
by the evidence of cognate versions) nothing of the kind.

{106} The sub-title “ Southern Recension ” is perhaps a trifle ambi-
tious, at least as far as the Adi is concerned ; because, firstly, he has utilized
only six Southern manuscripts (1 Telugu and 5 Granthas), even less than the
number (18) of the Southern manuscripts collated for our edition; and,
secondly, he has completely ignored one whole Southern version, the import-
ant Malayialam version, in my opinion, the most important of Southern
versions.

Further, it may be questioned whether the edition deserves to be called a
critical editicn at all, since, as was pointed out above, the. editor is avowed-
ly aiming only at reproducing the text, of one manuscript, categorically re-
nounieng the obligation of the textual critic to restore the text, as far as pos-
sible, to its original form.



PROIEGOMENA


133


The inclusion in Sastri’s text of a certain number of stray lines and even
a few lengthy passages which are peculiar to the Northern recension and
absolutely foreign to the Southern/ throws much light on the unconscious
process of the growth of the epic and the irresistible influence which the Vul
gate exerts on a text that is coming into being, in other words, on that subtle
process of textual osmosis (if I may term it so) by which the epic texts have
become conflated. Sastri’s explanations in his Introduction as well as his
procedure elucidate much of the psychology for the ancient scribes and re-
dactors, who have in the past shaped our Mahabharata texts for us. Uncon-
sciously he seems to have worked on the identical principles on which the an-
cient scribes have worked. His edition is a true lineal descendant of the Ma-
habhaiata manuscripts of South India.

In preparing Appendix I of this edition ( in which there is a strong pre-
ponderance of the Southern element), I had to go rather carefully over
Sastri’s text of the Adi, when I came across far too many inaccuracies in the
passages for which I checked his text and critical notes with the collations of
the manuscripts common to our critical apparatus. The critical notes of the
edition l^ve much to be desired. He has mostly shown correctly the addi-
tional passages in the manuscripts examined by him ; but he fails, as a rule,
to note the transpositions, omissions, and above all repetitions, which often
are, critically, highly significant, probably again in the erroneous belief that
they are negligible “ scriptorial blunders.” Some of them are undoubtedly
so, but not all. Likewise he has not always shown correctly the additions
and omissions of the colophons, and yet he is evidently most anxious to
reach the number 218, given by the Parvasalrhgraha. All deviations, however
trivial they may seem to him, he should have scrupulously noted, as a matter
of principle, because he must realize that with his utterly negligible critical
apparatus — comprising only five or six manuscripts out of a total of more
than three hundred manuscripts of the Adi — it is wholly impossible for him
to understand and explain the full significance of all the textual features
and anomalies of the manuscripts examined by him. I will not take him
to task for the numerous wrong readings which have inadvertently crept
into his text, because I know, from personal experience, that it would be
a physical impossibility to combine any high degree of accuracy with the
pace at which he is compelled to bring out the volumes. But it is inevitable
that the discovery of such inaccuracies should give rise to a sense of insecur-
ity and suspicion ini thej mind of the reader in respect of those matters that
he has to take from the editor on trust.

£107} The minor deficiencies pointed out here do not, however, detract
materially from the many merits of the work, from the incalculable advant-
age we derive from having a Southern version of an entire parvan in Deva-

niagait transcript, printed in handy volumes, because thei Southern manusc-
cripts are really most inconvenient for the purposes of rapid consultation.
I should be indeed very ungrateful if I did not frankly admit that Professor
Sastri’s edition has been of immense help to me, personally, for the study
of the Southern recension, and I have no doubt that it will also help other
workers in the field in future.


There remains for me the pleasant duty of recording all the encouragement and
assistance I and my colleagues on the Mahabharata Editorial Board have received
from different quarters in the course of our labours in this connection.

To Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, B. A., Ruler of Aundh, whose libera-
lity made it in the first instance possible for the Institute to undertake this ambitious
project — the greatest philogical enterprise undertaken in India within living me-
mory — I have to tender on behalf of myself and other people like myself interested
in the study and regeneration of our great National Epic, our most sincere and cor-
dial thanks. For the numerous marks of personal kindness with which the Chief
Saheb has favoured me, in this connection, on all occasions, I have to offer him the
expression of my profound gratitude. His unflagging zeal and irrepressible optimism
have helped me to carry on the work in the face of heavy odds. The Chief Saheb
has been pleased to enliven the dry and scientific character of the work by contri-
buting to this edition excellent paintings of scenes selected from the Great Epic,
paintings especially prepared under his expert guidance and supervision, for the
purposes of this edition.

I have next to record the gratitude of the promoters of this scheme to various
distinguished donors : the Imperial Government of India ; the Provincial Govern-
ments of Bombay, Madras and Burma ; the Governments of H. E. H. the Nizam
of Hyderabad, H. H. the Maharaja of Mysore, H. H. the Gaekwad of Baroda ; the
Chief of Phaltan and other enlightened and patriotic Rulers and Chiefs of Indian
States ; the University of Bombay ; and diverse other generous donors : who have
all rendered valuable financial assistance to the scheme and contributed their share
to that measure of success which has already been achieved. In this connection I
must not forget to mention the kind offices of my old friend the Honourable Mr.
Mukundarao R. Jayakar, M. A., Bar-at-law, Member of the Legislative Assembly,

whose selfless interest in the success of this project has moved him to exert his

influence for enlisting the sympathy and securing the help of some of the distin-
guished donors mentioned above.

I must next record my grateful thanks for help of various kinds I have received
from my colleagues on the Mahabharata Editorial Board, namely : Prof. S. K.
Belvalkar, M. a., Ph. D., I. E. S.; Prof. A. B. Gajendragadkar, M. A., B,
E. S. ; Mr. P. V. Kane, M. A., LL. M ; Principal R. D. Karmarkar, M. A. ;
Prof. V. G. Paranjpe, M. A., LL. B., D, Litt. ; Prof. V. K. Rajavabe, M. A.;
the! late Mr. N. B. Utgikar, M, A.; £108} Prof. P. L. Vaibya, M. A., D. Litt.;

Mr. V. P. Vaibya, J. P., B, A., Bar-at-law; Prof. M. Winternitz, Ph. D.; and

the late Rev. Father R. ZiMMEa?MANN, S. J., Ph. D. No Board of which I have
been a member has worked, eVer since its inception, more smoothly and harmo-
niously.

But I desire to make a special mention of my indebtedness to Mr. V, P.
Vaidya, Bar-at-law, of Bombay, and the late Rev. Father R. Zimmermann, S. J.,
whose advice and ready help accompanied my labours from' the time I first under- ^
took the responsibilities of the work. The interest of my late lamented fellow-stu-
dent and friend Father Zimmermann in this project did not flagl even as he lay,
in 1931, in a Nursing Home at Faldkirch, waiting prepared to meet his Maker !
Nothing encouraged me more in the early stages of this arduous and fascinating
work than the active and unwavering interest with which these two friends fol-
lowed it.

Nepal and Kashmir in the North and Tanjore anjd Travancore in the South
are known to contain vast treasures of unpublished and valuable Sanskrit manus-
cripts ; and the course of Indological studies of the last two or three decades may
be said to have been dominated by discoveries of outstanding importance made
during that period in the three last mentioned centres. On the other hand, in re-
gard to the large and well-stocked public and private libraries which are known to
have been in existence in the country, Nepal decidedly appears not have contri-
buted its quota to the stock of fresh material which is now required for unravell-
ing further the tangled skein of the history of Indian literature. Satis Chandra
ViDYABHUSHANA and Haraprasad Shastri among Indians, and Sylvain htvi and
Giuseppe Tucci among Europeans have undoubtedly done valuable pioneering work,
but in view of the immense possibilities, what has been achieved thus far must be
said to be tantalizingly little.

Under these circumstances, we cannot be sufficiently grateful to Rajaguru
Hemaraj Pandit, C.I.E., IMrector of Public Instruction, Nepal, through whose
go^ offices the doors of the rich store-house of the Nepali material were thrown
open to us — material which is all but inaccessible to Indologists — and we have been
placed in a position to publish, for the first time in the history of Mdhabharata
studies, collations of valuable Nepali manuscripts. This supremely unselfish and
profoundly learned patron of Sanskrit studies has really done more than merely sup-
plying to the Institute, free of cost, collations of Nepali manuscripts available to him
in local libraries. Realizng that there were valuable manuscripts to be had outside
Kathmandu, the headquarters of the Rajaguru, he caused a search to be made, at his
own expense, throughout that distant outpost of Hindu culture and civilization, for
old Mahabharata manuscripts, and the find of the valuable Ms. N 3 , the oldest of the
dated manuscripts of our critical apparatus, is the unexpected and welcome fruit
of the Rajaguru’s exertibns in the cause of Mahabharata research. Only those who
know the difficulties in the way of obtaining any manuscript from Nepal will be
in a position to appreciate fully the debt which the editor and the other members
of the Mahabharata Editorial Board, and beyond that the whole world of Indolo-
gists, owe to the Rajaguru. Sanskritists have much to hope for from the dispassion-
ate efforts of this truly patriotic and cultured Rajaguru, who loses no opportunity
of placing bis immense learning and unbounded resources freely at the disposal of
all serious workers in the field of Sanskrit research.

£ 109 } In connection with other help that has been received from extra-mural
collaborators, I must put on record our special obligation to Pandit Vidhushekhara
Sastri Bhattacharya of the Visvabharati, and to M. R. Ry. Rao Saheb T. Samba^
murthi Rao AvL, B. A., B. L., of the Saraswathi Mahal, Tanjore. These gentlemen
have been good enough to supply the Institute, for many years past, with care-
fully procured collations of manuscripts which are in their charge or which were
kindly procured by them, on loan, for the purpose, unselfishly supervising the work
of their collation centre, at great sacrifice of their tiipe and labour. To Profcs^r

K. Rama Pisharoti, then Principal of the Sanskrit G)llege at Trippunittura in
Cochin State, I am indebted for the collations of Malayalam manuscripts for the
first two adhyayas of this parvan.

My special thanks are due to the Managing Committees and Trustees of the
following libraries and institutions for supplying me with the manusaipts required
by me and allowing me to retain them as long as necessary : the Adyar Library,
the Baroda Oriental Institute, Benares Sanskrit College, Mysore Oriental Library,
Shri Yadugiri Yatiraj Math (Melkote, Mysore) and the India Office (London).
The latter deserves speaal mention as the only Euroi>ean library I know, which
sends out freely its Indian manuscripts, on loan, back to India, for the use of In-
dian scholars. A few manuscripts were sent to me by my kind friends Professor
Sushil Kumar De, Head of the Department of Sanskrit and Bengali, Dacca Uni-
versity, and Professor Bhagavaddatta of the Dayananda Anglo- Vedic College,
Lahore, to whom I wish to thank for this kind help. I am obliged also to Sardar
Kibe of Indore for the loan of a Nilakaptha manuscript. The Chief of Idappalli,
Mr. Anujan Achan, Mr. Kallenkara Pisharam, all of Cochin, as also the Pro-
prietors of the following estates in Cochin, Poomulli Mana, Avanapparambu Mana.
Nareri Mana, have put me under heavy obligation by sending me freely Malay^am
manuscripts in their possession, for collation, at a time when it was rather difficult
for me to secure any Malayalam manuscripts at all.

I desire further to express my gratefulness to various scholars who have fol-
lowed the publication of the fascicules of this volume with keen interest, periodi-
cally publishing reviews of them in the Journals of different learned Societies, re-
views expressive of their interest and appreciation ; to wit, Professors Banerji,
Sastri, Barnett, Belloni-Filippi, Charpentier, S. K. De, Edgerton, R. Pick,
Jayaswal, Konow, Krishnaswami Aiyangar, Lesny, Kalidas Nag, Weller,
WiNTERNiTZ and others. These kind reviewers have adopted uniformly a most
courteous and sympathetic tone in their reviews. Their sympathy and courtesy
have always reminded me of thase classic lines of Bhartrhari :



I must next record my thanks for the ungrudging assistance I have uniformly
received from the members of the permanent staff of the Mahabharata Department
of the Institute. Mr. S. N. Tadpatrikar, M.A., Supervisor of Collations, was
always by my side, helping me with useful suggestions, when I constituted the text
of the Adi. Mr. Tadpatrikar has been associated with the work, in various capa-
cities, since 1919. He has assisted my predecessor, the late Mr. Utgikar, in pre-
paring the Tentative Edition of the Viratparvan and seeing it through the press.
The compiling of the critical notes (printed at the foot of the page) was entrusted
by me to Messrs. B. G. Bhide and D, V. £110} Naravane. For the conscientious
manner in which these two gentlemen have discharged their duty, I feel greatly
obliged, since it is a most tedious and trying piece of woric to collect the variant
readings from the different collation sheets, and to arrange, in a prescribed form,
according to stringent rules of sequence and enunciation, that ponderous mass of
variants which is and will remain the unique feature and abiding achievement of this
edition. The ^rada codex was collated by the Head Shastri of the Mahabharata
Department, Shankar Shastri Bhilavadikar. The comparative paucity of printing
mistakes in this volume is largely due to the vigilence and conscientiousness! of the
Collator and Reader, K. V. Krishnamurti Sharma, Sastri, of Erode (South India).

These and other members of my staff have uniformly worked with exemplary zeal
and untiring patience, to make a success of this edition, and I gladly take the op-
portunity of putting on record their loyal help and willing co-operation.

It is but right that I should also mention here that the Manager iand the ex-
pert compositors of the renowned Niranaya Sagar Press have! rendered ungrudging-
ly every assistance in carrying out the typographical arrangements which appeared
to me best suited for the purpose of the work, meeting requirements that would
have tried the patience and exhausted the resources of any other press in India.

Last but not least, I must express my profound gratitude to my revered Guru
Geheimer Regierungsrat Professor Dr. Heinrich Luders of the University of Berlin.
What little merit there may be in the present work is due wholly to that excellent
though somewhat rigorous and exacting training in philological methods which I
had the benefit of receiving at his hands in the Indogermanisches Seminar, as a
student in the University of Berlin. It is my firm conviction that there is no living
scholar who has a deeper insight into the history of the Indian epic and the compli-
cacies of its tradition than Geheimrat LOders. It was, therefore, an unlucky day
in the annals of Mahabharata studies when, for lack of sympathetic co-operation
and adequate financial support, he must have been compelled to abandon his epic
studies, and our Great Epic lost the benefit of redaction at the hands of one of the
greatest living philologists. His early Mahabharata studies, Ueber die Granthmecen-

him a small recompense for the great trouble he has taken to initiate me in the

DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE MANUSCRIPTS
Sx

(The Saradia Codex.)

Poona, Bombay Government Collection (deposited at the BORI), No. 159 of
1875-76. Total number of folios, for this parvan, 192 (some frayed and patched
at ends) , with about 24 lines to a page. Size 12" X 19". CleaT Sarada diaracters.
Birchbark (bhurjapatra).

The codfex, which is unfortunately incomplete and fragmentary, must
have originally contained at least the first three parvans (Adi, Sabha, and
Araaiya or Araioyaka), writteh, as far as one can judge, by the same hand.
The extant portion contains the Sabha in its entirety, but only fragments of
the other two parvans, the beginning of Adi and thei end of Arapyaka being
lost. The text of Araipyaka begins on fol. 211a, line 1 ; and ends, or rather
breaks off, at the end, of a folio marked 194b (sic). The numbering of the
pages is most erratic. There are in all 192 folios pertaining to this parvan. The
fragment breaks off in the middle of our 3. 253. 18*^, ending with the words :

The margins are mostly clean, andi corrections are few and
far between. Erasures have been made in a few places with green pigment.
{3} In good many places (e.g., folios numbered 156a, 185b, 186a, 193b,
194a, dtc.), the scribe has written dots to denote portions of the text which
were either lost or illegible to him : sign of a conscientious copyist. On
fol. 220a, some stanzas which had been omitted (? hapl.) in the text have
been written on the margin (s'esc. w.), in a diffetent and inferior ink. The top



INTRODUCTION


143


parts of the four folios numbered 89-92 are broken off and lost, involving a
loss of from 5 to 8 top lines on' each page. The names of sub-parvans have
been sporadically mentioned. The manuscript has been fully described at
p. X of the Prolegamma to Adiparvan (q. v.)

Poona, Bombay Government Collection ( deposited at the BORI), Visrambiag
I, No. 474 , Folios 486 (numbered 55-540; first 54 folios missing), with about 10
lines to a page. Size 12i" X 5i". Devaniagari characters. Thin glazed superior
Indian paper.

First 54 folios are lost ; fol. 55 begins with 3. 32. 4®. Number 237 is
given to two consecutive folios, but the second folio thus marked is sub-
sequently corrected (5€c. m.) to 238. The missing portion of the text at the
end of the first of the two folios marked as 237 is written out in small letters
(? sec, m.) at the bottom of the page. Fol. 485 is written only on one side ;
and at the end of this folio is the remark 3T& i) ^ \\, the

contents of this folio (485) have been copied out again sec, m. (on a separate
sheet of modem paper with watermarks), including the final remark
...II -if II, with the addition, I II % II

which shows that the copyist of this sheet was some Gujarati scribe. The
handwriting of the original, which is Kashmirian in style is not quite uniform :
some folios show very thick, black, broad upright characters, while others are
appreciably thinner and somewhat slanting. Frequently in the colophons, and
the references to speakers, only alternate letters are written, blanks being left
to be filled with red ink, which,, however, has not been done. Mere folds,
without vertical lines, mark the right and left margins of folios. The ink used
is jet black and of a superior quality. The sub-parva0 names are generally
mentioned.


K,

Poona, BORI, Mbh. Collection No. 15 (—Institute’s Collection, No. 246).
Folioal 3(X), with about 14 lines to a page. Size 13i" X 6|/'. Devanagari characters.
Dated V. Saiiivat 1828 and Saka 1693 (ca, a.d. 1772). Grey Indian paper.

This manuscript is described' as Di at p. vii of the Introduction to the
Udyogapyarvan, for which parvan it was first used. The name of the scribe,
which comes after the date (year) at the end of this parvan, appears as :
3^*1 feqPRt fersft I the day and month come last : ^

Udyogaparvan, the scribe's name is given as Ka§-
miriya Sadananda. Very incorrect, containing numerous little errors of spell-
ing, such as writing ^ for Adhyaya colophons and margins are< marked
with red pigment, corrections with yellow pigment. Marginal (vertical) lines
o( tpages are in black and red, separated by a thick yellow line. The manu-
script is almost without any marks of punctuation. The dmidas were probably
to be marked with red ink, but the £4} revision was never actually carried

out. It may be noted that this is a parvan. from an almost complete manus-
cript of the' Mahabhiarata written by one hand, and as such important.

K3

Poona, Bombay Government Collection (deposited at the BORI), No. 184 of
1891-95. Folios 285, with about 17 lines to! a page. Size 10^" X Sj". Devanagari
characters. Indian paper.

Total number of folios is 294, of which fol. 270, 272-279 are missing. Fol.
152a has only six lines of writing, the greater part of the folio being left
blank, and the writing continued on the reverse, without any loss of text. In
the references to speaker the word (resp. ) is generally omitted ;
the name of the' speaker to be generally given in some abbreviated form like
manuscript seems to be fairly old. The edges, especially
of the last folios, are brittle and worn. Characters are short and broad, re-
presenting an old style of writing in. Writing is incorrect on the whole.
There are occasional corrections in margin {sec. m.). Adhyaya colophons
and nam^ of speakers are generally coloured with red pigment. The manus-
cript mentions sub-parvans as a rule. It doe's not distinguish between ^ and
^ . both are again often confused with

K.

Poona, Bombay Government Collection (deposited at the BORI), No. 57 of
,1882-83. Folios 370 (numbered 52-421), with about 10 lines to a page. Size
12 J X Devanagari characters. Old Indian paper.

First 51 folios are lost ; fol. 52 begins with 3. 36. 1«. The hand-writing
of the manuscript, though it seems to be of one scribe, is not uniform. For
some portion we have large round letters with flourishes, while for others
the characters are thin and upright. Pi^thamatras are almost invariably
used. Marginal notes, especially variants, are written {sec. m.) with the
clear remark that it is a patha ; there are explanatory notes also, written on
the margins. Colophons, references to speakers, and sloka endings (the
latter sporadically) are marked with red pigment. — ^The manuscript breaks
off at the last folio (421), where it ends with the colophon of the last adhyaya
of this! parvan. There is no phalasniti, nor the list of contents, which we
often find at the end of Mahabharata manuscripts.

Dacca, University Libraiy, No. 495. Folios 1-323, and 325. Bengali characters.
Dated ^aka 1393 (ca. a.d. 1471). Paper. Slightly damaged.

The manuscript contains two correction slips, one between fol 163 and
164, and anothe!r between fol. 247 and 24S.-~Collat€\di at the Visvabharati

characters. Indian paper.

Text .with commentary of Caturbhujamisra entitled Vdkyadipikd. The
handwriting is not uniform : it begins with a longish upright style, which
gradually becomes slanting towards right, up to fol. 164 ; fol. 165 begins with
a broad, short, round, broken styld up to folio 265 ; from the next fol. (266),
the style of writing again becomes long, slanting and thin ; and towards the
end the lettering becomes a little thick and bold. Right and left margins are
marked by double lines in red, and stops in the text and the commentary, are
also marked by double dain<Jas in red. The lower borders of folios of this
manuscript are a little soiled by damp.

Poona, Bombay Goveinment Collection (deposited at the BORI), No. 236 of
1895^1902. Folios 768, with about 9 lines to a page. Size 15p' X 7". Devana-
gari characters. Thick Indian paper.

Text with the commentary of Nilakaintha, called the Bharatabhdvadlpa,
The manuscript is written in a uniformly neat upright handwriting. Right and
left margins are marked by two double lines in red. Double daindas in red
are used on some folios to mark the stops in the text as well as in the com-
mentary. Adhyaya colophons in both the text and the commentary are also
in red ink. On some pages, continuations are written on the right side along
the marginal red lines.

Poona, Bombay Government Collection (deposited at the BORI), Visrambag I,
No. 496. Folios 626, with about 12 lines to a page. Size 16" X Devanagari
characters, Indian paper.

Text with the commentary of Nflakantha, called the Bhdratabhdvadlpa.
The’* manuscript has its right and left margins marked with close double lines
in red as usual. The first three folios and the last folio have an illuminated
border with floral designs. The writing, though incorrect, is bold and upright.
Numerous corrections are made in the text by using yellow pigment. Fol. 401-
439 are written with ink of a faint black colour. Subsequent portion is written
in a shaky style, with short and round letters. There are also marginal cor-
rections, entered sec. m., throughout the manuscript. Adhyaya colophons are
marked with red pigment. The last colophon in the commentary is left in-
complete, and the last but one fol. (625) breaks off with : The

first sloka of the Virata too, is left incomplete, while the* last folio is num-
bered 626 in one (right bottom) corner and 627 in the other (left top) cor-
ner. The usual table of contents is also wanting. All this suggests that the
actual fol. 626 is lost.

MANUSCRIPTS NOT INCLUDED IN THE CRITICAL APPARATUS

Besides the twenty-eight manuscripts detailed above, the following two
manuscripts were also e'xamined by me, which deserve notice.

1. Calcutta, Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal Collection, No. 33,12 ( 4066).
   Folios 166; size 13" X 10". Sarada characters. Dated Saka 1630 (ca. a.d. 1706).
   Kasnuri paper.

2. Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society's Collection, No. 966 ( =
   B.D. 245). Folios 235, with about 15 lines to a page ; size 14^" X 6^". Old Deva-
   nagari characters. Dated! Sarhvat 1573 (ca. a.d. 1516). Indian paper. Illustrated,

The dated Sarada manuscript belcmging to the Royal Asiatic Society of
Bengal is a very fragmentary and fragile manuscript, in an extremely delapi-
dated' condition. The custodians of the manuscript would not part with it
for collation at the Institute, but allowed it to be collated and photographed
on the premises of the Society. The difficulty in the way of collating — as of
photographing — it, was that many of the folios were stuck together and could
be separated only at the risk of damaging the writing. A partial study of the
manuscript showed that the basic text is probably Kasmiri, but it is contami-
nated deeply from the Mid-Indian versions (Bengali-Devanagari). The ma-
nuscript is briefly described in Haraprasada Shastri's Descriptive Catalogue,
Vol. 5, at p. 166. A facsimile of a page from this manuscript, containing
the text from 3. 242. 20^ to 243. 15% is given at the' end of Volume 4 of this
edition. Note the bits of commentary wrongly incorporated, in lines

9-10, and in lines 12-13.

The other manuscript, which belongs to the Bombay Branch of the Royal
Asiatic Society, is, on the other hand, an extremely valuable old manuscript,
dated in V. Samvat 1573 (= a.d. 1516). It would! have been fully collated
and used for our edition, but for the circumstance that it is also very frag-
mentary, nearly one-third of the number of folios being, unfortunately, irre-
coverably lost. The original manuscript was written at Yoginipura (modem
Delhi) during the reign of “Sulitrap Sikandara”, who. appears to be the
famous Sikandar Shah Lodi, Sultan of Delhi, for Bhanudiasa Chaudharl — z
resident of Kacchauva (a “ water- fortress ”, jalddmga),^ The manuscript was
constantly £11} consulted by me in case of doubt to see what help it could
give. I have cited its evidence occasionally, in the Critical Notes ’’ at the

1 This Kacchauva may perhaps be identified with the modei^n Kachola ”, a
town in Udaipur State. The Imperkd Gazetteer (1866) states that in former times
the town, which stood on the western bank of a large lake, must have been a place
of some irnportance ; for all around, the giouhd is strewn with fragments of extremely
fine sculpture, and half way up the hill the ruins of a temple are visible.

TESTIMONIA

The ’testimonia of the Aranyaka consist of ancient commentaries and
epitomes, of which there are not very many in the case of this parvan.

Devabodha’s commentary on the Arainyaka has unfortunately been lost,
or at least has not been retovered so far. The same is true of the Javanese
version. This parvan thus unfortuniately lacks two of the oldest — and the
TWst important — of the testimonia of the Mahabharata, — ^works which have
rendered yeoman service in some of the parvans already edited.

As regards other works of that nature, there is, as far as I know, extant
at least one complete manuscript of the commentary of Arjunamisra on the
Aranyaka. It belongs to the Government Sanskrit College Collection in Cal-
cutta^ (No. 310); cf. Catalogue, Vol. 4, p. 190. There are also incomplete
copies of the commentary in the Sanskrit College at Benares (MSS. No. 2279 ;
and q I 65 34). .1 had the use of a rough copy of the Calcutta Sanskrit
College manuscript mentioned above, which was kindly supplied to me’, at my
request, by the Principal of the College. The copy was however found to be
full of clerical errors and was not exactly suitable for collation. It was there-
fore used by me merely for occasional consultation. The text used by Arjuna-
mi^ra is, as usual, of a superior type, jand his commetitary would repay care-
ful study, if good manuscripts of the commentary could be obtained. A fac-
simile of the single e^xtant page of a paper manuscript of what proved to be
Arjunami^ra's commentary on the Arainyakaparvan, written in i^rada cha-
racters and included by chance in the iSaradia manuscript of this parvan be-
longing to the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, forms the frontispiece of the
second part of the Arainyakaparvan (Vol. 4 ). The passage commented on is
3. 133. 20 to 134. 9. Note the consecutive numbering of the lines in the left
        margin.

Fr<Mn this list of contents, it can be seen that almost all the stories and
episodes which we now find in our text of the Araijyaka were there already in
K§emendra’s time (ca. 1050 A.D.). The parvan must therefore have had then
the same gaieral form and appearance as now. More significant is the fact
that all important passages — ^without exception — ^that are lacking in our manus-
cripts of the Ka&niri version are likewise missing in the Manjan. This fact
alone cannot prove that these passages were laddng in the Kaimlri versicm of
the devmth century. Some or even all of them could have been omitted by
a poet who was making an epitome of an extensive work like the Araijyaka-
parvan : he would be within his rights in doing so. But the Mmj^l does not
omit any important episode or passage which is not omitted at the same time
in the KaSmari version of the Great Epic. Consequently, unless the version of
the Araijyakapafvan used by Ksemendra was nearly indentical with our
KaSmlii version, the coincidence that our Kairrflri manuscripts omit just
those passages which K§emendra had considered not worth including in his
epitome, and no other, would be extremdy curious, if not miraculous. It
seems accordingly most probable that the episodes which are not found in
Ksemendra’s Manjati were already lacking in the Ka^mlif version of the Mahfi-
tharata in the eleventh century,. I think, therefore, that with the help of this
testimonium, we can establish for the omissions of the KaSndtf version an anti-
quity much higher than that vouchsafed solely by the age of our manuscripts,
which are later by scane centuries than the period of the conmosition of Kj§e-
mendra’s Bhdratamah/arf.

Noteworthy among such omissions of the Mahjmi are the followii^ three

lengthy passages : (1) the Temptation of Arjuna by Urvasi (App. I, No. 6) ;
(2) Kanpa's Conquest of the World (App. I, No. 24); (3) the Visit of Dur-
vasas to Yudhi^thira (App. I, No. 25). The first of these three interpola-
tions has insinuated itself in the manuscripts of almost all versions and is now
lacking only in some manuscripts of the Kasmiri version.^ The second among
them is documented only by Devanagail manuscripts, excepting a few con-
flated manuscripts of other versions ; consequently its claim' to be recognized
as an authentic passage is not very substantial. Finally, the last i>assage in-
troducing Ehirviasas into the story, a passage which is really restricted to the
Nilakantha version, with the casual support of a few DevanlagaTl and some
conflated manuscripts, does not really come into question ; because its spurious
character is very £133 ^ideht and does not need an elobate proof. ^

The versions of the commentators Caturbhuja and Nilakaintha are des-
cribed below under the Devanagari version.

2 With this story disappears one of the very few episodes in the Mahabharata

in which Sri Kr^a is irepresented as hearing from a ^stance, as it were by clair-
audience or divine omniscience, the prayers of his distressed devotees and as either
coming instantly to their help in person or providing invisibly the means of their
rescue or safety. The other episode I had in mind, which has likewise proved to
be an interpolation, is the well-known scene, in the Sabhiparvan of the disrobing
of Draupadi (Draupa<£-vasitra-haraina), when, according to the Vulgate version,
Draupaefi prays to Sri whq hears her prayer and comes running to her rescue.

( tqfcsrr ^«rf mw- l B. 2. es, 45), and she is clothed again and

again, miraculously, but presumably by the intervention and grace of Sri Kp^a.
They undoubtedly represent a later phase of K|Wa wor^ip.



154 ARAI^YAKAPARVAN

A CRITICAL SURVEY OF THE RECENSIONS AND THEIR

VERSIONS

general survey

A description of the forest life of the Pajoidavas constitutes the topic of the
Third Book, the Araijyaka — (Araipya — or Arajoya — ). parvan, conmionly
called (for short) the Vanaparvan, whose extent is between 11,000 and 12,000
slokas (i.e. “ granthas ”) . The actual incidents narrate, pertaining to the life-
history of the heroes in this parvan, are indeed few and unimportant compar-
ed to the size of the book. The entire narrative has been condensed by
K§emendra in his into less than 2,000 stanzas, without omitting

any of the main incidents. The great extent of the parvan has been made
up by the inclusion of episodes of the most diverse kind : stories of ancient
kings, sages, and virtuous women ; description of places of pilgrimage {ttrtha-
yatrd); discourses {14} on moral, ethical and philosophical topics, ancient
gathas and anuvarhsa stanzas. It was a fashion for some time to obelize this
episodic matter as late interpolation. But that is a misguided view, originating
with a certain type of critics who haVe exhibited a uniform lack of under- ^
standing of the meaning of the Mahabharata and of the basic plan and aim
of the creators of our great epic. The episodical material in the Mahabha-
rata is, in general, not secondarily introduced ; it belongs to the original
plan and serves a distinct purpose. As Pisani has pointed cut in his paper
on the Rise of the Mahabharata the bulk of didactic and episodic matter
has been used to fill up the great temporal hiatuses in the narrative, viz,
in the first place, the twelve years of exile in forest (Araipyaka), and then the
long interval between the end of the Bharata War a!nd the last adventure of
the P^^avas (Santi and Anu^sana). ** This distribution remarks Pisani,
“to fill up! temporal hiatuses has not only the scope of not disturbing the
course of narration, but also that of helping the raider to pass over irrele-
vant years^ without striking against too strong a contrast betweoi periods mil-
nutely narrated and others rapidly surpassed . In a not different manner Ho-
mer introduces often dialogues and episodic stories when he must conceal the
flowing of times without noteworthy events.”^

The episodic material is largely Puraipic in character. Many of the Pu-
rmic stories we find here narrated over again. Moreover, as the references
given in the foot-notes to the text and the critical notes at the end of this
Book (pp. 1091-1109) will show, there is considerable verbal agreement bet-
ween the epic and Pura)i>ic versions of the stories. The Pur^as which show
the closest contact and widest parallelism are the Skanda;, 'Padma and Brali-
ma. The aitire story of Skanda (adhy. 213-221), togdber with the passage
containing the 108 names of the Sun (our adhy. 3, stanzas 18-28), recurs

almost verbatim in the ^anda Punaji^. The story of the Bhiargava sage
Cyavana and the princess Sukahya, the prose story of the Frog-girl, and a
considerable portion of the Ramopiakhyana are also to be met with in the
Skanda, worded almost identically with the M^abharata, The 108 names
of the Sun, recur beteides in the Brahma Puiiapa, which, moreover, has a por-
tion of the story of Markaindeya in common with the Araipyakaparvan. Fur-
thermore, sections of our tirthayatra are to be met with again in the Padma
and Matsya. A Bengali manuscript^ of the Padma Pur^a contains besides a
version of the IJsya§rnga legend. In all these cases, the parallelism of ver-
bal expression of the epic and the Purmjic narratives is so complete and drik-
ing, that the possibility of their having originated independently of each other
is at once ruled out. Many stray stanzas from our parvan are found in the
Kurma, Varaha, Vayu, Vi§|nu„ Vi§iiiudharmottara, and in the Harivam&i.

Our recensions of the Puranas are admittedly of a very late date', and it
is not to be expected that the Mahabharata would have borrowed any of its
material from our Puranas. The claim that the the Mahabharata owed certain
geographical and cosmographical sections of the Bhi$maparvan to the Padma
Parana, preferred by Luise Hilgenberg,^ £15} has been answered and liqui-
dated by Rao Bahadur Professor Dr. S. K. Belvalkar, who has shown that
in reality the converse of this proposition is true.^ This scholar has now
shown from internal evidence that the Padma Pur^a must have written up
its geographical section from the information supplied by the Mahabharata.
Similarly, the question of relationship between our Pulastya Tirthayatra and a
very similar episode in the Padma Puraipa has been discussed by my assistant,
Mr. M. V. Vaidya, m.a., who has likewise shown from intrinsic evidence that
the Mahabharata passage is the source of the Padma Puranja version.^

It must, however, be admitted that although in most cases the compilers
of our Pur^as appear to have drawn their material from the Mahabharata,
there may be — indeed there must b&— a few cases in which both the Maha-
bharata and the Punkas may have drawn independently upon a third com-
mon source. We can also say this with regard to episodes like the Savitn
episode, which likewise occurs in the Matsya Pur^a, where it is narrated in
an entirely different manner from that in the epic, and where all traces of

mutual relationship are absent or obliterated, except for two or three common
stanzas and stray piadas.

The reference in our parvan to Vayu, (3, 189. 14), is

worth considering in this connection. Nothing corresponding to the general
contents of the passage where it occurs is to be found in the extant Vayu
Purijja, as is remarked by Hopkins,^ or for the matter of that in any other
Purana proclaimed by Vayu. There are, however, a few stanzas in the Vayu
describing the dissolution of the world where verbal similarity with some
stanzas of this passage is pronounced, even though they are introduced in the
Vayu in a different context. The Mahabhlarata, as mentioned in it (3. 189.
14), draws upon a Puiwa of Vayu — ^and indeed, the topic narrated belongs
properly to a Puraria in its right, a Puraija which is older than the extant
Pumaias and which must be presumed to be now irretrievably lost. The evi-
dence for establishing a relation^ip between the extant Vayu and its old
namesake to which the epic is indebted is lacking, barring these few stray
stanzas.

Our parvan also contains an epitome of the legend of Rama, son of Da^-
ratha, the hero of the Ramiayaioa, which is known as Ramopakhyana (adhy.
258-275) ; but in the Parvassamgraha this passage is called
(1. 2. 126). Does this name imply any connection with' our “ Ramayairia ” ?
Jacobi has tried to show that the Ramop^hyana is indeed an epitome of
the work commonly known as Valmlki's Ramayama, a conclusion which has
been confirmed by subsequent researchers.®

This book, as already observed, is particularly rich in legends of ahcient
India. Among them are three worthy of special mention, viz., the Tale of
Nala, the IJsyai§phga L^end and the Story of Savirtri which have been critical-
ly edited here for the first time. The first of these, the Tale of Nala, has by
way of translations into English, £16} French, Gemum, Dutch, Italian and
other European languages, passed into the great stream of world literature.
The second, the IJ^yaSinga Legend, though not so well known, has yet a long
and interesting history and shows many modulations and ramifications, as has
been convincingly shown by Professor Heinrich Luders in his well-known
monograph on the subject, “ Die Sage von Ifeyagpiga."' ® The story of
Siavitri portraying woman in the role of the saviour of man, which r^resents
the high-water mark of epic poetry, is in a class by itself, and deserves to be
more widely known. It is to be hoped that this first critical edition of the
three of the most famous episodes of the Mahabhlarata will evoke the interest
of Indologists and encourage further study of them.

THE TWO RECENSIONS

The text of the Arainyakaparvan is, relatively speaking, remarkably
smooth, offering no special difficulties for textual reconstruction. There are
of course, as usual, discrepancies between the Northern and the Southern
recensions, and between the various versions comprising these two main recen-
sions. But it is noteworthy that in the whole of this big parvan, comprising
between 11,000 and 12,000 “slokas*’, there are not many transpositions of
any consequence and there are also remarkably few “ substitute passages
By the latter I mean parallel versions of fairly long passages in two or more
conflicting recensions which agree in general sense but are worded differently
in different groups of manuscripts, so that they cannot be co-ordinated line by
line, — passages which we find in large numbers in some of the other parvans,
notably in the Virataparvan. These substitute passage's are very clear evidences
of textual corruption — or, shall we say, derangement ? — and indeed very em-
barrassing to the textual critic. As for the transpositions, there is only one that
is worth noting here, and that is of the last adhyaya of this parvan. The
whole of this ^adhyaya is bodily transferred in the Southern recension to the
next parvan and appears there incorporated in the first adhyaya of that par-
van ! It is not possible to say with certainty whether this chapter, which in
all probability is itself an interpolation, belongs legitimately to our parvan
or to the next ; but it appears to be distinctly more appropriate* in its North-
ern setting, as its intrusion in the Virataparvan seems to lead to some obvious
repetitions as well as disturbance of context.^

There are naturally quite a number of large and small insertions in the
various versions. But in this matter also the present parvani prepares a sur-
prise for us. From the experience* gained from our critical editions of the Adi,
Sabha, and Virata parvans especially, we are inclined to regard the Southern
recension as a highly inflated version of the text. Now, in this parvan — strange
to say — the Vulgate version, which is based on the late Northern tradition, is
actually considerably longer than the Southern, as may be seen from the
extent of this parvan according to the existing printed editions of the Vul-
gate and the Southern recension : the Calcutta edition has 12,848 slokas
(corrected figure) as against 11,138 slokas in Sastri's Southern Recension.

£17} The large excess in the Calcutta-Bombay editions compared with
Sastri's is explained by the fact that the Vulgate text contains about a dozen
adhyayas which are lacking entirely in the Southern recension ; whereas the
Southern recension contains only two passages of any considerable length
(App. I, Nos. 4' and 23 )j which are not found in representative manuscripts
of the Northern recension, they being peculiar to the Southern, — ^with the
result that the Calcutta edition has 1710 Slokas in excess of Sastri's edition

of the Aranyaka-parvan. Thus we see that though, as a whole, the Southern
recension is unquestionably inflated, yet the process of inflation, as is evident
from this parvan, is not uniform throughout the epic, — which is a very imr
portant and significant fact.

Though the best version of the Northern recension — namely, the §arada-K
version — and the Southern recension agree remarkably well as regards the
general extent of the parvan, there are nevertheless numerous specific indivi-
dual readings, characterizing the two recensions — Northern and Southern —
and distinguishing them sharply] from each other. Here is a selection of
readings peculiar to the two main recensions, the references being to adhyayas
and slokas.

It may be observed that all these additions in the Southern recension
(with the exception of only one or two), numerous as they are, are uniformly
short, eadi usually consisting of not more than a couple of lines.

As remarked already, the text of this parvan is remarkably smooth, not
presenting any unusual difficulties in the way of restitution. When the
Sarada-K version (which is the best Northern version) and the Southern
recension are placed vis-o-vis, we can in general reconstruct the original with
confidence, barring a certain number of minor verbal fluctuations in the shape
of synonymous phrasings, which remain indeterminate without affecting the
construction or obscuring the sense. The concord between the :§arada-K ver-
sion and th -3 Southern recension in point of general content is striking, and
forms a sure basis for constituting a single text. Contamination between the
Kasnun version and the Southern recension cannot be proved, but contami-
nation between the Bengali-Devanagarl version and the Southern recension is
not impossible. The agreements between the Bengali-Devanagari and the
Southern recension have nevertheless been as a rule utilized to arrive at a
tentative stop-gap, based on the indications of documental evidence. But it
should be noted that the Kasmiri-Southem agreements have for greater docu-
mental authority ahd probative value than the Bengali-cum-Devanagari and
Southern agreements.

Let me put the matter in a slightly different way. The highest docu-
mental probability we can demand and expect is when all manuscripts of our cri-
tical appaiatu&--which is the same as saying, all our different versions— agree
on a reading or a feature. We must accept this as the original ; at least we
do not want to question it, at present. In the absence of such complete con-,-
cord, the next best combination is the agreement between the Sarada version
and the Southern recension (against Bengali-DevanagarJ). Third in import-
ance is, in my opinion, the concord between the Southern recension and the
Bengali-cum-Devanagari version (against the iSarada). Fourth in order
stands the agreement between only Northern versions or only Southern ver-
sions inter se, which I consider, in general, as of equal value. With the pro-
viso that a passage or a stanza or even a line, which is not necessary to the
context, may be rejected, if it is actually omitted entirely in even one of the
important versions, since — as experience has shown — ^the chances of confla-
tion are always very much greater than those of accidental or intenticmal
omission.

MANUSCRIPTS

The §a^<idd K^ssnUri) Version,

We are fortunate in possessing for this parvan also, a genuine Ka^tniri
manuscript written, in old iSaradia characters, on folios prepared from the
Himalayan birch-bark {bhurjopatra) , The manuscript is no other than the
now world-famous “Sarada Codex”, the unique birch-bark manuscript of
the Mahabharata belonging toi the Bombay Government Collection, now
deposited at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, with identification
No. 159 of 1875-76, which is the only extant genuine representative* of the
old {19} version of Ka^ir.^ Our manuscript is, irt other words, the conti-
nuation of the iSarada manuscript used for the Adi and Sabha. The manus-
cript is fragmentaiy, breaking off in the middle of 3. 253. 18*^, thus lacking
unfortunately the last 46 adhyaya^ of our text. For this lacuna we have to
depend upon the “ K ” version, some manuscripts of which have proved to be
moderately good copies of the iSarada version, especially Kg, which is des-
cribed below.

It is now recognized by the competent authorities on the subject that the
Sarada version is, in many respects, the most faithful representative of the
original now extant ; and the text of the Araoyakaparvan as preserved in our
Sarada Codex only confirms this view.

The tSarada text of the Araaiyaka is of a piece with the texts of the Adi
and the Sabha. The sitanzas comprising the text have not been actually
counted — it would not be easy to cdmpute its exact extent, as the text com-
prises slokas, tri^tubhs and two lengthy prose passages — but it is, in all prob-
ability, the shortest version of the parvan now extant, since it omits many
passages which are found in other versions and manuscripts, while it does not
contain new additions of any consequence. The text includes many archaic
survivals in point of linguistic usage and shows what may fairly be regarded
as “difficult readings” (lect, diff,), in comparison with those of other
manuscripts.

The most striking omission of the Ka^miii version is the story of UrvaSJ
(adhy. 45-46 of the Vulgate =pa‘ssage No. 6 of our App. I), which idates
how Arjuna is tempted by Urva-SI during his isojoum in Indra’s heaven, and


i The KaMii character of the text of our Sarada manuscript, which is sug-
gested by the script (^rada) and the writing material (bhurjapatra), is confirmed
not only by the reading in the third pada of the introductory mantra

; but also by the regular onussion of the word in such reference as
further by such Ka^miri spellings of names like^^^OT (for^gj^)
in 3. 17. 22. corresponding to ^for in the Viitfa ; RAGHU Vira,

Introdurtion to the Virataparvan, p. xi. The Bharutcmmjmi h^ in 3. 159

how he refuses her advances on the ground that she is ah ancestress of his.
Although this piquant story has permeated all Versions of the epic except the
Ka4nflri (Sj and some K), there is no reason to doubt that it is a late addi-
tion. The highly erotic description of the voluptuous hetare of the gods, Urvali,
with its pronounced sex appeal, is in my opinicm totally incompatible with
the epic setting, which lacks all “ feminine ” interest and esdiews all erotic
topics as such. The stanzas I refer to are (App. I. No. 6. lines 50-57— Bom-
bay ed. 3. 46.8-11 = Calcutta! dd. 3. 1824-1827) :

{20} The spurious character of this lengthy erotic interlude seems to me
to be further revealed by two stanzas of pkalasruii with which the passage ends
(App. I, No. 6, lines 157-163=Bomb. ed. 3. 46. 62-63-Cal. ed. 3, 1877-
1878) :

The object of the interpolations seems to be also clear. It is primarily
intencted to motivate Arjuna’s masquerading as the dancmg master to Prin-
cess Uttara in the harem at the court of Virata, which is narrated in the
next parvan. The devout see in it a trial, a test, to see if Arjrma’s mind was
as pure as his body was strong. Arjuna withstands the test successfully. But
the reward he gets for his patience and self-contrd is a curious raie : he is
cursed by the angry and disappointed nympdi that he would live as a amuch
among women ! This apparent curse is, however, looked upon as a blessing
in disguise, for it was to take effect and serve its purpose in the thirteenth
year of the exile through which Arjuna along with his brothers must remain
unrecognized {ajAatiavdsa) . -

This jejune inventicm creates, however, many oomplicaticxis not foreseen
by the interpolator, as it is unfortunately contradicted by Arjuna himself in

the very next parvan, when he confesses to Uttara, that though he has been
telling people that he is a eunuch (4. 10. 8-9), he is in reality nothing of the
kind, and that he has only been practising strict continence, having taken the
vow of rigid celibacy for one full year by order of his eldest brother, Yudhi§-
thira (4. 40. 12-13) :

If that be so, then we must assume that either Urva^'s curse had failed
to materialize or — ^what is more plausible — ^that Arjuna was never under any
curse such as the one implied in this interpolation. Such an interpolation
could have been made only when it was considered necessary that Arjuna
ought in reJality to have been a eunuch to be admitted into the ladies’ apart-
ments at the Virata court, or at least to justify his specific statement to the
effect that he was a eunuch. But this appalling realism is as clumsy as it is
unnecessary. The original conception was obviously quite different. At the
end of the twelfth year of their exile Dharma tells Yudhi!§thira that they
cculd go to Virata’s kingdom in any capacity or with any profession, and no
one would recognize them under any circumstances. Their samkatpa would
be so strong that they would appear to others in any shape or form desired
by themselves, without any external aid or make-up (3. 298. 17, 19) :

In these circumstances I think there is not much doubt that the sus-
pected episode is in fatt a clumsy interpolation, and the circumstance that
the iSarrada version lacks is only an additional proof of the superiority of
this version.

I may add here that the whole story is likewise missing not only in the
Bhdratamanjart but also in the fragmentary but excellent Devanagari manus-
cript of the Araioyakaparvan belonging to the Bombay Branch of the Royal
Asiatic Society (No. 966, fol. 43b), which I have occasionally consulted in
doubtful cases.^

Further particulars of the iSarada version will be found under the account
of the ‘‘ K ” version, which follows next, and with which the Sarad§ verson
is intimately connected.

INTRODUCTION l63

A facsimile of a! page of the “Sarada Codex’' (i§i) appears as the fron-
tispiece of this volume. The text is 3. 45. 1-25.

The “ K ” Version.

This version, as is the! case of the other parvans, is a specific Devanagari
version, closely related to the iSarada, and clearly differentiated frc^ the so-
called Devanagari version. The manuscripts comprising this version must in
part be merely Devanagari copies of Sarada originals and may in part repre-
sent the version of a province or a region adjoining the iSarada zone, which
it has not been possible to localize more precisely.

That the manuscripts of the K version are akin to and cognate with
may be seen from the numerous readings common to Si and K (with or with-
out seme other E>evanagari manuscripts). But it is demonstrated especially
forcibly by their common omission of certain important and well-known pas-
sages found in all other manuscripts, or at least in all other manuscripts of
the Northern recension. Of such passages, given in our App. I, the most
important are numbered 16-18, 22, 27 and 31.

Of these passages No. 16, which forms a separate adhyaya of about 130
lines, and is a medley of legends — among them the story of Narakasura and
the legend of the rescue of the Earth by Vi?nu in the Boair incarnation, — is
omitted in all five' manuscripts of the group i§i K, besides Di.g of the North-
ern recension. It is, in other words, characteristic cf the Mid-Indian group,
Bengali and late Devanagari. — ^Passage No. 17 (42 lines), describing the
return of the Pajnjdavas to the hermitage at Badari, has permeated more
widely, and is now found not only in the entire Southern recension but also
in all manuscripts of the Northern recension except K (with Here

also we notice that the group tSi K is clearly distinguished from the typical
Central sub-recension B Dc Dn 04.^. — ^No. 18 is a short passage of 24 lines
of exactly the same type ; that is to say, it is omitted in K (with some
other allied Devanagari manuscripts) in opposition to the typical Mid-Indian
group B Dc Dn D^.^. K3 secondarily incorporates ip its text only the first
four lines of the passage, which is as indication of the manner in which the
additions of the Central slib>-recension (B D) haVe contaminated the Sarada-
K version. — Another passage tof that type is No. 22 (giving the names of
Skanda); which is omitted in the whole group (i§i K), with £22} the single
exception of tfie conflated manuscript Kg. — ^The next passiage of that kind is
No. 27, a lengthy passage of 87 lines describing in detail how Jayadratha,
after being, released from captivity by Yudhi^thira, seeks the help of the god
Mahiadeva in order to avenge himself ; it is found in all Northern manuscripts
except §1 K Dj. — The last passage in our list is No. 31, a long spun out lament
by Yudhi^thira on seeing his brothers lying on the ground as if dead near
the Enchanted Lake, a passage which is also found in all Northern manus-
cripts except iSi K (with Dj. 3. 5).

Notwithstanding the fact that the manuscripts comprising the K version
show many ^riking agreements which distinguish them from other groups,
the K group itself cannot be said to be quite homogeneous. Of these is
distinctly conflated and rather more deeply contaminated than the others.
While preserving a' large number of Ka§m5ri readings, it sides frequently
(especially in the early adhyayas) with the BengaJi-Devanagari group ; at
times even showing readings peculiar to the late Nilakaaitha tradition. Kj
is really a manuscript of the same type, though the degree of contamination
is ccmsiderably less. K3, on the other hand, sha!res with iSj many unique
readings, coming closest to it. Indeed I am inclined to regard the concordant
readings of ahd K3 as the specific Kasmiri readings. In K4 the last manus-
cript of the K version, the contamination has gone yet further than in any
other K manuscript, incorporating occasionally not merely Southern read-
ings, but sporadically even what are diaracteristic Southern insertions.

I append here eixamples of readings showing special affinity between
and K3 (references are to adhyayas and slokas) :

Sporadic contamination of from S is seen in the insertion 159*, and in
pa'ssage No. 4 of App. I (cf. v. 1. 3. 38. 18).

Manuscripts Di _3 of the Devanagari version show pronounced affinities
with the K version, often supporting the specific readings and omissions of
the latter, and they might have been classed under the K version.

The Bengali Versicn.

Our four Bengali manuscripts form on the whole a very homogeneous
group, presenting generally a single common reading. The version has very
close affinities|iwith £24} a particular type of Devanagari manuscripts repre-
sented by our Dn D 4 .P (with or without Dc). These two groups — B and Dc
Dn D 4 .,. — ^show as a rule the same readings, and contain the same insertions. A
notable exception is 939*, which is a specific Bengali insertion lacking even in
Dc D 4.6 and found only in Dn of the Devanagairi manuscripts.

The affinity of B (Dc) Dn D 4.6 (often with the conflated manuscript
K 2 ) is exemplified by the following rdaciings :

11. 27 Ks B Dn D 4 .G : rest

Similarly B (Dc) Dn D 4 . 6 , differing from most other manuscripts, have
the following short additions : 446*, 448*, 455* (also in two Southern
MSS.) 466*, 467*, 477*, 498*, 512*, (with KJ, 532*, (with D3), 540*,
541*, 684*, 806*, (with K 3 ), 844*, etc., etc.

The Devanagari Versions {other than K).

I have divided the Devanagari Versions into three groups : ( 1 ) the
Version of Caturbhuja ; (2) the Version of Nilakantha ; and (3) the Com-
posite Version. The first two are the versions respectively of the commen-
tators Chaturbhuja and Nilakantha, being accompanied by their glosses ; the
third is a group of Devanagari manuscripts not associated with any commen-
tary.

The Devanagari Version of Caturbimja,

The version of the commentator Caturbhuja has little to recommend for
itself. It generally sides with the BD group, showing a slight preference for
B ; thus B and Dc have a coihmon insertion 415*, not found in other manus-
cripts of our critical apparatus. But it is definitely superior to the version
of Nilakaa?tha, in so far that it lacks many of the very clearly spurious addi-

tions of the latter. The best known of such additions is a passage of 39
lines (App. I, No. 12) inserted in the Nala Episode after our 3. 62. 10, which
is found only in K 2 Dn Dg and is comparable to the passage substituted in
K 4 for stanzas 1-17 of our adhy. 62 (cf. App. I, No. 10). Especially
in the later adhyayas of this parvan, Dc and Dg go tojgether, showing numer-
ous agreements peculiar to themselves. Dc shows some unique additions,
though their number is small ; examples are 129* and 402*, both being one-
line insertions.

Manuscripts of Caturbhuja’s commentary on different parvans are avail-
able ; that on the Virata has been published by the Gujarati Printing Press
(Bombay 1915). It is not unlikely that Caturbhuja had written a commen-
tary on the whole of the Mahabharata, though it is doubtful whether com-
plete manuscripts of the whole of his commentary are now extant. The
manuscripts I have hitherto seen were invariably of individual parvans
separately handed down.

{25} Very little is known about this scholiast. He bore the surname or
title Misra, like his fellow commentator Arjuna Misra. It is therefore likely
that he hails from Eastern India. It has not been possible to fix his chronology
with precision even in relation to the five major Mahabharata commentators,
Devabodha, Vimalabodha, Sarvajna-Narayana, Arjunamisra and Nilakantha.
But it is most unlikely that he is a very early commeftitator.'^ In our manus-
cripts the* commentary is called Vakyadipika (fol. 1) :

This name is analogous to the titles of the commentaries by Devabodha
and Arjunamisra, Jndnadipikd and Arthadipikd respectively ; compare also
the title of Nilakafitha’s commentary Bhdratn-bhdvadipa,

The Devmdgml Version of Nilakant\ha : the Vulgate,

The version of Nilakantha has never inspired confidence, and in the case
of the present parvan, it is singularly disappointing. It contains (along with
some other manuscript groups) fourteen additional adhyayas, some of which
are palpably very late intenxilations. Notable among the latter are adhy.
262-263 of the Vulgate (our App. I, No. 25), which relate how Duryodhana
sends the I?!§i Durvasas, with 10,000 disciples, to Yudhisthira at a moment
when the latter would not be able to feed such an alarming crowd of hungry
mendicants. In answer to Draupadrs prayers, however, tSii Krsna appears,
all of a sudden, from Dvaraka, and so contrives . it that the mendicant
fraternity, without having eaten a morsel of food, inexplicably feels all of a
sudden completely satiated and slinks away in fear and trepidation. They
vanish without even making an effort to e'xplain the situation and express

their apologies to Yudhisthira, who had managed in the meantime to cook
food enough to feed that astonishing large troop of beggars. This naive

story, which is not without an element of humour, is found only in Dci

besides Dn, a very poor collection of manuscripts, and is therefore
obviously a very late interpolation. Its omission from our text, I feel sure,
will not be regretted.

The Vulgate contains many lines which are extremely weakly supported,
at least by manuscripts of our critical apparatus. Thus, besides Dn, 5”' is
found only in D5 ; 25* only in K3 ; 30* only in Kg Dg ; 48* only in :
50* and 55* only in Kg ; 874* only in ; 1193* only in D3 ; and passage

No. 32 of App. I (a long interpolation of 72 lines) only in G3 !

Dn also shows a surprisingly large number of unique readings, not found
in my other manuscript, a few of which are noted below as illustrations :

Owing to the ambiguity of the word snw:, it is not possible to say for
certain whether Nilakantha is here referring to eastern commentators or
merely to old commentators, but he probably means the latter, as he calls
easterners “ Gaudas.”

Nilakantha appears to have been an adept in the Kama-sastra also. In
the course of his commentary on the chapter describing the general dege-
neracy of the Kali age, he discusses certain pornographic details with a frank-
ness which is as astonishing «s it is disconcerting. The stanza in question is

Nilakantha’s guru Narayana-tirtha — not to be confused with the Maha-

The Composite Devandgan Version.

The Devanagari has always been found to be a composite version. Our
composite Devanagari manuscripts may be roughly divided into three groups.

(1) The best group, from our view-point, is Di_3 which frequently agrees
wdth §i K (but especially K4) in opposition to other D manuscripts and
might have been classed under the K version. Of these D2 agrees, however,
frequently — especially in later adhyayas — ^with Dc, the version of Caturbhuja.

( 2 ) Then there is the group which generally agrees with B Dc Dn.

( 3 ) The remaining manuscript D5 is in a class by itself, presenting a text
which is, for large parts, almost the same as that of the Nilakantha version,
but which shows exceptionally some noteworthy discrepancies. Groups 2
and 3 are frequently seen in combination, and we accordingly very often get
a wider group B Dc Dn D4.C (sometimes joined by K2).

The affinity of the group Di_3 is exemplified by the following concordant
readings of these three manuscripts.

1. 3 Di _3 cT^ : ( Parasm. ) : rest ^ ( Atm. ) qfrm:

1. 5 D1.3 : Other MSS. ( text ),

1. 13 D1.3 : other MSS. U w( or gg

!• 14 Di- 3 : other MSS. 3^( text ),

1. 15 ( Parasm. ) rest ( Atm. )

1. 34 Di .3 : rest qR!#n:

2. 5 Di _3 Iff jf^: ; rest ( by transp. )

6. 22 Dj .3 : rest

48. 29 Di _3 ifqx ; other MSS. ( text),

167. 19 Dj .3 jffvff ; other N MSS. ( text ) etc., etc.

Examples of insertions, almost peculiar to Dj., and showing the close
affinity between these three manuscripts, are : 182* (with K,,), 288*, 334*
(with K,), 1025*, 1186*, 1188*, 1190*, 1194* (latter four with KJ, etc., etc.

As remarked above, the group D,.3, differing from other Devanagari
manuscripts, frequently agrees with S, K. Examples of insertions common
to Si K and Di-j (often with D5) are : 640*, 707*, 711*, 715*, etc. etc.

Group Di-a is important for the reason that it lacks (like S, K) many
of the interpolations of the B D group ; e.g. 44*, 128*, 130*, 131*, 133*, 162*,

etc., etc., etc.


The Telugu Version,

Only two manuscripts of the Telugu version were collated, of which one
(|^s is often the case with these manuscripts) is certainly conta‘minated, to
a very high degree, from {28} Northern! sources. In such conflated parts, T.
is generally associated with G^. Examples of such contamination will be found
below, under the Grantha version.

Ti, differing from Tg often side's with G^ Mjl (with or without M2),
giving what app>ears to be the real Southern rc'ading.

For examples of contamination of T2 through the Northern recension,
cf. 174*, 248*, 484*, 568*, 570*, 572*, 577*, 661*, 673*, 932*, (with MJ.
991 *„ etc., etc. Many of these are marginal insertions, added sec. m.

The Grantha Version.

Most of our Grantha manuscripts are unfortunately contaminated from
the Northern recension. The contamination is particularly noticeable in the
case of G3, and it increases towards the end of the parvan ; so much so that
in the final chapters G3 often omits the specific insertions of the Southern
recension, absorbing at the same time the characteristic insertions of the
Northern ! Such manuscripts are valuable for a study of the fusion of
recensionsi.

Examples of omission in G3 of specific Southern insertions are : 1050
1059*, 1060*, 1061*, 1062*, 1069*, 1071*, 1077*, 1082*, 1085*, 1086*,

1091*, 1092*, 1093*, 1102*, 1114*, 1137*, 1138*, 1139*, 1142*, 1146*,

1148*, 1149*,, 1152*, 1154*, 1226*, 1343*, 1372*, 1373*, etc., etc.— Examples
of the incorporation of Northern insertions in G3 (sometimes with TJ are :
1046*, 1048*, 1063*', 1065*, 1066*, 1067*, 1073*, 1074*, 1088*, 1103*,

1120*, 1126*, 1131*, 1134*, 1167*, 1203*, 1224*, 1226*, 1227*, 1229*,

1230*, 1279*, 1331*, 1337*, 1358*, 1365*, 1382*, 1385*, etc., etc. ; and passages
Nos. 24, 27, and 32 of App. I.

But the most striking instance of conflation is the inclusion in G3 of our
final adhyaya (299), which is regularly transposed in all genuine Southern
manuscripts to the beginning of the Virataparvan. The evidence of G3 is
thus seen to be fully inconclusive and therefore untrustworthy for the consti-
tution of the Grantha version and the Southern recension.

The M^alayalam Version.

While forming an integral part of the Southern recension, the Malaya-
1am version has its own peculiarities, which distinguish it clearly trom the
T G version, as regards both readings and insertions. Here is a list of T G



172 araivjyakApArvan

insertions, which are lacking in the Malayalam version : 183*, 218*, 232*,
243*, 286*, 356*, 620*, 667*, 674*, 685*, 802*, 803*, 805*, 824*, 856*,
859*, 867*, 868*, 869*, etc., etc. — On the other hand, M also shows a certain
number of specific insertions which are not known to the Telugu and Grantha
versions, such as 307*, 494*, 560*, 581*, 949*, 1028*, 1041*, 1083*, 1158*,
1262*, 1336*, etc., etc. — Nearly all of these insertions (of both types) are
single-line insertions ; a few are of two lines.

But our M is not homogeneous, and exhibiting among them-
selves numerous differences. shows clear signs of contamination from
Northern sources, and is by no means a good representative of the Malaya-
lam version. Examples of Northern accretions in M. are 96*, 99*,, 466*,
516*, 796*, 955*, eta etc. is again often excepted from the common
Southern reading, as in 3. 41. 24 : S (except Mg) against N

(with MJ £29} where agrees with N. M. (like G;{)

also omits a few of the typical Southern insertions; e.g., 102*, 723*. is
not altogether free from contamination from some Northern source or sources
as is indicated by 629*, 677*, 932* (with marg. sec. m.), etc.,, etc.

A very good example of the contamination of from N is furnished
by the conflated reading of M 2 in 3. 22. 8. N reads op-
posed to S, which has ; hut Mg reads which

is very evidently a result of the conflation of the Southern and Northern
readings: (S) ^ (N)- ^he most convincing

proof is furnished by a palpable mistake in Mg. The manuscript inserts
line 1 of a Northern additional stanza (95* )| after 3. 28. 16^*^, but line 2 of
that stanza after 16^^. The two lines of the stanza, though superfluous, do
convey some meaning when read together ; but arranged as in M^, they serve
no useful purpose except to betray the conflated character of the manuscript
in question.

With regard to the status and merit of the Malayalam version in general,
I ami glad to cite here an observation of Professor P. P. S. SaSTRI,, which I
am able to confirm from my own experience. Ip the course of his remarks
on the Southern recension in the Introduction to his edition of the Arapyaka-
parvan. Professor Sastri writes : “ Not having been subject to NSyak influ-
ence in any manner whatsoever, the tradition handed down by the Malayalam
manuscripts preserved the Grantha text, in a purer and more unmixed form
than even some comparatively early Grantha manuscripts, as the Malayalam
Mss. do not at all seem to have come into contact with the Northern Recen-
sion till very recent times''.^ This is in substantial agreement with what
I had stated in my Prolegomena to the Adiparvan regarding the Malayalam

p. iii f .

version, namely, that it is “ the best Soutkern version''''^ I am happy to find
that this cautious remark of mine has subsequently been confirmed by the
editor of the Southern Recension himself in a clear and unambiguous manner.

£30} With regard to the above figures the following particulars may be
noted. According to the count of the Calcutta edition the number of slokas in
this parvan is 17,478. But this calculation misses the correct figure by several
thousands. The Calcutta Pandits responsible for the edition, who were
apparently not very good mathematicians, have made repeated mistakes in
the counting of the lines, being evidently baffled by the complicacies of calcu-
lation at the turn of the century ! They have numbered the lines, by fives,
without committing any mistake up to 3095. They make their first mistake
by putting down the next figure (after 3095) as 4000, in place of 3100 ; and
this is followed by several other lapses of that type ! The correct total as
computed by JacobP is 12,848 as shown above. — The figure' for the slokas of
the Bombay edition has been taken from the edition of text and Marathi
translation by Kashinath alias Bhau Shastri Lele of Wai (Saka 1821), who
has counted the stanzas! in his edition, adhyaya by adhyaya ; and, after
correcting his own errors in three different places, gives the correct figure,
according to him, at the end of the Vanaparvan volume (p, 1344) as 12,002.3

of the "Vanaparvan.”





174 arainjyakaparvan

P. P. S. Sastri’s Southern Recension has been given by himself in the Intro-
duction to the second part of his Araaniyakaparvan (vol. 5, p. xiv). — ^The
figure for the critical text has been intentionally left blank by me, since the
parvan contains two prose adhyayas, in addition, toi a large number of Tri^-
tubh stanzas, and it is difficult to compute their equivalent in slokas. Indeed
the figures given for the other editions are all defective for the same retison.
In fact they are all purely fictitious^ being obtained by the addition of figures
for the stmzas and prose sections, but may be taken to represent a very rough
approximation of the extent. It will thus be realized that it is futile to com-
pare these figures with the Parvasamgraha figures, which are often themselves
doubtful. It has been the general experience that ancient figures, when at all
complicated, seldom come out quite right. And there is no reason to think
that fhe Parvasamgraha figures for the number of stanzas are an exception
to the rule.

We do not expect strict agreement between our figures and the Parva-
sarhgraha figures in respect of the number of stanzas in such a voluminous
work but we do expect some agreement as regards the number of adhyayas.
It is, therefore, surprising to find that almost all extant manuscripts contain
about 30 adhyayas at least more than the figure given by the Parvasam-
graha ! This discrepancy is the more striking, as the manuscripts of the
Parvasamgraha, of all versions and recensions without exception, agree — for
a change — in giving the same figure for the number of adhyiayas, namely,
269. As regards the manuscripts of the Aranyaka, the Ka^miri (Sarada)
     and the Southern manuscripts agree in having about 300 adhyayas, while the
     Central Sub-recetision (Bengali-Devanagari group) show in fact about 315
     adhyayas. The former may be taken as the more reliable figure. Professor
     P. P. S. Sastri’s device of arriving at the Parvasarhgraha figure (269), by
     omitting arbitrarily about 31 colophons actually contained in all of his
     manuxripts is hardly commendable.

{31} Due to these discrepancies between the data of the Parvasalmgraha
and the manuscripts, which are patent, two probabilities are presented to us :
either, the compiler of the Parvasalmgraha had made a mistake in counting
the adhyiayas, or some thirty adhyayas have been added to our parvan since
the time of the Parvasamgraha count. No third explanation is possible, and
both these , are significant alternatives. If we admit that there has been an
original error in the counting of adhyayas, it is rou^ly a mistake of 30 in
300, that is 10 per cent., which is indeed a very high percentage of error. If
we could prove even two or three such errors, the value of the figures in the
Parvasamgraha will dwindle down to an insignificant quantity. Ifi on the
other hand,~~as is more likely— our critical text contains about 30 adhyayas
(equivalent to about 1500 stanzas) more than the text which was the basis
of the Parvasamgraha calculation, then even in the matter of general contents



INTRODUCTION

it is nowhere near the Parvasamgraha standard and must be very far re-
moved from the hypothetical archetype of the Mahabhiarata ; for it is hardly
credible that as many as thirty colophons could get displaced or lost in a
mere aggregate of 300 colophons. There are moreover no means to excise
these spurious accretions except by methods of higher criticism, which owing
to the peculiar character of our work would be a very delicate operation
indeed, and withal one of doubtful utility. We thus see how easy it would
be to delude ourselves that just by collating a small fraction of the extant
manuscripts, we could arrive at the archetype.

The passage in the Parvasamgraha giving the conte^nis of this parvan
exists in two versions (1. 2. 111-126) : the longer version of the Vulgate
being based on the Central Sub-recension (the Bengali-Devanagari) , the
shorter version on the Kasmiri-Southem tradition. I have adopted the latter
in this edition, relying mainly on the superiority of the agreement between
what appear prima jmie to be independent versions. But I think it is pos-
sible to fortify the argument in the present case from intrinsic considerations.
It will be seen that in the shorter version, the sequence of the* incidents men-
tioned in the list of contents does not tally with the actual sequence in the
original text of the parvan, given uniformly by all extant manuscripts ; the
sequence of the longer version on the other hand tallies exactly with the
present text. Moreover, the latter — ^namely, the longer version — is much
fuller, containing as it does far more details. Is it now likely that the
Kasmiri and Southern traditions had independently— or in collusion with
each other — discarded the original fuller and more correct version in favour
of a shorter and defective version ? It seems far more probable that the
defects of the original short version, which has been preserved independently
by the Ka^nnrl and Southern traditions, had been noticed early, and that had
led to its being modified and corrected by the revisers of the Central Sub-
recension, which then adopted the revised version of the contents.

The Parvasamgraha mentions sixteen sub-parvans, which is also our
number, but the Vulgate has twenty-two ; that is six more. The latter
number is obtained by adding to the list the names of certain episodes like
the Nalopakhyina, Riamopakhyiana, Savitryupakhyiana, which originally did
not form separate sub-parvans at all, as will be seen from the following table.

The limits of these sub-parvans can be fixed, as a rule, with tolerable
certainty with the aid of the colophons of our manuscripts, which give indi-
cations sufficient for purposes of approximate identification.


OTHER EDITIONS

Of the numerous printed editions of the Arajiyaka-parvan (almost uni-
formly passing under the name Vanaparvan) , I have consulted the following :

(1) The edifia prmceps of the Mahabharata printed in Calcutta between 1834
and 1839. Its Vanaparvan comprises, according to its own data, 17478 ^lokas in
314 adhyayas,, It gives in general the Nilakaajtha version, which we have called
the Vulgate and which has been reproduced in many subsequent editions, sometimes
accompanied by translation and commentary. The editio princeps still remains the
best edition available of the Vulgate version of the Araioyakaparvan, though that
is not saying very much.

(2) The oblong pothi-form edition, published by Ganapat Krishna ji in
Saka 1799 in Bombay (hence commionly known as the Bombay edition). It is
accompanied by Nilakajatha'a commentary, Bharata^bhaviidipa, and should there-
fore represent the £33} Nilakaotha tradition. But it oohtains as a matter of fact

that is, the Pativratamahatmya precedes the Ramopakhyana.

quite a large number of lines and readings not countenanced by Nilakantha himself.
The text is divided into 315 adyhiayas, and contains (according to some editions
which give the aggregate number of stanzas in the parvan) 12,002 stanzas.^

(3) The Kumbhakonam edition published by T. R. Krishnacharya and T. R.
Vyasacharya, and described on its title-page as' “A New Edition, mainly based on
the South Indian Texts”. Its Vanaparvan comprises (according to the Index
Volume) 12,476 llokas and 315 adhyayas, but contains like our misch-codices a good
number of specific Northern passages unknown to the true Southern recen^n.2

(4) Professor P. P. S. Sastri’s Southern Recension, Volumes 4-5, comprising
(according to his own count) 11,136 slokas dividied into 269 adhyayas.

As these old editions contain nothing of any serious importance which
is not to be found in the different manuscripts already collated for this edi-
tion, they have been only sparingly used and cursorily studied by me. The
following observations may be of use to those who may wish to consult these
editions.

As remarked above, there are some gilave mistakes in the numbering of
the stanzas of the Calcutta edition. The first mistake occurs after stanza
3095, where the next number suddenly jumps up to 4000 (when it should be
3100). Similarly after 8895, the following number jumps up to 9900 (when
it should be 8900). For the third time, after 10,095, the following number
is given as 11, OCX) (instead of 10,100). For the fourth time, after 11,095,
the next number jumps up to 12j000, when it should be 11,1(K). At the next
step, however, the number equally suddenly jumps back to 10,200 ! Thus
at one place three successive numbers (which are supposed to increase by
five at each step) are 11095, 12,000, 10,200 ! ! After adhy. 117, there ap-
pear to be no new mistakes, and from that point onwards the numbering
may be taken to be continuous and correct. But the result of these earlier
miscalculations is that the extent of the parvan appears to be 17,478, when
it should in reality be (according to Jacobi’s computation) 12,848, the Par-
vasairiigraha figure being 11,664 ! Several numbers occur twice, and in giv-
ing reference to the Calcutta edition, it is advisable to cite the adhyaya num-
ber as well.

The Bombay edition, like the Calcutta, is based on the Nilakaiotha ver-
sion but (like yet other editions of the Mahabharata prepared in the same
fashion, e.g., the Chitrashala edition) does not represent the Nilakaiptha tra-
dition very faithfully. In the footnotes to the text, and the critical notes at
the end, I have frequently drawn attention to unwarranted departure from
Nilakaaitha’s original text. The vagaries are small and of no great conse-
quence, but they are there nevertheless. They prove very clearly that tdth-

^ According to the Chitrashala Edition the number is 11,859, though ’the text
is precisely the same in both editions.

^ It seems not to have been noticed that in the old printed editions though the
name of this parvan is given on the title-page and in the captions as ” Vanaparva
the colophons invariably give the name correctly as Araiiya-ur — Araijyakaparvan

any conscious effort^ at alteration or emendation — and perhaps, notwith-
standing the half-hearted efforts to preserve intact the received text-
discrepancies do arise in course of time, and the text does drift away from the
norm, imperceptibly, within a relaUvely short period of time. Thus in 3. 9.
7 fcr our (which is documented {34} uniformly by almost all our

manuscripts), the different editions printed in the Bombay province, and exa-
mined by me, all have the reading a reading which has not been found

in a single manuscript ! In 3. 83. 30, the Bombay edition (with the Kum-
bhakonam and some other editions) reads when the Nilakantha

manuscripts themselves (along with a host of other manuscripts) have the
correct reading {lect. diff.), which is the reading of the constitut-
ed text ! Likewise in 3. 249. 8, out edition reads which is the read-

ing offered by all manuscripts collated for our edition, except one inferior
Grantha manuscript (G3), which reads and yet this latter reading

( been adopted in many of the Bombay editions .

Professor Sastri’s edition is based chiefly on four manuscripts, of
which one ( ^ ) is in Telugu script, two ( 3T, ^ ) in Grantha, and one ( ^ }
in Malayalam. For adhyayas 67-130, that is, for about 64 adhyayas out of
his total of 269 adhyayas, a fifth manuscript was partly utilized. Ac-
cording to the editor, manuscript e? (Grantha) “represents the Principal
Text printed It bears a date corresponding to a.d. 1795, that is, it is less
than 150 years old. As an edition of the Southern recension, Professor Sas-
tri’s edition is preferable and indeed much superior to the Kumbhakonam
edition. But it seems to me that in: its preparation the manuscript material
has not been as fully and carefully utilized as it should have been. Judging
by the Southern manuscripts collated for our edition and examined by me,
which cannot be very different frdm his, it should seem that too often
Sastri’s edition agrees in its mislections and other short-comings with the
Kumbhakonam edition to the exclusion of the genuine Southern tradition. I
miss in his critical apparatus many of the readings which are given uniformly
by all Southern manuscripts. Even if the editor, for some occult reasons, did
not wish to adopt in his text these perfectly good and authenticated Southern
readings, they should have appeared in the footnotes as discarded readings.
Instances of Northern readings having contaminated his text will be found in
the following stanzas (reference is to slokas and adhyayas of his text) :

1. 27^ 28^ 2. 13i^ 22^ 46", 71J^ 80J^ 4. 8^ 8", 15^ 5. l^ 6", 7", 22^; 7. 2^
   2", 9^ 23* ; 8. 17" ; 10. 49^ 55^ 66^ ; 11. 60i", 72i" ; 12. 23i"', 41* ; 13. 1* ;
14. 6^ 17. ; 18. 5* ; ^tc., etc. These examples have been select-

ed at random from the first US adhyayas only ; but such lapses keep turning
up on page after page up to the end of the book.


As his edition is based on four manuscripts only and even these manus-
cripts appear not to have been rigorously collated and fully utilized, I should

179


hesitate to accept his text as a true representative of the Southern recension,
even ignoring the deficiencies of the critical apparatus.

In the division into adhyayas, Professor Sastri seems to have followed
the Grantha edition of Sarahhojirajapuram (Tanjore District) printed in
1895. The reason given by Professor Sastri for following the edition instead
      of the manuscripts is that the division of the Tanjore edition “accords ex-
      actly with the enumeration of the number of chapters for the Vana Parvan
      (sic) in the AnukramainJkadhyaya of both the Northern and the Southern
      Recensions*'.^ This is a dangerously vicious circle ! As the Tanjore edition
      does not pretend that it has followed any manuscript tradition, the adhyaya
      division of both these editions (Tanjore andi Sastri) remain unsupportel by
      manuscript authority £35} and therefore perfectly arbitrary. Adopting the Par-
      vasarhgraha figure, Sastri has divided the parvan into 269 adhyayas, while
      the actual numbering of the adhyayas in Southern manuscripts reaches the
      figure 300 approximately, the number according to our Southern manuscripts
      varying between 299 and 302.

While Sastri by arbitrary elimination of colophons, has equated his
adhyaya-number to that given by the Parvasamgraha, he could not make the
figures for the slokas tally ! According to the Parvasarhgraha the number of
slokas should be 11,664. “ The total number of stanzas, *’ says Professor

Sastri, “printed in the Text of the Southern Recension comes to 11,136,
which is short by 528 As his text is short by over 500 stanzas, his equa-
tion of the number of adhyayas with the Parvasamgraha figure, by arbitrary
omission of about thirty colophons, which are found in all Southern manus-
cripts, has no significance, and remains a piece of useless and unmeaning
manipulation.

It is exactly seventeen years since I took over charge of the Mahabharata
work, and reorganized, on somewhat different lines, this Department of the Insti-
tute, having profited by the experiments and experiences of my predecessor, the
late lamented Mr. N. B. Utgikar, m.a. During this interval the Mahabharata
Department of the Institute has prepared and) published critical editions of four
whole parvans (in this sequence) : the Adi (1933), the Virata (1936), the Udyoga
(1940), and now the Araajyaka (1942). These four parvans comprisfe, according
to the data of the Parvasamgraha-parvan, about 28,4(X) “Islokas". In addition to
this : the Sabhaparvan, which is being edited by Professor Franklin Edgerton of
the Yale University (U.S.A.) and which has been ready for some time, has been
taken up for printing, and its printing has made considerable progress ; nearly the
whole of the text, along with the critical apparatus pertaining to it, has been
printed off, and the printed portion may even be issued in the near future, as a
separate fascicule. Furthermiore, the press-copy of the BhX§maparvan, which is be-
ing edited by Rao Bahadur Dr. S. K. Belvalkar, i.e.s (Retd), is almost ready
and is now undergoing final revision at the hands of its editor. Funds permitting,
it will be sent to the press in the not very distant future. Thus, during these sevcn-

ARANYAKAPARVAN


teen years the Insititute has critically dealt with the first six parvans of the Great
Epic : the Adi, Sabha, Araoyaka, Virata, Udyoga and Bhisma. These six parvans
make up a total of about 36,800 *'islokas’', out of the aggregate of about 82,150
“slokas*' comprising the entire Mahabharata, a portion which is approximately 45
per cent, of the aggregate, excluding of course the Supplement ”, Harivaih§a, which,
for the time being, we have placed aside. This is no mean achievement, we think.
The part of the epic critically dealt with so far is, I imagine, in bulk, about four
times as great as the Iliad and the Odyssey put together, and one and a half times
as great as our Ramayana.

That a work of this nature and these dimensions is not one man’s job is very
evident. Many collaborators, sympathisers, friends, benefactors and patrons have
contributed to such measure of success as has been achieved so far, and they in-
clude among them, princes and potentates, persons owning manuscripts, curators
and librarians, printers and parvan-editors, not to speak of the General Editor
and his modest staff in £36} the background. Surely the most potent among these
multifarious contributory factors have been —

srfe 5^ ST I

— the generous patrons of learning, who out of regard for this venerable monument
of Indian antiquity, this great and lustrous heritage of Bharatavarsa, have liberal-
ly supplied the Institute, all through these years, with funds to carry on this cost-
ly but very vital work.

First among these generous patrons stands in our estimation Shrimant Bala-
saheb Pant Pratinidhi, B.A., Rajasaheb of Aundh, whose princely liberality made
it, in the first instance, possible for the Institute to think of undertaking this am-
bitious project. The Rajasaheb has already paid up a large part of the Foun-
dation Grant of a lakh of rupees promised by him, and thus placed under his ob-
ligations not only the Institute but all those who love the Great Epic of India.

I have next to record the gratitude of the promotersl of this scheme — which
has now become nothing less than a great national undertaking--to a number of
other distinguished and generous donors, scattered all over India, who have con-
tributed liberally to our Mahabharata Publication Fund, the chief among them be-
ing : The Imperial Government of India, the Provincial Governments of Bombay,
Madras, Burma and United Provinces; the Gwalior, Hyderabad (Deccan), Baroda,
Bhavnagar, Phaltan, Mysore, Porbunder, Kolhapur, Patiala, Sangli, Ichalkaranji,
Ramdurg, and other Indian States, The Trustees of the Sir Dorab Tata Trust,
the Savitribai Bhat Trust, and the Tulsidas Charities also deserve a grateful men-
tion here for their kind help to our finances. We must gratefully think also of
those persons less gifted by Fortune, who have contributed vsmaller sums — with the
one idea of helping on this great cause — each according to his ability.

The Institute is indebted, for subsidies to its Mahabharata work, to the Trus-
tees of the Mahabharata Fund of Great Britain in London ; and indebted also for
a token grant, in appreciation of this work, to the British Academy of London.

And last, but not least, I must mention, in this connection,, our Alma Mater —
The University of Bombay — who has been exceptionally generous and appreciative
of our endeavours in this field, supply us with funds, lending us manuscripts, and
generally taking a very keen and active interest in the welfare and rapid progress
of our project.

In connection with further assistance rendered by extra-mural collaborators and
helpers, I must put on record our special obligations to Pandit Rajaguru Hemraj,

C.I.E., of Nepal ; as also to Professor Kshitimohan Sen, who has succeeded Profes-
sor Vidhushdchar Bhattacharya as Principal of the Visvabharati ; further to Mr.
S. Gopalan, B.A., B.L., who has succeeded the late Raosaheb Sambamurthi Rao,
as Honorary Secretary of the Saraswathi Mahal Library of Tanjore. Both these
latter gentlemen have been kind enough to carry on, in a purely honorary capacity,
the onerous and responsible task of supervising the Mahabharata collations done
in their respective institutions.

The thanks of the Institute are also due to the Curators, Trustees, and Custo-
dians of the following libraries and insititutions for keeping us equipped with the
manuscripts required for our Mahabharata work, during almost two decades : the
Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal,
the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad, the Adyar Library, the Oriental Institute of Baroda,
Madras Government £37} Library, Mysore Oriental Manuscripts Library, Sri Yadu-
giri Yatiraj Math (Melkote, Mysore), Cochin State Library, Pudukkottah State Lib-
rary, and the India Office Library (London). The Institute has also received ma-
nuscripts or photo-copies or hand- made copies of manuscripts from the Bombay
University, the Visvabharati, Dacca University, Dayananda Angk>-Vedic College of
Lahore (Research Department), Benares Sanskrit College, and Calcutta Sanskrit
College — all of whom I wish to thank! on behalf of the Institute very cordially for
their kind help in the matter. The Institute is, moreover, obliged to Sardar M. V.
Kibe, M . A . of Indore for the loan of a complete Nllakantlia manuscript of the
Mahabharata. It is further indebted for the free loan of Southern manuscripts of
the Mahabharata to the Chief of Idapalli, Mr. Kallenkara Pisharam, Mankavu
Padinnare Kovilakam, Killimangalam Nambudiripad, and to the proprietors of
the following Malabar estates ; Poomullimana, Avaijapparambu Mana, Nareri Mana,
Ponnokkottu Mana, Paliyam Estate, Channamangalam.

Once more I would fain express my gratitude for help of various kinds from
my colleagues on the Mahabharata Editorial Board, who have throughout reposed,
very generously, full confidence in me, and helped and supported me invariably in
the true spirit of camaraderie. It is sad to reflect that before we are even half-
way through our work, several members of the old Editoial Board, formed in 1925,
are no longer with us ; from among whom I remember particularly my friends
Father R. Zimmermann, SJ., Professor M. WiNTEJRNiTZ, and Mr. Vishvanath
P. Vaidya.

I have to record here my keen appreciation of the willing compliance and un-
grudging assistance I have uniformly received from members of the Permanent
Staff of the Mahabharata Department of this Institute. Mr. S. N. Tadpatrikar,
M.A., Supervisor of Collations, who is in special charge of the collations, has
been moreover, as usual, always by my side, helping me with useful suggestions,
when I was engaged in constituting the text of this extensive parvan. The critical
notes were compiled from the collation ^eets by Mr. B. G. Bhide Shastri, Mr.
D. V. Naravane, and Mr, G, G. Soman. We shall miss, in future, the expert
assistance of Mr. Bhide in several fields, who having served the Institute in the
Mahabharata Department since 1921, has now owing to old age, retired from ser-
vice. The Sarada manuscripts have been invariably collated by our Sarada expert,
Shankar Shastri Bhilavadikar, Head Shastri of the Mahabharata I>epartment. The
proof-reading has been done by the Codlator and Reader Pandit K. V. Krishnamurti
Sharma Shastri, of Erode (^th India), who is now helped in that work by Mr.
M. V. Vaidya, M. A., both of whom have worked with praiseworthy diligence,
exemplary zeal, and signal devotion to their work. Collations of Southern manus-
cripts have been done at the Institute uniformly by the Pandits K. V, Anantana-

rayan Shastri of Erode, and K. S. Vishvanath Shastri of Kolengode (South
India), both of whom also are very accurate and conscientious woilcers, exhibiting
characteristically a single-minded devotion to duty.

The superior finish of the Aranyakaparvan Volumes, from the typographical
viewpoint, is due solely to the care and thought personally bestowed on them by
my indefatigable friend Professor Dr. Raghu Vira of the International Academy of
Indian Culture, who, as part of a programme of multifarious activities for the re^
generation of our culture, has equipped at Lahore a small but efficient printing es-
tablishment — ^the £38} Arya Bharati Press — ^which is solely devoted to the cause of
the service of the arya-bhdratl for endowing Sarasvati with better vestments than she
grudgingly receives in India at the hands of very mercenary printers and publi-
shers. At great trouble and inconvenience to himself — and, I fear, even at the risk
of pecuniary loss— he undertook and has carried out successfully the printing of
these two big tomes, and thus led us safely out of the first big forest our little party
of explorers had encountered on our way to the yet distant Ut(H>ia of a complete cri-
tical edition of the Mahabharata.

If Mahai^i Kp^ina Dvaipayana Vyasa tells us that he has cried himself hoarse,
urging people to follow the Path of I^ty :

his shouting with uplifted arms has not been entirely in vain. He has not failed
in his mission. Across the reverberating corridors of Time, we his descendants can
still hear dimly his clarion call to Duty. It is in response to that call and in a
spirit of reverent homage to that sage of unfathomable wisdom — ^that embodied
Voice of the Collective Unconscious of the Indian people — ^we offer this work, pledg-
ed to broadcast to mankind, in this hour of its need and its peril, the luminous mes-
sage of the Mahajn§i :

## EPIC STUDIES

### Some Aspects of the Mahabharata Canon.

The problem of the Mahabharata textual criticism is a problem sui generis.
Here the principles of textual reconstruction must first be evolved from an
intensive study of the manuscript material and the‘ manuscript tradition.’^
They can be finally considered as settled only after prolonged and consider-
able discussion and exchange of ideas and opinions.

The vulgate text of the Mbh. is fairly readable and appears, in places,
to be even “ better ” than the critical text, because the former has been purged
by the continuous emendations of scholars for cetituries. The reader is con-
sequently apt to prefer, at first sight, the readings of the vulgate text, but a
thorough and sympathetic study of the author’s language and thought and a
critical evaluation of the variants would show him that the constituted text
is sound.

Of the many reviews of the first fascicule of the critical edition of the
Mahabharata that have appeared during the past year there are two
that deserve my special attention : the review by Dr. Hermann Weller in
the Zeitschrift fur Indologie und Irmistik (vol. 6, pp. 166 ff.), and that by
Professor Edgerton in the Journal of the American Oriental Society (vol. 48,
pp. 186-190). Both reviews are evidently products of a very close study of
the text and the critical apparatus. Particularly valuable is the review by
Prof. Edgerton, who can appreciate the difficulties of the problem I have
had to confront perhaps better than most scholars, since he has had to struggle
with problems of a like nature in his valuable work on the Paficatantra and
the Vikramacarita.

In the succeeding pages I have endeavoured to set forth my reasons for
adopting in the text the readings that have commended {158} themselves to
mef, in those cases whidi have been discussed by Weller and Edgerton in
the reviews mentioned above. They concern the readings of 1, 1. 19, 42, 49,
62, 201, and of the identification of the hundred sub-parvans of the Mbh.
enumerated in the second adhyiaya of the Adiparvan, that is, in the Parvasam-
grahaparvan.2

^ Valuable hints are to be found especially in the writings of Prof. LOders.

2 As most of the references in these studies will be to the Mahabharata, all
numbers without alphabetical prefix refer to the critical edition of the epic. When
a reference is made to other edtions of the epic, I have prefixed’ to the reference an
Midicatory letter enclosed within parantheses : thus (C.) denotes the Cakutta edi-
tion, (B.) the Bombay edition, and (K.) the Kumbhakonam edition.

EPIC STUDIES


1. 1. 19 :

vedais caturbhilji samitam (v. 1 . smmniidm).

Weller suggests an emendation — ^in fact, two alternative emeindations.
He first proposes to read sammitdm for my samtdm. The former variant
is found only in one MS. which besides transposes the first two words of the‘
piada. His alternative suggestion is more radical. Seeing that the variant
preferred by him yields a pada metrically defective, he proposes to mend
matters by recasting the pada thus : caturUhih mmmitdm vedaili. This
pathya he thinks, must have been the original reading of the pMa. The
only reason Weller has adduced for rejecting the text reading is the sup-
posed intrinsic fitness of the alternate ; it suits the conteixt much better, he
believes. K^, the solitary MS. which contains the reading preferred by
Weller, stands sixth on my list of K MSS., whose relative valu« diminishes
in the order there given ; it is full of clerical mistakes, due probably to the
difficulty eixperienced by the copyist (either of this MS. or of one of its
ancestors) in deciphering the ( ? iSaradia) exemplar. I consider it an inferior
codex. With Weller’s reading we get a prior pada with the scansion

— / ^ — . Hopkins* statistical study of the relative frequency

of the different forms of the padas {Great Epic, p. 236) shows that this is
a “rare** combination. Even Weller realizes that the line does not read
smoothly and calls therefore the length of the sixth syllable a “metrical
archaism.*’ Now samitam (of the text, {159} without the anusvara) recurs
in a similar context, also at the end of a prior pada, and apparently in the
same sense in (B.) 1. 96.90 : idam hi vedaih samitam. It also occurs, in a
different context, in Susruta 2 . 346. 3 : angusphaparvasamitam. If we read
sammitdm in the passage under discussion, we should have pari passu to read
it in the two latter passages also, both of which then would be metrically
delfective ; the scansion of the first would be nearly the same as tliat of the
pSda in question, the second would end with three consecutive iambs. Are
these all instances of “ metrical archaisms *’ ? For that, it seems to me, the
documental probability of the reading perferred by Weller is not strong
enough. The text re(ading, which is mentioned by Nilakaptha as a variant,
is supported indirectly by {satnatam) and directly by Ko. 3 . 4.0 On

the other hand, Weller’s reading, as has already been remarked, is found
only in one inferior MS. Worthy of note is Nilakantha’s gloss : samitam Hi
pdphe Udydm ity arthah. The initial mistake of Weller lies in supposing that
sammitdm suits the context better than samitdm, wherelas, in point of fact,
sammmitdm is nothing more than a doublet of the other word. Weller does
not realize that his attempt to substitute an “ easier reading ” has been anti-
cipated by the scribe of K 5 , who likewise finding the emended line (metrically)
unreadable has transposed the words of the pada, reaching a new combina-
tion : caturbhir vedaih sammitdm, which according to Hopkins {loc. cit.) is
of “very rare, sporadic** occurrence. The word samita has been perfectly

correctly explained in PW. : samita {su -f mita) — sammita, “ gleiches Mass
habend, gleich.” The relation between the two words is clearly revealed by the
more familiar doublets satata : samtat\a, sahita : samhita and so on, 5/i-and sam
being the unaccented and accented forms of one and the same prefix. When
the accentual factor became inoperative, the choice was conditioned solely by
metrical considerations. The identification in the case of samita may have
been helped by contamination with sam + ita { — samgata)y “conformable
to, in harmony with ” (a meaning not unsuitable even here), or by its sup-
posed connection with sama, “ equal “ (cf. Wackernagel, Altind. Gramm.
II, 1 . § ‘30 \>p). The semantic values of the words in question being the
same, the combined {160} forcd of documental probability and metrical pre-
ference decides the question of choice incontestably in favour of the adopted
text.

The text reading really needs some further justification. Weller’s mis-
understanding of the* text is, ini my opinion, a direct confirmation of my re-
mark in thei Foreword (p. vi) that it is a lectio difficilior. The word was,
I suppose, early misunderstood. To judge by the character of the variants,
it was comnxonly, though erroneously, interpreted as sam -f ita, “ united, com-
bined with.” In this sense, in course of time, it must have been ousted by
its easier synonyms samyukta (substituted for it in B D) and sahita
(mainly in T and G). Both these readings are inadequate. Nilakaijitl'ia s
explanation caturveddrthavatlm is inadmissible ; the phrase can at best mean
catutvedaviattm\ (“possessing the four Vedas”), which is of course sheer
nonsense. Roy’s “ comprehendeth the sense of the four Vedas ” and Dutt’s
“contains the sense of the four Vedas” are dually inaccurate paraphrases
(based upon the explanation furnished by the scholiast), because the passage
in the vulgate cannot be'ar the meaning here forced! upon it. On the other
hand, the literal meaning of semtyukta or sahita is, as already re-
marked, wholly imsuitable. For what could the assembled sages melan by
saying that they wished to hear the (Mahabharata) Samhita “combined with
the four Vedas ” ?

To return to the manuscript evidence. The K group is partly corrupt
and indecisive though the majority has the text reading : Ko. y. 4. o as in text;
Kj sahitdm ; K., samUtam ; K5 smhmitdm. All these stand resolutely against
samyuktdm of the vulgate ; but, from the point of view of transcriptional
probability, none of them is wholly incompatible with samitdm of the text.
Three out of the four Malayalam MSS-, have also prewired the true reading ;
the remaining Malayalam MS. has sahitdm, the reading of the T G group.
With this data I should explain the genesis of the’ variants thus. The text
reading is a lectio difficilior, preserved in the majority of K intact, and in
the remaining MSS. of the K version in a corrupt condition. The K read-
ing being partly supported by M, there is a partial agreement between two
more or less independent versions, a condition almost wholly absent in the
13a

£164} The practice being the outcome of a natural desire to avoid the
monotony of a bald enumeration of names, it is not surprising to find that
even the Homeric epics furnish ample illustrations of it ; here is one with the
trick repeated in consecutive hemistiches (Illiad, 24.250-1) :

After having proved that the text reading is not only better documented
but in itself very plausible, we may proceed to consider whether any reason
can be suggested how the variant eva ca may have arisen. Two explana-
tions — both mere possibilities — occur to me. It is for one thing possible that
the original dtmavdn may have been deliberately suppressed in order to avoid
the monotonous reiteration of dtma at the end of three consecutive verses.
A more likely reason for the suppression may have been the lack of a copula
in the original line, which had been crowded out by the succession of three un-
usually long names (two of four syllables each, and the third one of not less
than five), taking up by themselves 13 syllables out of an aggregate of 16 of
the 41oka line.

1.1.49 :

vistkyatm ntahaj jnanam samk^epam abravit

The two rejected variants are : samk^epato ’ bravlt K V, B,m D ,4 and
sathk^pya cdbliamt B Da Dn Dr D,. ,2 S (except Gj.a M3 ). Welleh finds
samk^epato satisfactory (“ befriedigend ”). As a matter of fact, of the rejected
variants, the reading samk?ipya cabravit is far superior to the other. In it
the sense is dear ; grammatically it is correct, metrically flawless. It is nwre-
over the reading indicated by the prindple of agreranait between indepen-
d«it versions, being supported by the Ban^li and Devat&garf verdons cm the

correctly explained in PW. : samita {sa -f mita) = samumta, “ gleiches Mass

being the unaccented and accented forms of one and the same prefix. When
the accentual factor became inoperative, the choice was conditioned solely by
metrical considerations. The identification in the case of samita may have
been helped by contamination with sum 4- ite ( = samgata), “conformable

The text reading really needs some further justification. Weller’s mis-

bindd with.” In this sense, in course of time, it must have been ousted by
its easier synonyms smhyukta (substituted for it in Vj. B D) and sahita
(mainly in T and G). Both these readings are inadequate. Nilakautlia’s
explanation caturvedarthavatim is inadmissible ; the phrase can at best mean
caturHjedauatim^ (“possessing the four Vedas”), which is of course sheer
nonsense. Roy’s “ comprehendeth the sense of the four Vedas ” and Durr’s
“ contains the sense of the four Vedas ” are equally inaccurate paraphrases
(based upon the explanation furnished by the scholiast), because the passage

hand, the literal meaning of samyukta or sahita is, as already re-
marked, wholly unsuitable. For what could the assembled sages meian by
saying that they wished to hear the (Mababharata) Samhita “combined with

{164} The practice being the outcome of a natural desire to avoid the
monotony of a bald enumeration of names, it is not surprising to find that
even the Homeric epics furnish ample illustrations of it ; here is one with the
trick repeated in consecutive hemistiches (Illiad, 24.250-1) :

After having proved that the text reading is not only better documented
but in itself very plausible, we may proceed to consider whether any reason
can be suggested how the variant eva ca may have arisen. Two explana-
tions — both mere possibilities — occur to me. It is for one thing possible that
the original dtmavdn may have been deliberately suppressed in order to avoid
the monotonous reiteration of dtma at the end of three consecutive verses.
A more likely reason for the suppression may have been the lack of a copula
in the original line, which had been crowded out by the succession of three un-
usually long names (two of four syllables each, and the third one of not less
than five), taking up by themselves 13 syllables out of an aggregate of 16 of
the §loka line.

the compelling power of this agreement is weakened by the circumstance that
one Malayalam MS. and three (out of the seven) Grantha MSS. are outside
the group. Had the whole of B agreed with the whole of S, it would have
been difficult, if not impossible, for reasons explained in the previous section,

in the fact that it does not at all explain, as far as I can judge, how the other

variant, though not in the same degree. The text reading, though weakly
supported by MSS, serves admirably, in my opinion, to account for the
existence of the variahts, especially if smhksepam is taken as an adverbial
gerund in-am (Pacini’s nanud), as I think it should be ; c/. Whitney, Sans-
krit Grammar, § 995. For there would then be an inherent tendency to substi-
tute for it simpler readings, samksipya ca and samksepatah would be very
neat paraphrases of the awkward adverbial gerund : the second {samksepatah)
preserving nearly intact the original ak^aras, the first {samk^ipya) involving
a more radical change from the view-point of form, but closely following the
original in sense. The latter may, moreover, have been directly suggested by
vistlrya in the first pada which it nicely balances. I assume, of course, that
samksipy\a was introduced independently in B D on the one hand and S on
the other. In other words, I think that the concordance between certain
sections of the Northern and the Southern recensions is purely accidental, and
it is unquestionable that it could be that. I must frankly admit, however,
that there is a strong element of subjectivity in this choice, which can in no
way be said to be compelling. I prefer the text reading, fully realizing that
others may prefer either of the other two readings ; but that is precisely why
a wavy line has been printed in the text below samksepam, I doubt very
much whether any compelling reason can be advanced to prove the absolute
superiority of any one of the variants over the others.

Edgerton discusses at some length the variation amrtam : am tarn and

these : first and foremost, the text reading does not do justice to the emphatic

Edgerton discusses at some length the variation arnrtam : anrtam and
decides emphatically in favour of mrtam, Edgerton’s arguments are briefly
these : first and foremost, the text reading does not do justice to the emphatic
particle eva in the same line, which is a “ crucial word secondly, anrlam is
intrinsically far superior to the innocuous arnrtam, which has been substituted
for the original lectio difficilior by ignorant copyists who, missing the “ para-
dox ” intended, naturally gagged at attributing ‘ falsehood ’ to the epic.”
In the first place I differ from Edgerton radically as to the value and im-
portance of the word eva in the sentence. It is unquestionably true that eva
does emphasize the preceding word or words, but this is neither necessarily
nor universally true. Very frequently, especially in the epics and the

It would be clearly preposterous to see in these evu ca emphatic parti-
cles” or “crucial words” emphasizing paradoxes; £170} they are nothing
more than copulative expletives. My impression is that the epic “ poets ”
use the conjunctions m, caiva or eva ca according as they require one, two or
three syllables to fill their line ! This, I hope, will suffice to dispose of the
alleged necessity of looking for and finding any striking paradox in
this line.

But I think Edgerton is making another and a graver mistake. His
remark that “ the panegyrist of the epic [italics mine] starts out to claim that
it contains everything makes me suspect that Edgerton has possibly mis-
understood the hemistich in question. Here the subject matter of glorifica-
tion is not the epic at all. but merely the first’ adhyaya thereof. The hemis-
tich occurs in a passage at the end of the first adhyiaya, and the passage is
evidently of the nature of a phalasrutL The hemistich says : “ This is the
body of the (Maha-) Bharat a.” Here “ this refers not to the whole epic but
merely to the Anukramainl chapter mentioned in the previous stanzas. The
whole line is a subordinate {hi) clause depending upon the main clause con-
tained in the immediately preceding stanza. “ (200) He who repeats (in an
undertone, even) a little of the Anukramani at both twilights is freed immedi-
ately from as much sin as has been accumulated during the day and the night ;
(201) for, this is the body of the (Maha-)Bharata (that is) Truth and also
Immortality ! ” It is owing to its partaking of the qualities of (or, as the pane-
gyrist of the adhyaya will have it, owing to its being) Truth and Immortality
that it is able to absolve the devout reciter of the adhyaya immediately from
sin. The emphasis, if any, is on hi (“for”), not on eva. Objection may be
taken to the neuter gender of etat, since it is made to refer the Anukramani
(f.) chapter as I do here. The gender may be explained either as a case of
attraction by the gender of the predicate {vapus, n.) or as referring indiscri-
minately to anukramofii (f.) or adhyaya (m.). But if Edgerton does not
like that, I have no great objection to his translating : “ For this form of the
(Maha-)Bharata is Truth and Immortality.” According to this interpreta-
tion, the variant amtam is wholly inappropriate and inadmissible ; and in fact
on second thoughts I am inclined even to dispense with the wavy line under
amrtam.

£171} The paradox conceived by Edgerton might apply fitly to the
whole? epic, which may be said to mirror all phases of life, ‘‘ Truth, — yes,
and Falsehood too ! ” but it is clearly unreasonable and even impossible to
say that the Anukramaji^ chapter by itself could be “ Truth,— yes and False-
hood too.” Furthermore, even if this wonderful chapter be the Truth as well
as Falsehood, I fail to see how it should follow that such a chapter could on
that account be able to give absolution to a sinner. If one bears in mind
that the subject matter of the panegyric is the Anukramani chapter (and not



198


EPIC STUDIES


the epic), one cannot, I think, come to any other conclusion than that the tru(:
reading is rnnrtam.

It may be added that Edgerton’s mistake is quite natural and is caused
primarily by the* misleading division of the passage (stanzas 200-202) into
distiches, which suggests that the subject matter of the pr^asti is the Maha-
bharata. The first half of stanza 201 is logically and grammatically con-
nected with the preceding stanza (200); on the other hand the second half
is part and parcel of the following stanza (202). The first half clearly refers
to the Anukramani chapter, the second half equally clearly to the epic as a
whole. Could I have foreseen the confusion it is apt to cause, I would cer-
tainly have joined the first half of stanza 201 to 200 and the second half to
stanza 202, notwithstanding that this arrangelment yields two consecutive three-
line stanzas. In such cases I have mostly made three distiches, sometimes,
I fear, as in this instance, clouding the sense.

There remains now only one point to be* considered. By saying that
amrtam is a lectio difficilior, Edgerton implies that the change from amHam
into anrtdm is ordinarily inconceivable, since any copyist would have fought
shy of attributing falsehood to the epic. Such a view would, in my opinion,
be entirely incorrect. The distinguishing feature of scribes’ emendations is
that it is superficial. The scribe does not stop to think very deeply about
the consequences of the change. Here, I fancy, the variant has arisen merely
because, in entirely different contexts, satyam and anftam are found frequently
combined into a phrase, sometimes even combined into the compound
satyanrta (e.g. satydnrt\e yo vivmakie loke, 1. 3. 152 ; satydnrte avapasyan
jandndm RV. 7.49.3). I {172} therefore hold that the substitutions of anrtam
for amftam is wholly within the range of probability and even quite natural
for an Indian scribe.

1.2.70 :

etat parvasatmh puvffom Vyasenoktam mahar^i^.

Although it is prefectly true that all previous efforts to make the text
of the Mbh. agree with the numerical data of its extent and size have ended
in dismal failures, Edgerton is needlessly nervous about my attempt to re-
duce the number of the (sub-)parvans exactly to one hundred. Edgerton’s
view is that the traditional hundred ^ould be regarded as an approximate
or “ round ” number. This is the explanation given also by C. V. Vaidya
in his Epic India (p. 189) when he is faced with the anomaly that his list
of " hundred parvans ” contains 107 titles. In support of the view, one mi^t
cite the use of the word sataka in titles of anthologies like the SrngSrasataka,
which frequently, if not uniformly, contain more than 100 stanzas. The paral-
lelism would, in my opinion, be not quite exact, because, I think, here the suffix
ka (miscalled svdrthe by Indian grammarians) probably suggests, if it does not

actually connote, the approximate character of the denominaticxi. Less con-
vincing still isi the analogy (mentioned by C. V. Vaidya, loc. cit.) of the ap-
pellation satasdhasn of the Mbh, This expression is admittedly not intended
to mean exactly one hundred thousand, whatever else it may mean. But the
latitude implicitly allowed in the use of the expression satasahasra in stating
the number of stanzas which are approximately a lakh cannot, it seems to me,
be claimed by a person giving the number of chapters which are approKf-
mately only one hundred. That question apart, when the old experts of the
Great Epic {bhdratacintaka, 1. 2. 172) had calculated and stated the
exact number of adhyayas and slokas, parvan by parvan for all the eighteen
parvans, apparently correct to the last digit, would it not be exceedingly
strange if the numbet of the chapter-groups alone, given in the very same
adhyaya, in the same context, were to be only approximate ? A few stanzas
more or less in an aggregate of several thousand stanzas, or a few adhyayas
more or less {175} in an aggregate of several hundred adhyayas would not have
mattered very much one way or the* other ; but a few parvans more or less
when the total was only in the neighbourhood of hundred ! So careless I
suppose even the careless custodians of the fifth Veda were not. Their cal-
culations imy have befen wrong, but their intention is perfectly clear. They
say and mean that the number was exactly one hundred : notice the puniam
in the first pada of the hemistich. In fact, the amazing difference in the
lengths and characters of these chapter-groups — ^there are some containing
only 1 adhyaya and less than 70 stanzas, there are others which contain more
than 70 adhyayas and considerably more than 3,000 stanzas ! — could, I think,
only have been the result of an over-mastering desire on the' part of some
old editor or editors to reach, by hook on crook, some such predetermined
“round"’ number.

Edgerton is perfectly right when he says that tlie attempt to reconstruct
the original text of this passage presents some very serious textual difficulties.
Whether my text will finally prove correct in every respect or not remains of ,
course! to be seen. I hope it will fit the constituted text of the whole epic ;
but I shall not be greatly shocked if it does not. The texts of the present
editions, Calcutta, Bombay or Kumbhakonam, do not conform to the detahs
given in the “ Table of Contents.” There arc all kinds of discrepiancies bet-
ween them : the sloka numbers do not agree’ ; the same is true of the adhyaya
and the parvan number. These discrepancies cannot be helped, — so long as
we do not know who had done the coimting andj when it was done. As for
the constituted text of the passage in question, I will only say that I have
forniied it rigidly on the! principles of textual criticism worked out by me and
followed elsewhere in the course of my work on the edition. These principles
have been applied independently of the queJStion of the past, present cm* future
form and divisions of the epic. The constituted text is based
mainly on documental and intrinsic probability. It is



200


EPIC STUDIES


more than likely that it contains some slight errors ; the different versions are
interwove'n in such an intricate manner that to disentangle them with com*
plete assurance or to one's complete satisfaction is not yet possible, or perhaps
is no longer possible. I honestly believe that the discrepancieis between the
constituted {174} text and the present Table of Contents," will be very
considerably diminished. But about one thing I feel perfectly confident and
that is that the number is intended to be exactly one hundred. Edgerton
himself would probably have been less sceptical had he known that both
Arjunamisra and NUakaaita have left behind them in their scholia mnemonic
stanzas, stating the exact number of (sub-)parvans in each of the eighteen
(major) parvans. In both cases the total is exactly one hundred ; besides
that, the individual figures tally exactly in the two lists.

Here are the stanzas themselves.

My series differs from that of the mnemonic stanzas only as regards
the two (consecutive) parvans Santi and Anu^sanr,. The aggregate number
of the two parvans is the same in our lists ; the discrepancy is only with
regard to the division of the five sub-parvans between the two major parvans.
My figures for these parvans are 3 and 2 ; those given, by the scholiasts in
their stanzas are 4 and 1 respectively, differing only by one each from mine.
I am unable to account for this discrepancy at present.

These stanza;s, it will have to be admitted, make the case for the ex-
actitude of the figure 100 very much stronger. Is it conceivable that two
different scholiasts would make up two different mnemonic stanzas, each
giving a perfectly fictitious series of figures, with the total exactly hundred,

1 It will be noticed that 17 (out of the aggregate of 19) names of the (major)
parvans, in this scheme, are identical with the names of the Mial (sub-)parvan
of each group. This is valuable because it suggests how the names of the 19
(major) parvans were obtained from the (older) list of the hundred (sub-) parvans.

for the number of chapter-groups in each of the eighteen books of the epic ?
These stanza's establish, in my opinion, irrefutably that as late as the time
of Arjunamisra the total number of (sub-)parvans was believed to be exactly
one hundred, and (what is much more important) the exact number of
(sub-)parvan in each of the (major) parvans wasi also believed to be
accurately known. Whether or not these figures tallied exactly with the
actual divisions of the version of the text prepared by these commentators
is an entirely different question, which I am not yet prepared to answer in
the affirmative. These stanzas stand, in my opinion, for an effort to save
from the limbo of oblivion some precious fragment of traditional knowledge
regarding the epic. Like fossils these skeletons of the old Parvasarhgraha-
parva have survived, despite the frantic efforts of centuries of editors and
critics to make the “ Table of Contents '' agree with the form of the text
known to them.

Many of Edgerton’s suggestions and queries relate to the uses of the
wavy line : mostly cases where he has either less or {178} more confidence
in the readings I haVe adopted. This device, as Edgerton himself admits,
is *‘by its very nature hard to apply strictly and consistently.” Moreover,
most of tile words cited by him are merely commonplace adverbs, conjunc-
tions and other expletives like caiva, dkuh (v. 1. viduh), iha, vd, tv-air a, edpi,
kintrvd (v. 1. vd kirn) and so on. I will therefore forbear from entering
into a detailed discussion of the relative merits of the variants, especially
as, in the maljority of the cases, the manuscript evidence is so conflicting
that absolute certainty is impossible.

I cannot conclude this paper without expressing both to Professor
Edgerton ahd to Dr. Weller my cordial thanks for the very kind remarks
they have to make regarding the work in general, and my keen stppreciation
of the uniformly courteous tone of their very sympathetic reviews.

### Further Text-critical Notes

The organizers of the new Indian project of preparing a critical edition
of the Mahlabharata are deeply indebted to both Geheimrat Luders and
Professor Winternitz not merely for their taking personally a keen interest
in the scheme, but for their bringing the project formally to the notice of
the savants assembled at the historic XVIIth International Congress of
Orientalists held at Oxford in August 1928, and moving resolutions convey-
ing messages of appreciation and congratulation. ^ A singularly happy
feature of this event was that this gesture of cordial sympathy and willing
co-operation should have proceeded spontaneously from just those two

animously by the Indian Section of the Congress has been published by Winternitz

veteran scholars who not merely enjoy the greatest amount of respect and
confidence in the world of Indologists but whose names are most intimately
connected with the earlier scheme of the International Association of Acade-
mies of publishing a critical edition of our Great Epic. It is a matter of
high gratification to the members of the Mahabharata Editorial Board that
their modest efforts in the cause of Mahabharata studies are being so keenly
appreciated by their fellow workers in Europe, just as it is a matter of relief
to the responsible editors that the general method and principles underlying
the preparation of this edition have won the warm approval of the two
eminent European critics^ who have themselves made the closest study of
the central textual problem and enriched the literature on the subject by
the contribution of several valuable papers and monographs.

At the said session of the Congress of Orientalists, Winternitz read
a paper entitled “The Critical Edition of the Mahabharata”, dealing with
the history of the project from its early beginning^. Much of what Winternitz
says in this {166} memorable address of his bears the unmistakable stamp
of being personal reminiscences, because he was the first scholar who more
than thirty years ago, at the Xlth International Congress of Orientalists held
in Paris (1897), emphasized the superlative importance of a critical edition
of the Mahabharata and proposed measures for its preparation.®

After nearly thirty years of restless endeavour, he is again one of the
small group of the first collaborators of the great and ambitious project.
EHiring 1922-3 he used his opportunities as a Guest Professor at the Univer-
sity of the poet philosopher Rabindranath Tagore to train some of his ad-
vanced pupils at the Visvabharatl to do collation work, thus helping to
establish there a centre for the collation of Bangali MSS. of the Mahabha-
rata, ^ a centre which is still doing excellent work under the supervision of
the Principal, Pandit Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya. Finally, Winternitz
has taken over some of the editorial burden on hi> own shoulders by kindly
agreeing to edit for the Institute one Parvan, the Sabhaparvan. This is in-
deed a very happy augury for the continued success of our cherished project.

To the text of his Congress address, which be has published in the
first issue of his Journal, Indologica Pr ageusia, Vol. 1 (1929), pp. 58-63,
Winternitz has appended (pp. 64-68) some critical remarks on my edition
of the Adiparvan. While expressing his whole-hearted agreement with the
general principles underlying my reconstruction of the text, he has given a
long list of passages in which he differs from me with respect to the readings
of the constituted text. With unerring judgement he has picked out those

passages in the first two adhyayas that had given me most trouble, and he
has criticized the readings of the constituted text, weighing the pros and cons
with great acumen, and pointing out the errors and imperfections with much
delicacy and courtesy. While tendering him my cordial thanks for the
honour he has done me by making so close and penetrating a study of my
critical work, I shall endeavour here briefly to answer his queries and critic-
ism. I write these notes not so much to justify my selection and establish
the readings of the critical edition as £167} to set forth the reasons that
have guided me in the choice of the readings in question and that may not
have occurred to my critic — remarksj which will not fail to throw some fitful
light on the obscure and complicated processes which go to make up Maha-
bharata textual criticism.

Minor Questions.

1. 1. 30 : WiNTERNiTZ observes that “in the notes the interesting re-
      mark of Arjunamisra is given ; paramesthy atha iti prdyasali pdtipdh, but the
      actual reading of the Da MSS. is not given The reading of the Da MSS.
      not being specifically mentioned, it must, in conformity with a tacitly assum-
      ed Paribha^, be taken to be the same as the text reading, namely, para-
      me^thy iatha. In that sense the reading of the Da MSS. (i.e. of Arjuna-
      misra) has been given, and my note is both complete and correct, because
      both the Da MSS. collated for the passage do, in point of fact, read para^
      me^thy atha.^ Nevertheless, as I discovered on referring to the commentcuy
      once more, the note does not represent the facts fully and correctly, because
      the MSS. which are corrupt, being contaminated from the vulgate, had suc-
      ceeded, for the time being, in completely misleading me.

That the true Arjunamisra reading must, against the testimony of MSS.,
be assumed to be paramemarah (agreeing then with Dq.s Q) follows,
with certainty, from the commentary itself, a fact I had overlooked when
I wrote the note. The commentary runs thus :

«Tg: I i;: I 1 51R5I'.

tr:; I i

In the Foreword to Fascicule 1 (p. 1), I have already drawn attention
to the fact that “ the (epic) text in the Arjunamisra codices is frequently
contaminated from the “ vulgate '' and has to be corrected with the help of
Arjunamisra’s commentary.” The examples cited there are 1. 1. I7b and

niagari) MSS. of Arjunami^ra's commentary collated by him for his Specimen edition
read likewise paramesthy atha; only in one instance has the reading been cor-
rected (by a later hand) to paramesvarah. Accordingly Prof. Luders has also
taken paramesthy atha as the reading of the version of Arjunamisra.

In the latter case (1. 1. 22 b), likewise, tlie Da MSS. read sivam, agree-
ing with many K and D MSS. ; but the commentary shows (as I have
pointed out in the notes) that the true Arjunamisra reading is sucim, agree-
ing with the constituted text, Hvam being only a variant mentioned by the
scholiast ;

m I i m yjyi i to

1 must here add, tlierefore, a word of caution. In the critical notes
published with the text, the readings as actually found in the (epic) text (in
contradistinction to the commentary) of the Arjunamisra codices have, as
a rule, been taken to represent the readings of Arjunamisra ; the commen-
tary was consulted by me only occasionally, in case of doubt or difficulty,
or when a pdphantara was noticed. It is, therefore, more than likely that,
owing to the fact our I>a MSS. are conflated by contamination with various
types of MSS., in particular with the Nilakahtha type, a few errors of the
kind pointed out by Winternitz may have inadvertently crept in. Such
errors can be rectified only by working through the whole commentary, word
for word, and comparing the lemmata with the (epic) text of the MSS. ;
even then one can of course be sure only of the words and passages actually
cited and explained by the scholiast.

The version of Arjunamisra, as I pointed out in the Foreword to Fasci-
cule 1 (p. v), is closely allied to the Bangali version. The reason for this
affinity (as I have stated elsewhere) appears to be that Arjunamisra was a
native of Bengal.^ Following the example of my predecessors, I have uti-
lized, for the critical edition of the Adiparvan, Devanagari MSS. of Arjuna-
misra’s commentary. The two MSS. I am using are extremely corrupt. In
fact, all the MSS. of Arjunamisra’s commentary I have seen— and they are
all Devanagari MSS.— have been remarkably corrupt. Not only that, the
text they offer is, as already remarked, obviously contaminated from the
[169} vulgate. This corruption of the Devatiagari MSS. I could not ac-
count for at first ; but it must be due, I cannot but think now, to their being
copies of Bangali or Maithili originals. It would, therefore, be expedient
to procure and use, whenever possible, Bangali- or Maithili MSS. of Arjuna-

   like the Whish MS.; only between 62ab and the Appendix passage, my MSS.
   further interpolate 29*, 64 and 30*, as stated in the very note cited by
   WiNTERNiTZ. The point of insertion of this interpolation varied in the dif-
   ferent MSS. Thus of the MSS. collated by Prof. Luders for his Druckprobe,

1 . 1. 13'1 : The printer’s devil, I regret to say, is responsible for the
erroneous spelling Samsaptaha — (with dental s) in this stanza; the correct
spelling Saihsaptaka — (with palatal s) is given at 1 . 2. 56 and 160. More-
over, the various readings have been given only at 1 . 2. 56, and, through some
unfortunate oversight, omitted at 1. 1. 131 and 1 . 2. 160. I make good the
omission here. At 1. 1. 131 the various readings are as follows. Ko. 2 - 4 .C

From the readings of the three passages in question, it should seem that,
anomalies apart, Kj (or the India Office Codex), Bangali and Southern MSS.
read it correctly (that is, with the palatal 5 ), while the rest of K agrees with
the commentators in reading it with the dental s. The balance of probability
inclines to the side of the palatal, I think, even if we restrict ourselves to the
MS. evidence. C. V. Vaidya {The Mahdbharata : A Criticism, p. 159)
speaks of them as the “ 7 clahs who came probably from the Afagan {sic)
borders,” but it seems to me more likely that they got their nickname from
the fact that they had bound themselves by an oath to kill Arjuna or die in

the great Bharata* battle (Dropap, 17).

1. 2. 85 : The spurious line (102*) kutasya Dhmdird^prena pre^mani
      Pmpdavdn prati stands in the MSS. not before 97* (as WINTERNITZ imagines
      and very naturally), but after 101*, as correctly stated in the critical notes.
      I haVe re-examined the MSS. concerned on the point and find that my note is
      perfectly correct. One cannot be dogmatic about the Mahabharata MSS.;
      there is no knowing what they may or may not contain. The line was found
      only in six Nilakantha MSS. in Devahagarl or Bangali characters, collated
      for the first two adhyayas. In all these six MSS. the line is found inter-
      polated at the same place, the place mentioned in the critical apparatus
      (namely, after 101*), although all printed editions without exception place
      it elsewhere (namely, before 97*), which is no doubt the reason of Winter-
      NiTZ’s remark. A note drawing attention to this patent discrepancy might
      have been usefully added in the critical notes. But I have found the printed
      editions so arbitrary and unreliable^ that I have almost £171} completely
      ignored them in the foot-notes, which have necessarily to be rather brief and
      to the point. The meaning of this enigmatic line found in Nilakaptha MSS.
      is as obscure toi me a’s the cause of its transposition in the first printed edi-
      tion. We need not inquire why the line occurs in the wrong place in the
      other editions as well, since the subsequent editors appear to have studiously
      and uniformly avoided consulting MSS. Winternitz could easily convince
      himself of the correctness of my statement regarding the point of insertion
      of this line in the MSS. by referring to the superb complete copy of the MahS-
      bharata in iSarada characters, with Nilakantha s scholium, he purchased in
      Kasmar during his stay there.

      The correction will be duly notified in the list of Errata, which will be added
      at the end of the volume. In passing I may draw attention to the superiority
      of the K MSS., the only group which, as Winternitz rightly remarks, gives
      the undoubtedly correct rendering of the whole stanza ; all other MSS.-— even

such as do not contain the interpolated line 112* — are in utter confusion.

This is indeed a difficult case, and I for my part doubt whether any
definite decision can be reached as to how the stanza originally read. I must
say, I cannot share the confidence with which Winternitz decides for the
reading :

yadd Vdyuh Sakiasuryau ca yuktau,

which is mentioned as a patha by Nilakantha and was adopted in the editio
prmceps. It is one of the eight rival readings and is found chiefly in the
Bangali version, and in MSS, and editions allied to or influenced by it. The
combinations found £172} in the different MSS. may be arranged schemati-
cally as follows :

According to Winternitz, the stanza refers to (B.) 7. 7. 34 ff. ‘‘where
the line vdtoddhutcmi rajas tivram etc., also testifies to the reading vdyuh,
while iakra {— Indra) probably refers to the rain of pieces of flesh, bones
and blood.” To start with I doubt whether Sakra could be held responsible
for the “ rain ” of flesh, bones, and sundry other articles ; but that is a minor
point, immaterial to the present discussion. In believing, however, that our
stanza refers to (B.) 7. 7. 34 ff., Winternitz is partly mistaken, as will
presently appear. The important point is that in the opinion of Winternitz
the stanza alludes to certain forces of Nature, certain elements, such as wind,
rain and so on, which were favourable to the P^davas and unfavourable to
the Kauravas. The commentators Nilakaptba, Arjunami^ra and Devabodha
(with the readings which they had adopted or which were before
them) have explained the stanza in a similar way. I hold a different view,
however. When I selected the reading of the constituted text, I thought—
and I still think— that in this stanza there is allusion not to the elements, but
to some mtrologicd factor or constellation — an allusion which was not under-
stood by commentators and which I could not then fully explain. On read-
ing the criticism of Prof. Winternitz, I therefore made a reference to my



210


EPIC STUDIES


friend Prof. Jyotish Chandra Ghatak, M. A., of Calcutta University, who
has made a special study of Indian Astrology and allied sciences and is rightly
regarded as an authority on these topics ; and I was not disappointed. Hav-
ing already worked through the whole of the Mahabharata in special search
of references which have a bearing on Astrology, Augury and kindred subjects,
he could at once lay his fingers on the right passage, the prototype of our
stanza, which throws a flood of light on the question, without however fully
solving the riddle of the stanza, so far as I cah judge. The said stanza,
(B.) 6. 20. 2, reads :

{173} [Dhrtara§tra to Sariijaya]

%5rt

sqWRT I

While the connection between the two stanzas is patent and indeed un-
questionable, the discovery of the prototype leaves, unfortunately, nK)st of
our real difficulties unsolved. The reading which agrees closest with that of
the Bhi§maparvan stahza is that of the vulgate text and is found only in the
MSS. of NilakaiTitba. These latter have Vayu-Chandra-Surya (lacking Sakra
or Sukra altogether) like Soma-Surya-Vayu of the Bhi§maparvan. Is the
Nilakaiptha reading then the original reading ? As I have pointed out else-
where, we are apt to prefer, at first sight, the readings of the vulgate, which
appear to be better than those of the critical text ; but that is only because
the text of the vulgate has been arrived at by the purging of the original by
the continuous emendations of scholars for centuries.^ It seems to me that there
is a long history behind the reading of the vulgate in the present case also.
Nilakaptha had evidently arrived at it by an emendation, by collation with
the prototype, because there is no indication of the re being any MSS. before
him which could have contained that particular combination. This fact may,
perhaps, supply us with a clue to the labyrinth of the readings recorded in
the critical notes for the line in question. An important factor is that Sukra
(or sakra), which persistently occurs in all the various categories of our
MSS. and which must, therefore, be regarded as an essential feature of our
stanza, is entirely lacking in the later stanza. This proves irrefutably that
the combination of the former was not identical, in every respect, with that
of the latter originally. That is an important point to remember. WlNTER-
NIT2 is emphatic in a'sserting that yadd Vdyuh of the original was changed
in S into the usual yada§rau$am. This assumption does not seem to me to

be at all well founded, because the very next stanza (130) begins yadd
Dr OHO vivid hm astramdtgm, and here no attempt has been made in S (or
anywhere else) to change the beginning into yadasrcdui^m. There are a few
more stanzas (133, 140, 145) in {174} this series which do not begin with
the oft-repeated formula. It seems to me much more likely, therefore, that
Vayu was introduced into our passage, secondarily, by some early Northern
redactor who knew the prototype and had noticed the omission of one of the
elements in the prior stanza ; precisely as Nilakantha, much later, appears
to have further altered the line by changing the difficult Sakra (or iSukra)
to Candra, thus equating the combination to that of the prototype. I there-
fore adhere to my original choice, explaining the genesis of the variants as
follows. The stanza in question, which was suggested to the author of the
yadakau^am section by the Bhi^maparvan stanza but was composed from
a vague recollection of the original, began like the other stanzas of the series,
and contained, moreover, an allusion to an astrological situation. Some Nor-
thern redactor (who had known the Bhi§maparvan stanza and noticed that
tlie first stanza did not contain Vayu) then deleted {a)srausam and substi-
tuted for it the missing Vayu, retaining, however, the original feature Sukra.
The corruption of Sukra into Sakra must be judged as easy and even natural
(in juxtaposition with Surya), in view of the famous episode of the Maha-
bharata which narrates how Indra‘, disguised as a mendicant Brahman, begs
for the miraculous ear-rings and the armour which had been Karpa s from
his birth and which had made him invincible. The emendatory activity of
the early Northern redactor was continued by Nilakantha, who expunged
the sakra (or Sukra) which he found in his MSS. (and perhaps did not
fully understand) and substituted for it Candra, thus equating the two com-
binations.

I am confirmed in the supposition that the original line contained only
two agencies instead of three by the fact that no MSS. hitherto collated
show yuktdh (plu. ) for yuktau (dual) in the first line, as they certainly
would have done, had there been three names in the original instead of two,
as I have given. ^

The question then arises whether Sukra and iSurya, as gMhas, were at
that time favourable to the P^ndavas or, what comes to the same thing,
adverse to the Kauravas. About {175} Surya I cahnot say. But as far as
Sukra is concerned, we may safely answer the question in the affirmative.
My friend Prof. Ghatak has kindly drawn my attention to a stanza in Vara-
hamihira’s Brhatsamhitd which, if dyutajivin may be taken to apply to the

1 It should be noted that even in the explanation of Winternitz, Sakra and
Surya do not make any combined effort. If the three elements wind, rain and
sun operate all together for the success of the Papdavas, then yuktdh is indeed the
correct word. What is the point of the dual, when the plural form would be even
metrically equally suitable?

Kauravas, would indicate that at the time of the Bharatal battle the planet
Sukra, which was then in the Purvabh5drapada (cf. 6 . 3 . 15), was in a
position which augured disaster to the Kauravas and was therefore favour-
able (anuloma) to the Paijdavas. The Brhatsamhitd reference ( 9 . 34) sup-
plied to me by my friend runs.

As Viayu is missing in the whole of S except Mj (which latter is a
conflated MS.), it can never be established that Viayu is an esseniwl element
of the original stanza ; on the other hand, (a)srausam, though of course no
less doubtful because it is documented also by only half of the entire evidence,
is rendered probable, if not required, by the context. But I am prepared
to leave the line as “ less than certain,” as indicated by the wavy line below
the words in question.

to read tava putrmr mahattardl}, pointing out that there is not much evidence
for the text reading. It is quite true that the text is weakly supported ;
but so are almost all the readings except that of the vulgate, which certainly

cannot be considered the original reading, as it is palpably an emendation.

The text is based on Ki. 5 G 5 . ^ only. But Winternitz’s reading is not
much better supported ; in its entirety it is found only in K 3 M ; because,
of the MSS. which do contain the questionable mahattkirdh^ Ko begins the
pada with tvatputrair ye and with tvatsutebhyo. I submit, therefore,
that the reading preferred by Winternitz is not better documented than
mine. That is the first point. Winternitz then seeks to explain the

variation on the ground that the scribes must have found difficulties with

the £ 176 } instr. putrmli. Now the so-called instr, comparationis is very
common in both epics and, I submit, that alone would not account for this
plethora of readings in the case of a simple line with a perfectly obvious
meaning. I know instances in the Mahabharata text where this instr. com-
porationis has called forth no variants at all in the MSS., no doubt because
it was felt to be quite normal by the copyists, editors and readers alike.
The cause of disturbance in this case must, therefore, be looked for else-
where, and that was principally, I think, the use of the superlative joined
to the instrumental.

In settling th^ original reading, the question is primarily one of fact, of
the actual MS. evidence, not of grammar. The Shakespearean “This was



EPIC STUDIES II


213


the most unkindest cut of all” cannot be judged and tended by modem
standards of grammar. It sounds harsh to our ears ; but there is, I suppose,
sufficient documentary evidence to prove or make it probable that the line
as I have quoted it was in point of fact written by the author of Julim Csesar
(who knew his English quite as well as, if indeed not better than, we do),
consciously or unconsciously using what our purists stigmatize as
vulgarism. The argument that a dramatist like Shakespeare could not com-
mit such a blunder (if blunder it be) would be without cogency, when the
MS. evidence supports the questionable reading.

The Mahabharata, I may point out here, has suffered from the great
misfortune of being always edited by learned Pahdits, who were concerned
more about the purity of diction than with the determination and preserva-
tion of the words of the author or the authors of the epic. One of the very
worst offenders in this way was Pandit Bohtlingk who, in the passages
edited by him in his Scmkrit-Chresthomathie, has ''corrected ” away the
few oddities of idiom and style of the original which had escaped the vigilence
of mediaeval Indian scholiasts and editors and found their way stealthily into
our printed editions

fied as follows. Readings

much in evidence. He has not only introduced, with scrupulous care, the correct
Sandhi wherever it was at all possible, he has substituted the correct bandhum
for the (irregular) huddhum (1. 3.. 21), found even in the printed editions and
made many similar “ corrections independently of the MS. evidence. Most
amusing, however, is his regular and systematic substitution of the correct form,
as required by the Sutra of P§mm, out of etad and enad, a rule probably unknown
at any time to anybody outside a select coterie of AcSryas of Yyakaraoa.

It is an admittedly sound principle of textual criticism to give preference
to a reading which best suggests how the other readings may have arisen, and
it would be hard, I think, to find another reading which^ could explain all
these nine variants more satisfactorily. Winternitz’s choice, for instance,
does not at all explain the origin of any of the readings which contain
mahaltamdk (superl.)' such as 2 (a) and (b) and the text reading ; because
there is in that case nothing to be gained by changing the (supposed) original
comparative into superlative.^

En passant it may be pointed out that the so-called instr. campaTationis
is not a distinct category of the comparative at all ; it is only a special case of
the (Prakritic) coalescence of the instr. and abl. pi. {metri causa), an equi-
valence which comes out very clearly in such parallel phrases as :

I 1. 1. 198

{178} and

1-1- 209 and 494 *.

The latter does not mean he is left by all sins " but “ he is freed from all
sins.”

That the superlative is used in the epic in the sense of the comparative®
may be seen from :

^ % ^Tl^rntfr: \ Gita 12. 1
^ ^ I 18- 69

Of these which are more verged in Yoga ? ” Nor among men shall
there be any whose service is dearer to me than his.”

The superlative is normally construed with the gen. or loc.; but that it is

^ Unless it be a scribe’s error perpetuated through centuries or repeated
independently in different places and times.

2 This pada recurs^ frequently in the Ramayapa also.

» These derivative forms have probably a merely intensive value, and do not
necessarily and invariably connote comparison. The Prakritsl frequently confuse the
tara and the tama endings. It is further worth noting that a separate formation
of the comparative and superlative is unknown to the Modem Indian dialects.
The epics also sporadically furnish instances of the use of the ptmtive in the sense
of the comparative.



EPIC STUDIES II 215

construed sometimes also with the abl. may be seen not merely from the
example last cited but also from :

3Tfq I ibid, 4. 36

Though thou art of all sinners the most sinful/*

Then the above-mentioned equivalence of the instr. and abl. pi. ushers
in finally the construction of the superlative with the instr., which we find
in the passage in question.

Formally the two constructions tava puttair mahattardh and tava ptdrair
mahattamah are almost equivalent ; but there may be just a slight difference
of meaning between the two locutions. While tava puirair mahattamh
(comp.) evidently means only ‘"greater than thy sons’*, the other clause
( tava putrair mahattamdh ) may have been intended to convey some such sense
as “ far, very much, greater than thy sons.**

It may be finally observed that in dealing with the first two adhyayas
of the Adiparvan (a^ in fact with the whole of the earlier portion of this
Parvan ) the critic should never forget that he has before him what Hopkins
has justly called the “ pseudo-epic ** : the poetasters responsible for the com-
pilation of these passages are capable of the worst blunders of every descrip-
tion.

* *

£179} 1. 1. 269 : mdhattvdd bhdravattvdc ca.

As WiNTERNiTZ rightly observes, here the MS. evidence is almost evenly
balanced. Moreover, graphically there is so little difference between the rival
readings that we cannot expect much help from the side of the MSS., though
it may be pointed out that their evidence inclines, if at all, just a trifle to the
side of the text reading. Winternitz {Ind, Ant. 27., 93) admits that the
lines (69*) caturbhyah etc. and tadd prabhjti etc. are “quite superfluous.”
When these lines are expunged from the text, as has been done by me, the
line mahattve ca gurutve ca of 208c) stands adjacent to mahattvdd bhdra''
(of 209<?). The idea of 208c is evidently reflected and repeated in 209a.
Just as mahattvdt corresponds to nidfiattve, so Wmra'' should correspond to
gurutve. This clearly shows, as far as I can judge, that the doubtful woid
(ftfeira®), which should be a paraphrase of gunwft;c, must bt bhdravattvdt
and not bhdratatvdt. The latter seems to be an emendation made by some
revisor who wanted' to squeeze in somehow the significant word Bhdrata into
the context ; and, it must truthfully be confessed, it is a very ingenious emen-
dation indeed. But as to which is the orginal reading there cannot be much
doubt. The importance that Winternitz (like Buhler, Ind. Stud. 2. 9 f.,
before him) attaches to the circumstance that the verse is quoted in (our edi-
tion of) Kumarila's Tahtravartika with the reading bhdratatvdt is wholly un-
justifiable, and that for two reascms : firstly, because we have no critical
edition of the Tantravarttika, and so we cannot be wholly sure of what the



216


EPIC STUDIES


MSS. actually read at that place ; and secondly, because, even if Kumarila
should, in point of fact, have quoted the verse with bhdraiatvM, it does not
at all follow that this is ipsa facta the ariginal reading, notwithstanding that
Kumarila’s work is far older than the extant Mahabharata MSS ; because
Kumarila may have cited the stanza from one or the other of the versions
which contained (and still contain) that reading. Or again he may have
known both variants and preferred, for reasons similar to those adduced by
Buhler and Winternitz, the variant rejected by me.

The situation is somewhat clearer and the facts better capable of demon-
stration in the case of the other great mediaeval commentator Samkaracarya.
In many cases when the readings of the Mahabharata verses and stanzas cited
by him {180} differ from those of the Bombay and Calcutta editions, I was
able to identify i^aihkaraoarya’s readings in the Southern MSS. Being a
Southerner, he had naturally studied and cited from the Southern recension
of the Mahabharata. It is quite clear that he was not going to work through
all available MSS. and establish the original reading of the numerous Maha-
bharata stanzas cited by him in the course of his voluminous commentaries.
Therefore his citations, although of far greater antiquity than the oldest of
our extant Mahabharata MSS., do not necessarily give us in every case the
** original '' readings. Salmkara’s testimony applies to and affects mainly the
version, or the! recension used or cited by him ; and that was probably the
Southern recension in its Malayalam version. Even in the time of the Acarya
the Northern MSS. must have read differently in places, as they do now,
because the divagation of the recensions must be assumed to be far older than
the epoch of the great Vedantist.

I shall give only one example in order to clarify my meaning. 1. 1. 37
of the critical edition reads yathartda rtulingdniy agreeing with other printed
editions and with the majority of the MSS. of the Northern recension. iSam-
karadarya in his Bh^ya on the Brahmasutra (1. 3. 30 ; Anandasrama ed.,
p. 313) cites, however, the verse with the reading yalthartu^v jtulingdni.^
Now this reading is found only in Southern MSS. and in such of the Northern
MSS. as can be shown to be contaminated from the Southern source, but not
in any Kasmlri or Bangali MSS. collated so far. Here it would be clearly
wrong to cite the Bh^ya as an authority older than our MSS. to establish
the text reading as yathartu^v rtulingdni. The Bh^ya citation affects directly
the Southern version only, documenting that the divergent reading of our
Southern MSS. is as old as (or rather older than) the time of Sairhkaracarya ;
and that is aU. It does not take us beyond the Southern recension, much
less beyond the two rival recensions to the archetype.

When Winternitz further observes that “ from the etymologizer's point
of view ” hharatatvdt is a ** better ” etymology, since with the other reading


1 Only one of the Bhasya MSS. has our text reading.



EPIC STUDIES 11


217


the ta of the Bharata remains unexplained, he is bringing into the discussion
an element of finesse that is quite foreign to the view-point of £181} the
Puraijic writers, as will be evident from the following specimens of “etymo-
logische Spielerei ” culled from the earlier adhyayas of the Adiparvan :

(B.) 1. 30. 7 = line 3 of 343* (Garuda) :

1. 36. 3 (Jaratkaru) :

1. 56. 31 (Mahabharata) :

1. 69. 33 (Bharata) ;

In view of these bizarre specimens, it would be extremely strange should
a Puraoic “ etymologizer " fight shy of sacrificing a /la, if he, for the mcwment,
could not think of anything better.


1. 2. 2 : susrusa yadi vo viprd bruvatas ca kathdh subhdfj.

I admit that my reconstruction of the line is not wholly satisfactory.
The reading preferred by WiNTERNiTZ may also not appeal to other scholars,
as it does not wholly appeal to me. I therefore cite here the 15 different
readings found in the 48 MSS. collated for this passage, of which one (Dg),
unluckily or luckily, omits the line altogether. The lines containing ca (to
which WiNTERNiTZ takes exception in particular) have been underlined for
the sake of ready identification.

£182} As for the doubtful ca, I may remark that, besides its normal
use as a conjunction meaning and ”, ca is very frequently used in the Maha-
bhSrata (and the RamSyaioa) as an expletive, a pure and simple verse-filler
ipadapuratj^i) ^ without restriction of position, like hi and vai. It may occa-
sionally have served as a particle of emphasis, stressing the previous word
like eva. The second use is somewhat doubtful ; but of the first, one can find
scores of perfectly clear and certain instances in any portion of the epic, even
in the printed editions. In the line in question, I consider, ca has
been used in the first sense, as a mere verse-filler. Sporadically tm, which
improves this awkward line ever so slightly, appears to have been substituted
for it, independently in both recensions. The first half of the line was so
uncouth that it was recast in the vulgatei. There are numerous instances of
lines being recast ip the vulgate, as a careful study of the critical apparatus
will show.

* - 1 ;

1. 2. 29 : ydt tu Saunaka^tre te Bhmatdkhydnavistaram j
      dkhydsye Mra Pmlomam dkhydna^ cdditah param jj

This is again al most difficult case, and, as Winternitz rightly remarks,
” full of almost hopeless editorial cruces”. The reconstruction would be,
therefore, almost entirely a matter of speculation. Winternitz has rightly
surmised that I regard the Parvasaiiigraha as an accretion later than this
stanza, which, in my opinion, belongs to a much earlier stratum of the text
of the Mahabharata. That Samakasatre in line 1 is a regular trap for the
unwary. Misled by the printed editions, I had myself treated the words as
separate at first, realizing only much later that in this adhyaya the Suta is
addressing not Satinaka but the IJ§is, among whom iSaunaka is not
yet present. iSaunaka is not mentioned in the foregoing portion of the text
except once, in connection with his twelve-year sacrifice in 1. 1. 1. In
adhyaya 4, moreover, it is plainly stated that the Suta first approaches the
IJ§is assembled in thei Naimi§a forest and asks them what he should narrate.
The Iil§is request him to await the arrival of i^unaka. The latter, as soon
as he arrives, asks the Suta to relate the history of the Bhiargavas (adhy. 5).
If Saunaka was not afcmong the audience in adhySya 4, I do not see how he
could have been there in adhyaya 2. Moreover, Tn the latter adhyaya the in-
terlocutors are throu^out stated as being the IJ§is, while it is only from
adhyaya 5 onwards that iSaunaka appears in this £183} role. It should,
therefore, seem that the reading &aunaka satre is not easy to understand or
explain by any means. Or does Winternitz mean that it should be adopted
as the lectio diffidlior ? It would be admissible, in my opinion, only on the
supposition (which is not as improbable as it may at first si^t appear) that



EPIC STUDIES II


219


the compiler of adhyaya 2, when he wrote stanza 29, had overlooked the fact
that Saunaka was not then among the audience. I have preferred to give
the “ poet ” the benefit of the doubt and assume that the remark is addressed
to one of the Rsis i>resent.

WiNTERNiTZ has misunderstood my reconstruction in some other parti-
culars as well, yat, at the beginning of the stanza, is not a neuter pronoun
but an adverb = yada. The words aditah param offer no difficulties at all
for interpretation ; Sdital}. does not mean “ /row the beginning,” but “ at the
beginning” {=adau) ; param excellent.” dkhyasye must of course be
supplied in the first line ; but that is not difficult as it is the very first word
of the second line. Therefore I translate :

“ But when, during Saunaka’s (sacrificial) session, I (shall narrate) to
thee the very extensive Bh5rata Story, then shall I narrate, to begin with, the
excellent Story of Pauloma."

Even a cursory examination of the variants given in the critical notes is
sufficient to convince anybody that the stanza has been recast over and over
again. With, its history is bound up the history of the successive additions
of the three episodes AstOca, Pauloma and Pausya, which appear to have
been aH)ended successively to the main text in this order. The stanza in
question seems to have been written at the time of or soon after the addition of
the Pauloma, but before the addition of the Pausya. The purpose of the line
was originally not— as Winternitz imagines— to state all the episodes with
which the MahabhSrata begins, but to authenticate the latest interpolation
then made, namely, the Pauloma, by making the Suta declare beforehand his
intenti<Mi of narrating that akhyana at the beginning of the Mahabharata.
The .Astika must have formed at that time the recognized beginning of the
epic (cf. Mtptvadi Bhdratam kecid Astikddi tathd pare 1. 1. 50), and the
Pausya had not yet been added. This is the state of things the constituted
text envisages.

A study of the critical apparatus of this adhyaya shows that the adhySya
is best preserved in the Southern recension ; £184} in the MSS. group on
which the vulgate is mainly based (namely, BD) numerous additional stanzas
are found which are missing in S and Ko. j, « ; but even the three latter MSS.
occasionally indude some of such additional stanzas, which also nevertheless,
since they are missing in S, may safely be regarded as interpolations. Of this
character is interpolation 74*, which is found in almost the whole of N and
which must have been made with a view to documenting the fact— or rather
the fiction — ^that the MahSbhfirata as narrated by the Suta to tSaunaka was
identical with that narrated by Vai^ampSyana to Janamejaya (cf. Nilakaptka
ad loc.). Ko. 1 agree with S cm the reading of this stanza except for the in-
clusion of 74* in the one and the addition of the name of the Astika to the



220


EPIC STUDIES


Other. The text is formed by collating S with the inferable version of K
before the addition in the latter of 74*. The subsequent steps leading to-
walrds the reading of the vulgate consisted in the addition of the name of the
Astika episode (which intervenes between the Pauloma and the beginning
proper of the Mahabharata ) , of a statement of the identity of the Suta-
version and the Vai^a)rhpayana version, and finally of the name of the Pau§ya
interlude, all these changes being made in our stanza with a view to setting
the seal of authenticity on the three spurious additions. That adhyaya 3
must be an interpolation follows from the fact that it is wholly unconnect^
with the previous adhyaya and only loosely connected with what follows.
Noteworthy is also the fact that adhyayas 1 and 4 have the same beginning ;
Lomahursanctputra Ugrasravah sutah paurdniko Naimi^dranye dvddasavdr-
sike satre ! And in the text itself there is no explanation why after the Suta
has finished his narration of the Pau§ya episode, it is necessary to reintroduce
the Suta in the same words as approaching the same R§is assembled at the
same twelve-year sacrificial session of .^aunaka in the Naimi§a forest. There
is clearly a new beginning made in one of the two adhyayas.

Since many of the intermediate links are missing in the MS. evidence, it
is not possible to reconstruct the history of this portion of the text fully and
satisfactorily ; but that it must be reconstructed on the lines sketched above,
I have no doubt. Accordingly the successive stages in the development of
the reading of the vulgate (which is the reading preferred by Winternitz)
I would arrange in a scheme like the following, in which the innovations have
been printed in black type. £185} It will show anwng other things that the
vistmam of the text and of the Southern recension is not “ a remnant of vis-
tardrtham ” of the vulgate ; on the contrary, in the latter the first line was fill-
ed up with uttamam when the original vist\a7a was used in the interpolated
stanza. The view of Winternitz that at least Astlkam must remain in the
text is quite untenable ; because if the stanza had As^kam there is no reason
why it should not have Pau^yam as well. On the other hand, if Pausyam is
not indispensable, then Astlkam could go with it as well.

1. 2. 46 : mrgasvapnahhaymi Mah

Here again Winternitz prefers the reading of the \ailgate {mrgasvap-
nodbhavam) . It is clearer but, I must say, I am very doubtful about its
originality. The MS. support for this variant is only slightly stronger than
that for the reading of the constituted text. It is worthy of note that B,
which generally sides with the vulgate, has here a third and entirely different
reading : rnjgosvapno 'bhavat tatab I How would Winternitz account for
that ? I explain the compound of the constituted text as an irregular com-
pound with inverted sequence, common in Prakrit (PiscHEL, Gramm, der
Prakrit’Spracheft, §603)! and not unknown to the Low Sanskrit of the epics.
Hopkins, /AOS. 20 (1890X, 223, has cited two instances from the Rami-
yaaja : 7.22.36 dfstvu dandodyatam Yaman (for j 44 yatadan(}am)“ like Yama

tulyavm^asi) “glorious like the mountain (Kailasa).” I accordingly take
the compound in question as equivalent to svapna (df^la) mrgabhaymi

The readings of the vulgate and the Bangali version seem to represent
different attempts at emendation of the irregular con>pound which stood
originally in the Northern recension and which was perhaps misunderstood,
if it was not totally unintelligible. The wavy line below the pada was called
for also by the variant reading of S, which has parva or talah) prdyopa-
vesmam. This refers to an entirely different section of £187} the narrative,
the name being derived from the vow of fasting taken by Duryodhana.

ment between independent versions on the reading '^sarjanam, but the con-
cord, I believe, is only apparent, being due to the conflation of MSS. That
G 4 . 5 are contaminated from some late Northern source, I think, I have esta-
blished with tolerable certainty in the note on 1 . 20 . 1 ; the conclusion is cor-
roborated by many less certain instances where these MSS. (along with Gi. y)
agree with Northern MSS, against other Southern MSS., and the agreement
cannot be regarded as one derived from their connection through the arche-
type.^ That further G^ and Mj are not reliable representatives of the
Grantha and the Malayalam versions respectively, I have already pointed out
in the Foreword to Fascicule 1 (p. v). There remains only one other MS.

1. 2. 96 : In the Editorial Note appended to Fascicule 3, I have given

      and corroborated by the i^rada codex (iSJ. It may, therefore, be regarded
      as the extent of the Sarada version at any rate. I consider, as I have fre-
      quently stated, the Sarada (Kasmiri) version the best version now preserved,
      and my edition of the Adiparvan is based mainly (though not wholly) on
      this version.

I fully agree with Winternitz (op, cit. p. 61) that the Parvasariigraha
argument is necessarily of secondary importance and should not be pressed
too far.^ Be that as it may, it is extremely problematic whether we could
make any use whatsoever of the Parvasarhgraha enumeration in the case of
the Adiparvan at least, because it will be difficult to compute the exact extent
of this Parvan, and that for two reasons. Firstly, because this Parvan, as is
well known, contains two lengthy prose adhyayas (3 and 90) ; and it is diffi-
cult to say {189} now how the extent of the prose sections was computed by
the compilers of the Parvasarhgraha ; our section-numbers certainly can give
no indication of the extent in Slokas.'’- Secondly, this Par\^an also contains

^ The exaggerated importance Utgikar attached to the data of the Parvasam-
graha was, I believe, mainly due to his erroneous belief (induced probably by the
misleading character of the text of the Kumbhakonam edition) that the Northern
and Southern MSS. agreed completely with each other in all material particulars
for this acfliyaya. The Kumbhakonam edition, which claims to be an edition
“ mainly based on the South Indian texts ”, presents a text of this adhyaya which
is almost identical with that of the Calcutta and Bombay editions, taking no notice
of the Southern divergences, while in other sections of the epic it introduces numer-
ous innovations which are based on the Southern tradition.

® The lengths of the prose sections must have been computed on the basis of
32 ak^a^c^ to a slok’a, but such a computation in the cas^ of long prose sections can
be only approximate.

a large number of Tri§tubh-Jagati stanzas, which again introduce an element
of uncertainty in the computation. Was each Tri^ubh-Jagatl stanza counted
as one iSloka ” or did the Bh^ratacintakas compute the exact equivalent of
these long-metre stanzas in “ Slokas ? No definite answer is possible as yet.
The difference in the reckoning will be, however, between 40 and 50 per cent
of the total. As a very rough estimate, the Adiparvan may contain some-
thing like 500 long-metre stanzas. This factor alone would then introduce
a difference of a little less than 250 “ :§lokas in the total !

We must, moreover, not lose sight of the fact that the reading of the
number itself is never entirely free from doubt, since the MSS., as Winter-
NiTZ remarks, differ sometimes quite essentially in the Parvasamgraha itself ;
the figures differ not by units or tens, but by hundreds, and even thousands in
extreme cases.^ There can be no doubt, as I have pointed out elsewhere,
that the text of the Parvasamgraha has been tampered with and designedly
altered, in various ways, in order to make it harmonize with the inflated ver-
sions of a later epoch.^

These are some of the difficulties in the way of making any practical
use of the figures recorded in the Parvasamgrahaparvan for fixing the text of
the Mahabhiarata. The computations may have some value for a Parvan
in which there is no prose at all, which is almost wholly in Anu§tubh metre,
and for which finally the Parvasaaiigraha figure is tolerably certain.

It is quite within the range of probability, as far as I can judge now,
that the extent of the critical text of a pa<rvan may {190} fall appreciably
below or rise appreciably above the figure recorded in the second adhyaya, as
is actually the case with about half the number of Parvans in the Calcutta,
Bombay and Kumbhakonam editions when checked up with the figures given
in their respective Parvasairhgrahas.^ Moreover, unless it can be made prob-
able that the compilation of this “ Table of Contents ” is nearly synchronous
with the final redaction of the Great Epic, this discrepancy will be without
any cogency in questions relating to the constitution of the text. The value
of a MS. or a version cannot be said to depend exclusively or even mainly
upon its agreement with or discrepancy from the data of the Parvasamgraha.
It must, in the first analysis, be regarded as depending upon some intrinsic
criteria, upon the place it occupies in a logical and convincing scheme formu-


1 Thus for the Vii^taparvan, the Northern figure is 2050, the Southern 3500 ;
the difference therefore is 1450 41okas.

2 The actual number of ^lokas falls belotv the Parvasamgraha figure in the
following 10 Parvans : Adi, Udyoga, Bhi§ma, Sauptika, iS^nti, Anusasana, Mva-
medhika, AiramavSsika, Mausala and Mahaprasthanika ; while it rises above the
other figure in the following 8 Parvans : Sabha, Araijya, VirSfa, Dropa, Kanja,
Salya, Stri, and Svarg^rohaaja.

lated to explain satisfactorily the evolution of the different extant versions
and types of Mahabharata MSS.

It should further be carefully borne in mind that even if there is an exact
agreement as to extent between a constituted text and the Parvasamgraha*
this fact alone is no guarantee of the originality and the absolute correctness
of the entire text, line for line ; because the same number of stanzas could be
made up in innumerable different ways by accepting or rejecting, hesitatingly,
stanzas of doubtful authenticity and uncertain documentation, of which there
will always be a plentiful supply in every Parvan.^ The difficulty will finally
not be solved even if we happen to light upon a unique MS. which agrees
with the Parvasalrhgraha exactly and we should adopt its text verbatim ;
because there is every probability that while it satisfies the one criterion of
extent given by the Parvasalrhgraha, it may not satisfy, in every respect, other
and more exacting critical tests when compared, line by line and word by
word, with other extant MSS.

WiNTEiJsiiTZ is mistaken in thinking that the line is missing in the whole
of K : it is missing in only two MSS. of the group, albeit the best MSS.
These MSS. (Kq. j) are, however, by no means infallible, as a careful study
of the apparatus will show. Their evidence is, therefore, rebuttable and not
conclusive. In this instance, not only does the line occur in the rest of N,
but there is a corresponding line in S. I cannot think that the two lines : —
Text . paurmugamanam cairn dhar7naputrasya dlnmatah
S (except Ml) : paurdnukampd nirvedo dharmardjasyak dhlmatah

could have arisen wholly independently of each other. Even though the pur-
port of the lines is different, the construction is identical, which is a very
important point in its favour. Either these lines are connected through the
archetype, or else there is wholesale contamination between S and N except
Ko. 1 . The latter contingency being improbable in the extreme, we are led
to conclude that there must have been a line of that description in the ori-
ginal ; only its precise reading is doubtful ; the doubtful words have accord-
ingly been indicated in the usual manner.

The problem of the MahaWr^ta textual criticism, as I have pointed
out already, is a problem sui generis. Here the principles of textual recon-
struction, which must first be evolved from a study of the MS. material and
the MS. tradition, can be considered as finally settled only after considerable
discussion and exchange of ideas on the subject. I would, therefore, earn-
estly request Prof. Winternitz to continue his searching and exhaustive

examination of the fascicules as they are issued and publish periodically the
results of his scrutiny, a proceeding which cannot but throw much- needed
light on at least some of the difficult problems the editors have to face, and
thus advance the cause of Mahabharata studies.

### Dr. Ruben on the Critical Edition of the Malwbharata

I am bound to form and express an opinion on the issues raised in the
article Schwierigkeiten der Textkritik des Mahafcrfiarata published in the
current issue of the Acta Orimtalia (vol 8. pp. 240-256), in which the
author, Dr. Walter Ruben of the University of Bonn, has reviewed Fasci-
cules 1-3 of tny edition of the Adiparvan, criticizing at considerable length
and in great detail the principles underlying the preparation of the edition
and the constitution of the text.

From his discursive remarks it is indeed hazardous to say what precise
opinion Ruben has formed of the critical edition. But it seems to me that
his general verdict is anything but favourable.

It is not my intention to scrutinize every statement of the writer and
answer all his queries and criticisms ; nor is it incumbent on me to do so ; nor
even necessary, as will appear from the sequel. I shall confine my remarks
to a few points of outstanding importance in Ruben's paper which might mis-
lead the casual reader, creating an erroneous impression regarding the value
of the results achieved by the critical edition.

♦ * ♦

The Bogey of Classical Philology

At the beginning of his paper (p. 241), the learned reviewer from Bonn
formally recites the canon of the caturvarga of the Classical Philologist. The
Classical Philology, we are explained, distinguishes : 1. Heuristics, i.e. as-
sembling and arranging the entire material consisting of MSS. and testi-i
monia in the form of a genealogical tree ; 2. Recensio, i.e. restoration of the
text of the archetype ; 3. Etnendatio, i.e. restoration of the text of the author ;
4. “ Higher Criticism,” i.e. separation of the sources utilized by the author.

£260} Tested on this touchstone of the classicist, the critical edition
of the Mahabharata is found wanting in no less than three items, namely,
Nos. 1, 3 and 4. The third and the fourth items of the programme, R. pdnts
out, have been left wholly untouched ; even the first has by a long way not
been done full justice to by the hapless editor But as one reads on, one
finds that the dereliction is after all not as serious as one might be led to

tom.

suppose at first. For, as regards No. 1 (Heuristics), R. himself admits that
it is not yet possible to concentrate the entire material, and that in all likeli-
hood it will be for ever impossible to prepare a genealogical tree of the
Mahabharata MSS. — As for No. 3 (Emendaiia), I must plead guilty to
having perpetrated so far, perhaps somewhat unnecessarily, minor emenda-
tions in 13 instances^ in about 3800 stanzas ; that is, on an average 1 emen-
dation in a little under 300 stanzas, R. has not taken any notice of my con-
jectural corrections ; I take it that he approves of them. I feel greatly flat-
tered, I must confess, by R/s (implied) suggestion that I should have gone
in more systematically and vigorously for emendation. Most scholars will,
I fancy, be sincerely grateful that I have been so moderate and that I have
declared it as my policy to give preference to interpreitation over emenda-
tion.^ — In speaking at all of “ Higher Criticism” (No. 4 on the programme)
in this connection, R. seems to show a lamentable lack of understanding of
the objective of the edition, having mistaken evidently the beginning for the
end of the critical work on the Mahiabharata. Higher Criticism can begin
only after Lower Criticism has done its work, and not until then. And our
critical edition is just laying the foundation of the Lower Criticism of the
Great Epic. But I imagine, R. does not want to say anything special at all.
when he mentions his “Hohere Kritik'’. In the 1833 ^okas of the consti-
tuted text (!=2161 of the Bombay edition and 2208 of the Calcutta edition)
so closely investigated by R. in the preparation of his erudite paper, he does
not mention even a single passage where the ” Hohere Kritik ” could have
{261} earnestly and usefully ” functioned The item is probably introduced
here merely pro jorma, as the fourth and last stage of the ariya-magga.

But R. might have mercifully spared us this learned prooemium on the
aims and methods of the Classical Philology and their application to the
problem of the Mahabh^ata textual criticism. The same thing has been
said by others before R., more simply but with ample clearness and emphasis.
In the paper^ he read at the XVI Ith International Congress of Orientalists
(Oxford 1928), Winternitz remarked : “The general principles followed in
critical editions of classical texts, Greek or Latin or Sanskrit, can be applied
to a critical edition of the Mahiabharata only with great limitations and
modifications. It is simply impossible to trace a genealogical tree of all the
MSS. of the Adiparvan, and only in some cases are we able to state how
MSS. are related to one another. On the whole, we have to be satisfied with
a classification of the MSS. according to script, and the provinces to which
they belong. And we have more often to refer to classes of MSS., than to

individual MSS/'^ I had myself pointed out in the Foreword (p. ii) to
Fa^cule 1 that “ it is impossible to apply to the Mahabharata the special
canons of textual criticism which are derived from a study of classical (Greek
and Latin) texts and which depend ultimately upon there being a more or
less complete concatenation of copies and exemplars reaching finally back
to a single authentic (written) archetype'’.

And how would it be possible to apply to the Mahabharata the canons
of the Classical Philology in toto ? Where has the Classical Philology, I
should like to know, the necessary experience of dealing with a text with
about a dozen recensions whose extreme types differ in extent by something
like 13,000 stanzas (or 26,000 lines) ; a work which for centuries has been
growing not only upwards and downwards but also laterally, like the Nyag-
rodha tree, growing on all sides ; a codex which has been written in seven
or eight different scripts, assiduously and lovingly copied through a long
vista of centuries by a legion of devout — and perhaps mostly ignorant
{262} and inefficient^ — copyists speaking different tongues ; a traditional book
of inspiration which, in various shapes and sizes, has been the cherished
heritage of one people continuously for several millennia and which to the
present day is interwoven with the thoughts and beliefs and moral ideas of a
nation numbering over two hundred million? No, the Classical Philology
has no experience in dealing with a text of this description, a work of such
colossal dimensions and complex character, with such a long and intricate
history behind it. That is why I have elsewhere also said that the problem
of the Mahabharata textual criticism is a problem sui generis.^ The method
of the Mahabharata textual criticism must be evolved from a special study
of the Mahabharata manuscripts and of the Mahabharata manuscript tradi-
tion. Its results and achievements can be judged only by a standard of its
own.

Ruben’s Exaggerations and Generalizations

In his endeavour to maintain consistently an attitude of dogmatic doubt,
R. has been unconsciously led to make wild exaggerations and rash generali-
zations, which such a meticulous and captious critic as R. should have taken
pains to avoid.

Thus in one place (p. 242), R, observes that the iSarada MS., as a mat-
ter of fact, does not differ at all from other MSS. ! As a matter of fact,
this stat^ent of R. is demonstrably false. If a difference of something like
1000 stanzas (which is probably the difference between the garada and tt.e

Grantha versions of the Adiparvan), not to speak of innumerable minor var-
iants, is no difference, I should like to know what, in the opinion of R.,
would constitute a difference. Did R. expect that the Kasmiri Mahabharata
would be a poem of 8800 slokas in Old Prakrit in which Krsna was still a
tribal hero ?

On p. 253, R. remarks that every contextual criterion is problematic.’ This
is a rash generalization. In the Editorial Note (3) appended to Fasciaale
4, I have now pointed out (p. ii f.) three passages for which there is the
strongest in- {263} -trinsic probability, amounting to certainty, that they are
interpolations in the recension in which they are found. All three are instan-
ces in which according to the Northern recension the parties to be married were
united only by a shadowy and clandestine form of marriage known as the
Gandharva-vivaha, which is no marriage at all, while according to the Sou-
thern recension (respectively, in one case, the Grantha version c«ily) the
same parties were married, so to say, in church, in due form, with great pomp
and ceremony. I .maintain that at least in these three instances the crite-
rion of the intrinsic probability is not at all problematic. I challenge R. to
prove the contrary.

I shall mention only one other interesting instance of intrinsic proba-
bility. In the Paulomaparvan, Ruru, while praying for the life of his wife,
who has just died from the bite of a venomous serpent, says (1. 9. 4-5) :

“ If I have (practised) charity, (if I have) practised penance, if I have
duly served (my) Gurus, then on account of that (merit of these virtuous
acts) let my beloved be restored to life ! As from (the moment of) my birth
I have restrained myself and maintained my vows, so let the beautiful Pra-
madvara even now arise ! ”

The fulfilment of Rum’s fervent utterance is thought to be due merely
to the efficacy of his pious acts in the past : they by themselves operate as
a charm or spell to restore to life the dead Pramadvara. This is a form of
an impersonal ” prayer belonging to a comparatively older stratum of reli-
gious life and thought, which would never occur to an ordinary interpolator.
At this place, Gj. 2. 4 r, have some additional lines including the following
prayer (233*).

“ If my faith in Kr§|ija, Vi§nu, Hr§ike^, the Lord of the Worlds, the
Foe of the Asuras, unshakable, then let this beloved of mine be restored to
life !

This belongs to a later stratum, the period of the Bhakti cult. This is
just the thing that would be interpolated by a devout Vaisnava, to whom the
former prayer would be meaningless and unintelligible.

I maintain that here also the intrinsic probability as to what is original

1 Cf. also Ruben, (rp, cit, p. 244.

EPIC STUDIES


and what is interpolation is so strong as to be conclusive in favour of the text
and against G j. 2 . 4 . 5 - No £264} one with a modicum of the historical sense
can doubt it. Can R. adduce even a shadow of a reason to show that the
intrinsic evidence in this insitance is in any degree problematic? Scores of
illustrations of this character may be produced where the contextual evidence
is not problematic at all, but quite definite and conclusive.^

R. (p. 254) has magnanimously set the seal of his approval on “Die
Sage von Rsyasrhga by Professor Luecrs ® citing it approvingly as a piece
of investigation that belongs to the coveted domain of emendetio. It is un-
questionably that. Had R. now thought over the question a little more
deeply than he appears to have done, he would have easily perceived that
the whole thesis of “ Die Sage von R§ya^ga ” rests on the exploitation of in-
trinsic probability. There was, in fact, nothing else except the vulgate text
before Prof. Lum:rs when he framed his brilliant hypothesis about the diffe-
rent strata and the cross-currents in the Mahabharata version of that l^end.
If now every contextual criterion is so very problematic, then what is the va-
lue, may I ask, of Prof. Luders’s monograph, which R. professes to admire so
fervently? R. has been contradicting himself in one and the same para-
graph (p. 253 f.).

Theoretically considered also, R.*s proposition is untenable. When a text
has been tampered with on a large scale, however careful and however ac-
complished the interpolator may be, it is inconceivable that all the frills,
patches and paddings added by the interpolator should remain for all time
incapable of detection. It is inevitable that the interpolator should bungle
something somewhere, produce a misfit, leave raw edges which do not meet.
Therefore R.'s dictum (p. 253) “ebenso problematisch ist schliesslich ;c-
de^ inhaltliche Kriterium” is, in the form in which he has put it, funda-
mentally wrong and is to be unhesitatingly rejected.

Here is another instance of R.’s misstatdnents. On p. 242 he observes
that among the fifty MSS. collated for the Adiparvan £265} there are not
even two that may be directly connected with each other. This is of course
a wild exaggeration. The two Arjunami^ra MSS. show inter se no more
difference than any two (carelessly made) copies of an original would show ;
as a matter of fact— but this could not have been known to R.— they agree
almost page for page. If they were not copied from the same original, their
respective exemplars could not have differed from each other very consider-


^ For instance, it is on grounds of intrinsic probability that Prof. LOders
{DLZ^ Heft 24, Sp. 1142 f.) decides for and defencte the reading amytam of the
constituted t&ct (1. 1. 201). Here the documentary evidence is inoonclumve, but

ably. The same is the case with the three Nilakai^tha MSS. The MSS. of
the text as fixed by commentators (like Arjunami^ra and NUakaotha) are,
in general, as like as two peas. The number of such replicas can be increased
almost indefinitely. I have intentionally restricted their number to the mini-
mum necessary for fixing the text of the respective versions, always giving
preference to a divergent type. But even apart from such texts with com-
mentaries, there is considerable similarity and kinship to be noticed among
the different MSS. In the Editorial Note (2) appended to Fascicule 3
(p. ii), I have demonstrated the kinship between and K^. I pointed out
there that “the India Office codex must be a transcript not merely of a
iSarada codex, but, as a careful comparison with Sj would show, of an ex-
emplar very closely allied to mr fSarada codex This conclusion is supported
by numerous other agreements throughout the Adiparvan. That the three
new Malayalam MSS. M^. s again go back to the same original follows
not merely from the numerous readings these MSS. have in common, but
conspicuously from one particular mistake where they repeat inconsequen-
tially, at the same point, a fragment of a stanza (1. 85. 25) : pujayantlha loke
ndsddhava}}. Further the four Grantha MSS. Gj. 2. 4. u. (which will come
up for detailed discussion below) must go back to a not very distant com-
mon original. This group has not only numerous readings in common, but
it contains quite a considerable numbef of interpolations peculiar to itself.^
Their close affinity is, however, placed beyond the pale of reasonable doubt
by the fact that they all contain a stanza (294*) interpolated at a place where
it is, as will presently be shown, so thoroughly irrelevant that with it the pas-
sage does not construe even !

It will thus be seen that these generalizations of R. are absolutely un-*
warranted. They appear to have been introduced £266} by R, merely for
the satisfaction of having made some pointed and effective little statement.

The Four Types of Variants.

After pointing out that no pedigree of the Mahabharata MSS. is pos-
sible, R. proceeds (p. 243) to consider the different types of characteristic
combinations £tmong the variants, whose consideration must take the place
of the formation of the usual genealogical tree. He distinguishes four diffe-
rent types of constellations. They are as follows : 1. Complete Agree-

ment, where tlie two recensions N and S register one concordant reading ;
2. No Agreement, where N and S stand opposite to each other with two
   divergent readings ; 3. Cross- Agreement, where a part of N agrees with a
   part of S against the rest of N, which latter agrees with the r^t of S ; 4.
   Partial Agreement, where a part of N stands against S and the rest of N (or
   vice versa).

Diagrammatically the four types of constellations may be represented

thus.


Type No. 1 : Complete Agreement :

N = S

Type No. 2 : No Agreement :

N

Type No. 3 : Cross- Agreement :


Type No. 4 : Pmtial Agreement :

N, .No 1 N.
s/ 1 s,\so


Type No. 1 (N=S). In this case 1 have assumed that the concordant
reading of N and S must be postulated as having already belonged to the
archetype. To my proposition R. adds the rider that there is a possibility
that even such a concordant reading (or feature) might have been an inno-
vation made in one recension and then borrowed in toto by the other recen-
sion. He cites (p. 244) Ramiyana, Ayodhya 6 (Bombay ed.), which (ac-
cording to R.) is an interpolation in one recension, which had been borrowed
en bloc by the other (independent) recension. R.’s proposition would be a
contradiction in terms ; only he takes care not to put forward the proposition
in this form.

If the two recensions N and S of the Mahabharata should have an in-
terpolation in common, they would not be (truly) independent. But these
recensions must be assumed to be independent, and R. would not be able to
prove any second-{267}ary interrelationship ” between N as a whole and
S as a whole, at least for the Adiparvan. Should there be found a passage
which stands in such an apparent disagreement with the context that it may
(a priori) be regarded as an interpolation, it would be no more difficult-
in fact it would be, in my opinion, far easier and much more natural— to as-
sume that the contradiction was already present in the archetype,” before
the bifurcation of the recensions than to premise that one independent re-
cension had borrowed it from another independent recension.

For example, adhyayas 1 and 4 of the Adiparvan begin with the iden-
tical sentence, depicting the identical situation, that the Suta approaches the
R§is assembled in the Naimi^a forest at the twelve-year sacrificial session of
Saunaka. This implies that a new beginning is made at adhyiaya 4, totally
ignoring whatever has gone before it in the text as it now stands. Both pas-
sages occur with minimal variations in both recensions. It is evident that
this double b^inning (adhy. 1 and 4), as we find it in our version of the
Mahabharata, was not conceived and depicted by one and the same poet.
But it does not at all follow therefore that the interpolation was first made
in one recension of our text and was subsequently borrowed by the other
from this recension. There are various possibilities.^ Perhaps both versions

of the beginning lay before the diaskaiasts of the last redaction of the Ma-
liabharata : one giving the very useful table of contents, the other containing
some interesting old tales of gods, IJ§is and serpents. They were not consistent
in juxtaposition, but each was too good to lose. The redactors put both in,
making but a poor compromise. This is one possibility. The other possi-
bility is that one of these sections was composed and tacked on to an existing
version of the beginning by the diaskeuasts of the last redaction themselves,
using the same opening device. That would only show — ^as R. himself con-
cedes in another connection (p. 254) — ^that though we might regard the ori-
ginal epic as a more or less homogeneous £268} work, the archetype of our
MSS. already contained some inconsistencies and contradictions.^

Type No. 2 (N#S). I agree with R. that when there is a conflict between
N and S and they stand opposite to each other with two divergent readings,
no definite decision is, in general, possible as to which is the original ; the
versions should a priori be placed on an equal footing and treated with im-
partiality Accordingly, in such cases, I have adopted as stop-gap the
reading of N, placing a wavy line below it, to show that the reading is uncer-
tain. R. mentions an exception to this procedure of mine, but
the exception is only apparent. R. has failed to understand my motives in
departing from my usual practice in the solitary instance of the benedic-
tory stanza with which the epic begins {Nardyaf^am nama^krtya etc.). I
have printed it above the line not because it is found in K o.i or in K or even
in N, but simply as a mahgala. I am aware that the stanza is missing in S.
There is, therefore, every probability that it did not belong to the archer
type. I am also fully aiware that the stanza is a characteristic mark of the
works of the Bhagavata sect and not peculiar to the Mahabharata.^ There is,
however, the fact that all our MSS. of the Adiparvan begin with some bene-
dictory stanza. These stanzas have probably iisurped now the place of some
simpler mahgala with which the epic once began. No orthodox Hindu work
can begin without a mahgala ; and this edition of the Mahiabharata, critical
though it be, is and remains a Hindu work, which could not dispense w^lh


1 For instance, the story of the birth of Bhi^ma contains a patent contradic-
tion. The reason why the Vasus were cursed by Vaisi§tha as given in adhy. 91
( 1 = 96 of the Bombay text) is quite different from and inconsistent with that

tially identical form, in both recensions.— Cf. also the passage regarding the eight
forms of marriage (1. 67. 8-12) in the 8akuntala episode. The passage is made
up of two different and mutually inconsistent systems of rules, taken from two
different sources, lied and \2ab have been borrowed from a context which men-
tions only five forms of marriages ; cf. (K.) 13. 79. 9 and Dahlmann, Das Ma-
hdbhdrata pp. 203 ff. The same passage, with some variation, but with the same
inconsistency, occurs in Manu (3. 21-26) .

a irangala. My recognition of the unoiriginal dtaracter of the stanza is,
however dearly implied by the fact that I have omitted to give the £269}
stanza a number, differing in this respect con^icuously from the earlier edi-
tions, which treat it as the first stanza of the epic and an integral part of the
text.


The Position oj 3,4

One of the most perplexing forms of variation in the Mahabharata text is
Type No. 4, namdy. Partial Agreement. The critical apparatus is a verit-
able labyrinth of duplicated and intermingled versions, each with a Icaig
and intricate history of its own behind it. We have unfortunately no single
thread to guide us out of the maze, but rather a multitude of strands inter-
twined and entangled and leading along divergent paths. How difficult it
is to find one’s way in this maze may be realized from the fact that so pains-
taking and able a critic as R., despite his close and conscientious study of
the critical apparatus, could totally lose his bearings the moment the network
gets a little more complicated than usual.

The really petidexing part of the whole tangle is that while the agree-
ments of Sj Kj with S are mostly authentic and fundamental, those of
Gi. 2 . 4 . 5 with N are mostly secondary and spurious. Let us first consider
the position of the group 2 . 4 , 5 . which appears to have caused R. most
trouble. I shall state the case as it has been put forward by R. himself
(p. 249 f.).

Supanjadhyaya 19 contains a conversation of Garuda with his father
Kasyapa. Garuda introduces himself as patatam varistha and makes some
polite inquiries regarding his father {kaccid vas tdta kusalam gfhe^u) and his
mother {kaccit. . .mM\d na socati). The father replies that they are doing
well at home {vedaham eM kusalam gjhe^u) and then pronounces a blessing
on Garuda .tv a rak?atu. . .jco yajum^i ; thoi svastyayanam) . This con-
versation assumes in the Mahatriiarata (1. 25. 7-25) the following form.
Garuda asks his father for some new and substantial food and the father re-
commends the mammoth elerrfiant and tortoise (as in Supamja 13. 1 f. Ga-
ruda’s mother does) and proceeds to relate their history. In this scene
the contents of the Supaii). are to be found in the “ interpolated ” verses
(here adapted to the iww contents). In the beginning (324*; Ko. 3.4 N V,
B D Tj), the father asks Garuda if he is doing well “ in respect of food ”*
{kaccid vah kuialam £270} nityam bhojane) ; the three lines of this N in-
terpolation (says R.) correspond to the equally long S interpdation (326*:


1 This is R.’s rendering (“ fragt nach seinem Wohlergehen ‘ in Bezug auf das
Essen’”); but he has evidently misunderstood the line, vrfiich may be translated
thus: “Have you (all) been doing well? (have you had) always plenty of
food?”.

Gi. 2. 4. s)* which Garuda introduces himself as pMatdm srestha. In
both these N and S groups there follows a common interpolation (327*) in
which Garuda says that his mother is well (mdtd me kusald)^ etc. At the
end of the scene follows in these MSS. (N Vj B D Gj. 2. 4. 5 J ^2 4

only partly) the blessings of the father (335* svastyaymam. . ,rco ya-

jumsi),

Garuda has stolen the Amrta ; Indra hurls at him his Vajra ; Garuda
shows his strength and drops just one feather (Mbh. 1. 29. 19 = Supan.i.
27. 6). Mbh. 1. 29. 23 is similar to Supami. 28. 2 (Indra then tries to
    make friends with Garuda); Suparn. 28. 3 is similar to Mbh. 1. 30. 4 ff.
    (Garuda boasts about his great strength) In Suparp. 28. 1 it is narrated
    that out of Garuda’s feather, which had split in three parts {chirmmh tridhd
    tat kuUsena palram), there sprang the peacock, the “two-mouthed serpent-
    lords” and the mongoose. The last three padas of this stanza are interpo
    lated at this place in Ko. 4 (358*); the first finds an echo in 361*, an inter-
    polatbn of Ty Gi.2,4.r, itndhd kyiva tadd vajram), Kn 4 has then further
    actually cited verbatim Suparn. 28. 3 in 365*.

R. adnuts that in the second scene K0.4 unquestionably cite Supani.
F'urther 361*, according to R again, is to be judged similarly. That is an
interpolation in the S MSS., the same stanza of the Suparp. (28. 1) having
hover^ before the eyes of the interpolators as in the case of those who in-
terpolated 358* in Ko .4 After pointing out all this R. asks : “ Should one
now regard the first scene also as an interpolation made independently in N
and S ? Consider that Gj. 2. 4. s agree quite frequently in this episode with
N (1. 20. 15 ; 301* ; 329*; 343*), that they alone have a remarkably large
number of interpolations, and that 340* is found only G^. 2. 4. r> M and cor-
responds to Suparn, 13, 4 Has the G group then £271} interpolated the

passage under the influence of the Supanj. and in its turn influenced the N
groups? Su[kthankar] gives in 1, 20. 1 the diametrically opposite answer
with an assurance which is out of place in such difficult passages. It cannot
even be strictly proved that these “ interpolations in the first scene, which
are common to N and S, are not. m old remnant of the archetype/’

There are in the Adiparvan far more complicated passages than this :
this is one of the simpler complications. I shudder at the thought of what


1 It is by no means certain that (as R. sayaf, p. 249) the stanzas which are
common to the Mbh. and the Suparp. have been borrowed by the Suparp. from the
Mbh. I believe, on the contrary, that the Suparp, has to be looked upon here as
the source from which the stanza in question have been taken over by the epic.
Four of the stanzas are nearly identical' in the two works, because they occur as §Io-
kas in the Suparn, and could be utilized by tlie redactors of tlie epic version with-
out ch^i^e of metre and with some trifling change of language.

2 R. means the passages' which have been regarded as interpolations by me
and excluded from the text.

R. would have done if he had to handle one of the really difficult cases of
conflation.^ In the present case, it can, as it happens, be stTictly proved
that the doubtful passages of the first scene, which are common to certain N
groups and S groups, are interpolations and no rest of the archetype. Also
I may repeat here most emphatically what I have said in the note on 1. 20. 1
that the irrelevant insertion of 294* in Gj. 2 . 4 . 5 is irrefutable evidence of the
contamination of these four Grantha MSS. from late Northern sources.

We shall consider the second point first. I imagine, R. has misunder-
stood or overlooked the little word “ irrelevantly ” in my note on 1 . 20 . 1 .
Otherwise he would have tried to visualize the passage, by reconstructing it
carefully from the critical notes, and then he would have surely come to the
same conclusion as I . All that is necessary in order to prove that 294’* is
an interpolation in the Grantha group is to cite the passage in extenso. Here
is a transcript of the passage as it is found in G 2 , the better preserved of
the two Grantha MSS. belonging to the Bombay Government collection, col-
lated for the Adiparvan.

Even a cursory reading of the passage will show that lines 7-3 of this
passage (which constitute 294*) are thoroughly irrelevant here. The lines
comprise merely a string of attributes of Garuda. There is no finite verb in

the sentence and there is no reference to Garuda in the foregoing or follow-
ing lines. The only rational explanation of this state of things is that the
lines were interpolated in an ancestor of G^, 2. 4. 5 by a clumsy copyist, who
had missed the right place by four stanzas. Such mistakes occur frequently
in Indian MSS. because the additional lines were, as a rule, first written in
the narrow margin of the MS. and a small mark was made to indicate the
point of insertion. Should the mark get obliterated, the lines would be in-
serted by the next copyist wherever he considered they belonged or fitted
best. If those lines (294*) belonged to the archetype of our MSS. we
should have to assume that they were accidentally mis-placed in a sub-group
of the Grantha version, omitted (for an unknown reason) in another group
of MSSw K1.3 D2 M and are found in their correct place only in

^^0.2.4 Vi B D (except D2). Is this plausible? I can hardly think that R.
would say so. I am inclined to believe that R. had failed to realize how the
passage actually read in this particular sub-group of the Grantha version.
Taking all things into consideration, it is difficult to escape from the con-
clusion that an ancestor of the Grantha sub-group had been compared with
some MS. or MSS. of the Northern recension which contained the spurious
passage 294*. This is the first important fact to remember with regard to
this interesting sub-^roup of the Grantha version. It is quite in harmony
with £273} the other fact that this group contains 25 interpolated passages
in 52 adhyayas (24-75) or about 2()()0 stanzas, which have not been found
so far anywhere else. They are : 320*, 322*, 326*, 330*, 337*, 345*, 351*
(tliird line!), 357*, 363*, 364*, 368*, 371*, 373*, 382*, 386*, 387*, 388*,
406*, 519*, 584*, 636*, 705*, 706*, 741*, 755*. This group moreover con-
tains in the same section the following 10 passages which it shares only with
two or three other MSS. (in some written only on the margin) : 312*, 348*,
353*, 399*, 4104*, 421*, 423*, 442*, 469* (phalasruti !), 831*. How these
passages originate is somewhat of , a mystery. But as no one would be so
inane as to maintain that these are rests of the archetype preserved only in
a sub-group of the Grantha version and lost without a trace elsewhere, not
only in the remaining MSS. of the Grantha version but in all other versions
of both recensions as well, we are inevitably led to the conclusion that this
sub-group of the Grantha version must present a text exceptionally heavily
padded with indiscriminate additions. This noteworthy fact renders its ag-
reements with N immediately suspect. And a priori also it is more likely
that, when there is agreement between a sub-group of one version and some
aatirely different version or versions, the sub-group is the borrower. It may
further be pointed out that 294* is by a long way not the only passage which
this sub-group of the Grantha version shares with the vulgate text, against
the rest of the Grantha version together with the iSarada-Kasmiii and the
Malayalatn versions. Here is a list of these passages (in adhyayas 20-43),
which must all be assumed to be interpolated in the sub-group in question
16a



238


tPtC STUDIES


under the influence of some MS. or MSS. on which the text of the vulgate
is based, that is, of some late Northern sources.: 294*, 301*, 307*, 327*,
329*, 335*, ‘341*, 343*, 355*, 385*, 392*, 393*, 396*, 402*. 411*, 419*,
etc.

After this preamble we may proceed to consider the case of the Su-
parn. passage. Here the indebtedness of 2 . 4 . s to the Northern recen-
sion is equally dear and would have been manifest to R., had he but attempt-
ed to visualize the whole passage as it stands in the sub-group instead of
contenting himsdf with merely counting the number of lines. R.’s initial
mistake lies in thinking that 324* and 326* are equivalent passages, whereas
the passages, although of the same length and inserted at the same point,
are utterly different in contents and have an entirely different significance.
The passage 324* {274} contains a kusala-question and an inquiry as to whe-
ther Garuda gets enough to eat ; 326*, on the other hand, contains a question
as to where Garuda is going in such hurry ! Remembering this and reading
the various passages together, the relationship between the MSS. will be
clear. It is again a case of irrelevant insertion in the conflated group. The
passage in question reads in the different MS. groups as under.

Placed in this way, the reader will see at a glance that while 327* is a
proper rejoinder to the query in 324,* it is totally irrelevant after 326*; be-
cause in Gg. 4 . 5 » in reply to Kasyapa's question where Garuda is going, Ga-
ruda says My mother is well, so is my brother, and so am I ” etc. This
clearly shows that in Q 2 4 . 6 » 327* is a secondary interpolation. Then the
question arises whether 326* could be a rest of the archetype. The probabi-
lity of this being so is reduced to nil not merely by the fact that the passage
is found only in the highly inflated group G,. 2 . 4 5 ^ but also from the iK)te-
worthy circumstances (which I fear has escaped the vigilant R/) that in



EPIC STUDIES III


239


Gi. 2. 4. 6, has been altered from pr^tm cdhhydtavdn pituh, to Kdsyapam
dlptatejasam in order to accommodate the additional lines. In any case
these interpolations are not common to N and S, as erroneously believed by R.

The history of these interpolations must be something like the following.
The question (which is missing in S except T^) and the answer (which is
found only in Ti Gg. 4. 5 of the S MSS.) regarding Garuda's gastronomic
requirements (324* and 327*) were interpolated in a part of N (namely,
the base of the vul-{275}gate), inspired by SuparQ. 19. 2. Independently
there was inserted in G^ 2. 4. ^ question by Kasyapa (“ Where are you

going with such speed ? ”) in anticipation of the reply of Garuda in 1. 25, 7
cd, an interpolation which probably has nothing to do with the Supanj.
Subsequently, after comparison with some MS. or MSS. of the N recension,
the answer of Garuda 327* (which, as I have remarked above, fits only to the
question in 324* ) was irrelevantly added in an ancestor of Gi 2. 4. 5 by an
ignorant copyist after 326*, where it does not fit in the least ! This second
mistake of the copyist of an ancestor of Gi 2. 4. 5 is another valuable piece of
irrefutable evidence of the contamination of these four G MSS. from some
late Northern source.

I have remarked above that the mangalya or s vasty ayana (335*) before
1. 25, 26 must also be regarded as an interpolation. This follows for one
   thing from the MS. evidence, and is corroborated by the fact that the words
   of the suta : sa tac chrutvd pitur vdkyam refer clearly to Ka^yapa’s directions
   as to what Garuda should next do and ignore the intervening the long man-
   gaJya altogether. That is why the vulgate alters srutvd to smrtvd !

The reader need be not sceptical about the possibilities of such indiscrimi-
nate conflation and addition. The critical apparatus, if closely scrutinized
and properly understood, will reveal numerous instances of a similar charac-
ter. Even a close study of the Kumbhakonam edition, prepared in our own
times by two excellent Southern Pandits, will throw some light on the men-
tality of the old redactors of the Mahabhiarata : parallel and even contradic-
tory versions are placed quite unconcernedly side by side, regardless of the
effect on the reader, regardless of the fact that sentences are left hanging in the
air, that passages do not construe. Here one notices above all the anxiety
that nothing that was by any chance found in a Mahabharata MS. should
be lost. Everything was carefully preserved, assembled in a picturesque dis-
array. The guiding principle was to make the Mahabhiarata a “ thesaurus
of all excellences, ” culled no matter from what source. At the beginning of
his commentary on the Sanatsujatiya,^ Nilakantha naively remarks :

EPIC STUDIES


That is why it is safe to assume that far more stanzas must have been
added to the Great Epic than omitted from it. It follows from this as a co-
rollary that the archetype must almost completely— if not quite completely —
be contained in the extant MSS.^

It will thus be seen that the assurance with which I have spoken (in the
note on 1. 20. 1) of the contamination of Gj. o. 4 . s fi^orn late Northern sour-
ces is amply justified ; and that the passages common to this sub-groip and
the vulgate text (324*, 326*, 327*) mentioned by R. are in fact interpolations
and no remnants of the archetype.

The Position of K.

If I understand R. (v. 248, lines 1-3) right — his remarks are somewhat
confused — ^he questions the propriety of my treating the concordant readings
of the Southern recension and the Kalsmirl (Sarada) version (against the
rest of N) as original readings. But in the course of the same paragraph,
he expresses his unqualified approval of the procedure of Prof. Luders in
accepting as original the ccwisensus of G and B (against the rest of N). Now,
as a matter of documentary probability, there is no difference whatsoever
between the consensus of K and S against B D on the one hand and the
consensus of B and G against D on the other ; because the relationship bet-
ween the different versions must be one of the following type :

Ur-Mahabharata


N S

I _

i I 1 r T ^1

(-K) *N 'D -T -G *M

where X is the intermediate archetype of the vulgate, iid *K, *B, etc. are
the (uncontaminated) archetypes of K, B, etc.

£277} If Prof. Luders gives preference to the consensus of B and C
against the D MSS., it is to be presumed that he would likewise give prefer,
ence to the consensus of K and S against B (with or without D) , Let us see
what Prof. Luders himself has to say on the point

“ . . . . Dagegen ist es sehr erfreulich zu horen, dass von Adhy. 26 an noch

stimmen aber die siidlichen Handschriften so genau iiberein wie mit der

schriftengruppen schliesst die direkte Abhtogigkei der siidlichen Rezmsion
von der Kasmln-Version nahezu aus. Es ist daher anzunehmen, dass da, wo

Erachtens im Rechte, wenn er gelegentlich der Bangali-Version, mit der die
Maithili- Version und der Text des Arjunalnisra in allgemeinen zusammen-
gehen, da wo sie mit den sudlichen Handschriften iibereinstimmt, den Vorzug
gegeben hat.”

Prof. Luders, in other words, unhesitatingly endorses my procedure.
Herr Dr. R-jben dissents ! I am content to leave it at that.

The Extent of the Virdtaparvan

When I adopted 2050 as the figure^ representing the extent of the Vimta-
parvan, I did not do so, as R. says (p. 251), £278} under the influence of
Utgikar or anybody else. My chief reason for adopting the figure was that
it represents the reading of the majority of K supported by the Maithili
MS. (Vi) and Nilakaiotha version (Dn). When Nilakaiptha adopts it,
there is a certain amount of probability of its being well represented in the
old Northern MSS, of his time. I cannot say whether R. knows that it is the
reading of all printed editions as well ; it looks as though he does not.

Now let us consider the claims of the other variants. S has an obviously
inflated text.'* This inflated text appears to have been recounted in the South
by the diaskeuasts and the Parvasamgraha figure altered accordingly to 3500.'^
So the reading of S may be left out of consideration altogether. The other
Northern variants are as follows :

2015 : q=5I^ 5 K*

Only one thing that is plain in the midst of the prevailing confusion is
that the text has been counted and the figure adjusted more than once. The
pancadasmva of Kj, however, is obviously only a corruption of poncasod eva
of the text.^ Thus the text reading represents the reading of K except Ko.i.
There is no adequate reason for giving preference here to the readings of Ko
or Kj, because they not only disagree among themselves, but each finds only
desultOTy support from other Northern MSS. What could the editor do under
these circumstances but leave the reading of the vulgate (supported by the
majority of K) in possession and mark it as doubtful? The text figure
appears, however, in a certain measure, to be supported and even made prob-
able by the facts of the case ; because there are in existence, as a matter of
fact, a few MSS. of the textus simplkior (F A M)^— and with the constantly
operating £279"} urge towards inflation their number will be necessarily small
—which are approximately of that length.

The figure 2500, I must confess, I cannot adequately explain.® But as
regards 2300, which approximately represents the extent of the vulgate text
and which is documented by Bj, 3 . « m among others, one may hazard the
guess that it represents the measure of the text of that section of the Bangali
version in which the Kali (or Durga) hymn had been first interpolated along
with some other accretions. All things considered, I think I was perfectly
justified in adopting in the Parvasamgraha the reading which I did adopt.

What R. meaiis^ by saying (p. 251) that the reading of the archetype
night have been :

^N3[RTri5l: ^ I

is beyond my comprehension. Does he mean that I should have set this
(imaginary) line in the constituted text in place of the one which I have,
or does he only want to show that he can compose an Anui^tubh line ? If it
is the latter, I will readily admit that the line is metrically, grammatically
and stylistically impeccable, and does him credit. As we do not, however,
want to rewrite the Mahabharata, such manufa!ctured lines have no value
for us. The only sound test of the correctness of a reading is the evidence

of MSS. In overriding this evidence, R. is unguardedly opening wide the
door to a subjective Hohere Kritik which is the only thing that we must
rigorously avoid doing at this stage of the Mahiabhiarata studies and which
R. would be the first to deprecate if any one else were to attempt it.

Ruben constitutes the Text

At the end of his paper R. has appended, as a specimen, the text of 3
stanzas (1. 26. 1-3), as it should be constituted. The reader who has waded
through 15 pages of R.'s disquisition on the complicacies of the Mahabharata
textual criticism will be amazed to discover that notwithstanding the over-
whelming mass of variants and additional ” lines which stand at the
£280} disposal of the exacting critic and despite the alarming theoretical
doubts and scruples expressed by R. in the earlier part of his paper, his con-
stituted text differs from mine principally in the readings of two ak^aras, and
-the addition of a line which he himself subsequently (p. 256) admits to be
a probable interpolation ! The difference between our readings is as follow's.
In line 1 he hesitatingly sets ""mdtre^ for my °mdtrd, and in line 3 bhonktva
for my bhagndm. R. (doubtfully) decides in favour of °mdtre on the ground
that it is a lectio difficilior and according to R. himself — of course in another
place (p. 253) — the criterion of the lect. diff. is problematic and proves
nothing. Here is a neat little paradox : R. prefers the lect. diff. and sets it
in the text, because the criterion of the lect. diff. is problematic and proves
nothing ! — As regards the second word, R. admits that though he prefers
bhahktvd, the differentiation from (an original) bhagndm to bhmiktvd may
be an innovation (p, 256).

The other difference in the text as constituted by R. and by me lies in
the underlining of the uncertain parts of the text. Let me at once admit that
I have been rather remiss in showing the uncertain portions in this passage.
The device is a practical makeshift and by its very nature hard to apply
strictly and consistently. But the difficulty is not solved by R.’s marking
below the text wavy and straight, single and double lines, in season and out
of season, as soon as he espies a variant in the critical apparatus. An edition
prepared on R’s plan would be indeed not critical but hypercritical. Even
a constituted text is after all a text, meant to be read like any other text,
and not a chart of the aberrations of careless copyists of the last two 'millen-
nia. While it would be foolish to underline bhagndm (line 2) merely on the

1 Even with his reading, R.’s translation is inaccurate. The translation should
be : “ Aber kaum hatte der ubermachtige Garuda (den Baum) mit seinen Fiissen
beriihrtj als der Ast des Baumes abbrach”, etc. and not “ Nachdem (der Baum)
von Garu<Ja beruhrt war, bradi von ihm ein Ast,'" etc. R.’s' translation omits tu,
padbhydm and baliyasd and ignores the force of ""rmtra — (ifc.) ! — With R's reading
matte, the word sd in line 1 (for which there is no variant even in TGM^) re-
mains unclaimed and has to be forcibly connected with sdkhd in the middle of the
following line. Altogether the reading adopted by R. is unsatisfactory.

ground that three (inferior) MSS. read for it lagndm, which is obvi-
ously a clerical error, it is fatuous to underline text-words merely because
some MS. £281} or other has a divergent reading, as R. does in the case of
baRyasd (Ki mahdtmand), sa tad- (G^ sar^ib), tesdm evd"" (iSg te^dm
etc.

With regard to the short explanatory notes (p. 255 f.) added by R.
below the specimen of the text, I have to make the following comments.

The participle smayamdna is not “episch”, but smaym (of the text)
may be, since the root swi is commonly used with middle endings. — The line
340* being an interpolation (even R. admits, p. 256, the possibility of its
being that), the adhamukhdn of the text is opposed virtually only by the
Qvdhmukhdn of the two Grantha MSS. G 3 . g, because the remaining adverse
MSS, (Gj. 2 . 4 2 M), while trying to interpolate the Vaikhana^s (under the
influence of Suparn. 13.4), have obviously altered the last foot of the line
{2d) therefore the text reading adhomukhdn is hundred per cent, certain
and in need of no underlining, straight or wavy, — In view of the fact that
340* is missing even in T 0^,^ and in regard to the general character of
Gi. a. 4 . 5 explained above, there cannot be the slightest doubt about the spuri-
ousness of 340 * ; the line was probably first inserted in M and copied thence
by the highly inflated group Gi. 2 - 4 * 5 .— -The form jagjhe is found only in
five Devanagari and two Southern MSS. (one Malayalam arid one Grantha).
In old Devanagari MSS. (written with pr^tbamatras), jagfJte would be all
but indistinguishable from jagrdha of the text. So the reading of these Deva-
nagari MSS. may be ignored in this case. The Bangali and the Southern
MSS., which would carefully distinguish between the two words, have jag-
7dha, with two insignificant exceptions in the Southern recension. It is on
that account that jagrdha was adopted in the text, and it is not doubtful.—
2ef is certainly a third line, but is in spite of that quite certain. The line is
not missing in any MS., and as for its reading there is agreement on all
material points between all versions of both recensions. Thus K and S agree
completely with each other as far as e is concerned, which is a very signi-
ficant fact in its favour and should not be lightly ignored. The variations
concern mainly /. The difficult prmisdtayai, a led. diff., preserved only in
K, was the cause of the remodelling of the pada in S and the vulgate. Of
£282} course all guesses as to how the variants have actually arisen must be
more or less problematic. I would, however, hazard the conjecture that tlie
way to the variant pravicdlaym was virtually paved by the southern tend-
ency to confuse the palatal siWlant (5) and fricative (c) : the successive
steps in the corruption would be pravi^dtayan, corrupted to *°cdtayani and


^ G 1 2 4 2 have used their adhomukhdn. in 340*. They therefore substitute

then corrected ” to * °calaym. The vinasaym of Kg Dg is perhaps an ori-
ginal gloss ; or (more probably) a wrong correction of an original mislec-
tion, the successive steps being visatayan, *visdnayan {ta and na being writ-
ten almost alike in old Devanagari MSS), and vimsuym. The difficulty
with the word pmvisdtdyan may be realized when it is remembered that the
Dhatupatha knows no root like sat or sdt ; it cites only sad !

* * ♦

Ruben's long disquisition on the difficulties of the Mahabharata textual
criticism boils down to this : only that portion of the text which is docu-
mented by both recensions, in identical terms, is tolerably certain ; the rest
is doubtful in varying degrees, there being no criterion whatsoever which can
enable us to discriminate with complete confidence between the variants ;
even the concordance between K and S (against B D)i is not conclusive evi-
dence of the originality of the common reading. This is a more or less ob-
vious standpoint, though partly erroneous and distinctly timid and conser-
vative. It was hardly necessary for the “ Referent ” to write so much in order
to say so little. His attitude of dogmatic doubt has caused him to make
unwittingly some wild exaggerations and unwarranted generalizations as I
have shown above. His perfunctory study of the manuscript evidence has led
him occasionally to make gross blunders in the estimation of the relationship
of the different manuscript groups and versions, some of which have been
pointed out above. Many of the difficulties of the Mahabharata textual cri-
ticism of which he speaks in his paper are £283} due to his failure to under-
stand the modus opermdi of the redactors and copyists of the epic and his
lack of insight into the character of the different manuscripts--an insight
which can be acquired only after a long familiarity with the manuscripts
themselves and a close arid patient study of their tendencies and idiosyn-
cracies. Ruben's paper is, in general, quite intelligent, but not at all im-
portant for the Mahabharata textual criticism.

### More Text-Critical Notes

The Mahabharata Textual Criticism is unquestionably making progress ;
slow but steady progress. There are many things in it still that are
obscure, but some things have undoubtedly been cleared up. Thus there
seems to be consensus of opinion among scholars now on the following points.

1 R. seems to have stomehow a lurking partiality for the consensus of B and
S (or even B and G). If he only knew, the agreements between K and S are likely
to prove mudi sounder than those between B and S ; for, while there are indica-
tions that there may be sporadic contamination between B and G (and perhaps
evOT between B and S), the (genuine) Kaiimiri version (;§) and S as a whole have
certainly the appearance of being almost wholly independent of each other through-
out the Adiparvan.

The Mahabharata textual tradition, as we know it, is far from being
quite uniform. There are now two main streams of tradition, the Northern
Recension and the Southern Recension. Each recension is further sub-divided
into a number of provincial versions, which differ inter se in many parti-
culars. But the text of the Mahabharata must have been in a fluid state for
a very long time, almost from the beginning. Clearly therefore a wholly
satisfactory restoration of the text to its pristine form — even the late so-called
satnsahml samhitd /orm — ^would be a task now beyond the powers of criti-
cism. All that we can attempt now is to reconstruct the oldest form of the
text that is possible to reach on the basis of the MS. material available. The
peculiar conditions of the transmission of the epic necessitate an eclectic but
cautious utilization of all MS. classes. The Kasmiri version {textus simpli-
dor) has proved itself so far to be unquestionably the best Northern version ;
and the Malayalam, which in many respects is superior to the Grantha, is
likewise the best Southern version (textus arnatior). The agreement between
the KasmirT version and the Southern recension (or sometimes even merely
the Malayalam version) can be taken as an indication of originality. But
contamination between the different versions was inevitable and must be
admitted. The Telugu MSS. are generally and the Grantha MSS. frequently
contaminated from Northern sources. Even the Malayalam version, which
is on the whole free from Northern influence, may show some contamination,
in unexpected places. {91} In fact, all versions, with the possible exception
of the Ka^mirf, are contaminated in various degrees. It is, therefore, often a
very ticklish question to decide which agreements are original and which
secondary. Notwithstanding these difficulties, experience has now shown, the
case is not as desperate as it might at first appear. For one thing, there is
a considerable bulk of text where the Northern and Southern versions are in
full agreement, where there are no variants at all, or — ^more frequently — only
unimportant variants : this part of the text is fortunately certain. There is
then the question of the “additional*' passages, that is, passages found in
only one of the rival recensions. There is only one rational way of dealing
with these “ additional “ passages : they must be carefully segr^ted from
the rest of the text, and examined individually. The onus of proving the ori-
ginality of these “ additional “ passages will naturally rest on him who
allies the ori^nality : the documents speak naturally against them, but their
evidence is not by any means conclusive.

These are some of the principal findings of the Prol^omena. It is assur-
ing to find tfet these conclusions have been restated and endorsed emphati-
cally by so cautious and judicious a critic as Prof. M. Winternitz in his
recent review of the Adiparvan volume, in the pages of these Anmls (Vol. 15,
pp. 159-175). The outlines of the reconstruction may, therefore, be taken
to be correct, and the method of reconstruction sound. There is bound to be
difference of opinion as regards details, When there are hundreds of thou?>-

cmds of readings to be considered and weighed, it is natural that all the selec-
tions would not satisfy all readers ; and there are bound to be small slips in
so enormous and difficult a work as this. But the reader has the advantage
of having the full critical apparatus before him, prepared with all possible
care and presented in a convenient manner. The reader may easily substi-
tute in the text any reading that appeals to him better. Prof. Winternitz
has thus shown hisi preferences, in the article mentioned above, in a certain
number of cases, where he differs from me as regards the choice of readings.
They are passages, as he tells us, which he came across in reading parts of
the Critical Edition with his pupils in the Indologisches Seminar at Prag.
Me has thus published these criticisms after much thought and discussion
with {92} other scholars. I gladly take this opportunity, therefore, to present
my view of the case, setting forth the reasons which have guided me in the
choice of the readings adopted by me in the Critical Text.

1. 3. 60 ; gird vd sarhsdmi.

I have indeed assumed that agreement between K (strictly speaking,
between the original Kasmiri version, or at least the isarada MS. SJ and S
is a sufficier.t though not a neecssary proof of originality. But there is no
agreement here between K and S. Kq, it is true, represents the version K in
a comparatively pure form (Prolegomena, -p. L.); but K© is not K ; and Kj
is, on the whole, decidedly a better representative of the Kasmiri version
than Ko (Prolegomena, p. xlix). Now here Kq and have different
readings ; Ko agrees with S, and Ki with the rest of N ! This fact has been
ignored by Winternitz. As for the agreement of Ni and S, I have pointed
out in the Prolegomena (p. lix), that '‘even the manuscripts of distant
Nepal are not wholly free from contamination from some Southern source or
sources (direct or indirect).’’ Thus the agreement between and S cannot
be considered as compelling evidence, by any means. Moreover, it should
be borne in mind that this agreement between Kq and S concerns merely
the omission of one syllable ; and it is clear that this trifling omission could
quite easily take place utterly independently in the respective group)s. There-
fore, even the documental probability in favour of the reading preferred by
Winternitz is not at all strong. It is, in fact, considerably weakened by
the following (intrinsic) consideration. N has vd and a dodeka (hypermc-
tric) line ; S omits vd and has the eleven-syllable (normal) line. This is a
circumstance suspicious in itself. It is by no means certain or necessary that
all the padas of our Tri^tubhs should be of the eleven-syllable pattern. Some
of these hypermetric padas can indeed be made normal by the omission of
one or nK»*e of the additional syllabks, often n^rely of an expletive. But
there are many lines which defy such athetiratiem ; for instance, the second
pada of the very next stanza (1. 3. 61 ; ndsatyadasrm sunasau vknjaymttau) ,
Such lines ought to {93} warn us against giving hasty preference to these nor-
malizing readings. I have cited elsewhere (Prolegomena, p. xciii) clear



EPIC STUDIES


248

instances of efforts made by redactors to correct hypermetric padas of Slokas.
Similar efforts are to be found among the variants of our Tristubhs. But as
the scheme of the Tristubh is more variable and arbitrary, or at least more
complicated and obscure, it is difficult to prove the alterations made by the
different scribes or editors. In this particular instance, however, it seems to
me, there is no reason to assume that the original pada was not hypermetric,
because our pada is a standard hypermeter — a type of which Hopkins has
cited numerous instances. Cf. No. 6 of the typical, oft-recurring varieties
(mentioned by Hopkins in The Great Epic, p. 275) :


The scansion of our line is :

N-- vj ,

which, it will be seen, is a pada of the identical pattern.

From the examples given by Hopkins, I will cite here only the follow-
ing :

3. 13. 193 mamaiva (tau) vdmyau parigrahya rdjan
5. 42. 9 tatrdnu (te) ydnU na taranti mftyum
5. 48. 77 vegena {iva) sailam abhihatya Jambhalj,

13. 94. Vi na (hy) tUsake dra^lum iha jivalokam
        Hari, 2, 72. 44 vi-iOnjano jam Vtha) vidvm samagrak

Are we to omit the bracketed syllables — or some similar syllable — in
each case, on the ground that they disturb the metre, if not the sense ? We
do not possess yet the collations of all these passages, but I am confident
that there will always be some MSS. if not versions (or even a whole recen-
sion), which omit these extra syllables, for one reason or other. There is
this other consideration. The ancients had as good an ear for the rhythm
of their Tri§tubhs as we have, if not better. Why and how was the offend-
ing syllable first inserted, and then tolerated by generations of editors? All
N MSS. except contain the hypermeter. Is it not, under these circums-
tances, more probable that the original was a hypermetric line, which was
emended by some redactors in conformity with the later ideas of the regular
Upajati metres? {94} This particular hypermeter is moreover antique, for
we find (as Hopkins has pointed out) already an example of it in Maud*
Up. 3. 1. 6 :

yatra {tat) satyasya paramam nidhdnam,

with the scansion - — , which differs from our

line as regards the quantity of the first two syllables only ; ours has an
iambic opening, the Mupdaka line trochaic. Here, also, we can with im-
punity omit the bracketed syll 2 d)le (tot), and get a line which is metricaily
a “ better line, but obviously not the original one. I am, therefore, fully
persuaded that in all such cases we have original hypermeters. These old



£PlC STUDIES IV


249


stanzas were not built at all on the pattern of the later, more regular, classi-
cal metres, but followed some other finer rhythmic principle, which escapes
our methods of rough analysis by syllable-counting. — Now as regards the
sense. The exact explanation of the phrase gird vd samsdmi is, I admit, difficult.
Nilakaptba offers the facile explanation : vdMhdas cdrthe (i.e. vd = ca),
which can hardly be considered satisfactory. Devabodha analyses the phrase
into gkdV’\-d=sdmsdmi (with girau, loc. of gm), but that hangs together
with his interpretation of the Asvins as the Sun and the Moon, which is not
very convincing. It is possible to interpret the words as ‘ gird vd ’ samsdmi
(i.e. vai-\r dsamsdmi) , as is done by some editors. On the other hand, it is
also possible to emend vd to vmi (“ ye two, ” acc. dual), which would give
a satisfactory sense. This reading, which is mentioned as a patha by Arju-
namisra, is found in only one of our inferior MSS. (Dg). It seemed to me
such an obvious emendation that I did not like to adopt it on such slender
MS. evidence, and I have hesitatingly (as shown by the wavy line) set in
the text the old Northern reading vd, which isi unquestionably a lectio diffi-
cilior. The whole hymn is, however, obscure and full of interpretative and
other difficulties. It will have to be studied and dealt with more minutely
before we can be sure of its text and meaning. But I am fully persuaded
that vd (or some such word) did form part of the original line, and it would
be a mistake to omit it.

1. 3. 145 Kuruksetre nivasatdm.

Why WiNTERNiTZ should have any doubts about nivasatdm, I fail to
understand. It is merely an augmentless imperfect, and {95} augumentless
imperfects are most common in the Mbh., especially in the case of verbs with
prepositions, as in this case. Even Whitney {Sanskrit Grammar, §587d)
remarks : “ Besides the augmentless aorist-forms with md prohibitive, there
are also found occasionally in the later language augmentless imperfect-
forms (very rarely aorist-forms), which have the same value as if they were
augumented, and are for the most part examples of metrical license. They
are especially frequent in the epics^ (whence some scores of them are quot-
able).” To this, in 1884 (that is now more than fifty years ago), Holtz-
MANN added the note :

” Beispiele von fehlendem Augmente des Imperfects sind ziemlich hau-
fig, besonders in Q>mpositum und hier wieder in solchen, die mit auf a aus-

(no. V. 1. !) 189. 21, samahhidravat 218. 28. There are many others, less
certain. A number of instances will be found in the Tentative Edition of
the Virataparvan by Mr. Utgikar ; the Critical Edition of this parvan, I
may add, will again contain quite a few instances of this particular solecism.
How many examples are really needed before it is admitted that augument-
less imperfect forms occur regularly in the Mbh., and we cease to talk of
“correct” and “incorrect” forms? The augmentless forms are quite
as “ correct ” as the other as far as the Mbh. is concerned.
WiNTERNiTZ points out that the “correct” form “is given by the Kasmi-
rian transcript by the Maithili and Bengali MSS., by Arjunamisra, and
by some Southern MSS., ” and therefore he prefers it. It is a wonder that
£96} it is not given by more MSS. ; because the tendency is always to change
an “ incorrect ” form into the “ correct ” one. We have here to lode not to the
MSS. which have the ” correct ” form, but to those which have not the “ cor-
rect ” form ! Let us look at it in another way. If nivasatdm be the original
reading, then there are two ways of improving the text : (i) keep vasatdm
of the original and change the .word to nyavasatdm and thus make it “ cor-
rect” (Central sub-recension and Malayalam, independently), or (ii) keep
ni- intact, and change the word to the present nivasatab (“ K” version) ;
both are represented here. If, on the other hand, nyavasatdm were the origi-
nal reading, no one would think of changing it later to nivasatdm ; and
nivasatah of K would also be quite unintelligible. The text reading niva-
satdm thus explains, to a certain extent, how the other readings may have
arisen and has therefore been preferred. And I think there cannot be much
doubt about its correctness and originality.

1 . 3. 183 prabruhi vd kim kriyatdm dvijendra.

If WiNTERNiTZ prefers me kvm, he must, at the satne time, also prefer
karardyam adya | yendsi kdryeii^i etc., found in N (except K D2.5) ; but
he did not realize it.’ The me kim of the Vulgate cannot be joined to kriya-
tarn dvijendra of K B4 D2.5 S. There is no MS. which reads prabruhi me
kim kriyatdm dvijendra | susrusur asmy adya vacas tvadiyam. The reading
of the line proposed by Winternitz will be like an animal with the head
of a horse and tail of a donkey ! The text reading of the entire line — nay, of
the entire stanza — occurs verbatim in Kj. 3. 4 I think, the original NoKrthem
reading was probably prabruhi vd kim, as in text. If vd be useless after pra^
bruhiy it is more than useless after kim, where Winternitz would have it.
It is conceivable that the (original) Northern reading (preserved in Kj. 3. 4.
is corrupt, and we ought to give here preference to S. That is another mat-
ter. Not being convinced that vd kim of 3. 4 was “ secondary ” or cor-



EPIC STUDIES IV


251


rupt from hint vd of S, I have adopted, in the text, vd kirn underlining it to
show that it is less than certain. But mdm kirn, mdm yat, me kim, me tv am,
vokyam of the Northern MSS. are clearly all secondary, and need not be
considered at all.

{97} 1. 55. 3 stptum pdtram ca rdjams tvmn.

I have taken the Sarada MS. only as the norm for my edition ; I have
not undertaken to reproduce its text verbatim. The srotfpdtrarh ca rdjams
tvdm of §1 K is opposed by all other MSS. And, moreover, as there is agree-
ment between B D and S — more or less independent versions — on the reading
srotum pdtram ca rdjams tvam, this reading is indicated as the original, and
has been adopted, without wavy line ; a procedure quite in accord with the
principles of text reconstruction laid down in the Prolegomena (p. XCI).
WiNTERNiTZ finds srotrpdtram ca rdjams tvdm of K “better Sanskrit,” but
I must frankly confess that I could not make head or tail of it, and I can-
not understand it even now. The text reading is the same as the reading of
the Vulgate and of the Southern recension, and is besides quite clear, and,
as far as I can judge, flawless Sanskrit. It may be translated : “ And thou
art, O King; a fit person to hear (Vyasa's Bharati Katha),” a sense which
suits the context admirably. Furthermore, K has here an entirely different
reading for the whole stanza. If we adopt the reading preferred by Winter-
NITZ, then we must read the stanza as :

srotrpdtram ca rdjmhs tvdm prdpyeyarh Bhdratl subhd ]
guror vaktraparispandani mudd protsdhativa nwm\\,

which is apreciably different from the text. But the variants of the other ver-
sions do not at all suggest that this is the original reading. Our text: repre-
sents the reading of the Southern recension, which has here, in my opinion,
the greatest probability.

1. 56, 8 : katham vyatikramm dyute.

It is natural that W. should demand wavy lines for this verse. I admit
the line is most puzzling, and I only lighted upon the solution of the puzzle
by accident, after prolonged wrestling with it. An explanatory note was really
called foi-, because the first line is absolutely unintelligible unless one knows
the particular meaning of the root vyatikram intended here, which is “to
wrongly submit or surrender oneself to, wrongly take to (a thing or person,
acc.)”. It is a rare meaning, but not unknown. It is given in the dictionaries
of Monier Williams (ed. 1899, s. v. {98} vyatikram), and Macdonell
(s. v. kram). It appears not to be given in PW, but pw has (s. v. krOm) :
“verkehrter Weise sich einer Sache (Acc.) hingeben”. One example of the
use is (B.) 12. 174. 36 :

atha ye buddhim aprdptd vyatikrdntds ca mudhatdm
te 'tivelam prakr^ymti samtdpam upaydnH ca | \



252


EPBC STUDIES


Here vyatikrMM ca muihatam must mean those who have surrender-
ed themselves (wrongly) to folly” ; no other meaning will fit, as far as I
ctin judge. Our stanza is, therefore, to be traslated thus :

How (indeed) did the two sons of 'Prtha, as well as the two som of
Madri, (tamely) surrender themselves to the tiger among men (Yudhi§-
thira), who was being cheated at dice by those wicked men, and (how did
they) follow him?”

This strange submission consists in their consenting, in the first instance,
to be used as pledges or stakes in that dire game of dice, and acquiescing
dumbly to everything that Yudhi^thira did. The Southern recension is un-
animous on the point that the doubtful word was some form of vyMikmm ;
and the eight readings recorded in our crit. app. show that it must have been
some word which was as unintelligible to the scribes and editors as it is to
WiNTERNiTZ. WiNTERNiTz is again mistaken in thinking that the S reading
is vyatikmmadyute. This is the reading not of S but of only two MSS.
(Gs.e) out of the thirteen Southern MSS. of our crit. app. I myself have
followed S in reading vyatikramm dyiite, which is the reading of five of the
Southern MSS. In fact, my text represents the reading of the majority of
the Southern MSS., and is, therefore in a sense, the true S reading. It is
needless to add that vimrjitcm of ‘‘ K ” and vyasaninam of the Central sub-
recension, are emendations, made by those who could not make head or tail
of the original. For it is clear that no one would change vinirjitam or vya-
sofdnam to any of the Southern readings, while the reverse would be the most
natural thing in the* world. It is further worthy of note that while the
Northern MSS. have the easier reading, there is no agreement between the
Kasimri and the Central sub-recension. They must therefore represent in-
dependent alterations of a third original. — Following certain other S MSS.
P. P. S. Sastri has adopted the reading {99} vyatikramam dyute (without
recording any v. 1.) ; but I am inclined to think that this is a wrong analysis
of ""krammdyute whidi in S MSS. stands for both ^krammh dyute and
°kramm dyute— Now that I have explained how the awkward word is to
be interpreted, I have no doubt that Winternitz will agree with me that the
text reading is correct

1. 57. 20 : kriyate *U€€hrayo njpaih.

There has been extraordinary reluctance among scholars to face the fact
that the Mbh. text once contained far more examples of hiatus than what one
deems right or readable for such an ancient and venerable text. But there
is hardly any excuse now for such hesitation. On p. xciii of the Prolegomena,
I have given numerous instances of the surreptitious efforts of scribes and
redactors to eliminate hiatus, which show that hiatus was an anathema to
them. It is wdl known that the Sandhi is not rigidly observed in the Vedic
Sajhhitas, the Brahmaoas, and the Upani^ads, in Pali, and in Prakrit works.



EPIC STUDIES IV


253


Why must the Sandhi then be rigidly observed in the popular epic, a work
which has its roots firmly embedded in the soil of the heroic poetry of the
Sutas, and which has throughout preserved vestiges of its humble origin ? The
only reference (so far as I know), in the poem itself, to the Mbh. being a
Kavya {krtam mamedam bhagavan kdvyam paramapujitam) has now dis-
appeared with the Brahma-Ganesa inteipolation in the Adi, and we are thus
left only with a Purana, Itihasa or Akhyi^a. A specimen of this class of
work may surely contain sporadic instances of hiatus, without our being
scandalized. It is futile, I may add, to try to apply to this category of popu~
Utr literature the rules of the dialect of the high-brow iSistas. We may expect
every conceivable solecism in the language of the Mbh., and we find, in fact,
an amazing variety of them ; the hiatus, which was extremely common, is
only one of such so-called irregularities. But for this strange modem anti-
pathy towards hiatus, Winternitz would have recognized that the emenda-
tion is quite legitimate and certain. Winternitz considers the North-
ern readings but wholly ignores the Southern, which is fatal to his
argument. S does not contain either ati (or abhi) which is found only in
certain N MSS., and is besides superfluous. {100} TG have recast the line ;
kuTvanty etc dhvafocchrayam, with kurvmti (note the active voice!), that
is, a form of the root kr (like kriyate of N) at the head of the pada. All
these versions have the verb, it may be noted, in the beginning of the pada.
M contains the same three words as our kriyate, ucchr^yali and njpm}}, but
transposes kriyate and ucchrayalt, reading ucchrayah kriyate nrpaih. This is
the key-.reading, which gives a clue to the original. You can explain every-
thing else, but you cannot explain the transposition in M {which fiormdly
ought agree with TG), unless you start from the hypothetical kriyate
*ucchrayo njpaih. If you argue, on the other hand, that the reading of M
is an arbitrary variant, which is in no need of a special explanation by means
of an emendation, then there is no need of a critical edition either ; because
all MSS. contain approximately the same text and the same story, and the
few differences could be regarded as arbitrary variations which needed no
explanation. With this reading, containing the opprobious hiatus, you can
explain all the variations. N inserts a futile and innocuous abhi (corrupted
in some MSS. to ati) to destroy the hiatus. M transposes the ucckrayo^ which
is the chief cause of the trouble ; TG recast the original, and substitute a
reading which fits badly in the context, with ah active kmvanti (having no
proper subject), after kriyaie in stanza 19. That is how I r^atd this little
complex of readings, and hence the emendation, of whose correctness I myself
have no doubt whatsoever.

1. 57. 21 : hdsyarupef^a samhmah*

This reading is undoubtedly, as Winternitz rightly observes, the lectio
difficitior, but there is not the slightest doubt about its being the original
reading, judging by documentary evidence, and therefore, there is absolutely

no nedd of underlining it. It is, in the first instance, the reading of the whole
oj M, which WiNTERNiTZ appears not to have realized. I have stated, as my
opinion, that the Malaytalam version is the best representative of the Southern
recension (Prolegomena, p. lxxiii). I am glad to note that Winternitz
{Annals, Vol. 15, p. 170) agrees with me, and that even my learned friend
Vidyasagara Prof. P. P. S. Sastri now endorses it. In the introduction
(p. iii) to Vol. IV of his edition £ 101 } of the Southern Recension, Sastri
writes : “ Not having been subject to Nayak influence in any manner what^
soever, the tradition handed down By the Malayialam Manuscripts preserved
the Grantha text, in a purer and more unmixed form than even some com-
paratively early Grantha manuscripts, as the Malayalam MSS. do not at
all seem to have come into contact with the Northern Recension till ‘very
recent timesj'^ Now this reading of the Malayalam version is supported by
the reading of the Kasmiri version ; for though is missing, yet (India
Office 2137) has the corrupt hdmyahdmya'' (for hamsa° of the rest of N),
and it is well known that in Niagari copies of ;Saradia MSS., s is frequently
transcribed wrongly as m ; so that we have to read hdsyahdsya (dittography).
The reading is further home out by Devabodha s gloss (the MS. reads hdsa^
for our hdsya^) : hdsariipena kridavatararuperia (cf. p. 9910 of the Crit
Ed. for the gloss) , where hamsa, in any case, would not fit, for it is not clear
how hamsarupa would be krlidvcddrarupa. Further, samkarah is the read-
ing of all MSS. except B 5 Dn, which have Isvarah (an obvious emendation)
and TG which has vdsavaJi (which must likewise be an emendation), origi-
nally, perhaps, only a gloss. Here practically the whole of N is supported
by M. samkarah is here not a name of Indra, but only an epithet, an attri-
bute meaning ‘auspicious, beneficent'. Thus in (B.) 3. 229. 6 samkara is
used with reference to Skanda : lokdndm samkaro bhava. In (B) 3. 201. 29
the epithet mahesvara (“great lord'’) is applied to Vi§nu tvayi .nit-
yam mahesvara. Further in 1 . 58. 43, the epithet isa (“lord”) and
sambhu (“auspicious”) are applied to god Brahma : prabhavah sarvabhu-
tdndm tsah sathbhuh prajdpatih. This shows that the words samkara, sambhu,
Isa, mdhesvara, and so on, which are now generally regarded as proper names
of Mahadeva, were still not specialized, but were applied to other gods as
well, as mere epithets, descriptive of their beneficence or omnipotence.

p. XXIV of the Prolegomena). The Vulgate lacks here the support of the
Grantha version, which has an enitrely different reading :

avayos ca katham brahman bhavisyati samdganuth |

The Grantha version dispenses altogether with the troublesome drsyatoh
of the original (or the unsuitable v. 1. drUayoh of the Vulgate), thus reveal-
ing its secondary character. The line was recast in the archetype “ Sigma
(see the pedigree in the Prolegomena, p. xxx). The textual relations here
are ideal, being clear as crystal. Winternitz is right in regarding it as pass,
part, praes. with active ending. Passive forms with active endings are quite
common in the epic. I adduce a few examples to dispel the remaining doubts
of sceptics : 1. 11. 15 isyati (v. 1. Uyeta, arhati etc.) ; 16. 15 dksipyatajj, (no.
v. 1. explanation); 34. 13 moksyanti (v. 1. moksyante)\ 47. 9 sambhriyantu

tdm (v. 1. jvalatdm, dahyatdm) ; 48. 22 diryati (v. 1. siryati) ; 53.6 viduyald

219, 5 adrsyan (v. 1. adrsyd, nyapatan).

1. 92. 2 : Gahgd srir iva rilpim.

The configuration of the MSS. as well as the intrinsic merit of the read-
ings are different in the two lines. That is how iSj appear to be of greater
authority in the first line than in the second. The salildt of the text is found
in all MSS. except (S only transposing the word : Text salildt tasmdt,

S Gangd salildt), and is, therefore, for one thing, obviously far better docu-
mented than sayandt of Ki only. In the second line, therefore, we have,
practically, only two readings : sayandt of Si Ki, against salildt of the rest ;
therefore the reading of has been rightly re-[103}-jected. Such is not

the case in the first line. Here we have three nearly independent readings
(§1 Ki Gahgd mr iva rupini : Vulgate G. strlrupadhdrim : S lobhamyata-
mdkrtih, which latter is mr jourth pdda). Here, while the two Northern
readings are somewhat allied to each other, the Southern reading is entirely
different, having very little connection with the Northern. None of the
readings can be mechanically derived from the other, and intrinsically they
are all more or less of the same value. Such being the case, the Northern
tradition was, as usual, followed. Winternitz does not say why he thinks
strirupadhdrm is better than the other. The reason why I chose stir iva
rupini {** beautiful like Lak§mi '') is that it is nearer in sense to lobhamyata-
mdkjtih (‘'with a most enticing form'*) of S, than stfirupadhdrmi (“assum-
ing the form of a woman”) of the Vulgate. I have here explained in detail
the exact reasons which have weighed with me in making the difficult choice,
but as a matter of fact, they are all three epic iterata and these iterata

keep alternating with each other indiscriminately. In such cases, it is im-
possible to decide, with certainty, which is original and which is secondary,
and the matter is also of no great consequence. The uncertainty of the
text tradition has been duly indicated by a wavy line.

1 . 92. 7 : rdjan kmydm varastnyam.

I am glad Winternitz has drawn my attention to a wrong reading
which has crept in here, through oversight, and I gladly take this opportun-
ity to publish a correction. The reading I had intended to adopt, or at
least I should have adopted, is precisely the one advocated by Winternitz :
rdjm kamydfh vara°, that of the Kasmiri version (iSi Ko-2.4). The fact is
that just for first two words of the last pada of this stanza, there is a con-
fusing array of readings in Northern MSS., all meaning, more or less, the
same thing : rdjan kdmyam Ko-2.4), divydm (K3), divydm kmydm
(Vulgate), kdmydm divydm (B), divydm kdmydm Under these

circumstances, clearly, the Kasmin reading should have been adopted, ac-
cording to the principles enunciated in the Prolegomena, but through a
clerical error kmydm (of the Vulgate) £104} has crept in, in place of
kdmydm (of the Kasmiri), which was intended. — I do not agree with
Winternitz however when he says that the epithet kmyd is “not very
appropriate for Gah^ It would be quite appropriate, as far as I can see.
It would imply that she was an unmarried virgin, which is the regular
meaning of kmyd ; compare :

1. 57. 63 uvdc /2 matpriyam krtvd kmyaiva tvam bhavisyasi

1. 104. 12 prdddc ca tasydh kmydtvam punch sa paramadyutih

(B) 3. 307. 16 sd mayd sake samgamya punch kmyd bhavisyasi

It would then answer Pratipa’s objection (1. 92. 6) :

ndham parastriycm kdmdt gaccheyam varavarnini.

But kanydm is not supported by the MS. evidence, and kdmydm is :
that is the main point. The constituted text should therefore be corrected
accordingly by changing kmydm to kdmydm.

1 . 92. 45 : na ca torn kimccmvdcc.

Here I do not agree with Winternitz. I am fully persuaded that the
text is quite in order. The first mistake Winternitz makes is in thinking
that sa is the reading of K ; it is actually given in the crit. app. as the
reading of 61 Ko.3.4 D5. Winternitz has overlooked the fact that §1
differs from Kj, which is in itself suspicious ; and K^ is also excluded from
the group. If ca has to be translated by “ but there is no help for it ; for
ca has frequently to be rendered in that way. For the Mbh., I may add,
ca and tu are almost synonymous, tu having entirely lost the specific ad-
versative force. It is quite clear that there must have been a period in the
history of Sanskrit, as it was spoken, in which the two ^all particles ca



EPIC STUDIES IV


257


and tu were confused in the mouths of the common people, and were used
indiscriminately. That is, in fact, the only explanation of the curious particle
cu one conies across in certain A^ka inscriptions, which is evidently a com-
bination of ca and tu. The iSarada MS. undoubtedly offers a “better"’
reading, but, as a comparison of the different versions shows, it is a clear
innovation or emendation. That the original had something like na ca (of
the text) is proved by TG, which has nu tUy only in a slightly different
combination : {105} ma^ia kimcin na tu tdm. M differs from TG, and
has a third combination, with a new word vacanam, not found in the other
versions : novae a vacanam kimeit, which has neither na ca nor na tUy and
which does not help to solve our difficulty. The sa of some of the Kasmiri
MSS. is not necessary for the context, as the subject mahipatih (“ the king ”)
occurs in the same line.

1. 92. 50 : a^teme Vasavo dev ah.

Practically all the MSS. except those of the D version begin with a^tau,
which makes it probable (if it does not directly prove) that the original
must have begun with astau ; therefore imesiau (one of the readings pre-
ferred by WiNTERNiTZ) must be ruled out, as an emendation, probably of
a lectio difficilior. The (final) me of and the initial ime of some

Nagari MSS. suggest that the original was the conjectural * asteme, which
combines the characteristics of these groups, and which is very close to the
a^td of 5^2. It is also suggested, to a certain extent, by the Bengali
fl.s/CM ye. The conjectural astemCy is in fact,, tlie hypothetical form to
which the various readings astau me, asta me, astau ye, astau hi, and imestau
seem to converge. The convergence is not a matter of which a mathematical
proof can be supplied. If Winternitz does not see the convergence, he
may substitute for the text reading any of the five readings found in the
MSS. I did not know which to choose ; hence the emendation. The change
is not quite unmotivated. The motive appears to have been the seemingly
irregular Sandhi (double crasis) : astau 4 - ime = a^td + ime = asteme.
But as a matter of fact, there need not have been any irregularity at all in
the Sandhi, for asfeme may simply be resolved into (^(d-\-ime, or asta+ime,
since besides the heavier a^tmi, both the forms and asta were in use,
of which the latter (a^(a) particularly was used, I think, in all periods of
the language (cf. Whitney, Sanskrit Grammar § 483). The translation of
Winternitz is not quite accurate ; at least it is not literal. The stanza
has no word for “obtained birth,” which Winternitz interpolates into it,
in order to justify the reading me, of me,” which he has further to explain
as “ in my body ”. Translate : “ Those gods, the Eight Vasus, had on

account of Vasi§tha’s curse become men (lit. attained the state of men).”

for the original reading ; it is purely the result of conflation. is, more-
over, not a version ; it is merely a single MS., written in Maithili script,
and as such, capable of showing any reading at random. Again, the agree-
ment of with Dn and S against B Da is most unnatural and thoroughly
suspicious. In other words, the MS. evidence here is extremely confused.
Ordinarily I would have adopted the K reading tnmiusaivam updgatah,
which has occurred already in the previous adhy. (1. 92. 50), and occurs
again in (B) 3. 83. 66 ; but owing to the mdnu^m of B, which recurs in
S, I have given here prefer^ce to the reading of the Bengali version. I
may point out that it is the reading of the entire Bengali version, and not
of a few unimportant MSS., as Winternitz imagines. The readings are
these :

K manusatvdm updgatah
B mdnusm tanum dgatdh
S mdnusim yonim dgatdh,

This being the constellation of the readings, mdnusim and dgatdh are
as good as certain, as suggested by the agreement between B and S. There-
fore the real variant is only tanum : yonim. It is likely that the original
was yonim which was corrupted, in N, to tanum, and then the original pada
mdnusim tanum dgatdh (preserved in Bengali only) was replaced by the
recurrent tag mdnusatvam updgatdh ; but it is most unlikely that the latter
was the original which was changed in B to mdnusim tanum d°, and in S
to mdnusim yonim <5°. In any case, the Kasmiri reading must be rejected
here as secondary (cf. Prolegomena, p. lxii), as shown by the evidence of
B and S. Dn Di appear to have got their yonim from S (ibid. p. lxvii), and
f? Vi possibly from Dn.

1. 93. 11 : devadevarsisevitam.

Winternitz is mistaken in thinking that the hermitage in question was
frequented by Ifeis only, and not by gods as well. In fact, the talk is not
about a hermitage at all, but about the £107} forest {vanam) containing
the hermitage. Moreover, it was not an ordinary hermitage, but the hermit-
age of Vasi^tha, situated on the slopes of the celestial mount Meru (1. 93.
15 f.) :

Vasi^tho ndma iti sa khydta dpava ity uta || 15
tasydstamapadam punyam mrgapdksigandmitam |

Meroh pdrsve nagendrasya sarvartukusumdvrtam ] [ 16

The forest, therefore, in which Vasi^tha’s hermitage was situated, was
inhabited and frequented by divine r§is (like Vasi§tha) and by gods (like
the Vasus). That is how, in fact, the Vasus found themselves in that her-
mitage on that fateful day. If the forest were not frequented by gods, the
Vasus would not have cotne there at all. If we adopt the reading devd
devar^isevitam (which is plausible) then the compound must be taken to



EPIC STUDIES IV


259


mean “frequented by gods and jsis” (and not by divine j^is, as Winter-
nitz understands it). According to our text, the forest was frequented by
gods and divine T§is. As will be seen, there is not much to choose 'between
the readings, but I prefer the text, because only the divine |T?is like Vasi§tha
could reach those regions, not ordinary r§is. Moreover, such adjectives
(forming the entire second half of the line) are extremely common in the
descriptions of sacred forests, hermitages, tirthas, with many variants, as
may be seen from the following examples from the Aranyaka' (Bom. Ed.) :

3. 82. 41 devarsipitrsevita

84. 46 siddhagandharvasevita
87. 5 rdjarsigmasevita
89. 7 devagandharvasevita

89. 8 devarsiganasevita

90. 21 brahmarsiganasevita
156. 10 siddhacdrmapujita
     and 145. 41 devadevarsipujita,

which latter has our combination devadevarsi, and in which deva cannot be
separated from devarsi, for the stanza reads :

tatrdpasyata dharmdtmd devadevarsipujitam |
Nara-Ndrdyanasthdnam Bhdgirathyopasobhitam [ 1

The adjective devadevarsisevitam (or ""pujitam) is used with reference
to the most sacred and inaccessible regions like the {lOSj penance groves
cn Meru or Gandhamadana, or on the Himalayan peaks. I do not wish
to suggest that the simple phrase devarsisevitam would not have sufficed
here. I only want to show that tliere is nothing wrong with the text read-
ing, which is proved by the Kasmiri version ('^^ K). From the graphical
point of view, the difference between the readings (devd and deva-) is so
slight that the documentary evidence actually counts here for very little. It
is just owing to this uncertainty that the reading has been underlined in the
critical text.

1. 214. 9 : Dharmmdje * atiprityd.

Here again we notice Winternitz’s prejudice against hiatus; to which
I had drawn attention in tlie discussion on 1. 57. 20, above. But here my
case is stronger still. As far as the Vedic tradition is concerned, e (like o)
remained unchanged before a which was generally elided in the written text,
but, according to the evidence of metre, must almost invariably in the
Bgveda and generally in the Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, be pronounced
whether written or not. According to the statistics prepared by Vedic
scholars, it must be pronounced in the Rgveda in 99 per cent of the cases,
in the Atharvaveda and the metrical portion of the Yajurveda, in about
80 per cent of its occurrences. This shows that in the older stages of the



260


EPIC STUDIES


language, at any. rate, any Sandhi between final e (or o) and initial a was
rare. The rule becomes more and more rigid as we advance, until with
classical authors, ignorance or violation of the rule came to be regarded
as a capital blunder. Now the Mbh., whatever its age be, stands unques-
tionably midway between the Vedic and the classical epoch, and therefore
partakes naturally of the linguistic characteristics of both. In the Vedic
literature, where the scribes or editors did not dare to add even a single
syllable to the received text, the later antipathy towards hiatus shows itself
in the efforts to coalesce, in the written text, the adjoining vowels, accord-
ing to rules of (Sanskrit) grammar, leaving a correct but unmetrical and
unreadable line. The subterfuge is however so obvious that no one hesitates
to dissolve the Sandhi automatically and restore the hiatus. Much reluctance
is felt, on the other hand, by scholars £109} in admitting that the epic text
likewise contained originally many instances of hiatus, though of course
they are not as frequent as in the Veda. The reluctance is due to two
causes. Firstly the Mbh. text looks on the surface so like a classical text
that scholars, who have so far studied the text mainly from printed editions,
insist on applying rules of classical grammar to the text. The second reason
is that the ancient redactors who had not the same compunction about
making small adterations in the epic text (as is evident from our critical
apparatus) as they had in the case of the Vedic texts, have not resorted
to coalescence in order to remove the hiatus, but have boldly added little
expletives like cc, tu, hi for saving their precious rules of grammar, a pro-
cedure which, as it leaves tlie line metrically intact, makes the detection
of their nefarious interference difficult, if not impossible. Now though the
Mbh. looks on the surface like a classical text, there are many peculiarities
of Sandhi and grammar — even in the printed editions and the Vulgate —
which distinguish it from a classical text. Coalescence unknown to classical
usage is seen in amale Hmanam (1. 68. 64), te 'jhaya (1. 70. 41), manyate
'tmdnam (1. 198. 19). We have hiatus in a compound in Ndrdyam-
urogatah (1. 16. 35) ; Pragrhya Sandhi in samupete 'dbhute 'naghe (fern,
du. 1. 14. 5), jajhate 'stravi sdradau (1. 57. 88) etc. Double crasis in pama-
gdbhavan (1. 21. 6), Vasumanabravit (1. 87, 18), jdyateti (1. 11. 13).
Hiatus between padas, caused by the change of as to o (1. 76. 35) : jagdma
svapuram hr^to mujndta mahdtmand. Frequently we come across Prakritic
Absolutives like gjhya (1. 2. 93 ; 9. 19 ; 39. 23, 30 ; 119. 16 ; 123. 12, 16,
50; 124. 20 etc.), tosya (1. 1. 109), cintya (1. 9. 2), u.syn (1. 71. 58),
etc. etc, ; and the converse {tvd for ya) in sam-pujayiivd (1. 54. 15), d-
nayitvd (1. 66. 12), nu^mitvd (1. 85. 18), mu-sktvdnugatvd ca (1. 133.
24), prdpayitvd (1. 189. 25) etc., some of which may however, be explained
as absolutives of verbs with separable prepositions. Such a separable pre-
position we have in 1. 65. 34 :

firati sravanapurvdm naksatrdm sasarja ha j,

where prati is to be construed with sasarja, as pratisasarja : a line often
misunderstood by editors, commentators and translators alike. These vio-
lations of (Sanskrit) grammar are not so rare that one has to hunt for them
with a microscope. There is an endless list of fllO} them. One meets with
them at every step. If these and scores of other irregularities do occur as a
matter of fact, why could there not be hiatus as well ? Scholars are not yet
familiar with this phenomenon, because they have been dealings so far, with
the clarified text, from which most of these irregularities have been carefully
expunged, as is evident from our critical apparatus, by purists who have had
the handling of the epic text during a long succession of centuries. I have
noted that even Bohtlingk, who was otherwise a careful and conscious
editor, has in editing Mbh. passages for his Chresthamathie, rigidly enforced
Sandhi rules, even in prose passaged, with a zeal which was worthy of a better
cause, where there was not the slightest manuscript authority for doing so.
My study of the Mbh. MSS during the last t ten years has convinced me now
that it is the grammatical and material irregularities of the original that are
responsible for quite a large fraction of the mass of variations which we
come across Jn the MSS. The correctness of my reconstructions can be
proved only by adducing the entire evidence, which it is not possible to do
here, but which may be undertaken later on, when a large part of the text
has been dealt with in a like manner. I am fully persuaded that the Critical
Edition, as it advances, will supply material for confirming most of my con-
clusions. — To return to the case under consideration. Winternitz points out
that hi is found in all N MSS., including iSj, but he ignores that Kj shows
here tu, not hi ? Now is a clear transcript of a Sarada MS., and agrees
with our §1 to such an extent that I have expressed it as my opinion that it
is a copy of a ^rada original very similar to our '^radia MS. It is, no
doubt, a very small and insignificant variation, but how would Winternitz
explain it all the same ? hya cannot be misread as tva, even in the Sarada
script. Why should just Ki show here tva ? Is it not, perhaps, because a not
very distant ancestor of our and Ki had still the obnoxious hiatus, as in
our text ? The KaiSmIri version does contain many original features and
archaisms.

1. 215. 2 : ekdm trptim prayacchatdm.
        prayacchatdm of the text, I may point out, is not entirely wrong ; it may
        be construed with bhavcmtau, understood, ai more £111} respectful form of
        address than the second person. In stanza 5, however, the reading sampra-
        yacchata^m has been accepted, because the subject in the second person
        iytwdm) is expressed. We cannot argue that since in 5 we have sampra-
        yacchatiam, therefore in 2 we must have also prayacchatam. Because in
        the Mbh., which is not and never was polished literature, we do come across
        such strange yoke-fellows. Changes of subject and changes of construction
        are frequent. That is the view I had taken when I adopted the text reading.



262


EPIC STUDIES


But on second thoughts I decided that prayacchatcm would nevertheless be
a better reading, and the correction now proposed by Winternitz had been
already published by me, in the “ Addenda et Corrigienda,’' at the end of the
volume (p. 996).

The matter is not simple as Winternitz imagines. Of course, with the
reading yani, any one can see that the relative may be construed with rathmn
in 8. We then get two sentences : '‘Which (scil. chariot of Arjuna) was
fashioned by Bhauvana. .. .by (the power of) his austerities,” and “whose
beauty was like that of the sun.” But the reading yat is actually found in
(except Kq) ViG (except GJ ; i.e. in the Kasmiri version (except Kq),
agreeing with the Grantha version (except GJ, plus the Maithili MS. How
is it that so many MSS. give what Winternitz considers, an “ impossible ”
reading ? The reading is, in fact, not impossible at all ; only the construc-
tion is a little involved and difficult to understand. By reading yat we
actually get better sense. Construe : yasya, raver iva, yat anirdesyam rupam,

sarja, and yasya rupam raver iva (or yam Bhauvmah. . . .svatapasa sasarja,
and yasya anirdesyam rupam raver iva), which result from the wrong read-
ing ymn for {112} yat, yat is almost a perfect example of the lectio diffi-
cilior, and a regular trap for unwary editors.

1 . 218 . 14 : jaladhdrdmuQo 'kuldn.

Winternitz is here again mistaken in thinking that ""mucotuldn is the
reading of S. It is the reading of only five of the thirteen Southern MSS.
('Ti Gj. 2 M3.5) ; three others (T3 G3.4) read °mucofUlm, *three more (Mg.g)
read mumocivan, two (G5.3) read as in text {"^mucokulm). The question is,
in fact, what was the original riding of S. That question I have not been
able to answer definitely, and I have, therefore, put in, as a stap-gap, the
reading of Gg.e which seemed to me not improbable, since initial d is curi-
ously enough, sporadically treated in the Mbh. text, like a. The reading
""mmakuldn is useless ; it is obviously a substitute for some reading which
was difficult to understand or explain.

I have underlined muco in the text, but I now think that it is as good
as certain. It is documented not only by the whole of S, but also by Ko.^.a
Sf Yjy^. If muoo be admitted, then samdhUdn of the .Northern group be-
comes secondary, but with an important residue in the shape of the final
kuldn, agreeing with the final of °mucokuldn of Gg rhyming with

tutdn of Ko.3 Ti Gi. 3. Mg 5^ and finally reflected faintly in muconildn Tg G.. ,
The documentary evidence, therefore, points unmistakably to a reading jala-
dhardmuco{x)ldn. Query, what is the value ot x? The adjective dkuldn (“ con-
fused”) qualifying meghdn would be not inappropriate, referring to the con-
dition of masses of clouds confusedly hurled about by a! cyclonic wind ; not
so appropriate, to my mind, the atuldn (“incomparable”) preferred by
WiNTERNiTZ, and adopted by P. P. S. Sastri, against the evidence of his
basic MS. 3?, which has our text reading. In Sastri’s adoption of atuldn
and his ignoring of variants, which must have appeared to him meaningless
corruptions or clerical mistakes, we have an illuminating example of how the
readings get indiscriminately distributed, disturbing the relationships estab-
lished by the stemma codicum, and how the lectio difficilior is gradually effaced.

£113} 1. 218. 27 : vydtisthanta mahaupsali

The text reading vydtisthanta, it must be confessed, has not been adopt-
ed because it is the reading of Sj Ki ; it is a mere slip. I am thankful to
WiNTERNiTZ for drawing my attention to it. The reading vyatisthmta should
be adopted without doubt.

t * *

I may repeat here what I l^ve stated elsewhere that the problem of the
Mahabh^ata Textual Criticism is a problem sui generis. Here the princi-
ples of textual reconstruction, which must be first evolved from a study of the
MS. material and the MS. tradition, can be considered as finally settled only
after considerable discussion and exchange of ideas on the subject. I would,
therefore, repeat my request to Prof. Winternitz, made some years ago, to
continue his searching and exhaustive examination of the fascicules or volumes
as they come out, and give us the benefit of his ripe experience and valuable
opinions and findings. His publications on a subject which has engaged his
attention, off and on, for the la^ forty years cannot but throw some much-
needed light on the obscure question of the Mahabharata Textual Criticism
(which has unfortunately not received much attention so far from scholars),
and thus advance the cause of Matebharata studies.

In conclusion, I must express my grateful thanks to Prof. Winternitz
for the very kind and encouraging remarks he has made regarding the work
in general as also my keen appreciation of the uniformly courteous tone of
his sympathetic and appreciative review.

### Notes on Mahabharata Commentators

§ 1. Chronological Notes.

A necessary complement to a critical study of the Mahabharata is an
intensive study of the commentaries of the Mahabharata, of which there is


[ABORI 17. 185-202).



264


EPIC STUDIES


quite a large number preserved still, mostly in manuscript form. Among
the scholiasts who have written commentaries on the Mahabharata~~either
on the whole, or only on selected parts of the Great Epic— are : ( 1 ) Ananta-
bhatta, (2) Arjunamisra, (3) Anaiida, (4) Caturbhuja(misra), (5) Jaga-
disacakravartin, (6) Devabodha, (7) Nilakajifha, (8) Mahanandapuroa,
(9) Yajha-Narayapa, (10) Ratnagarbha, (11) Ramakimkara, (12) Rama-
krsua, (13) Ramanuja, (14) Lak^maija, (15) Varada, (16) V^iraja, (17)
Vidyasagara, (18) Vimalabodha, (19) Samkaracarya, (20) Srinivasa, (21),
Sarvajna-Narayaloa, and (22) Sr§tidhara. Very little is at present known
about these commentators : only very few of them have been, so far, pub-
lished. The only collective study made of these commentaries is by Holtz-
MANN in Das Mahdhhdrata, VoL 3, p. 67 ff., and that was in 1897, that
is, nearly forty years ago. The material at his disposal was very scanty,
and so are his notes.

But the study of these commentaries must be now taken up more seri-
ously, not so much for the sake of the explanations contained in the com-
mentaries — though even the glosses of a commentator like Devabodha are
extremely important — ^as for the readings and pafhantaras recorded in them ;
because, most of £186} the commentaries are older — some very much older
—than our manuscripts ; and therefore the documentation of these readings
by the commentators takes us back a stalge further in our investigation of
the history of the epic.

The usefulness of these commentaries is, however, considerably dimini-
shed by the fact that we know next to nothing about these commentators
themselves. In*particular, we lack information about their dates, which are
not easy to fix in Indian literature. Even if the dates cannot be determined,
it would be a great help if we could fix their relative chronology. An at-
tempt is made in the following pages to fix, to start with, the relative
chronology of some of the more important Mahabharata commentators.

A fixed point in the exegetical literature centering round the Mbh. is
furnished by Nilakaptha, who until lately was considered, at least in India,
as the most trustworthy guide for the exposition of the Great Epic, and
about whose date there is not much doubt. The available personal data
about him has been put together by Wilhelm Printz in the biographical note
on Mlakaiptha appended to his Berlin dissertation entitled Bhd^aworter in
Nilakantha's Bhdratabhdvadipa und in anderen Smskriihommentmen.^
Nilakaajtha'. according to his own statements, was a Mahara§>tra Brahmin
of the Gautama Gotra, with the surname Caturdhara (modem Chaudhari),
eldest son of Govinda Suri and Phullambika, residing at Kurparagmma
(modem Kopargaon) on the Godavari. ISRlakantha wrote his commentary

cularly p. 70 f.




EPIC STUDIES V


263


on the Mbh. ahd on the Gaoesagjta (a section of the GaBiesapuraoa) in
Benares, in the last quarter of the seventeenth century,^ the latter (Gaioesa-
^tia) being composed in a.d. 1694.®

In the beginning of his commentary on the Mbh. Nllakantha
tells us that before writing his commentary, the Bharaiabhdvadipfi, he had
compared many {bahun) copies of the Mbh., collect-£l87}-ed together from
different parts of India (vibhinnadesydn) in order to ascertain the correct
reading {pat ham agryam) and also consulted older commentaries.'^ We ac-
cordingly find that he frequently mentions variant readings and “ additional ”
passages found in the versions consulted by him, and he cites the explana-
tions given by older scholiasts information, scanty though it be, of im-
mense interest and value for the history of the received text.

(z) Devabodha and Sarvajna-N drdyana.

In marked contrast to Nilakaajtha stands Devabodha, whom I regard
as probably the oldest and therefore the most important commentator of the
Mbh. He is extremely reticent about himself atid his predecessors, but is
cited or mentioned by several commentators, who must therefore have lived
after him. ^ One of such successors of Devabodha was Sarvajha-Narayana.
Sarvajha’s Bhdr atari haprakdsa has fortunately been preserved, though it is
not definitely known whether his commentary on all the eighteen parvans of
the Mbh. is now available. His commentary on the Virata and the Udyoga
has already been published by Mahadeva Shastri Bakre." The Bombay
Government MSS. Collection (No. 180 of 1891-95) contains a fragment of
his commentary on the Adi, comprising merely the first adhyaya with the
beginning of the second ; while the Madras Government Collection (No. 2169)
contains another fragment which lacks the beginning. In the colophon of
the latter MS., Sarvajha is styled paramahamsar-parivrdjakdcdrya ; he was
therefore a sarhnyasin.

Now Sarvajna explicitly refers to Devabodha in the beginning of his
commentary on the Udyoga :

1 He was apparently a protege of Anupasiihha, who was a contemporary of
Shah Jahan.

® The year of composition is given as Sarhvat 1750, The name of the com-
mentary is Gaj^patibhdvadipikd, Cf. the name of his Mbh. commentary, Bharata-
bhdvadlpa ; see next note.

£ 188 } This stanza is curiously enough not found in the commentary
of Sarvajiia as printed in the GujaiatS Press edition of the Udyoga, but
occurs in both the MSS. of the work in the Bombay Government Collection
(deposited at the Institute), bearing Nos. 33 of A 1879-80 and 168 of
1884-87 respectively. The priority of Devabodha is, however, independ-
ently established by another direct reference to Devabodha in the body of
the published commentary itself, to which my attention was recently drawn
by my friend and colleague Professor Sushil Kumar De of Dacca Univer-
sity, who is editing the Udyoga for the Institute. In Sarvajna’s comment
on B|. 5. 96. 41 (on p. 327 of the Gujarati Printing Press edition), we find ;

This quotation can unfortunately not be verified ; for in the very old
Bengal Asiatic Society’s palm-leaf MS. (No. 3399) of the unpublished com-
mentary on the Udyoga by Devabodha the corresponding folio is missing I
But there is no reason to doubt its authenticity.

This establishes Devabodha’s priority to Sarvajna. We therefore get

Series 1 : D 0 v a b o dh a—S ar v a j n a

Now this Sarvajna-Narayaha must be identical — ^as has indeed been
assumed by Jolly,^ Buhler,^ Holtzmann,^ and others-''’— with the Sarvajfia-
Narayaina (also called Narayana-Sarvajfia) the author of the Manvarthavrtti
or Manvarthanibandha, a £189} well-known commentary on the Manusmrti,
published by V. N. Mandlik.® The assumed identity of the two commen-
tators at present rests, it is true, merely on the identity of the names, but
can scarcely be regarded on that account as doubtful. It is hardly conceiv-
able that there were two different Sarvajha-Naiayanas, both commentators
of well-known works on Dharmasastra like the Mahabharata and the
Manusmrti.

The date of Sarvajna has been fixed on the basis of certain quotations.^

^ This important passage was verified by me in a MS. of Sarvajha's com-
mentary deposited at the Institute, namely, Bombay Government Collection No. 33
of A 1879-80 (fol. 194^).

Buhler cautiously remarks that Sarvajna-Narayaiua ‘'cannot have written
later than in the last half of the fourteenth century/’^ but the recent resear-
ches of Kane tend to show that Sarvajna flourished between a.d. 1100 and
1300.^

(zf) Arjimamisra.^

Both Devabodha and Sarvajna are mentioned and cited several times by
the Bengali commentator Arjunamisra, the manner in which Arjunamisra
refers to Devabodha suggesting that in his time Devabodha’s commentary
possessed an established reputation. These references are as follows :

(a) In the foreword to his scholium (Bombay Govt. Coll. No. 30 of
A 1879-80 = Dai of the Critical Edition), Arjuna pays homage to his prede-
cessors, citing by name several of them. Devabodha, he mentions with
special reverence, whose commentary (among others) he had carefully
studied before writing his own commentary on the Mbh.:

Worth noting is the fact that in the long series of names of Bharata-
caryas cited by Arjuna at the beginning of the above extract, the
first four names Vyasa and Vai§almpayana, Devabodha £190} and Sarv^ajna
have been recited in the correct order of precedence and chronology, a point
to which we shall return in the sequel.

(b) Arjuna mentions the Acaryas again in the list of his (immediate
and remote) “Gurus’', placing this time Devabodha at the head of the list,
which ends with the name of his father, who (as we know from other sources)
was a well-known reciter {pdthakaY of the Mbh.

JIRPm ^ 5^^ WT II

(c) In the short introduction which prefaces his conunentary on the
Virata,-’ Arjuna twice mentions Devabodha, once to give expression to the
high esteem in which Arjuna holds him and again to record his gratefulness
to his illustrious predecessor :

EPIC STUDIES



(d) Finally, while commenting on 1. 143. 34 (a difficult stanza, giving
a fanciful derivation of the name Ghatotkaca), Arjuna mentions two read-
ings which had both won the approval of Devabodha :

(sic) 1 ^

These two readings are in fact mentioned by Devabodha : vide fol. 37^
of the Baroda MS. of Devabodha's commentary on the Adi.

The above extracts taken together indisputably prove that Arjunamisra
was posterior to both Devabodha and Sarvajna-Narayaiia. Adding the name
of Arjunamisra to Series 1, we get

Series 2: D ev a^b o dha — Sarvajna — Arjunamisra,

Some faint light on the question of the age of Arjunamisra is thrown by
a dated MS. of Arjuna's commentary listed by the late M. M. Haraprasada
Sastri in his Notices of Sanskrit MSS., Second £191} Series, Vol. I (Cal-
cutta 1900), p. 298 (MS. No. 295). The late Mahamahopadhyaya reported
that it was a carefully written palm-leaf MS. of Arjuna’s commentary on the
Mokiadharma, called Moksadharmdrthadlpikd written in archaic Bengali
characters and belonging, apparently, to Babu Saradaprasanna Ghose of
Kelomal, Tamluk. The MS- gave the date of writing as Saka 1456 (ca.
A.D. 1534).®

I may here draw attention to some stanzas added by the copyist, which
are to the eiffect that already at the time when the copy was made, correct
MSS. of Arjuna’s commentary were a rarity even in Bengal, the home of the
commentator, which can only be explained by assuming, as pointed out
already by Mahadeva Shastri Bakre that there was a considerable interval
of time between the two. The stanzas I am ref ei ring to are :

% I




%5iT srsjuiwft

The date iSaka 1456 (ca. a. d. 1534) is then the lower limit of the age of
Axjuna, but the date of Arjuna, if we rely on the information vouchsafed by
the copyist, must be long prior to A. d. 1534.

(Hi) Nilaka^tha.

We return to NHakaibtha, who is the next great Mbh. commentator, and
who cites or mentions Devabodha, Sarvajfia-Naray^ and Arjunamisra, not

parvan, Introduction, p. 6.


EPIC STUDIES V


269


indeed in the introduction to his commentary on the Mbh., where he mentions
a number of his ‘‘ Gurus ”, but elsewhere in the course of his well-known
scholium. Here are the references.

(a) While commenting on 1. 158. 14, a stanza with numerous variants,
Nilakajitha cites an old variant of the entire stanza, mentioning Devabodha
in that connection.

iT ^V- fr ^ ^ 1

1% m ii

[192} 5JI^: I '■

it is worthy of note that Nilakantha regards the variants as ancient,
owing to its having been explained by ” Devabodha and others ”. He must
therefore consider Devabodha as an ancient authority.

What N51akai.itha regards as ancient is of course a matter for specula-
tion. Nevertheless I do not think that Nilakajntha would have used the word
pTdctna in connection with Devabodha unless the interval between them was
at least three or four centuries.

In passir'g it may be mentioned that this reference to Devabodha by
Nilakaintha is yet another instance of the practice of mentioning names of
Acaryas honoris causa (pujMham)," because the reading cited by Nila-
kaotha is probably not that of Devabodha at all, who to judge by the lem-
mata in his commentary must have had before him a stanza differing from
the corresponding stanza of the Critical Ekiition merely in reading sakundh
for kutitapdli of the Critical Edition (1. 158. 14). The third pada of the
stanza as cited by Nilakahtha is certainly the reading of the T G version,
found otherwise only in three conflated N MSS., and in a fourth one written
in the margin ; while the last pada was found by me only in four MSS. (Kg
Ba M 3 . 5 ) of my critical apparatus, one of them (B 3 ) having as a matter of
fact the reading of our text in the margin ! It is therefore most improbable
that Devabodha had commented on the particular variant version cited by
Nllakaptha, and it is really doubtful to me whether Nilkaajtha had at all
Devabodha’ s commentary before him. Devabodha is referred to by Nila-
kaiptha merely as one of the ancient Acaryas.

(b) While commenting on B. 7. 82. 2, Nilakamtha notices a variant
interpretation of madhuparkika given by Devabodha :

(c) NSlakaiotha’s reference to Sarvajna will be found in his comment
on B. 5 . 40. 10 (Gujarati Printing Press ed., p. 131) :

and afeain in the same adhyaya, a few stanzas further on (B. 5. 40. 26),
we find ;

I JIRFPir: I I

^ BTit arrai^einJ: I

A reference to Sarvajna's commentary printed in the same work
(p. 131 f.) will show that all these explanations do as a matter of fact occur
in the commentary of Sarvajha, while they are not met with in any of the
three other commentaries printed there.

(d) For Nilakaotha’s mention of Arjunamisra, I may draw attention tc
Nilakajptha’s comment on B. 3. 291. 70, a stanza at the end of the Ramo
pakhyana, where he mentions various explanations of the word jdruthya,
among them the one given by Arjunamisra, whom he mentions by name :

These various extracts establi^ the posteriority of Nilakaajtha to Deva-
bodha, Sarvajha-Narayana and Arjunamisra. Adding Nilakantha to
Series 2, we get

Series 3 : Devabodh a — S ar v a j n a —

Ar junamisr a — N ilakaritha.

It will be remembered that as each member of this series of four names
clearly cites one or more of his predecessors, this is a chronological sequence
whose correctness is absolutely incontrovertible.

( iv ) Vimalabodha.

There is moreover a subsidiary series connected with a Mbh. commen-
tator called Vimalabodha,^ to which we shall now turn our attention.

It will be recalled that in the excerpts given above from the commentary
of Arjunamisra, the commentator twice mentions Vimalabodha in close proxi-
mity to Devabodha. Therefore it is evident that Arjunamisra is posterior
to Vimalabodha, whose commentary (tika) variously known as Durghafartha-
prakdsim £194} or Vi^amasloki has fortunately been preserved. In the intro-
duction to this unpublished commentary, a copy of which is to be found in
the Bombay Government Collection (No. 84 of 1869-70), while speaking of
his predecessors, Vimalabodha says (fol. 1) :

II

Again while giving the etymologies of the name of the Suta, Loma- (or
Roma-)har§a|ija, Vimalabodha observes (fol. 2) ;

See Holtzmann, op. cit. vol. Z, p. 72.



EPIC STUDIES V


271


Undoubtedly the Devasvamin mentioned in the first excerpt is the same
as the Devabodha (who in the colophons of his commentary is styled parama-
hmhsa-pmvrdjakdcdrya) in the second. Incidentally it may be pointed out
that the etymology of Loma- (or Roma-)har§aipa mentioned by Vimalabodha
is actually to be found in Devabodha’s scholium. In the Baroda MS.
(11372) of the unpubli^ed commentary of Devabodha, we read (fol. 3 b,
line If.):

^fTT i ,

which substantially agrees with the excerpt in the commentary of Vimala-
bodh^.

Since Arjunamisra mentions Vimalabodha, and Vimalabodha cites Deva-
bodha, we get a subsidiary series, namely.

Series 4 : Devabodh a — V im\alabodh a — A rjunamisra.

Thus far we have been treading on solid ground and the correctness of
Series 1-4 is, as far as I can judge, absolutely unimpeachable.

In trying to combine Series 3 and 4, however, there arises the difficulty
that no cross reference has hitherto been found in the works of Vimalabodha
on the one hand and Sarvajna-Narayana on the other. Their relative chrono-
logical position is, therefore, a matter for speculation. It is possible, how-
ever, to combine the two series tentotivelyf on the equivocal testimony of
Arjunamisra, which we shall proceed to examine more closely.

£195} In one of the lists of the Acaryas cited by Arjunamisra, we have
the sequence , Veda-Vyasa, Vaisaiiipayana, Devabodha, Vimalabodha,
Sarvajna-Narayaipa, San^cjilya Madhava. Here the first two pairs, as was
pointed out above, have been named in the correct chronological order, the
earlier author being placed first, in conformity with the rule governing the
sequence of the members of a Dvandva compound (P. 2.2.34 Va. ). Deva-
bodha is, as we have seen, prior to Vimalabodha as surely as Vyasa, the
reputed author of the Great Epic, is prior to Vaisaimpayana. Further in
both lists the father of Arjunami!§ra is mentioned last. These facts suggest
the surmise that the whole series is arranged in the strict chronological
sequence. If this surmise be correct, then Sarvajna-NaiayaTja would be
posterior to Vimalabodha, and we get, tentatively, the sequence : Vimala-
bodha — Sarvajfia.

It may, however, be noted that such names are often found arranged on
the diametrically opposite principle of uttaroitmaganyastva, i.e., naming the
more important persons later, which is however not admissible in the parti-
cular instance ; or even a;rranged on no principle at all ; or at least on some
principle which it is difficult for us to comprehend. In fact a subsequent
enumeration of these same Acaryas by the same Arjunamisra is in partial
conflict with the earlier list ! There the sequence (already given above) is



272


EPIC STUDIES


Devabodha, Vimalabodha, Saiidilya Madhava, Niarayaina-Sarvajfla. Here
Sarvajna-Narayana has been placed after isandilya Madhava, while in the
former list he is placed bepre them ! This irregularity apart, the lists tally
with each other.

It is not, however, impossible to resolve this contradiction and harmonize
the data. There is a notable difference between the two lists. The first one
is in prose, the ^ond is an anu^ubh stanza. I am disposed to attach more
importance to the sequence of the prose enumeration, and to regard the change
of sequence in the other as due to the exigencies of metre. The first again
is a formal expression of homage {namaskriyd) , where the principle of prior-
ity has been, it seems, rigidly observed ; on the other hand, the second is
merely a collective metrical list of the author’s “ Gurus,” where the considera-
tion of rank and precedence did {196} not perhaps prevail so much. I may
also point out tliat the first list is in the form of a Dvandva compound, while
in the second the persons have been all independently mentioned. If these
considerations have any value, then we may postulate, at least tentatively,
another series.

Series 5 : D ev Ub o dk a — V imalabod h a —

Sarv a jn a — A r fun a—N xlakantha,

where the relative position of Vimalabodha and Sarvajna alone is open to
doubt.

Of these five commentators, as was mentioned above, Sarvajna could not
have lived later than the latter half of the fourteenth century and flourished
probably between a. d, 1100 and 1300 ; while Arjunami^ra lived some time
prior to a. d. 1534.^ Moreover, if the position assigned in Series 5 to
Sarvajna be correct, then both Devabodha and Vimalabodha must have lived
long prior to A. D. 1300.^

§ 2. What was Devabodha’s Version of the Mahabharata Like ?

The only commentary of the Mahabharata completely printed so far is

1 Since the above was written, two efforts have been made to fix the date of
Arjunamisra. Mr. Jogendra Chandra Ghosh (Indian Culture, Vol. I, p. 706 ff.),
working on the data supplied by certain ancient pedigrees preserved in Bengal,
arrives at the date ca. a.d. 1300 for Arjunamilra ; but it may be pointed out that
the method of fixing precise dates on the basis of pedigrees alone never gives entirely
reliable results. On the other hand, Mr. P. K. Code of the Bhandarkar Institute
(Indian Culture, Vol. 2, p. 141 ff.), relying on his identification of the &tya-Khana,
who was a patron of Arjunamisra (see Sir f. J. Modi Commemoration Volume,
p. 566), argues for a date between a.d. 1450 and a.d. 15(K), There is thus a
difference of about 200 years between the two computations. But the matter is still
sub judice, and more li^t on the questicm may be expected from further investiga-
tion of the questicMi which is being carried on by these two sdiolars.

the Bhdratabhdvadtpa by Nilakantha. The Gujarati Printing Press of Bom-
bay has done, however, inestimable service to the cause of Mahabharata
studies by publishing other commentaries at least on the Virata and Udyoga,
edited by Mahadeva Shastri £197} Bakre. The Vinataparvan Volume

important than any of these and one more neglected still is the Jndnadlpikd
of Devabodha. Until recently nothing was in fact known about Devabodha
or his commentary on the Mahabharata save what is contained in perfunctory
notices of Sanskrit MSS., which has been summarized in Holtzman's meri-
torious work Das Mahdbhdrata (Vol. 3, section 14, para 3, p. 70 f.). A
selection of Devabodha’s readings and glosses was for the first time published
by me in che critical notes of the Adiparvan Volume.^

I have shown in the previous section that Devabodha is indubitably
earlier than Nllakaipta, Arjunamisra, Satvajna-Narayana or even Vimala-
bodha, and is therefore in all probability the earliest commentator of the
Mahabharata hitherto known. It is therefore needless to add that the com-
mentary is most valuable and its evidence, both positive and negative, of
supreme importance for the constitution of the text.

The MS. of the commentary (which is unaccompanied by the epic text)
utilized by me for the Adi belongs to the Baroda Central Library (Sanskrit
Section) and was kindly placed at my disposal by Dr. Benoytosh Bhatta-
CHARYA, Director of the Oriental Institute of Baroda, to whom my sincere
thanks are due for the kind loan.^ This paper MS. which bears the identifi-
cation No. 11372, contains the commentary on Adi only and is written
in £198} Devanagaii characters of about the seventeenth century. The bulk
of the MS. is in a fair state of preservation, though in many places the text
is extremely corrupt. In our MS. the name of the commentary is given as
Jndnadlpikd ; but, according to HOLTZMANN {op, cit. Vol. 3, p. 71), it is also
known as Mahdhhdrata-tdtparyafikd or tdtparyadlpikd. MSS. of this com-
mentary a‘re rare, and no complete copy has yet been found.


1 Vadiraja's cammentary on the Sabha has been published by Prof. P. P.
Subrahmanya Sastri as an Appendix to his edition of the Sabha according t e
Southern recension (Madras 1932). For Vadiraja^s date see further below (pp. 20i-

EPIC STUDIES


In the colophon the author is described as paramahamsa-parivrdjaka.
He must therefore have belonged to an order of Sairiinyasins. The name of
his Guru is given as Satyabodha. This is all the personal data we have at
present about Devabodha.

The Jndnadtpikd is a concise flka, that is, a running commentary para-
phrasing the difficult words of the epic text and occasionally explaining the
gist or purport { tat par y a) of the original. The extent of the text of the
commentary on the Adi is given at the end of our MS. as 1,400 granthas.

The homage which Arjuna pays to Devabodha in the Introduction to his
scholium is by no means a matter of mere form. Arjuna appears to have
made a very close study indeed of the scholium of Devabodha, and based his
own commaitary, on the Adi at least, largely on that of his predecessor. He
has copied very large portions of Devabodha’s commentary, sometimes ver-
batim, sometimes in extracts. Moreover, even when the commentators differ,
the influence of Devabodha is plainly discernible. In fact, Arjuna’s Artha-
dtpikd may be considered, as I have remarked elsewhere,^ as a revised and
enlarged edition of Devabodha's Jndnadlpikd. Unlike the commentary of
Nllakaiotha, that of Devabodha is unaccompanied by the epic text. The
question, therefore, naturally arises what was Devabodha’s text like ?

When we read the commentary along with any of the old printed edi-
tions of the Mahabharata, like the Calcutta or the Bombay or the Kumbha-
fconam editions, we are at once struck by the singular disparity between the
text and the commentary. Not only does Devabodha's commentary contain
many words or expressions which do not occur at all in the Vulgate, but it
also cites, at times, verses or stanzas which read differently in the
£199} Vulgate, One also comes across passages and even adhyayas of the
Vulgate on which one expects some comment but which are left wholly un-
commented by Devabodha.

The Southern recension may be categorically ignored in our search for
the protot)q)e of Devabodha’s commentary, as this comtnentator does not
know even ?i single one of the many passages peculiar to the Southern recen-
sion. He further does not show the typical Southern transposition of the
Sakuntala and Yayiati episodes, nor the characteristic position of the prose
genealogical axihyaya (called puruvamSdnuh^tam) , after the chapter con-
taining the eulogy of the epic (JShdrataprasamsd) ,

The vulgate (with the Bengali) may likewise be excluded. It agrees
with Devabodha’s text up to a certain point ; but the divergences, which are
numerous, remain inexplicable. There remain then only the garada and the
“ K ” versiems. And with them, the version of Devabodha does, as a matter
of fact, show very close aflSnity.

It is worthy of note that Devabodha has no commentary on any of the


1 Adiparvan, Prolegomena, p. LXX.



EPIC STUDIES V


275


six adhyiayas of the Vulgate which are completely missing in the Sarada and
the K MSS. and which have also been completely omitted in the Critical Edi-
tion of the Adi. They are the following adhyiayas of the Vulgate : (i) adhy.
22 (duplicate description of the ocean) ; (ii) adhy. 24 (Aruna is appointed
charioteer of the Sun, an evident digression and interpolation) ; (iii) adhy.
116 (birth of Dubl^a : a fairy tale of questionable authenticity) ; (iv)
adhy, 139 (an absurd chapter describing further exploits of the Pans^Javas
and containing a reference to Yavana kings) ; (v) adhy, 140 (Kanikanati) ;
and finally, (vi) adhy. 149 (Paijdavas’ crossing the Ganges, a passage of
doubtful value).

But on principle, we cannot attach very great importance to such omis-
sions, as a commentator is apt to skip in the Mahabharata any adyhaya which
he thinks too simple to need any comment. This explanation will apply to
most of the omissions mentioned above, but will not hold good in the case of
the Kanikaniti an adhy. of 140 stanzas, which has evoked lengthy comments
from both Arjunamijsra and Nilakantha ; we expect some comment on this
adhyaya by a commentator like Devabodha.

{200} Much more important from our point of view is an addition
characteristic of the Kasmiri version,. This version adds at the very end of
the Adi a supplementary (and entirely superfluous) adhyaya, which contains
merely a variant version of the well-known Purapic tale of Svetaki s sacrifice,
occurring earlier in the course of this very parvan, and which was known to
K§emendra. Curiously enough the king who is called i§vetaki in the first
version is here called Svetaketu ! That the version of Devabodha contained
this interpolated (supplementary) adhyaya is proved by the concluding
remark of Devabodha on this adhyaya (fol. 48) :

^ 1

This remark, as I have pointed out elsewhere, will not apply to any ver-
sion which did not have the supplementary adhyaya containing the story of
gvetaketu, which in fact is peculiar to the §arada and the K versions. These
facts demonstrate that the version of Devabodha agrees with the Sara^ and
K versions with respect to both addition and omission of whole adhyayas.

The conclusion regarding the affinity between the two versions is fortified
by many minor agreements in point of shorter passages and even readings of
individual stanza^s.

For example, Devabodha has no comment on any portion of the Brahma-
Ga|Qie§a episode (40 stanzas in thq Vulgate), which is missing in its entirety
only in the Kasmiii and the Bengali versions. Again, for 1. 105. 4-7 of the
Critical Edition the Vulgate substitutes a lengthy passage of 56 lines, which
is entirely ignored in the commentary of Devabodha, who on the other hand
cites 7^^ (a line not known to the Vulgate), in exact agreement with the



276 EPIC STUDIES

Sarada and K versions (besides the Southern recension), but in direct oppo-
siticai to the Bengali and the Devaniagari versions. In connection with the
omission of. adhy. 139-140 of the Vulgate mentioned above, the iSarada and
K versions omit the first 19 stanzas of the following adhyiaya (namely, adhy.
141 of the Vulgate) . In conformity with that, the first 19 stanzas of adhy.
141 are ignored completely in the scholium of Devabodha. It may be noted
that the omission of adhy. 130-140 together with the first 19 stanzas of adhy.
141 of the Vulgate £201} makes an aggregate and continuous omission of 1.39
(=27 + 93-f-19) stanzas of the Vulgate, a not inconaderable portion of the
text. Likewise there is no commentary on nearly 70 stanzas of adhy. 128
and 129 of the Vulgate, which ate omitted only in the Sarada-K group and
the Critical Eldition.

This affinity is further borne out by agreements as regards minor read-
ings too numerous to mention.

These considerations make it, in my opinion, perfectly clear that the
version of Devabodha is closely allied to the Sarada and K versions.

Though the isarada version and what I have called the “ K ” version run
for the most part parallel to each other, there are in fact minor discrepancies
between the MSS. of these versions, which indicate different sources. But as,
on the one hand, we have for the Adi a solitary MS. (6i) of the genuine
iSarada (or Kasmiri) version, and on the other hand we do not know the
provenance of the Devanagari MSS. which I have denoted by the symbol
“K” (on account of their affinity to the version of Ka4mir), it is at this
stage not easy to explain these discrepancies between i^iarada and K. It would
be also premature to say whether Devabodha’s version was more akin to
Sarada or the K version.

I may, however, draw attention to one instance which suggests to my
mind and affinity with K rather than with the Sarada version. In 1. 68. 72
the text reading is asatyavacam nary ah (nom. plu.), “women (are) perfidi-
ous,” a general statement. Only Kj.j Bj (m as in text) have, on the other
hand, asatyavacane ’ndrye (voc. sing.), “0 thou perfidious (and) dishonour-
able (woman) ! ” Ko ,4 appear to have corrupt forms of the same. The
vocative appears to be, therefore, peculiar to the K version, which differs here
from the Sarada, and which latter has the nom. plu. as in all other MSS.
Now in agreemait with K, Devabodha has amrye = vakre ! One instance of
an agreement like this is, I will readily admit, wholly inadequate to prove the
point. It can only give an indication and may perchance give wrong
indication. The question may, therefore, be left over for future investigation.

### The Bhrgus and the Bharata : A Text-Historical Study

The Bhrgus are unquestionably an interesting old clan.*^ Tempted by
the tantalizing affinity between the Sanskrit name Bhrgu and the Greek

in the name of ^Xevoas and of the ^Xsvvai, A. Weber^
postulated a genetic connection between the Indian and the Greek names,
and even ascribed Indo-germanic antiquity to a certain legend about Bhrgu
Vartuii preserved in the iSatapatha Brahmana (11. 6. 1), a legend of which
he thought he had discovered a parallel in Greek mythology. The facile
phonetic equation put up by Weber has not, however, commended itself to
other scholars, and we are not specially concerned with it either. But it
cannot be gainsaid that the clan is very ancient and that some of their legends
are of hoary antiquity. There are scattered notices about the Bhrgus to be
found from the Vedic Samhitas onwards through the Brahmana, Arapyaka
and Upani§ad literature up to the Epics and the Pur^as, steadily growing in
volume and importance.

£2} Not only is the clan ancient, its legends also are highly interesting.
So suggestive in fact are the early myths of this clan that they had in former
years engrossed the attention of many a student of Indian mythology, and
called forth a variety of interpretations. Thus, A. Bergagne^ looked upon
the Bhrgu myth of the Bgveda as merely a more developed form of the early
tradition about the descent of fire and identified Bhrgu with Agni. A. Kuhn^
and A. Barth® agreed in regarding the Bhrgus as personifications of the light-
ning flash, and Kuhn^ tried to harmonize the Greek myth regarding the des-
cent of fire with the Vedic. A. Weber, ^ as already remarked, saw in a legend
preserved in the' iSatapatha Brahmana a relic of primitive Indo-germanic
m 5 d:hology. But even the later legends of these people are not without a

certain amount of grandiosity and ostentation. Just consider the figure of
Parasurama : a matricide, annihilator of the K^atriyas and finally an avatdra
of Vii§jnLU (the “Preserver”) all in one.

The popularity of the Parasurama legend in India is attested by the
number of places, scattered all over India, which are associated with his name
and his exploits and held sacred to his memory.^ Near the Kangra
District‘d of the Punjab there is a very ancient temple dedicated to
Parasurama, (a name not yet applied to him in our epic), in which is depo-
sited a copper-plate grant recording the gift of a village to a Brahmin study-
ing the A. V. In the State of Udaipur^ there is a sacred pool called Mar-
kundiab where Rama is said to have bathed and atoned for his sins ;
likewise in Cape Comorin. In the Bijapur District^ of the Bombay
Presidency, an axe-shaped rock situated on a riverbank marks the spot
where Rama is represented as having washed his famous axe {para^u),
which has given him his nick-name Parasurama, Rama-with-the-Axe ; a stone
boulder situated in the river bed has preserved Parasurama’s foot-prints.
Even this irresistible axe of his has been deified, and there is in Mysore State^'^
a temple dedicated to it. Gokaijn^ shows a sacred pool dedicated to Maha-
deva, which is said to have been built by the son of Jamadagni. Even the
Lakhimpur District* of distant Assam has a pool to show to which, accord-
ing to popular belief, Parasurama had surrendered his dreaded axe, and
which attracts pilgrims from every part of India.

Notwithstanding the absorbing interest of the Bhargava myths, it is
primarily not their interpretation that is attempted here. {3} That is a task
fraught with difficulties and uncertainties, as also one which would call for a
range of knowledge and a compose of mind to which the present writer can
lay no claim. The modest aim of this paper is to collect and collate the
Bhargava references in the Mahabharata, in other words, to give a succinct
account of all that the Great Epic of India has to say about the Bhrgus. The
choice of the source-book is, I think, abundantly justified, because the Maha-
bharata, as I believe, is the richest mine for the exploration of the Bhargava
material, a veritable thesaurus of Bhargava legends, containing as it does
the largest number and the greatest variety of such legends. Even this
material is naturally not entirely new, having already attracted the attention
of scholars, but it seemed to me that it has not been studied with that degree
of attention to details which it deserves. It is a trite observation but never-

theless true that even what appears on the face of it to be a most insignificant
detail might yield a valuable clue if looked at from the correct angle, which
is often difficult to get.

My intention is to pass under review here all the important myths and
legends relating to the different Bhrgus, which occur in the Mahabharata,
subjecting them to a critical analysis : to study the manner in which they are
presented, to investigate their repetitions and even to examine their discre-
pancies. We shall find that there are many more Bhargavas mentioned in
our epic than commonly known and many more references to Bhargavas
than commonly suspected.

In essence, it must be admitted, this is merely a text-critical study, a
subject which, having engaged my attention for a number of years, has ac-
quired considerable fascination for me. But at the end of the paper it is
shown that the investigation might at the same time yield results which are
not without general value for a partial elucidation of the obscure history of
this venerable old text.

The BhargaVa references could have been presented here in many
different ways, but it appeared best to take them up for study in the sequence
in which they appear in our epic, to examine the material book by book and
chapter by chapter. The total number of passages of the Mahabharata in
which the Bhargavas are mentioned is astonishingly large. Exigencies of
space, {4} however, compelled the writer to restrict himself to the discussion
of only the more important of the references.

I add here a genealogical table which will enable the reader to follow
the legends of the Bhrgus and, the discussions about them with greater ease.
The table is made up from the data of the Mahabharata itself, but it is un-
doubtedly incomplete ; it appears to be very much abridged, lacking many
details and intermediate links.

ADIPARVANI

Strangely enough, already in the second chapter of the Adiparvan, the
Parvasarhgraha, which is in fact, for the greater part of it, something
like a Table of Contents, we make our acquaintance with one of the Bhar-
gavas, the most famous of them, Rama Jamadagnya,^ not yet a full-fledged
avatdra’^ a character which iri, reality has no connection whatsoever with the
action of the sublime tragedy which is going to be unfolded in the epic. That
comes about in this way. The place where the Mahabharata war was fought,
as everybody knows who knows anything at all about the war, was called
Kuruk^etra (Gita 1. 1) :

dharmaksetre Kuruk^etre samavetd yuyutsavah |
mdmakdh Pd};i4(wds caiva

But the Suta Ugratsravas, son of Lomahar§aoa, who recites the epic at
the twelve-year sacrificial session held in the Naimi^a Forest under the aus-
pices of Saunaka, gives the name of the place as Samantapancaka and is
careful enough to add that he had visited that sacred spot {punyam desam)
and was as a^matter of fact just returning from it (1. 1. 11 f.) :
Sammtapancakmi ndma punyam dvijanisevitam j
gatavdn asmi tarn desam yuddham yatrdbhavat pur a [|

Pdfidavdndm Kurund^h ca sarve^dih ca mxihlksitdm [
didrk^ur dgatas tasmdt samtparh bhavatdm iha ||

That obviously needed a little explication. Accordingly we find in the
beginning of the second chapter a query about this Samantapancaka from the
sages who formed the audience. They want to know all about this new place
of pilgrimage (1. 2. 1) :

Samantapancakam iti yad uktam sutanandma j
etat sarvam yathdnydyam srotum icchdmahe vayam ij
And from the story narrated by the Suta it proves to be a Bhargava place
of pilgrimage, situated probably somewhere in the neighbourhood of or with-
in the limits of Kuruk§etra.^ It was in fact, as the Suta proceeds to explain,

^ In the Adiparvan, the references are to the Critical Edition of that book
published by this Institute (Poona 1933); elsewhere to the Vulgate, the edition
used being the Chitrashala edition (Poona 1929-1933). References to the Vulgate
are distinguished by prefixing ‘‘ B."' to them.

the sacred spot where the Bhargava Rama, the foremost of weapon-bearers
{sastrabhjt^ varalp^ 1. 2. 3), after extirpating the warrior race during the
interval between the Treta and the Dvapara Ages, had made five pools of
blood, probably forming a circle (hence obviously Samantapahcaka), and
standing in the middle of the pools the terrible man offered the uncanny
oblation of congealed blood to his forefathers, until the shades of the departed
ancestors appeared before him and pacified him, giving him the boon that
those sanguinary pools of his would become holy places of pilgrimage (1. 2,
3 ff.):

A few stanzas later we read that the Kuru-Paipdava war was also
fought at this Samantapancaka (1. 2. 9) :

antare caiva samprdpte Kali-Dvdparayor abhut 1
Samantapancake yuddham Kuru-Pdndavasenayob |j
Samantapahcaka is thus made out to be only another name of Kuruk§etra :
evidently a Bhargava name.^ The people of India have forgotten this Bhar-
gava synonym : they remember only Kuruk§etra, a name which has struck
deep root in the memory of the people. Even now at every solar eclipse
there is held at Kuruk§etra, a mammoth fair, which attracts hundreds of
thousands of devout pilgrims,'^ hailing from the different comers of India,
who reverently visit the spot hallowed by the blood of their beloved kings of
yore, those shining examples of knighthood and chivalry, who counting their
lives as straw fell fighting, waging a holy war (dharmayuddha), which has
made the Kumfc^etra a dharmaksetra.

In passing, it may be mentioned that this short account of the annihila-
tion of the K§atriyas by the Brahmin Rama Jamadagnya — a very popular
theme, as will be seen later on, with the redactors of our Mahabharata — has
been even amplified in later times by the interpolation of a short dialogue

took place at Samantapancaka is also mentioned in :

This p^assage, which is an abridged version of a dialogue occurring in the
TJrthayatraparvan, a sub-section of the Aranyakaparvan, is found at this
point only in certain Devanagaii MSS. (including those of the “ K '' Version),
and is missing in the Bengali MSS. as well as in the entire Southern recen-
sion, and therefore certainly suspect. We shall have occasion to mention
other similar enlargements of Bhargava anecdotes.

{7} The next reference to the Bhargava Rama occurs in adhy, 58 of
the Adi. and the theme is the same. The chapter, as a matter of fact, des-
cribes the circumstances which led to the incarnation of the gods and god-
desses of the Puraiiiic pantheon on this earth of ours. But the account
begins with an allusion to the great exploit of the Bhargava Rama, his total
extirpation of the bad old kings of yore (1, 58,. 4) :

trihsQptakrtvah, pfthivhh kfiva nihk^atriydm purd |

Jdmadagnyas tapas tepe Mahendre parvatottame || (I)

The first line of this stanza is worthy, of special note. It occurs, with slight
variations, over and over again in our Mahabharata, its exultant note ringing
like a distant echo in the remotest corners and crevices of this huge epos,
which was composed by Kr§na Dvaipayana to spread in this world the fame
of the high-souled P&indavas and of other puissant Ksafriyas (1. 56. 25 f.) :

When the Bhargava Rama, after making a clean sweep of the K§atriyas,
retired to Mount Mahendra, on the eastern coast of India, to practise auster-
ities, there remained of the warrior caste only the females, and the I^§atriya
race was in imminent danger of becoming totally extinct (Adi. 58). When
the earth was thus bereft of K§atriya manhood, the K§atriya women, casting
aside their pride, approached the Brahmins for offspring. With these
Ki§atriya women cohabited the Brahmins of rigid vows of those times, in
pity for their sad plight. They cohabited with the K§atriya women, not
from passion, only in season, never out of season. Thus thousands of
Kj§atriya women conceived from their intercourse with pious Brahmins.
Their children were the virtuous K^atriyas, who ushered in again the Golden

Age. Thus sprang up a second K§atriya race from the surviving K§atriya
women, owing to their intercourse with ascetic Brahmins. The new genera-
tion, blessed with long life, throve in virtue. And there were again esta-
blished the four castes, having Brahmins at their head (1. 58. 8. 10) ;

Later the Asuras, defeated by the gods and expelled from heaven, in order
to continue their fight for supremacy, took birth in royal families, among
animals and elsewhere on this earth, and so again godless kings were bom
here on the earth. The goddess Earth, oppressed by this vicious and godless
creation, lodged a complaint with Brahma, who, with a view to freeing her
from the tyranny of her oppressors, ordains that the various gods and god-
desses, gandharvas and apsarases incarnate themselves, in different forms
and shapes, to wage war with the Asuras, and annihilate them.

In this legend, which is here skilfully interwoven with the much lauded
exploit of the Bhargava Rama, the Brahmin appears in the role of the
de jacto Creator of the Later K^atriyas. But in a variant version of the
same incident, which occurs in the santi (adhy. 48-49 of the Vulgate) and
which will be discussed in due course, the narrator, Sif-Kj^na himself, while
admitting that there was a general slaughter of the K?atriyas, allows that
some K§atriyas had escaped death at the hands of the Bhargava Rama and,
after his retirement to the forest, emerged from their places of concealment
and resumed sovereignty. But in this prologue to the Adiparvan, however,
VaiSampayana, as we have seen is quite certain that the K§atriyas were totally
annihilated by Rama and the race was entirely regenerated by Brahmins.

Another little digression, adhy. 60, which explains the origin and geneal-
ogy of the different orders of beings, from the gods downwards, contains also
a genealogy of the Bhargavas, the only Brahmanic genealogy, besides that
of the Angirasas^ (a clan closely connected with the Bhrgus) considered by
the epic bards worthy of inclusion in this chapter.

This confused cosmogonic account (1. 60. Iff.) begins with the enumera-
tion of the six mind-bom (mdnasa) sons of Brahma and the eleven sons
of Sthmiu, nan^ly, the eleven Rudras. The six mind-bom sons of Brahma
are : Marici, Angiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu, which list does
not include Bhrgu.® I>ak§a {9} was bom from the right thumb (angustha)

1 Even the Angirasas are shown scant courtesy. Only one generation of the
family is mentioned : the sons of Angirasas were Bfhaspati, Utathya and Samvarta ;
they had a (nameless) sister.

^ These ax “ mind-bom sons are mentioned again in 1. 59. 10.

of Brahma, and Dak§a's wife from his left thumb. Dafc^a begat fifty
daughters on his wife, of whom he gave away thirteen, in a lot, to Ka§yapa,
son of Martci. Kasyapa’s offspring were the gods and the titans.^ The
list of gods and demi-gods closes with the progeny of Kasyapa (L 60. 39) :

Immediately, after this list of celestials, come Bhygu and his descendants
(1. 60. 40) ;

The close proximity to the gods is perhaps intended to be an indication of
the high position of the Bhrgus in the Precedence List. The genealogy
given here is short and mentions only the well-known descendants of one
branch of the Bhargava clan, the branch made famous by Rama Jamadagnya.
The pedigree begins with Bhrgu, who also was a son of Brahma, being bom
by piercing his heart {hr day a).

But this ancestry of Bhrgu is in conflict with another account found in
the epic (Anusasalia 85 of the Vulgate), according to which Bhrgu was born
from the seed of Prajapati which had fallen in the fire.

The latter account has partial Vedic support, for we read in the Aitareya
Brahmaua (3. 34) that the seed of Prajapati became divided into three
parts, from which were born Aditya, Bhrgu and Ahgiras. On the other
hand, in tlie Pancavimsa Brahmaiia (18. 9. 1),^ the paternity of Bhrgu with
two others is attributed to Varuua. Further in the ^tapatha Brahmaua
(11. 6. 1. 1), Jaiminiya Brahmaoria (1. 42) Taittiriya Upani§ad (1. 3. 1. 1),
TaittirSya Arauyaka (9- 1) also, Bhrgu is said to be the son of Varui:ia ;
from Varuii^a, it is said, he obtained the knowledge of Brahma.

There seems to be partial synthesis of some of these divergent versions
in the confused Anu^sana account cited above, according tot which, while
Mahadeva, in the form of Varm,ia, was performing a sacrifice, Brahmd was
presiding and all the gods and the goddesses were present. Seeing that
assemblage of celestial damsels of exceeding beauty, desire sprang up in the
nund of Brahma, and he had an emission. As soon as the seed came out,
Brahma took it up with the sacrificial ladle and poured it, like a libation
of clarified butter, with the necessary mantras, on tlie burning fire. There-
upon £10} three beings emerged from the sacrificial fire. One arose from
the flames {bhjk) and hence he was called Bhrgu ; another came out of the
burning charcoals {ahgdra) and hence he passed by the name of Ahgiras ;
the third originated from a heap of extinguished coals and was called Kavi.
This tradition we find faintly reflected in a stanza (Adi. 216*), interpolated

Varnnasya kratau jdtah pdvakdd iti nah srutmn 1 1

Here we see that the great seer, “ Bhagavian ” Bhrgu is said to have been
produced by the self-create Lord Brahma during Varuna’s sacrifice from Fire.

However, to return to the pedigree of the Bhfgus given in Adi 60, we
lind the statement that Bhrgu had two sons, Kavi (whose son was Sukra)
and Cyavana. About both Sukra and Cyavana, we hear a great deal in our
Maliabharata. From Cyavana the short pedigree runs as follows : Cya-
vana-Aurva-IJcaka-Jamadagni-Riama. About Kavi and Rdka alone the epic
haS( not very much to narrate, but it is full of the amazing powers and the
wonderful exploits of the remaining Bhargavas mentioned here, for whom
our epic shows great predilection.

Thus we find, only a few chapters later, the epic relating at great length
the well-known story of Yayati (Yayat 3 mpiakhyana, Adi. 71-80), in which
Sukra, the Asura priest, and his haughty and ambitious daughter Devayani
play a prominent role, and which probably contains a solid substratum of
historic truth. Between Yayati and the P^^avas there intervene, according
to the computation of Pargiter, nearly ninety generations. And thus although
the connection of this episode with the main epic story is of most slender char-
acter, it possesses considerable Bhargava interest, which is probably the main
reason why it has been excerpted here from some Pur^ic source.^ The story
of Yayati is introduced in the epic in the following manner.

In adhy, 70, Vaisarhpayana briefly sketches the early history of the
Lunar Dynasty, incidentally mentioning Yayati and his five sons. Jana-
mejaya is not satisfied with this sketchy account and requests Vaisampayana
to relate in detail the story of Yayati, a remote ancestor of the Pi^'cjavas,
“tenth in descent from Prajapati ” {dasmna yah Prajdpateh 1. 71. 1). The
story of Yayati is as follows.

£11} Brhaspati, son of Angiras, was the preceptor of the Devas, the
Bhargava Sukra (Kavya U^as) that of the Asuras. Sukra, a powerful
sorcerer, like all the other Bhargavas, had the knowledge of the secret of
reviving the dead {samjlvam vidyd); not so Brhaspati. The Devas were
therefore handicapped in their wars with the Asuras. So at the instance
of the Devas Brhaspati’ s son Kaca goes to Sukra, who was then the priest
sorcerer of the Asura king ViT^parvan and lives with him as his disciple in
order to obta'in from him a knowledge of the art of reviving the dead.
Sukra*s beautiful daughter Devayani falls headlong in love with Kaca, son
of Brhaspati, and boldly proposes marriage, an honour which Kaca politely
but firmly declines. Subsequently one day when Devayani ahd Sarmi§tha,

It recurs almost verbatim in the Matsya Puraaja (adhy. 25-42).

the daughter of the Asura Vrsaparvan, are having a bath in a neighbour-
ing river, Indra tossed their clothes about, which had been left by the girls
on the river bank, so that Sarmii^thia by mistake took up the dress of Deva-
yanl. There ensues a hefty quarrel between the girls, and Sarmi§tba throws
her rival into a dry well overgrown with grass. And there she remains until
she is seen and pulled out of the well by the gallant king Yayati, whom she
promptly woos and who with the approval of her father, Sukra, marries her.
Previously, as a recompense for her overbearing conduct towards Devayani,
Sarmi^tha, the Asura princess, had become Devayani’s slave. She now ac-
companies Devayani to the capital of Yayati and the three people live in
happiness together for some time. Yayati has been warned beforehand by
the Asura priest Sukra that he must on no account call iSarmi^ha on to his
bed : she was only a slave-girl belonging to Devayani’s entourage. But
Sarmistha prevails upon the soft-hearted and indulgent Yayati, by dint of
importunity and feminine logic to act so that her menstrual period will not
be wasted, for the husband of one's friend is as good as one’s own hus-
band ”. Yayiati moved by her importunities admits the logic of ^armistha’s
requisition and begets on her secretly three sons, while Devayani has only
two. Devayani learns the truth of the whole affair one day by accident,
and goes in a huff to her father, complaining bitterly of the perfidy of her
husband. The enraged Asura priest Sukra curses Yayati that he would
instantly suffer the effects of premature decrepitude, and so it happens.
Sukra relents, however, and adds that, as Yayati had acted from pure
motives he might transfer his premature old age at will to any one who is
willing to take it on in his stead. Accordingly Yayati exchanged his de-
crepitude for the youth of his youngest son, £12} Puru scm of the Asura
princess tSatmi^tha, who was the only one of his five sons willing to take
on his old age and to whom he subsequently handed over his vast kingdom
as a reward for his filial affection.

In this version of the Yayaiti legend, the Bhargavi Devayani has it all
her own way and poor sarmistha, the Asura princess has been thrust in the
background except in the finale, which raises §armi^thia’s youngest son to
the throne and the tables are turned on Devayani, the daughter of the Asura
priest, Sukra. In spite of the Yayatyupakhyana, Indian traidition honours
Sarmii^ha as the pattern of a wife most honoured by her husband ; for in
Kalidasa’s famous drama, when Ka^yapa gives his parting blessing to his
beloved daughter, Sakuntalia, he could think of no better boon than to wish
that she might be like Samii#ia :

Yaydteri iva Sarmi^fM bhartur bahumatd bhava |

** Be thou highly honoured of thy husband, as was Sarmistha of Yayati ! ’

mention already for the third time in adhy. 98 of the Adi : this time in the
course of a conversation between Bhi§ma and SatyavatS. The continuance
of the royal family of Kurus was sorely jeopardized by the untimely death
of both the sons of iSamtanu, Citr^gada and Vicitravirya. Satyavati asks
Bhi§ma to marry the young and beautiful widows of his half-brother
VicitravJrya ahd beget children on them for the continuation of the race
of the Kurus, a proposal which Bhi§ma firmly rejects as that would mean
a deliberate breaking of his vow of celibacy. He proposes instead that a
Brahmin be called to officiate {niyoga) and do the job. He cites a prece-
dent for this apaddhmmu. It is po other than the story of the Bhargava
Rama and its sequel. To avenge the death of his father, Bh!§ma relates,
the Bhargava Rama slew Arjuna, the son of Krtavirya, king of the Haiha-
yas. Then he set out on his war chariot to conquer the world. And taking
up his bow, he hurled his mighty magical missiles {astras) and exterminated
the K^atriyas more than once. In days of yore this illustrious descendant
of Bhrgu annihilated the K!?atriyas thrice seven times (1. 98. 3) :

trihsaptakrtvab prthivl kfta nihksatriyd pmd\ (II)

Then from a high sense of duty, the virtuous Brahminsl of the £13} day,
skilled in the Vedas, co-habited with the widows of the Kai^triyas massacred
by the Bhargava Rama and begat on them offsprings and thus revived the
almost extinct race of the K§atriyas. Satyavati should unhesitatingly follow
this excellent precedent and arrange for the revival of the dying race of the
Kurus.

So far we have come across only legends of the past achievements of
the Bhargavas. The first reference to a direct contact between a Bhargava
and one of the epic characters occurs in adhy. 121 of the Adi, In this pseudo-
historical epic, the myth may not be properly regarded as concerned with
events in time. Therefore the Bhargava Rama, who only a few chapters
previously is said to have lived in the interval between the Treta and the
Dvapara Ages is here represented as the teacher {gum) of Acarya Dropa,
who lived in the interval ‘between the Dvapara and the Kali Ages. The pu-
pilship is only symbolical, but the basis of the symbolism is significant.
Acarya Dropa is the guru of the Kauravas and the Plapdvas and of all the
other valiant K^atriyas of the time, and he was also one of the greatest war-
riors on the side of the Kauravas in the Bharata War. But Acarya Dropa
must also have a guru. And who would be more suitable as guru than the
Bhargava Rama, who is the foremost of all weapon-bearers {sarvaiastrabhr-
tdnt verab) ?

Once the symbol has been accepted, it is treated as real, and the myth is
worked out in great detail. Thus we are told that when Dropa had finished
his studies and taken up the duties of a house-holder, he began to feel the
pinch of poverty. He then happened to hear that the Bhargava Rama was
bestowing wealth on Brahmins. No inconsistency or anachronism is fdt, be-

cause Rama is assumed to be “ever-living" {cirajivin). So Drorja presented
himself before the great Bhargava, who was about to start for the forest, and
asked for sofne wealth for himself. Rama ruefully confessed to him that
whatever wealth he at one time possessed he had freely presentai to the
Brahmins ; he had even presented the earth to Ka^yapa, his sacrificing priest.
And now he had nothing left except his mortal body and his weapons and
magical missiles (astras). He asked Droina to cho^ what he wanted.
Drona of course chose the famous missiles with which Rama had conquered
the whole earth. Rama accordingly gave all his £14} weapons to Droina,
instructing him at the same time fully in the science of arms.

This story of Droina and Rama was apparently popular, for we find it
repeated in an abridged form in adhy. 154, it being related there to the
davas by a Brahmin, who was urging them to proceed to the capital of Dru-
pada to attend the sv ay ark vara of Draupadi.

We learn another fragment of Bhargava history from adhy. 169 to 172
of the Adi, the Aurvopakhyana, which is, as a matter of fact, a digression
within a digression.

While the P^dava brothers were proceeding by slow stages to the capi-
tal of king Drupada to attend Draupadi s svayamvara, they are opposed on
the way by Citraratha Afigaraparna, king of the Gandharvas, whom Arjuna
after a brief fight overcomes. Citraratha and Arjuna soon become close
friends. This sudden friendship gives the necessary opportunity to the skil-
ful raconteur to smuggle in some stories. Citraratha, as a matter of fact,
relates to Arjuna a number of interesting but flimsily motivated anecdotes,
which are a pure and unadulterated digression, among them the well-known
story of Vasi^tha. It is related how Vi^vamitra, king of Kanyakubja, tried
to seize Vasi§tha’s sacred cow (kamadhemi) and, failing, turned ascetic and
in the end became a Brahmin ; how king Kalma^pada Saudasa was cursed
by Vasi^tha’s son Sakti (or Saktri) to become a cannibal and how he began
his career as a cannibal by devouring Vasi§tha’s own sons including §akti ; how
Vasii§.tha subsequently freed the king from the effects of the curse. Then
finally to dissuade his enraged grandson Para§ara, son of Sakti, from destroy-
ing the whole creation in his frenzy, Vasi^tha relates to him the story of the
Bhargava Aurva. It will thus be seen that the Bhargava legend is emboxed
within the Vatsi§itha l^end, which is itself an episode of the Caitraratha
section. This story of Aurva is as follows.

Once upon a time there was a king by name Krtavirya of the Haih-
yas, whose family priests were the Bhrgus. On them he bestowed great
wealth. After his death the princes of his family, for some reason or other,
demanded it back. The Bhrgus came out with some of it, but not all. It
then happened that one of the Ki?atriyas, accidentally digging the ground in
the settlement of the Bhrgus, came upon a large store of wealth buried under
{15} ground. Enraged at what they naturally considered deceitful conduct



290


EPIC STUDIES


on the part of the Bhrgus, the K^atriyas used violence to the Bhrgus, and
slew them all indiscriminately. The K^atriyas evai hunted down the women
of the Bhrgusi, and with a view to exterminating the race killed all those that
were pregnant. Pursued by the Ki§atriyas, some of the Bhtgu women took
shelter in the inaccessible fastnesses of the Himalayas. One of these womens
in order to perpetuate the race of the Bhargavas, had concealed her embryo
in her thigh. The K§atriyas, when they came to know of it, pursued her
with the intention of decimating her embryo ; when, lo and behold, the -child
was bom from his mother s thigh, blinding the Haihayas with his lustre.
Bereft of sight, they roamed about in the forest, and, meekly approaching
the faultless Brahmin lady, prostrated themselves before her, begging that
their eyesight might be restored. ‘‘ My good sirs ”, said the Brahmin lady,
“ I have not robbed you of your eyesight, nor am I angry with you. But
this scion of the Bhrgus seems certainly to be angry with you. Your eyesight
has no doubt been destroyed by this high-souled Bhargava, whose wrath has
been kindled by the massacre of his kinsmen. When you took to destroying
even the embryos of the Bhrgu race, the child was held by me concealed in
my thigh for one hundred years. That he may do good to the Bhrgu race,
the entire Veda with its six mgas revealed itself to him when he was still in
the womb. Being enraged at the slaughter of his kinsmen, he desires to kill
you. It is by his divine effulgence that your eyesight has been destroyed. Pray
therefore, my good sirs, to this excellent son of mine, bom of my thigh
{uru) ; and pacified by your humbly prostrating yourself before him, he
may restore your eyesight Thereupon all those Ksatriyas on their bended
knees said to that high-bom child, “Forgive us”, and the high-bom child
forgave them. But that descendant of the Bhargava race did not forget that
outrage and resolved in his mind upon destroying this wicked world. With
that object in view he started performing the most severe austerities. By
the intensity of his austerities he afflicted all the worlds. On learning what
Aurva was doing to avenge the wrong done to them by the Ksatriyas, the
shades of his ancestors came to him and addressed his as follows : [16} “0
Aurva, O child, the prowess of thy fierce austerities has been seen by us.
Control thy anger and forgive the people.” They explain to him that the
Ksatriyas were really not to blame for the slaughter of the Bhrgus ! How
could those puny Ksatriyas ever hope to kill the Bhargavas? That contre-
temps was a little contrivance of the Bhargavas themselves. The fact was
that the Bhargavas were tired of their lives and longed to die, but death dared
not touch them, those sinless effulgent specimens of humanity, and suicide
was a cowardly act and a sin. They had therefore staged that little quarrel
with those foolish and arrogant K§atriyas, so that the Ksatriyas might get en-

291


raged and kill them, as they did. Of what use could wealth be to those
emancipated souls, whose sole desire was to obtain heaven ? Aurva replies
that they may be all true, but he had made a vow to destroy the world in
order to calm his own anger and he must destroy it, or else he would be
destroyed himself by the fire of his uncontrollable wrath. And so the world
was in imminent danger of being totally destroyed ! But the ancestors of
Aurva show him a way out of the dilemma. They wisely advise him to
fling the fire of his wrath in the waters, which are the primeval source and
support of the world, and Aurva does so. And now, in the shape of horse s
head [hayasiras), his wrath dwells in the ocean, consuming its waters, which
are the world (lokd hy dpomaydh smrtdh. 1. 171. 19).

In the above legend we may notice some of the repeated motives of Bhai -
gava stories. There is first of all the feud with the K§atriyas, which finally
develops into the creation of the figure of the Bhargava Rama, “ the foremost
of all weapon-bearers, ” who single-handed, with the aid of his magical wea-
pons, the astras, conquers the whole earth, annihilating the Ki§atriyas thrice
seven times. Then there is the motif of the opportune birth of a miraculous
child, whose effulgent lustre either blinds the oppressor (as here) or con-
sumes him (as in the case of Cyavana) . There is, lastly, the appearance of
the shades of the ancestors, who step in to stop the carnage either contemplat-
ed (as here) or actually perpetrated (as in the case of Rama), to avenge
some private wrong done with reference to the family.

£17} Sabhaparvan

The short Sabha, which is a compact little book with 81 chapters and
about 2700 stanzas, (in the Vulgate), begins with the Erection of the Darbar
Hall and ends with the Second Gambling Match. Here the story marches
forward by rapid strides, consisting as it does mainly of spirited dialogue and
dramatic action. The digressions are few and far between, and of updkhyd-
nos as such there are none. The real important digressions, which occur early
in the beginning, are two : firstly,, the somewhat lengthy and imaginative
descriptions {dkhydnas) by Narada of the halls of the celestials Indra, Yama,
Varuoa, Kubera, and Brahma, preceded by a short Niti tractate (adhy. 5-12) ;
and, secondly, the previous history of Jarasaihdha, narrated by Ki^a (adhy.
17-19) . Consequently, in this parvan, the Bhargava material is extremely
scanty.

The Bhargavas are nevertheless briefly mentioned several times. Thus,
naturally, many of the Bhargavas, to wit, Blrrgu, Markaodeya, Rama, Ja-
madagnya, are several times mentioned as being present, along with other
famous sages and seers of the past, in the halls of the celestials mentioned
above, as also as a matter of course in the newly erected hall of Yudhi^thira.
In adhy. 8, Rama has been placed by mistake among the royal sages (rd-
jar^is). They are likewise present at the coronation of Yudhi§thira. These



292


EPIC STUDIES


Static figures are like tnural decorations, and of no special interest to us.
We shall therefore ignore them.

Rama’s extermination of the K§atriyas, which is really never quite for-
gotten by our bards, is mentioned in adhy. 14. KrsDa prefaces his long
reply to Yudhi§thira regarding the prerequisites of the Rajasuya sacrifice by
pointing out, quite irrelevantly, that the contemporary K^atriyas were far in-
ferior to that old race of Eu^triyas that was exterminated by the Bhargava
Rama (B. 2. 14. 2) :

Jdmadagnyena Rdmena k§atram yad avasesitam |
tasmdd <w<xrajmh loke yad idani k^atrasamjnitam 1|

It was mentioned above that the high esteem in which our epic bards
held Rama Jamadagnya had led to his being represented as the teacher of
Acarya Drona in the science of arms. The same ideology is responsible for
the sedulously fostered belief that Rama was the teacher of Bhi§ma also, an
idea which is taken hold of £18} and further developed in that late addition
to the Udyoga,, the Amba episode (Ambopakhyana). Rama is represented as
standing in the same relation to Kama, the protege and ally of Ehiryodhana.
So, in his denunciation of Kr§na, Sisupala mentions Karna’s pupilship under
Rama as one of Karna’s qualifications entitling him to receive the argha
(B. 2, 37. 15 f.) :

This book is a veritable thesaurqs of ancient Brahmanic myths and le-
gends. We accordingly find that a fair amount of Bhargava material has
been incorporated in it. We further find that one Bhargava takes a con-
siderable share in the story-telling that is done here.

The first important deference to the Bh^gus is in the Tirthayatra sec-
tion. The list of fiyikas given in adhy. 82 ff (of the Vulgate) is said to
have been first communicated^ by the sage Pulastya to Bhji^ma and then re-
peated by Narada to Yudhisthira. It is in reality a material compendium
of tirthas, which gives, in the space of a stanza or two, the necessary details
about the particular tirtha : the name of the tirtha, the ritual acts to be done
there, and finally the merit {purj^ya) accruing from these acts. Thus, for
example we read (B. 3. 83. 13 ff.):

‘‘O king, going to iSalukin! and bathing in the Dasasvamedha, the pil-
grim obtains the merit of performing 10 asvamedha sacrifices. — Then going to
Saipadevi, that excellent tirtha of the Nagas, one obtains the merit of per-
forming 1 agnktoma sacrifice and goes to the world of the Nagas.-— One
should then proceed, O virtuous man, to (the shrine of) Tarantuka, the gate-
keeper. Staying there only for one night, one obtains the merit of giving

away 1000 kine. — Then going to the Pahcanada, with regulated diet and sub-
dued soul, and bathing in the Kotitlrtha, one obtains the merit of perform-
ing 1 asvamedhu sacrifice. Going to the tirtha of the Asvins, a man is bom
handsome (in a future birth, of course). — One should then go, O virtuous

And so on and so forth.

Only very rarely is this dreary enumeration intermpted by a brief ac-
count of some myth or legend connected with the place of pilgrimage in
question. Now we find embedded in this list the legend connected with the
Ramahradas (B. 3. 33. 26 ff.), which appears to have considerably roused
the interest of the compiler and to which he has devoted not less than 32
lines. The story is of course no other than that of the extirpation of the
Ksatriya race by the Bhargava Rama, of which this is already the jourth
repetition in some form or other. The story is as follows.

The greatly effulgent and heroic Rama, after exterminating the K^atri-
yas with great valour, formed five lakes filled with the blood of the slaughter-
ed warriors. And he offered that blood as oblation to his forefathers, who
were most gratified by this supreme act of filial piety. The shades of these
ancestors appeared before him and addressed him as follows : “ O Rama, O
Rama, O fortunate one ! We are pleased, O Bhargava, with thy filial piety
and with thy great valour.. Ask for a boon, O greatly effulgent one. What
dost thou wish to have ? Having been thus addressed by his ancestors,
Rama, that foremost of smiters {Rdmah pruharatdm varah B. 3. 83. 31),
thus spoke with joined hands to his ancestors : “ If you are pleased with me
and if I have deserved your favour then by your grace I desire that I may
again derive pleasure in asceticism. By your power, may I be freed
from the sin I have incurred by killing these K^atriyas in a fit of
wrath. Also may these sanguinary lakes become holy places of pilgrimage
celebrated throughout the world . Hearing these righteous words of Rama,
his ancestors were highly pleased, £20} and filled with joy they thus replied
to Rama : “ Let thy austerities prosper, especially by virtue of thy filial piety.
Forsooth thou hast exterminated the K§atriyas in a fit of wrath, but thou
art already freed from that sin, for they have fallen owing to their own mis-
deeds. These lakes of thine shall without doubt become places of pilgrimage.
He who will bathe in these lakes and offer here oblations to his ancestors will

please his manes and they will gratify all his heart’s desire, and lead him
to the eternal celestial regions”. Having granted these boons to Rama and
affectionately taken leave of him, the shades became invisible. It was thus
that the bloody lakes of that illustrious descendant of Bhrgu became sacred
places of pilgrimage. — Leading the life of a student of the sacred lore and
observing sacred vows, if a person bathes in the Lakes of Rama (Ramahra*
da) and worships Rama, he will obtain much gold.

The reader will easily recognize this as the story which was briefly re-
lated already in connection with Samantapaflcaka. In fact Ramahrada ap-
pears to be only another name of Samantapancaka, one of the Urthas explicit-
ly mentioned as having been visited by the Suta (that is, the putative narrator
of the Mahabharata), before he came to Saunaka’s sacrifice. It will be re-
called that some information was asked then about Samantapancaka in adhy.
2 of the Adi, and in that connection this story was briefly narrated by the
Suta to the sages of the Naimi^a Forest. There the story was originally
summarized in four stanzas, but some subsequent reviser, apparently not
satisfied with such a cursory allusion to this epoch-making feat of Rama, had
interpolated at that place the dialogue between Rama and his ancestors
(compressed into eight lines) made up mostly of bits and pieces of verses
borrowed from the present context, and like all interpolations proving itself
to be somewhat of a bad fit.

A few chapters later, we have a strange story of a conflict between two
different avataras of the same god, Visnu, between the Jamadagnya Rama
and the Da^rathi Rama, told in connection with a Bhrgutirtha, ” celebrated
in the three worlds, which Yudhi§thira and his party are said to have visited
(B. 3. 99. 34 ff). Once upon a time, the story goes, Rama Jamadagnya went
to Ayodhya to meet Rama Dasarathi and to test his strength. {21} Rama
D. was sent by his father to the boundary of his kingdom to receive Rama
J. hospitably, but was flagrantly insulted by the latter. Rama D. nevertheless
bends the bow given to him by Rama J. to test his strength and shoots an
arrow which convulses the whole world, astounding Rama J. Rama D. further
confounds Rama J. completely by showing him his cosmic form (visvmupa),
made popular by the Gita (adhy. 11), and rebukes him for his( overweening
conduct. Abashed, Rama J. returns to Mount Mahendra, having lost his
lustre {tejm), which he regains later at some tlrtha or other. Yudhi^thira is
asked to baithe in the same tlrtha that he might regain the lustre he had lost
in his conflict with Duryodhana.

This grotesque story, composed probably with the object of glorifying
the K§atriya Rama at the cost of the Brahmin Rama, must be quite a modem
interpolatiooi in the Mahabharata. Contextually it is an obvious mis-
fit, being incongmously wedged in between two halves of the Agastya legend,
with which it has absolutely no connection. Not only is this bizarre story
contextually a mi^t, it is a very poor piece of composition, and it strikes

moreover a discordant note, involving disrespect towards the Bhargava Rama,
who in our epic is otherwise throughout held up for air admirations as the^
foremost of weapon-bearers and fighters. Fortunately we are not left to
deduce the spuriousness of this passage merely from intrinsic arguments,
which are apt to be discredited ; for, the passage is missing entirely in the
Southern recension, an omission supported by the Kasmirl version and even
by some ancient Devanagari MSS. The story, which is narrated at some
length in the Ramayatna, is not even alluded to in the Ramopakhyana of our
epic and belongs evidently to a different complex of legends, quite inharmo-
nious with the Mahabharata context. It appears to have been smuggled into
the capacious folds of the Arajiyakaparvan in quite recent times by some
well-meaning but ignorant Northern interpolator anxious to vindicate the
claim of the epic to be a complete encyclopaedia of the Hindu legendary lore.^

But the next chapter (100) again contains a Bhargava story, the legend
of Dadhica. Lomasa relates how the Kalakeyas under the leadership of
Vrtra persecuted the celestials, who betook them-{22}-selves to Brahma ask-
ing for his protection. The latter advises them to go to the (Bhargava) Da-
dhica and ask for his bones. The sage magnanimously gives up his body
for the good of the three worlds. The celestials took the bones of Dadhica
to Visvalcarman, the architect of the gods, who fashioned out of his tones
the thunderbolt, with which Indra vanquished the enemies of the gods. The
story is repeated in the account of the pilgrimage of Baladeva (sSalya 51 in
the Vulgate), where it is said of Dadhica that he was the strongest of all
creatures, tall as the Himalayas and that Indra was always mightily afraid
of him on account of his lustre.

Yet again, a few chapters later, the arrival of Yudhisthira and his party
at Mount Mahendra, the headquarters of Rama, now a samnydsin, affords
a welcome opportunity to the bard for the presentation of a full-length por-
trait of the hero of the Bhargavas, Rama, son of Jamadagni (Arainyaka 115-
117 in the Vulgate) .

The Pandavas bathe at the mouth of the Ganges and proceed to the river
Vaitaraiii in Kalinga, where the altar of Kasyapa is. They rest on Mount
Mahendra and hear there from Akrtavrana, a disciple of the Bhargava Rama,
the well-known story of Rama, which may be summarized as follows.

Gadhi, king of Kanyakubja, had retired to the forest to practise reli-
gious austerities. There a most beautiful daughter was tom to him, Satya-
vati, whom the Bhargava Rcika wooed. Gadhi perhaps did not re-
lish his suit and tried to evade it by demanding a present of
a thousand peculiarly coloured horses, but Rcika supplied them
and gained her. Then a Bhrgu (perhaps, Aurva is meant), who
was a great sorcerer, visits the newly married couple and gives his young

daughter-in-law the boon that she would give birth to a gifted son, and so
would her mother. To fortify the boon, he prescribes that she should em-
brace an udumbara tree, her mother an asvattha, and both should partake of
different dishes of some special earn prepared by him with powerful incanta-
tions and endowed with magical potency. These good ladies go and ex-
change the trees as well as the dishes of earn which were apportioned to them
by the great sage, with the result that the daughter was about to give birtli
to a Brahmin son with K§atriyan qualities and the mother a K^atriya son
with {23} Brahmanic qualities. But the Bhrgu, who comes to know of this
interchange by occult means, comes rushing to the hermitage and tells his
daughter-in-law what was going to happen. Moved by her entreaties, he gives
a further boon to the young woman who had really been deceived by her mo-
ther, postponing the action of the potent charm. Thus her son Jamadagni
was saved from the taint of K)§atriyahood, which ultimately fell upon her
grandson Rama, who turned out to be, as prophesied, a revengeful and blood-
thirsty warrior, perpetrator of cruel and sanguinary deeds. Jamadagni,
though a peaceful Brahmin who excelled in the study of the Vedas, as de-
sired by his mother, was not without martial equipment, for “the entire
science of arms with the four kinds of magical missiles spontaneously came
to him, who rivalled the sun in lustre, without any instruction from any-
body” (B. 3. 115. 45). Jamadagni married Renuka, daughter of king Pra-
senajit. She gave birth to five sons : Rumanvat, Suseina, Vasu, Visvavasu,
and last but not least Rama, The family lived happily for some time. Then
one day when Reriuka of rigid vows happened to see Citraratha, the hand-
some king of Marttikavataka, sporting in water with his numerous wives,
her fortitude forsook her and she felt the pangs of desire. When she return-
ed to the hermitage, Jamadagni noticed her pollution and guessed her secret.
In a fit of rage he called in turn upon each of his sons to kill their unchaste
mother. Four of them refused to do the atrocious deed and were cursed
by the angry and disappointed father for their disobedience. Then came the
last of all that “ slayer of hostile heroes, ” Rama Jiamadagnya. A military
type, accustomed to receive and obey orders, Rama, when sternly command-
ed by his father to slay his mother, took his axe and without hesitation
chopped off his mother’s head ! Jamadagni, mightily pleased with the ins-
tant obedience of his son, granted Rama several boons, among thetn the boon
that the mother whom Rama had decapitated might be restored to life.
And the family lived again happily for some time. Then one day Arjuna
Kartavirya Sahasrab^u came to the hermitage and was hospitably received
by the Bhargavas. The ungrateful king, intoxicated with the pride of power,
not heeding the hospitality, seized and carried off by force from the hermit-
age the calf of the sacred cow of the sage (a variant of the kamadhem motif
of the Vasii^tfia-{24}-Vi4vSmitra legend), and spitefully broke the big tree
in the hermitage grounds. This was the beginning of a terrible feud. Rama

first slew the arrogant Arjuna Kartavirya, and Arjuna's sons then slew the
unresisting Jamadagni. Then Rama slaughtered the sons of Arjuna K. and
finally destroyed all K§atriyas off the earth thrice seven times and made five
pools of blood in Samantapancaka (B. 3. 117. 9) ;

triljLsaptakTtvah prthivim krtvd ni^k^atriydm prabhuh 1
Samontapancake pane a cakdra rudhirahraddn \\ (III)

Standing in the middle of these pools of blood — as has already been nar-
rated several times above — Riama offered oblations to the manes until at
last his ancestor R.lcka appeared and stopped him. Rama then performed
a great sacrifice to gratify Indra, in which he bestowed the earth upon Kas-
yapa, his priest. Then this annihilator of the Ksatriya race was at last satis-
fied and retired to Mount Mahendra, engaging himself in austerities of a
rather severe type. “ Thus did hostility arise between Rama and K§atriyas
of this earth, and the entire earth was conquered by Rama of immeasurable
lustre” (B. 3. 117. 15). It is then narrated that the Bhiargava Rama
appeared there in person on Mount Mahendra to meet the Piaiitjavas. He
was duly received and honoured by Yudhi§thira and his party, and he
honoured them in turn.

This account has been amplified in later times — like several other Bhar-
gava episodes — by the addition of a passage of 23 lines (B. 3. 115. 9-19),
which is prefixed to it and which is chiefly of interest on account of the vague
suggestion it contains to the effect that Bhiargava Rama was an avatdra of
Vi§j>u. This interpolation begins with the previous history of Arjuna Karta-
virya, king of Haihayas. He is represented here as a worshipper of DattS.-
treya, by whose favour he had obtained a golden vimdna and a wonderful
chariot. Intoxicated with the pride of power, Arjuna Kartavirya insulted
Indra, trampled upon the sages and even upon the celestials, and persecuted
all creatures. Thereupon the celestials and the sages met together and went
in a body to Vi^aju to ask for his protection. Then the exalted god (Vi§iiu)
held a consultation with Indra. The god of gods (Indra) told Vwu what
had to be done. Thereupon the exalted go4, promising to do the needful,
went to Badan, his £25} favourite retreat. — Here the introduction suddenly
breaks off, and the story narrated about Gadhi and Rcika begins (B. 3. 115-
20). The suggestion probably is that at the consultation between Indra
and Vi§!iTiu it was decided that Vi§iiu should incarnate himself on the earth
as the son of Jamadagni, as Riama Jamadagnya, who should, in the fulness
of time, slay Arjuna Kartavirya, but that is left unsaid. The passage is
missing in the entire Southern recension and in some Northern manuscripts
including those of the Kasmiii version. There can therefore be no doubt
about its being a comparatively recent interpolation.

As already remarked above, Rama Jamadagnya and the other BhSrgavas
such as Cyavana, IJdka and so on are generally used as static figures, along
with other ancient sages like Niarada, in the description of largely attended
20

and important meetings and state functions, and such treatment of these
characters is quite intelligible, if not natural. But the Bhargavas — and es-
pecially the Bhargava Rama — are accorded a somewhat different treatment ;
they are represented as taking part in the action more definitely and more
frequently. We have seen that the Bhargava Rama is said to have given all
his astras to Dro|na. He is also said to have taught Bhli^ma and Karpa.
Here he is represented as having shown himself to the P^davas, as a special
favour. In another context Rama is said to have fought with Bhl^ma,, a fight
which lasted for twenty-three days but was absolutely barren of any conse-
quence. Elsewhere also we shall find Rama and some of other Bhargavas re-
presented as taking some innocuous part in the action, which in no way
affects the course of events but which serves to establish and maintain con-
tact between the Bhargavas and the epic characters.

The above story of Rama, which is miscalled the Kartaviryopakhyana,
ends at adhy. 117 of the Vulgate. At adhy. 122, we have another Bhargava
story, which covers adhy. 122-124 and about half of adhy. 125 : the story
of the great wizard Cyavana, son of Bhrgu.

The Pl^davas reach the Payo^iii and the Narmada rivers and hear from
Lomasa the story {updkhydna) of Cyavana : how he demanded in marriage
a young princess, by name Sukanya, who £26} had innocently and unwit-
tingly blinded him ; how he recovered his sight by the grace of the Asvins
and how he gave them on that account that Soma libation, paralyzing the
arm of Indra, who would have prevented it. The story runs thus.

Cyavana, son of Bhrgu, practised austerities in a forest so long that an
ant-hill was formed round him. There came one day to that place king Siar-
yati, acompanied by his daughter Sukanya, with beautiful eyebrows and
tapering thighs. The sage imprisoned within the ant-hill gazed longingly at
the youthful princess, clad in a single garment ai>d adorned with costly orna-
ments, and addressed some words to her which sihe did not hear. Sukanya
saw, however, the gleaming eyes of the sage, engaged in self-mortification in
the ant-hill, and mistaking them for a species of glow-worm, in youthful
heedlessness, pierced the eyes of the sage with a thorn. Little did she think
of the dire consequences of her childish act. For through the anger of the
offended sage, smarting with the pain thoughtlessly inflicted on him by the
heedless princess, the king’s entire army suffered suddenly from a complete
stoppage of urine and excreta. The bewildered king inquired about the cause
of this strange mishap, but none of his soldiers and companions could en-
lighten him. The occurrence remained a mystery until the guilty princess
confessed her misdemeanour. ;8aryiati forthwith set out to pacify the irate
sage. The sage would relent only if the mischievous but fascinating princess
is given to him in marriage. Without reflecting, the king agreed to bestow
his beautiful daughter on the high-souled Cyavana and returned to his own
city. Some time later the Asvins saw the faultless Sukanya bathing in the

lake adjoining the hermitage of the sage. They also were smitten by her
ravishing beauty and asked her to accept one of them for her husband instead
of the blind old sage. As she would not consent, they propose that they would
rejuvenate Cyavana, and then she should choose. With the permission of
her husband she consents to the second proposal. Cyavana had to dip into
the waters of the lake, into the primordial dement,, the womb of all creation,
along with the A^ins (Fountain of Youth motif ).^ The three of £27} them
came out of the water, all looking exactly alike. Here is a diletnma (Nala-
Damayanti motif). By virtue of her unswerving loyalty to her husband,
Sukanya is however able to choose the right man. In gratefulness for the
gift of youth and beauty, Cyavana promises the Asvins a draught of the
Soma juice during a regular Sacrifice. Soon afterwards, saryiati comes to visit
his son-in-law Cyavana and the latter arranges a great sacrifice for isaryati,
at which he offers the first draught of Soma to the Asvins, who used to be
altogether excluded on these festive occasions on account of their being
medicine-men. Indra tries to stop the sacrilegious act ; but as Cyavana will
not heed, Indra then attempts to hurl the thunderbolt at him. But Cyavana
was toc ^quick for him. Instantly Cyavana paralyzed Indra’s arm and brought
him to his knees. At the same time the great sorcerer created by his magic
a terrible demon {kjtya) called Mada (Intoxication). When Mada rushes
towards Indra to slay him, Indra grants the wish of Cyavana, who triumph-
antly continues the sacrifice and gives the Asvins, the promised libation of
Soma. Since that time the Asvins participate regularly in the sacrificial
offerings on a basis of equality with the other gods. Indra at the same time
apologizes and explains that he had opposed Cyavana merely to spread the
fame of Cyavana and his father-in-law !§aryati throughout the world : a
significant and prophetic utterance.

Bhrgu, the father of Cyavana, had only cursed Agni, a minor god, in
fact, merely the “ mouth ” of the gods, to be sarvabhaksa, devourer of all
things, good and bad (1. 6, 13). Cyavana did even better. He thoroughly
humbled Indra, the king of gods, who had to submit to the will of Cyavana.

In the next chapter again we have a passing allusion to a Bhargava,
who remains unnamed. The background is a Bhargava hermitage, though
the main actors are not Bhrgus, The pious Yuvaniasva Saudyumni is
practising austerities for the sake of progeny. One night he became very
thirsty. Searching for water, he enters the hermitage of the Bhargava who
was engaged in performing some magical rites in order to make Yuvanasva’s
queen give birth to a son. This sorcerer had actually prepared a potion, en-
dov/ed with magical efficacy, for administering it to the queen and kept the
jar containing the dose in al corner* of the £28} hermitage. The thirsty king
found it, and, not knowing that the water was charmed and intended in fact

1 An alluring explanation of the idea underlying this intriguing motif has been
given by H. Zimmer in his Muyu, Der indische Mythos (Stuttgart 1936), pp. 42 ff.

for the queen, drained the potion to the dregs. Here was a mess. But the
potion prepared by a Bhrgu is infallible in its effect. Whoever drinks it must
give birth to a son. Cotislequently the king became himself pregnant, and a
son, Mandhatr, was bom to him, ripping open his left side, but owing to some
propitiatory rites performed by the Bhrgu, Yuvana^va himself escaped unhurt.

It is interesting to compare this version of the story of M^dhiatr with
the one which occurs in the Droioaparvan (adhy. 62 of the Vulgate). There
we are told that once upon a time king Yuvanasva, when out hunting, became
thirsty, and his steed was exhausted. Seeing at a distance a curl of smoke,
the monarch guided by it reached a sacrificial enclosure and found there
some sacrificial butter (djya), which he greedily swallowed. Thereupon the
king became pregnant and was delivered of a son (Mandhatr) by the Asvins.
The rest of the story is nearly the same.

In this version, king Yuvanasva was not practising austerities for secur-
ing the birth of a son, but had gone out hunting. Nor did he partake of the
magical preparation at night in the dark, but presumably in full daylight,
when the slmoke from the sacred hearth could yet be seen by him. The second
version moreover makes no mention of any Bhrgu, playing the role of the
officiating priest and saviour of Yuvanasva, like the first, which is an im-
portant discrepancy. The second story is sketchy and lacking in definition,
and appears to Be the older version. In the first the details are filled out,
by adding a Bhrgu as an officiating priest and generally making the picture
more vivid and realistic.

The next Bhargava of importance we meet with in the Aranyaka is the
sage Markandeya, whose discourses on the most divers topics extend over
51 Chapters (182-232) in the Vulgate, containing about 2200 stanzas (Mar-
kandeya-samasya), which he delivers for the delectation and edification of
the Pandavas. This is not his first visit to the Pandavas by any means. For
early in the beginning of their exile, when the Pandavas had settled in the
Dvaitavana Forest, Markaaideya had paid a flying visit {29} to them (adhy.
25). He turns up again, as a matter of fact, also towards the end of their
exile, without notice or warning, to console Yudhi§thira and relates to him
the Ramopakhyana, the popular story of Rama and Sta, as well as the
Savitryupakhyana, that immortal story of a wife's splendid devotion. These
two updkhydnas, narrated by Markaaideya, together comprise about 1060
stanzas. Thus the Miarkair?^^eya-sianilasya together with the two latter upa^
khyanas comprise 3260 stanzas, which is nearly one fourth of the entire
extent of this extensive parvan.

Markan^eya was one of the cirajivins : eternally youthful though many
thousand years old. How he was exactly connected with the two wdl-known
Bhrgu families of our Mahabharata (Bhrgu-Cyavana-Rama and Bhrgu—
Cyavana-Sunaka) is not exactly known ; but that he was a Bhargava is be-
yond doubt. He is referred to as Bhmgam in B. 3. 183. 60 ; 189. 97 ;

                over MarkaiQda is' explicitly declared to be a gotra founder of the Bhtgu clan
                in the Matsya Parana (195. 20).

Some of the subjects of Markand^ya’s discourses to the Pao^avas are
the following : great power of Brahmins ; merit of benevolence to Brahmins ;
wife’s duty to her husband ; and different forms of Agni. He relates, among
others, stories of Manu, Yayati, Vrsadarbha, 'Sibi, Indradyumna (father of
Janaka), Kuvalasva and of Skanda Karttikeya. He is also responsible for
the famous story of the Righteous Hunter (dharma^vyddha) of Mithila.
Besides these, there is, as is well known, a whole Parana named after him,
the Markaipdeya Purana.

The most interesting of Markandeya's stories, however, is how he ac-
tually witnessed the act of creation and dissolution in progress. We have
here in fact in Markandeya a Brahmanic counterpart of the K^triya Manu,
that distant cousin of the Semitic Noah with his ark, seeds and so on.

The legend of Manu, like that of Noah, is a childish story. According
to this legend (Matsyopakhyana, also related by the same sage Mi^kaindeya,
Arainyaka 187 in the Vulgate), Manu, son of Vivasvat, while saying his
usual prayers on the bank of a river, sees a tiny little fish, which asks the sage
to protect it. £30} Manu rears the fish in a small earthem vessel, which the
fish soon outgrows. The fi^ keeps on growing larger and larger. Manu
places the fish successively in a tank, in the river Ganges, and in the ocean.
Before parting from Manu, the fish warns him of the impending catastrophe
and advises him to build an ark and keep carefully a store of seeds of all
kinds. When the deluge comes, Manu gets into the ark with the Seven Sages.
The ark is towed by the horned fish on the ocean, which during the deluge
flooded everything. The ship, “ like a drunken wench ”, staggered from side
to side on the bosom of the agitated ocean . In the end the ship is fastened on
to the peak of the Himalayas, called Naubandhana, which is projecting out of
the water. When the flood subsides, Manu quietly gets out of the ark and,
as he has all the necessary seeds with himself in the ark, there would be no
difficulty in creating the world anew. Before parting again from Manu and
the Seven Sages, the Fish saysi, ” I am Brahma, the lord of creatures. None
is greater than I. In the form of a fish I have saved you all from this pe-
ril. Manu will create all beings : gods, asuras and human beings, the mobile
and the immobile creation. ”

This story, which appears to belong to a different complex of m 3 dhs and
does not at all fit well in the Mahiabharata cycle, is, as has been surmised,
probably of Semitic origin.*^ If Manu creates all beings, Brahma is thrown

out of employment. The Purauic theory of creation is that there is a deluge ;

nothing remains of the universe except Vi§iiu-Narayaiiia, reclining on tlie

coils of the Eternal Serpent (iSe^a-Ananta) floating on the waters. Then
out of Narayana’s navel emerges Brahma, seated on a lotusi, tlie creative as-
pect of the deity. From Brahma are born his mind-bom sons {manasa-pu-
iras). Then other beings, male and female, emerge from his heart, breast,
thumbs and so on. These are the Prajapatis. They propagate this world
of oursi. The process is repeated at each dissolution : it is an eternal recur-
rence. In this complex there is clearly no roomi for the Semitic legend,

which would imply a parallel creation by Manu, a state of things

which is not at all what is intended by the legend. Since a £31} vaJriant
version of this legend is found even in the Satapatha Brahmaaja (1. 8. 1 ),
it should seem that the Semitic legend was introduced into India at a fairly
early date but has remained unassimilated. Its exotic character, however,
appears to me to be clearly betrayed by the phalasruti at the end of the chap-
ter, an addition which accompanies all late accretions to the Great Epic (B.
3. 187. 58 emended) :

ya idam sr^ydn nityam Memos caritam dditah |

sa sukhi sarvasiddhdrthah svargalokam iydn narah 1 1
The Indian Noah is a man of a very different character. He requires
neither boat nor homed fish to save him ; nor does he keep a store of
seeds with himself. The man who could live through the dissolution of the
world can only be a perfect Yogi ; and a perfect Yogi is deathless. “ There
is none equal to you in years save Brahma Paramesthin,” says Yudhistbira
to the Bhargava Markaiu^cya. But he requires neither food nor drink to live.
He can walk on water as easily as on land. So when the world was over-
whelmed with floods and the creation was gradually submerged, Markaijidoya
found himself alone, walking on the waters of the oceani. After some time
Markaindcya, being hunmn after all, begins to feel a little tired and lonely,
tramping about all by himself on the surface of the endless ocean. He also
felt inexpressibly sad at that awful destruction. Then all of a sudden he
noticed a little child resting on the extended branch of a huge banyan tree
{nyagrodha). Markaiijdeya could not at all imagine how that little helpless
child could have survived all that cataclysmal devastation, and he kept ponder-
ing over that matter, standing near the child. Seeing his confusion, the
child softly told him to go into his body and rest there, and the child opened
its little mouth and drew him gently inside. And, lo and behold, inside the
child he found the world whose destmction he had seen with his own eyes.
The sun, the moon and the stars, all the oceans, seas and rivers of the world,
all the men, women and children whom he had known, all animals, gods and
demons, — ^they were all there, inside the little stomach of that wonderful little
child. He wandered about inside for hundreds of years and still he could not
find the end of it all, when he suddenly found £32} himself outside the child,

blown out by his gentle exhalation. Then the child spoke to the sage, and
then it suddenly dawned on Markaodeya who the Child was. He sees and
recognizes God.^

As this Brahmin Noah had no need for the ark, he had no need for
any seeds. The ^eeds are there permanently. There had been in fact no
destruction at all : that destruction was an illusion. There was only an in-
volution : the world had been only withdrawn into the interior of God. Crea-
tion, moreover, was not Miarkajideya's concern : it was the business of
Brahmia. Like the seed which has been well planted, the universe will grow
of itself, putting forth in due time blossoms and fruits and other seeds. Mar-
kaitjd^ya, the Yogi, is interested only in knowing and understanding things.
He had seen God, but that is not sufficient for him. He wants to know God,
know about His nature and character. His Maya, that Maya which had not
been understood even by the gods themselves (B. 3. 188. 135) :

Jnatum icchami deva tvdm mdydm caitdm tavottamdm |

The divine Child declares itself to be Narayana,, the indestructible source
of the world, and reveals to Markandeya His real nature and character.

The Bhargava Markaindeya is, according to this account, the only man
who had survived the last deluge, witnessed the act of dissolution and crea-
tion in progress, stood in his own person face to face with Narayana in the
utter solitude of total annihilation, but it is nowhere made clear why Markan-
deya was singled out for this unique honour : it is an unmotivated theme.
It is left to us to infer that the Bhargava Markandeya is the only perfect
Yogi that ever lived.

A little later, as already mentioned, Markandeya relates to the PSijda'-
vas the famous Ramopakhyana (Aranyaka 273-292 in the Vulgate), an
abridgement of the Rama story in about 750 stanzas. The occasion for re-
lating the story arises in the following way.

Jayadratha, a near relative of the Kurus and the Ptandavas tries to carry
off Draupadi, but is defeated and captured, and ultimately pardoned and re-
leased. Yudhi§thira mourns his fate £33} and asks Markaindeya, who seems
to be rather abruptly introduced for the purpose of the story, if there is any
mortal more unfortunate than himself. Thereupon Markaindeya relates the
^ory of the Dasarathi Riarna. Now the entire story of the attempted rape
of Ehaupadi by Jayadratha is so ill conceived and unconvincing that it ap-
pears to have been invented solely for the purpose of introducing a sum-
mary of the Riamayana. Who could be now a better narrator of the story
of Rama than the Bhargava Markaipdeya, age-old and yet eternally young,
the only man who had witnessed the happenings in this world in all the dif-
ferent ages, witnessed even the dissolution and creation of the world?


^ An illuminating commentary on a different version of this same myth is
given by H. Zimmer, Maya, Der indische Mythos, pp. 52 ff.

EPIC STUDIES


After hearing the story of Rama, Yudhi^thira, the “dummy” of the
bard., says that he did not grieve so much on his own or his brotiiers’ ac-
count as he did on account of the daughter of Drupada ; and then asks Mar-
kaijd^ya if he had ever seen or heard of a woman as devoted to her husband
as Draupadi. To console Yudhi^thira, Markandeya then relates the well-
known story {updkhyana) of Savitri, who rescues her husband from death by
the insistent importunity of her pleading, by her deep feminine intuition
and by her unflinching devotion to her husband (Arainyaka 293-299 in the
Vulgate). And that is the last episode of the Aranyaka narrated by the
Bhargava Markandeya and in fact the last episode of this parvan in which a
Bhargava is concerned.

Virataparvan

In the short Virataparvan, as is in the Sabha, the narrative is plain and
straightforward, unembellished by any episodic enlargement, and the story
marches rapidly forward. This book contains consequently no updkhydnas
and there is no room for any Bhargava digression. The references to the
Bhiargavas are few and far between, and they are incidental allusions to the
greatness or heroism of the Bhargavas. One of these may be adduced for
the purpose of illustration. Addressing Duryodhana, BhJ§ma asks : “ Who is
superior to Drona except Rama, the son of Jamadagni ? ” {B. 4. 51. 10).^

[34} Udyogaparvan

The Udyogaparvan furnishes its quota of references to the Bhargavas,
at least to the Bhargava Rama. Here again Rama Jamadagnya emerges
from the obscurity of myth and legend, and we find him coming into direct
contact — and in one case, actual conflict — with some of the epic characters.

In adhy. 72 ff. of the Vulgate version of the Udyoga, we have an ac-
count of a council held by the Pandavas, where Ky^ina is commissioned to go
and treat with Dhrtar^tra, which is followed in adhy. 83 ff. by a descrip-
tion of Ki^na’s journey to Hastinapura. On the way he meets a com-
pany of ancient sages, whom he duly honours. On his asking them whither
they were bound, the Bhlargava Rama, who is apparently their spokesman,
explains that they were on their way to attend the council meeting which
was going to be held at Hastinapura in order to witness the proceedings and
listen to the discussion. The sages then take leave of him and proceed on
their way. Led by Rama Jamadagnya, they arrive in due course at the
capital of the Kurus and present themselves in the darbar hall, where they
are received with due honours by Bhi§ma (adhy. 94) . The proceedings be-
gin with a long peroration by Kp^ija, in which he announces that the Rapda-
vas were ready to obey implicitly the commands of Dhjtara^tra, provided

it was added perhaps within 3 or 4 centuries !

305


they were assured that they would be treated with fairness and given what
is theirs by right (adhy. 95) . The Bhiargava Rama, taking advantage of the
spell of silence which followed Krona's diplomatic speeclt, gets up and, advis-
ing peace, relates, unasked, the story of Dambhodbihava (adhy. 96) . TTie
foolish king Dambhodbhava, who wants to be acknowledged the unconquered
and unconquerable hero, challenges in his cupidity the sages Nara and Na-
rayaaia (who were then practising 'penance at Badari) to fight with him.
The ascetics meekly decline, but Dambhodbhava is importunate. So in the
end Nara takes up a handful of grass and, charging the blades in his hand
with mystic potency, flings them at the enemy. They change into deadly
missiles, overpowering the soldiers of Dambhodbhava, and compel him to
surrender and acknowledge his defeat. Nara reads Dambhodbhava a sermon
on selficontrol, on kindness to all creatures and humility towards Brahmins.
The Bhargava Rama appearing here in the role of a [35} peace-maker con-
cludes by advising conciliation and pointing out that Nara is Arjuna, while
Narayana is Kr§ina. The story is an unnecessary digression, with the
very obvious object of reiterating and emphasizing the identity between Nara-
Naraya;ia and Arjuna-Kpsna.

The Udyogaparvan closes with a story (Ambopakhyana), in which the
Bhargava Rama plays a very active and prominent part (adhy. 173-196 of
the Vulgate) . Bhisma explains to Duryodhana that, because of a vow he had
taken, he would not fight with Sikhandin, who at birth had been a girl, and
then relates the whole life history of sikhaindin, who in a previous birth was
Amha, the daughter of the king of Kaa. Bhisma narrates how Amba, hav-
ing been disappointed of marriage through Bhi^ma’s action, vowed to com-
pass his death and how the Bhargava Rama, having promised to help her,
fought with Bhisma at Kuruk§etra for twenty-three days, a fight which ends
in a stalemate. The story is developed in this way.

When Amba was repulsed by Salva, to whom she was engaged and who
subsequently refused to marry her on account of her abduction by Bhi§ma,
she left him and wandered about alone in a neighbouring forest, nursing her
grief and vowing vengeance. There she meets a company of ascetics, who
sympathize with her and devise means to help her. While the ascetics are
cogitating as to how they should help her, there comes along by chance Am-
ba’s grandfather, the royal sage Hotravahana, who advises her to seek the
help of his jriend Rama Jiamadagnya. While these deliberations are pro-
ceeding, Rama's disciple and faithful follower Akrtavrana appears on the
scene. Hotravahana tells him the previous history of Amba and also her
future plans. Akrtavraipa decides that Bhisma is certainly responsible for
Amba's misfortunes, and is the party deserving punishment. By a fortunate
accident Rama — on the war-path, armed with a bow and a sword and his
famous axe {parasu ) — comes there the following morning. Amba again re-
lates the whole story of her unfortunate life to the Bhargava Rama and be-



306


EPIC STUDIES


seeches him to slay the offending Bhfema. But since Rama has taken the
vow that he would on no account take up arms except at the bidding of the
twice-bom, he has to be persuaded by the sages to espouse Amba’s cause.
£36} He then proceeds with Amba and all the assembled sages to the banks
of the Sarasvati and from there sends a message to Bhl^rna, who meets him
at the boundary of the Kuru kingdom. Rama orders Bhisma to take back
Amba or failing that fight a duel with him. Since Bhi§ma cannot do the
former, he decides to fight, goes back to the city and returns, furnished with
all arms and accoutrements, in a chariot made of silver, drawn by white
horses. Bhl^ma’s mother Gang&devi (identified with the river Ganges) tries
to stop the impending fight but without success. The fight lasts for several
days, when at last Rama wounded by an arrow of Bhi§ma falls down in a
swoon. Bhisma stops fighting : it is a gentlemanly duel, following minutely
all the strict rules of chivalry, and unlike the deadly combats of the Bharata
war. The fight is continued on the following days, with varying luck. Even
after many days of constant fighting, in which millions and billions of ar-
rows are showered by each combatant and cut up by the opponent, various
magical missiles are flung by which alternately the combatants get wounded,
fall down, recover and resume the fight, the grim contest continues indecisive-
ly. Then one night Bhisma, who was one of the Vasus, saw in a dream a
group of eight Brahmins (the Eight Vasus), who had supported him and
encouraged him that same day while he was lying wounded and unconscious
on the battlefield. They remind him of a magical missile of his, by dis-
charging which he could put the Bhiargava Rama to sleep on the field of bat-
tle. Next day the fight began again and the combatants hurled at each other
simultaneously the terrific Brahma missile, which is capable shattering the
earth. The two missiles clash in the middle and neutralize each other.
During the commotion caused by these weapons, Bhisma thinks of the
sleep missile. As he is about to discharge that missile, the gpds intervene.
With BhJsma's mother, Ganga, the gods go from one to the other of the
combatants, trying to pacify them. Seeing that neither of them is prepared
to 5 deld and be the first to retire from the field of battle, the gods stand bet-
ween the combatants and make the fight impossible. Still the combatants are
not pacified and will not leave! the field. Finally the shades of his ancestors
persuade Rffma to lay aside his weapons, which he then reluctantly does.
That is sufficient for Bhisma. He puts down his bow and arrow, goes to
Rama, his guru, and prostrates £37} himself at his feet. They soon forget
their quarrel and become friends again,. Thus this titanic conflict between
Bhisma and the Bhargava Riama, which is said to have lasted foir three and
twenty days, is utterly barren of any result beyond adding a few hundred
lines to the text !

One peculiar thing we notice about this story is the sudden change of
heart on the part of the BhSrgava Rama. While in all other accounts of



EPIC STUDIES VI


307


him he is represented as the inveterate foe of the K§atriyas and the epic bards
are never weary of telling us that he had exterminated the K^atriyas thrice
seven times, here we find him befriending the royal sage Hotravahana and
championing the lost cause of an unhappy K§atriya damsel ! The episode
shows another inconsistency in the behaviour of Rama ; for, here
we are surprised with the statement that in Bhi§ma Riama had taken a
Ksatriya pupil and had apparently taught him so well that the pupil knew not
only as much as the guru but perhaps even more. This does not prevent him
subsequently from cursing Kama, who had learnt the secrets of the science
of arms from Rama in the guise of a Brahmin but later had to confess that
he was a Ksatriya. There Riama is reported to have said to Kanja that the
Brahma weapon can never be learnt by one who is not a Brahmin (B. 12.
3. 31), though Bhit^ma had used the Brahma missile successfully against
   Rama in the combat mentioned above.

Bhi§maparvan

With the Bhi§maparvan begin what may be called the “ battle books,”
which in some shape or other must have formed the kernel of the Mahabha-
rata, which kernel has served as a nucleus for the growth of a vast amount of
secondary material, cohering together so as to form a more or less harmo-
nious whole. A rough sketch of the original plan of the epic is preserved in
a stanza occurring in one of the chapters of the first book (1. 55. 43) :
evam etat purdvrttam tenant aklit^akarmandm |
bhedo rdjyavimsas ca jayas cu jayatdm vara 1 1

The Bharata, according to this statement, was a trilogy consisting of the story
of the dissension, loss of the kingdom, and victory, among some descendants
of Bharata.

{38} The Bhi^maparvan, according to the Vulgate, is divided into four
sections {upaparvms) , Of these the first two are mainly geographical trac-
tates : JambukhaiDdamirmi^a-parvan and Bhumi-parvan. The third is the
famous philosophical discourse, the Bhagavad^ta, which is, so to say, the
keystone of the whole new superstructure of the remodelled Bharata and
which has passed into world literature. The fourth and last section of this
book is a lengthy account in eighty chapters (or about 4300 stanzas) of the
fight of the first ten days of the Great War, up to the fall of Bhi§ma. After
the Bhagavadgita, the account of the fight runs on smoothly and is not allow-
ed to be interrupted by any digressions. Consequently this sub-section also
contains no Bhargava episode or for that matter any other episodic narra-
tive at all. But passing allusions to the Bhargavas are not by any means
wanting even in this final section of the Bhi^maparvan. They are, however,
for the most part trivial and confined to the glorification of Rama Jamadag-
nya, playing on the theme of his encounter with Bhi^ma. The Bhargava



308


EPIC STUDIES


Rama is subtly praised by saying that Bhi§txia was a hero whom even Rama
could not defeat.

But the Bhagavad^ta itself contains an interesting allusion to the Bhr-
gus and that is in the tenth chapter, in the enumeration of the so-called
vibhutis of iSri-Ktwa. The vibhutis are said to be infinite {nasty onto vis-
tarasya me, Gita 10. 19 in the Vulgate version), but about sixty of them have
been specifically enumerated and they are worthy of close study. Some of
these vibhutis are pure and simple gods, such as Indra, Vi§aju, Siva and so
on. Some are yet other supernatural beings, such as Kubera, Citraratha and
others. Some are celestial luminaries such as the Sun, and the Moon. Some
are merely terrestrial features such as mountains, rivers, the ocean and so
on. Some are even animals such as the serpent (^e§a), elephant (Ainavata),
eagle (Garuda) and so on. There are mentioned among these vibhutis
only nine human — or at least semi-human, that is, semi-divine — beings,
whom we may regard as historical or semi-historical personalities. Three
of them, Vasudeva, Arjuna and Vyasa, are well-known and important
epic characters, and as such their inclusion in this list is expected and
may be said £39} to be quite natural. They may therefore be ignored.
Then, further, of divine sages (devarsis), !Sri-Kr§3ia declares himself to be
Narada, the official messenger between the gods and the men. Of perfected
beings (Siddhas), Sn-Krsna says, he is Kapila, a celebrated sage, probably
the codifier of the Saatikhya, the system most popular with the
epic bards. Of household priests, iSfi-Kr^iha identifies himself, quite
naturally again, with Brhalspati, the priest of the gods, one of the An-
girases, a clan closely connected with the Bhrgus from very ancient times.
There remain three ; of these all—or at least two — are clearly Bhargavas.
Of Kavis, Sri-Kr^-tia says, he is isukra, the Bhiargava priest of the Asuras,
the asuric counterpart of Brhaspati. Of weapon-bearers {sastra-bhrt) , Sri-
Kr§(ha declares himself to be Rama, who is identified by sotne authorities
as Rama son of Dasaratha, but who in my opinion is meant to be no other
than the much lauded hero of the Mahabharata poets, Rama' son of Jama-
dagni, the Bhargava Rama. Lastly, of great sages (mahar^is), Sri-Rr§i)a
says he is Bhrgu {maharsindm Bhfgur ahum, Gata IQ. 25).^ All other vi-
bhutis are more or less intelligible ; for each vibhuti is or may be r^arded,
more or less, as the foremost or the first of a class ; but why Bhrgu should be
considered as the greatest io/ the great sages (Mahar^is) is somewhat enig-
matic. He is not reckoned among the Seven Sages (saptar^is). He is no
doubt said to be a son of Brahma, but Brahma had nearly a dozen sons of
that kind, who all became Prajapatis and founders of gotras. And about
Bhrgu’s greatness even the Mahabharata has nothing to narrate beyond the

^ C V. VArovA, Proc. S trams : 1st Or. Conf. (1922), p. 39 (''Gotra and Pra-
vara'" p.p. 34-45) explains it differently. He is of opinion that of all R§is Bhrgu
was actually considered as the foremost.

fact that his wife Puloma was abducted by a cannibal called Puloman (Adi)
or Darhsa (Santi), and that he had cursed various people.

Dronaparvan

The Droiiaparvan supplies what is for our purpose one of the most in-
teresting of Bhiargava references in the Mahabharata.

On the thirteenth day of the Great War during Arjuna’s temporary ab-
sence, Abhimanyu with a small following pierces the Kaurava ring-formation
(cakra-vyuha) , but Jayadratha intercepts his followers and isolates him, and
Abhimanyu is slain after a brave fight ; one of the most tragic episodes of
the Great Epic. {40} To console Yudhi$thira for the untimely death of Abhi-
manyu, Vyasa tells him many stories illustrating the transitoriness of human
life. At that time he relates how Narada comforted Srhjaya in a time of
bereavement by telling him of the sixteen kings of great merit, who never-
theless all died when their time came (adhy. 55-71 of the Vulgate) . These
kings were, as a matter of fact, all cakravartins, sovereigns who had con-
quered surrounding kingdoms or brought them under their sway and estab-
lished a. paramount position on more or less extensive regions around their
own kingdoms. The episode, which is known as the SodaiSarajaldya, re-
counts the heroic deeds and the meritorious actions of sixteen of such fa-
mous kings of antiquity. The sixteen kings are these : (1) Marutta, son
of Avik§it ; (2) Suhotra Atithina ; (3) Paurava (Brhadratha, king of Ahga);
(4) iSibi, son of Usinara : (5) Rama, son of Dasaratha ; (6) Bhagiratha,
son of Dillpa ; (7) Dilipa Ailavila ; (8) Mandhatr, son of Yuvanasva ; (9)
Yayati, soti of Nahu§a ; (10) Ambari§a, son of Nabhaga ; (11) Sasabindhu,
son of Citraratha ; (12) Gaya, son of Amurtarayas ; (13) Rantideva, son of
Sathkrti : (14) Bharata, son of DutB?anta ; (15) Prthu, son of Vena ; and,
last but not least, (16) the Bhargava Rama, son of Jamadagni.

Accordingly we have here a vivid and colourful description of that great
feat of the Bhargava Rama, the ectirpation of K§atriyas, an account which
courts mistrust by its appalling exaggeration and staggering figures (adhy.
70 of the Vulgate) . We are told how Rama took a vow to relieve the Earth
of her burden of Knatriyas. Thereafter he first ^ew Kaitavirya, who was
never before defeated in battle. Then of Ksatriyas he slaughtered 64,000,
cutting off their ears and noses and breaking their teeith, besides stifling in
smoke 70(X) Haihayas (the clan to which Arjuna Klartavirya belonged) and
torturing them, and butchering 10,0(X) with his own axe. . . .Then the puis-
sant sc«i of Jamadagni, marching against the Kasmiras, the Daradas, the Kun-
tis, the Ksudrakas and Malavas, the Angas, Vahgas and Kalingas, the Vide-
has, the Tamraliptakas, the Rakgovahas, the Vltihotras, the Trigartas, the
Marttikavatas, the Sibis and other warrior races, thousands in number, slew
them all with arrows of exceeding sharpness. Going from country to coun-
try, he slew {41} thousands aind hundreds of thousands of K§atriyas, creat-

ing a veritable deluge of blood and filling many lakes with it.... Then
bringing under his sway all the eighteen divisions of the earth, that descen-
dant of Bhrgu celebrated a hundred siacrifices, like a second Indra, when he
gave away costly gifts (dak^i^d) to Brahmins. The sacrificial altar, full eight
nalas high and made entirely of gold, embellished with hundreds of gems and
adorned with thousands of banners, as5 also this earth abounding in domestic
and wild animals, was accepted by Kasyapa from the Bhargava Rama as his
sacrificial fee for performing the sacrifice. Ri^a also gave him many thou-
sands of huge elephants adorned with golden ornaments. Freeing the earth
of robbers that infested her, making her full of rigliteous and amiable peo-
ple, Rama gave the earth to Kasyapa at his great horse sacrifice. Then
comes the Bhargava slogan (B. 7. 70. 20) :

triJ^saptakrtvak prthivlm krtvd nihksatiydm prabhuh | (IV)

Having cleared the earth of Ksatriyas thrice ^ven times, having cele-
brated a hundred sacrifices, Rama gave the earth to the Brahmins. When
the earth with her seven grand divisions was bestowed by him upon Kasyapa,
then the latter said to Rama, “ Go thou out of this earth at my command !”
Hearing these words of Kasyapa, that foremosit of weapon-bearers, obedient
to the command of a Brahmin, caused the ocean to roll hack and to give him
a new strip of land to live in, and Rama took up his abode on Mount Ma-
hendra.

It is instructive to compare this Story of Sixteen Kings with a variant
version of it in the iSanti (adhy. 29 of the Vulgate), as related td the same
Yudhi§thira by Sil-Kmna. After the battle the month of mourning is spent
outside the capital on the banks of the Ganges. Yudhi§thira, very dejected,
proposes to renounce the kingdom and retire to the forest. At Arjuna's re-
quest, Kr§na tries to console him and' so relates to him the Story of Sixteen
King^ which Narada had once related to king Sriijaya. The stories are na-
turally almost the same as those rdated to Yudhi'§thira by Vyasa after the
death of Abhimanyu. There is, however, one very striking difference. Fif-
teen of the kings in the list are the same ; the sixteenth “ king ” of the Drorja
list, namely, the Bhargava Rama, is conspicuous by his absence in the i&nti
{42} list ! He is replace^ by a real kihg. Sagara son of Ifc§vaku, who was
indeed a very famous king, fully deserving to be included in this list of the
celebrated sixteen kings of antiquity, whereas the Bhargava Rama was no
king at all and does not properly fall into this enumeration. His “ extermin-
ation of the Ksatriyas was merely an act of vendetta. And although he is
said to have conquered the whole earth, he never was crowned a king. There-
fore the propriety of including his exploits in the $oda4ariajakiya is more
than questiofiable. In fact it would never strike anybody except an unscru-
pulous Brahmin redactor— with strong Bhargava leanings— to perpetrate
such a tendentious perversion and father it upon Vyasa.



EPIC STUDIES VI


311


KARIsIAPARVAN

Kama is represented in our epic as a pupil of the Bhargava Rama, like
Bhl§ma and Drona. So there are several casual references — in his capacity
as the guru of Karina — ^to Rama Jamadagnya in the course of this parvan.

In adhy. 31 (of the Vulgate),, we have a reference to the bow (Vijaya)
which Kama had received from the Bhargava Rama, who in his' turn had
obtained it from Indra himself. Indra had used it in his fight with the
Daityas : Rama had used it in his campaign against the Ki^atriyas of the
earth, which he had conquered thrice seven times (B. 8. 31. 46) :

triijisaptakrtvah pjthivi dhanu^d yena nirjitd ] (V)

On the seventeenth day of the war, Ehiryodhana persuades' isalya to be
Kamja’s charioteer and to encourage him tells the story how Karina had be-
come possessed even of celestial weapons through the Bhargava Rama.

To emphasize further the great importance of Kania, Duryodhana then
narrates a story which shows the greatness of KariiTia’s guru, Rama Jamad-
agnya (adhy. 34 of the Vulgate). Rama is generally represented
in the !^fehabharata as a man — or rather a Superman — who had fought his
battles on this earth with other human beings like himself. Here we are
told that he had fought with and vanquished even the Daityas. The story is
this. To obtain celestial weapons from Mahadeva, Rama (like the P^ip^ava
Arjun^ later) was practising terrible austerities. At that time £43} the
Asuras had become so powerful that even all the gods together could not
subdue them, and so Mahadeva asks the Bhargava Rama to fight with them
(as Arjuna later fought with the Nivatakavacas and other demons). Rama
went up to the Asuras and said to them, Most invincible in battle as you
are, O Daityas, give me battle’'. Then the Daityas began to fight with
Rama. Then that delighter of the Bhargava clan slaughtered those Daityas,
on the battle-field by strokes that were like the strokes from Indra’s thunder-
bolt. After Rama had vanquished the invincible Asuras without the use of
any special weapons, then Mahadeva gave him those celestial missiles for
which Rama was practising the terrible austerities. Perhaps feeling that
the story might be disbelieved, Duryodhana hastens to add that he had heard
it himself from the lips of a pious and truthful Brahmin while the latter was
relating it to king Dhrtar^ra, Duryodhana’s father.

Then in adhy. 42 (of the Vulgate), Kaiina relates that under the guise
of a Brahmin he had been a disciple of the Bhargava Rama in order to learn
from him the secret of certain magical mi^les known to Rama alone. One
day while Rama was sleeping with his head resting in the lap of Kanja, the
thigh of the latter was bored through by Indra (Arjuna’s de facto father)
in the form of a ferocious centipede, and Kania was weltering in blood but
did not move a muscle, for fear of disturbing the sleep of his guru and thus
incurring his displeasure. When Rama woke up and saw this state of things,



312


EPIC STUDIES


he concluded that his disciple was no Brahmin, as only a Ksatriya could
suffer such agony and keep still. Then Karpa confesses his guilt and begs
Rama’s pardcwi. Rama pronounces a curse on Kanja, saying that at the
critical moment the magical missiles of which he had obtained knowledge
from Rama by such a dastardly trick — even the great Yogi could not see
through it — ^would fail him. Brahma could never reside firmly in one who is
not a Brahmin : abrahmoaie brahma no hi dhruvarii sydt (B. 8. 42. 9.) And
so it happened, needless to say.

In a variant version of this tale (iSanti 3 in the Vulgate) the worm
which had bored through Kaiiija’s thi^ is said to have been not Indra in
disguise, but a demon suffering the effects of a curse pronounced on him by
Bhrgu !

1:44} •Salyaparvan

In the Salyaparvan there are only stray references to the Bhargavas, es-
pecially in the account of Balarama's pilgrimage — another very obvious dig-
ression — during which Balarama visits of course all the places sacred to the
Bhargavas such as Ramatirtha, Samantapahcaka and so on, which lay on
his way.

At Ramatirtha we have a repetition of the story that Kasyapa officiated
at the sacrifice celebrated by Rama Bhargava after conquering the whole
earth and annihilating the K§atriyas (B. 9. 49. 7 f.) :

Sauptikaparvan

The Sauptika is one of the few books of the Mahabharata which are
entirely, or almost entirely, free from reference to the Bhargavas. The book
is short, consisting of 18 chapters and about 800 stanzas in the Vulgate ver-
sion, and comprises only two sub-parvans : the Sauptika and the Ai^ika. The
first sub-parvm describes the slaughter of the sleepers in the camp of the
Piaijdavas, while the second gives an account of the use of the worldijdesitroy-
ing dart Ai§ika by Asvatthaman.

STRiPARVAN

In the next book, the Striparvan, which like the former is short, con-
sisting of 27 chapters and about 800 stanzas in the Vulgate version, there are
only three incidental references to the Bhargavas. The pmvm ccMisists almost
wholly of the description of the obsequial ceremonies of the warriors killed in
the war and lamentations of women over their dead kinsfolk, which is fortu-
nately held free from digressions and interpolations. The tragedy also does

not permit the development of any other sentiment. The absence of reference
to the Bhargavas, who, as already remarked, had strictly Speaking no con-
nection whatsoever with the Kuru-Pancala heroes, is not only thoroughly
£45} appropriate, but is an omission for which we may be truly grateful to
the redactors of our Mahabhiarata.

ISANTIPARVAN

The iSanti, which is in esisence a manual of instruction in king-^raft
{rdjadhmma), conduct in time of calamity (dpaddharma) and emancipa-
tion {mok^<idharma) compiled in the peculiar pedagogic technique developed
by the redactors of the Great Epic for the edification of the people combined
with their entertainment, supplies its quota of Bhargava material, making up
in some measures for the deficiency of the last three books.

Already in adhy. 2 f. (of the Vulgate) we hear of the Bhargava Rama.
The month of mourning is spent by the Pandavas outside the capital on the
banks of the Ganges. There Narada relates to Yudhisthira the story of the
early career of Kama, which is here said to be a secret of the gods {deva-
guhya). Tn the course of the narrative Narada repeats with more details
the story we have already noticed as to how Karija had easily deceived the
Bhargava Rama and obtained from him the carefully guarded secret of the
famous Brahma missile (brahmdstra) under the false pretence of being a
Bramin, and a Bhfgu too. An interesting point of difference between this
version of the story and that given in the Karoaparvan is, as mentioned
already, that the worm which bites Kama and bores a hole through his leg
is not Indra but a demon called Damsa, who had tried to carry off Bhrgu’s
wife. If this wife be Puloma, then her ravisher's name was given as Puloman
in adhy. 4 of the Adi, where, however, there is no mention of Bhfgu’s curse ;
but we are told on the other hand that the ravisher of Puloma was reduced
to ashes by Bhrgu’s son Cyavana. But perhaps this demon Darhsa is some
other ravisher of Bhrgu’s wife.

In any event the happy result of this discourse of the sage was that
Yudhisthira, casting off grief, enters the capital in state, is installed on the
throne and performs the obsequial ceremonies of his departed kinsmen. Later
Kiima in an ecstatic trance communes with the distant Bhi§ma, who remains
lying on the battlefield on a bed of arrows and who in a long hymn of ado-
ration invokes Krmai. Krma then sets out with the Paajdava brothers and
his followers £46} to visit Bhfema on his death-bed. The arrival of the party
at the battle-field, which it will be remembered has been identified by the
redactors of the epic with the Bhargava tMka Samantapancaka, affords an
easy opportunity for another repetition of the legend of Rama's heroic exploit.
That was the very spot where the BMrgava Rama had established those
five lakes of blood. l§ii-K|Tma in passing points to those lakes and says
(B. 12. 48. 9) :

Yudhi^thira, the “dummy” of the rhapsode, has an insatiable longing to
hear all about the extermination of the Ki^triyas by the Bhargava Rama
though he had heard it all before from other story-tellers, and he has besides
some doubts which he forthwith refers to Kiwa (B, 12. 48. 10) :
trihsaptukUvab prthivi krtd nihksatriyd pure |

Rdme^eti tathattha tvt^m atra me samsayo maMn |1 (VII)

To solve this doubt of Yudhi§thira Kr^^oa gratuitously volunteers to re-
peat the whole story of Riama from the very beginning, a full-size account
of the birth of the Bhargava Rama, of the extirpation of the K)§atriyas and of
the subsequent regeneration of the race. Here we have now an attestation of
the entire story by iSri-Kn§tiia, a variant of the story told by Alqtavrafrja, a
disciple of Rama, to Yudhii^tbira himself in the Arapyaka. There are natu-
rally several discrepancies between the two versions, two of which are note-
worthy. In the first version it was Satyavati's father-in-law who prepares
the magical carus, which were subsequently exchanged by the good ladies who
were to partake of them ; here it is Satyavati’si husband himself, Rcika, who
prepares them. The other is a somewhat more serious discrepancy. In the
Araipyaka version, Jamadagni was robbed of his calf by Arjuna Kartavirya
himself, who is represented there as a perfect fiend. In the stbry as told
by (Sri-Kr^pa, Arjuna is a perfect angel of a man, always devoted to peace,
ever obedient to Brahmins and ready to protect all classes ; he had given
away the earth to Brahmins in a horse sacrifice which he had performed.
His sons on the other hand were “ proud and cruel ”, and it was they who
brought away the calf of Jamadagni s sacrificial £47} cow. As it is difficult,
at this distance of time, in the absence of independent evidence, to say whe-
ther Akrtavraipa or Sri-Kr$oa was more truthful, it must remain a moot point
whether the guilty party is Arjuna Kartavirya or his sons. Then Sri-Kr^pa
goes on to tell Yudhi^thira that the Ki§atriyas were annihilated by the Bhar-
gava Rama thrice seven times, speaking exactly like a Bhargava (B. 12. 49.
64) :

tribsaptakjtvab prthwlm kftvd nihk^atriydm pr€d>hub I
dak^ifj^m asvamedhdnte Kasyapdyddadat tatab || (VIII)

The matter being now attested by i§ri-Kiwa himself, it cannot be described
by revilers of Brahmins as a fabricaticm made by the Brahmins themselves.

It must always have been something of a puzzle to all thoughtful persons
where K^triyas like the Kauravas and the Paipdavas and even (Sri-<K|i§IOa
himself came from after the Rsatriya race had been wiped out thrice seven
times by the Bhargava Riama, and that was in fact Yudhi^hira's doubt,
which he had expresised to iSri-Krsipa. Various explanations of the ttiystery
have been propounded. In the earlier chapters of the epic, ab we have seen

several times, it was the pious Brahminsi who procreated children on the
widows of the K^atriyas slain by Rama and they became K^triyas by the
Vedic rule pariigrahasya tanayalp (1. 98. 5) : the child belongs to him who
has gone through the form of marriage with the mother. That was however
not the view of Sri-Kp^oa. His explanation was that the Earth had concealed
some K^atriyas.^ She had concealed some Haihayas among women, some
Pauravas among the bears of Mount Rk^vant. Some other K§atriyas were
brought up in the forest among the kine, some in the cowpens among the
calves. Some were protected by the Ocean, some by the wolves^ on Mount
Grdhrakuta. These had all escaped destruction at the hands of the formid-
able Bhlargava. And the old K]§atriya dynasties were resuscitated by Ka4-
yapa, who first ordered Rama to clear out from the earth which he had given
to Kasyapa as a part of the sacrificial fee and restored by and by those
scions of the old K^atriya families to their rightful heritage. iSri-Kr^na
evidently did not know anything about the procreation of K^atriyas by pious
Brahmins on the widows of the K§atriyas slaughtered by the bloodthirsty
Bhargava. He con-{48}-cludes by remarking that the present K§atriyas are
the legitimate offsprings of those ancient K§atriyas (B. 12. 49. 88 f.) :

At the beginning of the third great sub-division of the Santi, the Moksa-
dharma, we have a lengthy discourse attributed to Bhfgu, called the Bhrgu-
Bharadvaja-samvada (adhy. 182-192 of the Vulgate), which summarizes in
the form of questions and answers almost the entire Brahmanic teaching on
the subject of (1) the elements, (2) life and death, (3) caste distinctions,
(4) good and evil, (5) the four stages of life, and finally, (6) the other
world. It will be seen that it is a complete tractate on Hindu Ontology,
Sociology, Eschatology and Ethics that is here attributed to Bhrgu, the
eiX)nymou^ ancestor of the Bhargavas,

The oft-cited stanza B. 12. 339. 103 f. :

collated by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute for a critical edition
of that book. The other reference is in the same chapter, a few stanzas
earlier (B. 12. 339. 84) :

Tretdyuge bhavi^ydmi Rdmo Bhfgukulodvalmlp [

K^atram cotsddayi^ydmi samrddhabaluvdhanam ] [

This stanza cannot be impugned on the score of documentary evidence,
which is unanimous in its favour. But both references occur in the Naraya-
Oiya section of the Mok§adharma, which is notoriously a late addition to
our Mahabharata. This shows that the theory of avatdtas is still develop-
ing in the epic and their number is not yet fixed, nor are the avatdras fully
canonized. It should thus seem that the Mahabharata does not £49} neces-
sarily presuppose the Bhargava Rama to be an avatdra of Vi§hu.

Anusasanaparvan

The Anu^Sana, for some reason that is not yet quite clear, is the richest
in Bhargava material.

Early in the beginning of this book (adhy. 4), we have the third repe-
tition of the legend of the birth of Jamadagni. The previous chapter (3)
relates the mighty deeds of the K§atriya Visvamitra, which led to his attain-
ing the coveted status of a Brahmin. In adhy. 4, BhJ^ma explains how it
came about that Visvamitra who was of mingled Brahmin and K§atriya
parentage was born in the K§atriya caste with Brahmanic qualities, while his
nephew Jamadagni, under" similar conditions, was born in the Brahmin caste
with K^atriyan qualities. We have here a repetition of the old story how
Bdka married Gadhi’s daughter Satyavati, who obtained some boons' for
herself and her mother. The mother and the daughter exchange the trees
they had to embrace and earns of which they had to partake. The wise
Rdka had purposely made the prescriptions differently. He had in fact put
the entire accumulated energy of Brahmanism in the earn of his wife, while
he had put the entire accumulated energy of K^atriyahood in the earn in-
tended for her mother. The consequence of the exchange slyly effected by
the mother was that the son of Gadhi’s wife turned out to be a man with
Brahmanic propensities, while the son of IJdka’s wife would have been a
model K§atriya ; but, owing to the pleadings of Satyavatl, the great sage
graciously gives his consent to the pc^tponement of the doom to Satyavati’s
grand-son.

This story we have had at Arainyaka 115 and Santi 49 of the Vulgate.
In passing it may be mentioned that the present version agrees with the
Santiparvan version in making IJdka the giver of the boons, whereas in the
Arainyaka version this person is some ancestor of IJdka, either Boka’s father
or perhaps Bhrgu himself.

The mere mention of Bhargava Rama in B. 13. 14 . 273 at once calls
forth the reaction :

{50} trihsaptakrtvah prthivi yena nifyksatriya krtu j
Jamadckpiyena Govinda Rdfne^dkli^t(^karma^d || etc. (IX)

In adhy. 30 (of the Vulgate) we are told how a K^atriya Vitahavya was
made a Brahmin by the mere word of a Bhrgu. The story isl as follows.

Vatsa, a descendant of Saryati had two sons, Haihaya and T&lajahgha.
The hundred sons of Haihaya attacked and killed Haryasva, king of Ka^,
whose son Sudeva succeeded him on the throne. Sudeva was) likewise de-
feated and killed by the Haihayas. Sudeva was succeeded by Divodasa, who
built Vara^a^, on the northern bank of Ganges and the southern bank of
the Gomati. Likewise defeated by the Haihayas, he fled to his priest Bharad-
vaja, who obtained for him, through sacrifice, a son Pratardana. The son
of Divodasa defeated in turn all the Haihayas, when Vitahavya pursued by
Pratardana, fled to the hermitage of Bhrgu. When ^Pratardana demanded
from Bhrgu the surrender of Vitahavya, who was hiding in Bhrgu’s hermit-
age, Bhrgu in order to save the life of Vitahavya said that there were only
Brahmins in the hermitage. Through that declaration of Bhrgu, who could
not tell a lie, Vitahavya actually became a Brahmin. His descendants are
set out for fifteen generations. His son was Grtsamada, whose eleventh des-
cendant was Pramati : his son was Ruru ; his son was Sunaka, from whom
came the Saunakas.

In adhy. 40, Bhi§ma expatiates on the fascination and frailty of wo-
men, the root of all evil, and to support his statement he relates the story
of Vipula, another Bhargava, an interesting story in which mesmerism or
hypnotism plays some part (Vipulopiakhylana, adhy. 40-43 in the Vulgate).

The sage Devasarman, the story goes, had a beautiful wife Ruci (Beau-
ty) by name, who had attracted the attention of the gay king of the gods,
Indra. Once upon a time it so happened that Devasarman had to go away
from his hermitage on some sacrificial business. Not feeling quite sure about
his little Ruci, the old sage taking into his confidence his disciple, the Bhai-
gava Vipula, told him to protect his slender-waisted wife, especially against
the amorous advances of Indra, who was an adept at assuming different forms
at will. Deva^rman pathetically en-{51}-joined his disciple to take every
care and see that the lascivious king of the celestials did not defile that frivol-
ous wife of his, like a wretched dog licking the havis placed near the sacrificial
altar. To protect the virtue of Ruci, who was peerless on earth in beauty,
Vipula decided to enter into her by his yogic power and live in her without
her being conscious of it, until the critical moment was passed. Indra comes
as expected and makes overtures to the beautiful Ruci, who had captivated his
mind. Ruci, though anxious to reciprocate, remains externally indifferent
to the blandishments of Indra, through the influence of Vipula, who was
living within her and guiding her actions. Indra, puzzled by the behaviour
of Ruci, reflects and realizes how matters stand. At that moment Vipula
leaves the body of Ruci and re-enters his own body. Then Vipula faces the

philanderer and soundly rebukes him, and Indra slinks away abashed. Only
one man had been able to protect a woman and that was the Bhargava Vi-
pula (B. 13. 43. 27) :

tenaikena tu rak§d vai Vipulena kftd striydip |
ndnyak saktas triloke 'smin rak^tum nrpa ya^itam 1 1

This story was told by the Bhargava Markao<3eya to Bh!§ma (B. 13.
43. 18) and repeated by the latter to Yudhii^thira.

A few chapters later we have again a Bhargava story, the Cyavanopa-
khyiana in seven chapters (50-56), which is divided into two parts : the first
two chapters (50-51) illustrate the sanctity of cows, the last five deal really
with that topic of perennial interest, the mingled Brahmin and K§atriya pa-
rentage of the Bhargava Rama.

The first story, in which a cow was found to be the only equivalent
possible for the ransom of the sage Cyavana, may be passed over.

In the second story (adhy. 52-56), we come back to the anecdote of
Rama Jtoadagnya, and we have here practically a repetition of the explana-
tion given above (in adhy. 4 of this very par van) of the circumstances under
which Vi^vamitra, who was of mixed Brahmin and K§atriya parentage was
born in the K§atriya caste with Brahmanic qualities, while Rama under simi-
lar conditions was bom in the Brahmin caste with the oppo-{52}-site quali-
ties. The repetition comes about in this way. Yudhi§thira, whose curiosity
about the Bhargava Rama is, as already remarked, never satisfied, says to
Bhi§ma (B. 13. 52. 1 ff.) : '‘I have a great curiosity, O Lord, about Ja-
madagni's son Rama, that foremost of all righteous persons. You should
satisfy that curiosity. How was Rtoia bom, that tmly valorous hero? He
belonged by birth to a family of Brahmin sages. How did he become a
follower of K§atriyan practices? Relate to me in detail the circumstances
of Rama’s birth. Also how did a man bom in the family of the Ku§ikas, who
was a Ksatriya, become a Brahmin? Great indeed was the power of the
high-souled Rama afe also that of Vi^vamitra ! ”

The answer is given by Bhi^ma by relating the prophecy which had been
made by Cyavana, an ancestor of the Bhargava Rama. Cyavana wants to
prevent the harm that will come to his clan by Rama’s adopting the practices
of the K§atriyas, a danger of which he has prophetic knowledge. He repairs
to Kusika, through whose descendant the harm was to happen, in order to
vex him, and, if he finds a favouraible opportunity to pronounce a maledic-
tion on Kuiika, damning him and his descendants to eternal perdition. When
the sage presents himself before the king and says that he wants to observe a
certain vow while living in the palace with the king, he is warmly welcomed
with unfeigned joy, and also served with meticulous care and obsequiousness
by the king and the queen. The sage has a meal and he then sleeps for
twenty-one days, during which the king and the queen wait upon him with-
out food or drink, gently massaging his 1^. Suddenly the sage wakes

up and goes out, followed with trepidation by the king and the queen, and
as suddenly vanishes ! The king looks for in vain, and, returning in a de-
jected mood to the room set apart for the sage, finds him again, stretched as
before on his luxurious bed ! The sage practises many tricks of this type,
calculated to try the patience of the unfortunate couple, and ultimately yokes
them to a heavily laden war-chariot. During the drive through the city,
the sage gives the royal couple vicious digs with a heavy iron goad, distri-
buting all the while in charity the entire wealth of the king. Still the sage
finds no change in their behaviour. So in the end he has to {53} express
himself as satisfied with their treatment of him and he goes back to the
forest, asking the royal couple to come there on the following day. The king
and queen take a little rest for the first time after forty-two days of trial and
spend the night happily in each other’s company. The next morning the
king and the queen go to the forest to pay their respects to the sage and see
there a magnificent palace standing in a big park, a fair imitation of Indra's
paradise. After a short while, the magical palace and the park vanish, and
there sits in the solitude of the forest the sage who had yoked them to the
chariot and ill-treated them in other ways. Then the king feels that Brah-
mic power was the summum bonum of life. When he approaches Cyavana,
the sage gives him a boon. Kuiika wants to know why Cyavana had come
to live with him and what all those incidents implied. Cyavana tells him
frankly what his intention was and also prophesies that Kusika’s wish would
be fulfilled in so far that a descendant of Ku^ika’s (Vi^vamitra) would be-
come a Brahmin. Through the lustre of the Bhrgus, Kusika’s grandson
(Vi^vamitra) would be an ascetic endowed with the splendour of fire (B.
13. 55. 32) :

Bhrgunam eva tejasd ]
pautras te bhavitd vipras tapasvi pdvakadyutih ||

Then follows in the final chapter Cyavana’s prophecy about the persecu-
tion of the Bhtgus, about Urva (or Aurva), about Rdka, and Jamadagni,
who will marry Gadhi’s daughter, that is, Kusika’s grand-daughter. Of the
boons that will be given to the two ladies by Bhrgu, the exchange of the trees
and the earns by the mother and the daughter, about Visvamitra, and so on
and so forth. Incidentally it may be mentioned that this is the fourth oc-
currence of this interesting story of the birth of the Bhargava Rama, it hav-
ing occurred already at adhy. 4 of this very parvan, and ibefore that in the
iSanti (adhy. 48) and the Aranyaka (adhy. 115-117).

Some chapters later we again meet with the Bhargava Rama when
Bhi§ma tells Yudhii§thira about the merit of the gift of gold. The shades of
his ancestors had appeared to Bhi§ma and told him that the gift of gold
purifies the giver. Now it happens that the same advice had been given to
the Bhargava Rama by Vasi^tha and other sages. In this connection we
have again an {54} allusion to the extirpation of the K^atriyas and the con^

quest of the earth by Rama (B. 13. 84. 31) :

trifisaptakrtvafji prthivi krtd nihksatriyd pum 1

tato jitvd mahim krtsndm Rdmo rdjtvalocanah || etc. (X)

The next chapter (85), a long rambling chapter with 168 stanzas, deals
with the mystery, already alluded to above, of the birth of Bhrgu, Ahgiras
and Kavi. They are said to be prajdpatis and progenitors of many tribes
and clans, in fact of the entire mankind .

It will be a surprise to many that our sandals and umbrellas we also owe
to a Bhrgu. Chapter 95 relates how the practice arose of giving umbrellas
and sandals to Brahmins at srdddhas and other religiousi rites. Once upon
a time Jamadagni was amusing himself by shooting arrows at a distant tar-
' get, and his wife Renuka was fetching the arrows shot by him. Sorely afflic-
ted by the scorching heat of the midday sun, she rested just for a moment
under the shade of an umbrageous tree. Being kept waiting, the irascible
Bhrgu scolded his wife for her tardiness, but on learning the real cause of
the delay, wanted to shoot down the offending sun from his high position
in the heavens. The frightened luminary comes to him in the guise of a
poor Brahmin, who tries to dissuade him from carrying out his terrible threat,
but is recognized by the Bhrgu and reprimanded. In the end Jamadagni
is pacified and receives from the stm the first umbrella and the first pair of
leather sandals. To make a gift of them to Brahmins is highly meritorious.
This account of the origin of shoes and sandals is, I believe, not found out-
side the Mahabharata.

In adhy. 98 (of the Vulgate) we have a report by Bhi§ma of a discus-
sion between the Bhargava Sukra and Bali about flowers, lamps, aromatics,
appropriate to be offered to gods on diverse occasions and the merit accruing
from the presentation.

Above, while discussing the Dronaparvan version of the §oda;sarajaldya,
I had referred to palpable evidence of the “ bhrguization ” of a legend. We
have another illuminating instance of the process in the next story (adhy.
99-l()0 of the £55} Vulgate) told by Bhi^ma to Yudhi§thira. It is another
version of the well-known legend of Nahu^a’s fall from heaven.

Nahu^a, when king of the gods, neglected the daily offerings to the
gods including the bali, losing thereby some of his spiritual power. Subse-
quently, having oppressed the sages, he was hurled down from heaven and
turned into a boa by the curse of a Brahmin sage, Bhrgu.

A similar version of this legend occurs in the Udyoga (adhy. 11-17)
and is again alluded to in the Santi (adhy. 342) . There it is related that
Nahu§a became extremely arrogant and caused the sages to carry his palan-
quin. While being carried about in this way, his foot touched the head of
Agastya, who by his curse turned him into a boa. The defect in the cons-
truction of this n^Ve story is very obvious and must have been early noticed
by the diaskeuasts themselves. Nahu^a, by the terms of the boon which



EPIC STUDIES VI


321


Brahma and the gods had foolishly given him, could absorb the power of
any being on whom he set his eyes. Under these circumstances, even the
resourceful Agastya could not effectively curse Nahu^a, because Agastya,.
when kicked by the tyrant, being in full view of the other, was ipso jacto
deprived of all his spiritual power, like all the gods and sages who had been
oppressed by Nahusa and were utterly powerless before him.

The revised version of the legend in the Anu4asana stages beforehand a
confabulation between Bhrgu and Agastya. Agastya wants to damn Nahu§a
but does not know how to. Bhrgu befriends him and gives him the assurance
that he (Bhrgu) would somehow bring about the downfall of the tyrant,
Bhrgu, who knows beforehand, by spiritual prevision, that Nahusa was go-
ing to kick Agastya, proposes to Agastya, in anticipation of it, that on a
certain day he would sit hidden inside the matted locks of the sage and from
that position he would curse Nahusa. So when the opportune moment came,
Bhrgu, possessed of great lustre, addressed Agastya as follows : ‘‘ Do you
shut your eyes, Agastya, while I enter into the matted hair of your head ” .
Having said this, Bhrgu of unfading glory and great energy entered into the
locks of Agastya, who stood still like a wooden post. Soon after, Nahu§a
saw Agastya approached for being yoked to his chariot. Bhrgu, who was sit-
ting in the matted locks of Agastya, took £56} care not to look at Nahu§a.
Fully acquainted with the power which the illustrious Nahusa had acquired
on account of the boon which Brahma had given him, Bhrgu had acted thus.
Agastya though thus treated by Nahu§a did not yield to anger. Then Nahu-
vsa urged Agastya with his goad. The pious sage Agastya still did not yield
to anger. The lord of celestials, himself enraged at this pusillanimity, then
struck Agastya on the head with his left foot. When the sage was thus
struck on the head, then Bhrgu, who was sitting within the matted locks of
Agastya, became incensed and cursed the sinful Nahusa saying, “ Thou hast
kicked the head of the great sage, fall down therefore on the earth, changed
into a boa ! '' Thus imprecated by Bhrgu, who had not been seen, Nahu§a
forthwith became transformed into a boa and in that form dropped down on
the earth.

Yudhi^thira, who had heard a different version of the story from Salya,
as narrated in the Udyoga, maintains naturally a discreet silence about these
discrepancies and proceeds to question Bhi!§ma about some other matters on
which he wanted information.

Next, in the course of a long passage devoted to the praise of Brahmins,
showing that the Brahmins are mightier than even the gods, the story of
Cyavana is repeated (adhy. 156) .

Cyavana, who had been rejuvenated and cured of blindness by the As-
vins, had, as we have seen, promised them that they should drink Soma with
Indra and the other gods. The gods were wavering in their mind, but Indra
was adamant. He refused to accept the Soma libation in Cyavana’s sacrifice,

' This Uttahkopakhyana contains the last important reference in the Maha-
bharata to the Bhargavas, linking up with that in adhy. 3 of the Adi.

There are still a few more Bhiargava stories in the Mahabharata, the
consideration of which I had intentionally postponed and to which we shall
now turn.

We run into a nest of Bhargava legends, as a matter of fact, already ir
the fourth sub-section of the Adi, the Paulomaparvan, which have not been
discussed above.

The Mahabharata, as is well known, has two variant openings. In the
first (Adi. 1), when the Suta (or, according to some editions, Sauti) Ugra-
sravas, who is to recite the Mahabharata, presents himself at the hermitage
of Kulapati '^aunaka, during the twelve-year sacrificial session inaugurated
by the sage in the sacred Naimi§a Forest and offers to recite stories for the
edification and entertainment of the guests, the sages assembled there express
their desdre to hear the celebrated Mahabharata (1. 1. 18 f.) :
Janamejayasya yam rdjno V aisampdyana uktavdn |
yathdvat sa r^is tuUy^ Dvcdpdyandjfiayd ||
vedais caturbhiff. samitdm Vydsasyddbhutakarmanah j
sathhitdm sTotum icchdmo dharmydfk pdpdbhaydpahdni 1 1
The Suta accordingly commences with some mangala stanzas (1. 1. 20) :

£60} ddyath puru^am tsdnam puruhutam purustutam j

rtam ekdksaram brahma vyaktdvyaktam sandtanam | j etc.,
which are followed by a sort of prologue, which latter languishes and breaks
off somewhere.

In adhy. 4 of the Adi, we come upon another opening, whidi totally
ignores the first ! The Suta is re-introduced. The scene is the same, but
the programme is changed. Here the assembled sages do not themselves order
the entertainment, but ask the Suta to wait until the Kulapati iSaunaka
comes. When in the next chapter (5), the Kulapati joins the company, after
having duly performed his round of daily duties, he instead of asking the Suta
to narrate the Mahabharata, as the sages in the first instance had done, tells
him, strange to say, to relate first the history of the Bhargavas (1. 5. 3).
tatra vamsam ahath purvam srotum icchdmi Bhdrgavam |
kathayasva hathdm etdih kalydii sma sravane tava | ]

The Suta obediently proceeds to relate the history of that “ most illus-
trious family of the Bhrgus, which is honoured even by the celestials with
Indra, Agni and the Maruts"' (1. 5. 5). Here the Bhargava interest is very
clear and unmistakable. Accordingly eight chapters (5-12), which form the
Paulomaparvan, are entirely consecrated to an account of the wonderful deeds
of some of the Bhargavas, an account which is not even remotely connected
in actual fact with the incidents or characters of our epic. It is a digression
pure and simple, introduced with the very obvious object of glorifying the
Bhargavas and giving a permanent form to some of the Bhirgava myths and

legends. These chapters .are a short history of one special branch of the
Bhargava clan, represented by : Bhfgu, Cyavana, Pramati, Rum and Sunaka.
The significance of this branch and its connection with our version of the
Mahabharata will become apparent presently.

Bhrgu, a sage of almost mythical character, the eponymous ancestor of
the family, is here said to have been created from Brahma from the sacri-
ficial fire during Vamiia’s sacrifice (216*) :

Bhrgur mahar^ir bhagavan Brahmmd vai svayamhhuvd ]

Va^unasya kratau jdtah pdvQkdd iti nah srutam\\

£61} This interpolated stanza (found only in N) contradicts the statetnent
in the main body of the text (documented jointly by N and S) to the effect
that Bhrgu was born by piercing the heart of Brahma (1. 60. 40) :

Brahmaru) hjdayam bhittvd nihsrto bhagavdn Bhjguh 1
While Bhrgu’s wife Puloma was pregnant, the story continues (adhy. 5-6),
there came to Bhrgu’s hermitage, during his absence, a demon {rdksasa),
Puloman, who became enamoured of her and wanted to carry her off. To
make sure of his facts, however, the demon asked Agni whether she was
really Bhrgu’s wife. The fact was that this Puloma was first betrothed to
Puloman and afterwards given by her father to Bhrgu, and Puloman wanted
to have his Puloma back. On getting from Agni an answer in the affirma-
tive, the demon, assuming the form of a boar, carried her off. On the
way Cyavana is born. His lustre instantly reduces to ashes the demonic
ravisher of his mother and saves her from a very awkward predicament.
Puloma returns home safely with the baby. Bhrgu only learns of this inci-
dent after his return to the hermitage. Incensed at the outrage, he curses the
god Agni, whom he regards as the prime cause of the disaster, saying that
Agni would be an eater of all things, good and bad {sarva-bhaksa) .

There follows in adhy, 8 the story of Ruru, son of Pramati. Menaka
an apsaras, abandons her beautiful daughter near the hermitage of the sage
Sthulake§a. She is called Pramadvara. Pramati arranges her marriage with
his son Ruru, who has fallen in love with her. Shortly before the celebration
of their marriage Pramadvara is bitten by a venemous snake and dies, leav-
ing Ruru disconsolate. By the miraculous powers of his austere penance,
this Bhargava gives up half of his life to Pramadvara and revives her, and
ultimately marries her. Ruru takes a vow to destroy all the snakes in the
world, like Janamejaya before him, whose father Pariksit had died as the
result of a snake-bite. One day Ruru cotnes across a harmless old snake of
the variety known as 4m4ubha (adhy, 9), The snake begs to be spared and
so Ruru does not kill it. The serpent body only concealed the metamor-
phosed soul of a sage, who was suffering the effects of a curse pronounced on
him in a previous birth (adhy. 10). The £62} sage declares akimsd to be
the highest duty of a Brahmin. Janamejaya had once tried to destroy the
race of snakes by performing a snake sacrifice ; they were saved by the Brah-



326

min Astika (adhy. 11). Ruru subsequently hears the story of Janamejaya’s
snake sacrifice from his father Pranvati (adhy. 12). This story of the snake
sacrifice as told by Pramati to his son Ruru was repeated verbatim by the
Suta to saunaka and forms in our version of the Mahabhiirata the Astika-
parvan, the fifth sub-section of the Adi. (adhy. 13-53).

It will be noticed that from adhy. 4 to adhy. 12 of the Adi. a section
which, as already mentioned, is entirely concerned with the history of a
branch of the Bhargava clan, there is no mention of the Mahiabharata at all.
Nor is there, as a matter of fact, any mention of the epic in the immediate
sequel up to adhy. 53 of the Adi ! Only in adhy. 53, after having heard first
the Bhargava legends and then the story of the snake sacrifice (which had
been previously related by the Bhargava Pramati to his son Ruru), ^unaka
at last expresses the desire to hear the Mahabharata of Kr^ia Dvaipayana,
which v^as narrated to king Janamejaya by Vaisampayana in the intervals
of that snake sacrifice (1. 53. 32 f.) :

Mahdbhdratam dkyhdnnm Pdn^vdndm yasasharam j
Janamejayena yat prstah Krsna-Dvaipdyanos tada \ \
srdvaydmdse vidhivat tadd karmdntaresu sah |
tdm >aham vidhivat punydni srotum icchdmi vai kathdm j [

This completes our survey of the Bhargava, material in the Mahabha-
rata.^ But even this analysis does not give an adequate idea of the total
number of Bhargava references in the Great £63} Epic. The Bhargavas
regularly occur as static figures, along with other ancient sages, in the des*
criptions of martial combats, festive gatherings, state functions, council meet-
ings and all important assemblies. Outstanding incidents of their history
are frequently alluded to, briefly, even in the course of other narratives. The
names of their heroes are habitually introduced in similes and metaphors :
they are the standards of comparison iupamdna), to which everybody else
is compared, especially the epic heroes. Thus a man is praised by saying
that his intelligence is like that of Sukra. A waiTior is eulogized by saying
that in heroism he was the equal of the Bhargava Rama. Bhisma is once
praised by saying that he could not be defeated even by Rama. In other
places the valour and effulgence of Cyavana and Aurva are utilized for the
sake of a passing comparison. The devotion of Sukanya to her husband

1 The following sages should probably further be included among the Bhfgus :
( 1 ) a sage, mentioned several times in the Araijyaka ; a legend is told

about him in the Baladeva-tirthayStra (5alyaparvan) ; (2) G/tsamada, mentioned
briefly in the Anu^asana ; (3) Veda, who was the teacher of Uttahka and chaplain
of Janamejaya and Pau§ya ; (4) Paila, one of the pupils of Vyasa ; and (5) Math
davyay who curses Dharma in the celebrated story (updkhydm) of Animaijidavya
in the Adi. The part they play in our epic is small, and therefore they have been
ignored in this paper. Moreover, none of them, except Grtsamada, is actually called
a Bhargava in our epic. Sii-Kr^pa himstelf was distantly connected with the Bhar-
gavas, being a desteendant of Yadu, the son of Yayati by the Bhargava Devay-ani.

Cyavana has been made proverbial by constant citation. These details could
not be considered in the present paper for want of space.^

Retrospect

From the legends preserved in our epic it should seem that the Bhar-
gavas were a Brahmin clan, perhaps more intimately associated with the
ancient K§atriyas than most of the other Brahmin clans, being largely con-
nected with them by matrimonial ties. Thus Cyavana is said to have married
Sukanya, the daughter of king saryMi. Rqika had married Satyavati, the
daughter of king Gadhi of Kanyakubja and sister of the famous Visvamitra.
Jamadagni’s wife Renuka is likewise said to have been a princess by birth,
being a daughter of king Prasenajit of Ayodhya. The Bhargavi Dev^ayani
was moreover married to king Yayati : one of the very few pratiloma mar-
riages on record in Brahmanical literature." King Vitahavya had been adopt-
ed and made a Brahmin by a Bhrgu, and his descendants became Bhargavas.^
On the other hand some of the ancient Bhargavas seem to have come seri-
ously into conflict with the K§atriyas. The relations of Rama Jamadagnya
with the Ksatriyas are so well known and have been repeated above so often
that it is £64} unnecessary to dilate upon them here. But even in the case
of Aurva and Jamadagni, the epic has to relate conflicts with the Ksatriyas,
which have been alluded to above.

In these conflicts the Bhargavas are represented in our epic as irascible
sages, domineering, arrogant, unbending and revengeful. To our epic bards
they are at the same time omniscient and omnipotent. Supermen, who had
become so chiefly by virtue of their rigid austerities and the magical or spi-
ritual powers acquired by them. Owing to these occult powers, the Bharga-
vas were like gods walking on earth, or rather greater than mere gods.
Thus Bhrgu pronounces a curse on Agni — a god fervently lauded
and worshipped by the simple Aryans-— for no faults of his. He also cursed
(according to one version) Nahu:§a, who had been elected king of gods and
who had become arrogant and irreligious owing to this sudden elevation to
IX)wer. The wizard Cyavana paralyzed the arm of the recalcitrant Indra,
a high god of the Vedic Aryans. Jamadagni would shoot down the Sun,
another Aryan god. The Bhargava Uttahka, when about to curse 'Sri-Kr§'na,
the supreme god of the Bhagavatas or Vai^navas, was gently pacified by
the avdlara. The kings of the earth are of course like vermin before these
Bhargavas. The mighty Haihayas tremble before the infant Aurva, who
blinds them by his effulgence, and they have to beg for mercy on their bended
knees. King Kusika grovels at the feet of Cyavana and meekly submits to
all varieties of indignities for fear that the great sage might curse him.

1 Even these may be considered later, if a suitable opportunity presents itself.

EPIC STUDIES


Bhrgu, the eponymous ancestor of the Bhargavas, was one of the pra-
japatis. While the other prajapatis like Dak^a are said to have issued from
different limbs of Brahma, Bhfgu is represented as having sprung from
Brahma's heart, the noblest of the internal organs of man of god.^ In an-
other context in our epic, it is implied that Bhrgu was the greatest of the ma-
karris, though his name is not included even in the list of the famous Seven
Sages.

But the Bhargava most popular with our bards is surely Rama Jama-
dagnya. The bards love to dwell on his martial exploits, repeating them
whenever the slightest opportunity for it presents itself. The shadow of
this colossus overspreads the entire epic, excepting the short tale at the end
of the poem. In our epic he is not yet a full-fledged avatdra, but on the
high way to be ele-£65}-vated to that rank, surreptitious efforts being made
to make the epic document his divinity. He conquers the whole world, alone
and unaided ; such is the prowess of his fierce austerities. He frees the
earth of the burden of K§atriyas thrice seven times and makes the gift of
the earth to Kasyai>a, his priest, who divides it among Brahmins. Rama
fights even the enemies of the gods, with the same assurance and success,
enemies whom the gods themselves could not subdue. As the Bhargava
Rama is the perfect warrior {smvas^astrabhrtdm varah a phrase the bards
love to apply to him), three of the leading warriors of the Kaurava army—
Bhi§ma, Drona and Karoa — are said to have been initiated into the science
of arms by Rama Jamadagnya, though the latter according to the epic itself,
lived at the end of the Treta Age and the Kuru P^i>dava war took place at
the end of the Dvapara.

The epic contains a number of episodes {updkhydnas) relating to the
Bhargavas, such as, the Aurvopakhyma (Adi), Kartaviryopakhyana (Arai.i-
yaka), Ambopakhyana (Udyoga), Vipulopakhyana (;^nti), and Uttankopa-
khyana (Asvamedha), and so on. The entire Pauloma and a large section
of the Pau^ya two independent sub-parvans of the epic, are also devoted to
the legends of the Bhargavas. Besides these there are important discussions
and discourses attributed to some of the celebrated Bhargavas, such as the
Bhrgu-Bharadvaja-samvada, the Cyavana-Kusika-samvada and the Mar-
kai>deya-|samasya.

Another striking feature of these Bhargava legends in our Mahabh.^ 4 -
rata is the frequent repetition of these legends on different occasions in the
course of the epic. Thus the legend of Uttafika, the myth of the alterca-
tion between Cyavana and Indra, the story of Dropa’s obtaining weapons
from the Bhargava Rama, and the account of Karna’s pupilship under him,
is each told twice, in different contexts. The legend of the birth of Jama-
dagni and Rama is related in all four times. That the Bhargava Rama ex-
terminated the K§atriyas thrice seven times is mentioned ten times, in nearly

identical form {trihsaptakrtvali pjthivl krtd nif^kscUriyd purd, which appears
to have been a slogan of the bards) ; but the humiliation of the pride of
the K)§atriyas by the Bhargava Rama is mentioned about a score of times.

It is to be noted that the Bhargavas spring into this promi-£66}nence
all of a sudden in the Mahabharata. We look in vain for any reflection of
their phenomenal power and glory in the Vedic literature.^^ There the
Bhargavas are frequently alluded to as devoted to the fire-cult and they ap-
I^ear in the role of a group of ancient fire priests. They are said to have
procured fire for mankind. In the Battle of Ten Kings, the
Bhargavas are mentioned with the Druhyus. In many passages they are
associated with the Afigirases. The Atharvaveda is also known as BhrgvaiV
giras, and it seems certain that both the Bhrgus and the Angirases dabbled
a great deal in the black art and were feared on that account. That they
probably came into conflict with other clans and especially perhaps the K§a-
triyas is indicated by the fact that in the last-named Veda the name of
Bhrgu is chosen to exemplify the dangers incurred by those who oppress
Brahmins. The Siiijaya Vaitahavyas succumb as the result of an attack
on Bhrgu. 'The Aitareya Brahmaipa shows Bhrgu in a similar light.

Thus we see that the Vedic references give no ground for explaining the
eminence of the ancient Bhargavas implied by the epic account. These refe-
rences supply nevertheless rudimentary clues of ideas ahd sentiments which
were probably magnified in the imagination of the remote decendants of a
powerful ancient clan, influenced strongly by the cult of ancestor worship.
Thus, for example, the close connection of the Bhrgus with the fire cult may
ixirhaps serve to explain the part that Agni plays in many of the Bhargava
legends in the Mahabharata. The Cyavana-Asvins legend of the epic finds
some support in the statement of the Bgveda to the effect that the Asvins re-
juvenated Cyavana, making him “ acceptable to his wife and a husband of
maidens. ” The Brahmainas amplify this account. The connection of the
Bhrgus with the Atharvaveda explains the element of witchcraft in the
Bhargava legends of our epic, such as, for example, the revival of the dead
by the Bhargava Sukra, or the paralyzing of the arm of Indra by Cyavana
and of the creation of the monster called Mada, mentioned above. That tlie
Bhrgus had in some way championed the cause of Brahmins against other
clans is, as £67} already mentioned, supported by a reference in the Athar-
vaveda. Their intimate association with the Angirases implied in the Vedic
literature is reflected faithfully in many of the stories and genealogies of our
epic.

Taking a collective view of these Bhargava references in the Great Epic,
we cannot avoid the conclusion that the Bhargava heroes occupy a surpris-
ingly large portion of the canvas — ^which is said to depict the Bharata
War — ^filling up as they do much of the available space of the background.

EPIC STUDIES


And it is more than probable that if the epic is examined yet mqre minute-
ly, still further evidence of Bhargava material, hitherto undiscovered, will
be brought to light. Their myths and legends are uniformly distributed over
the entire extent of the Great Epic with the exception of some short and
unimportant parvans (10 and 15-18) at the end (comprising in all not more
than 2500 stanzas, a negligible fraction of the epic), books on vrtiich the aver-
age reader of the poem bestows but scant attention. The figures of the
Bhargavas have also been magnified to colossal proportions, painted with a
thick brush and in vivid colours. In short, the Bhargavas are represented in
our epic — ^the Mahabharata, the epic of the Bharata's or the epic of the
Bharata War— throughout as the people. How does that come about?—
** Cui bono ? as the Roman lawyer would have asked.

To imagine that all this fulsome eulogy liberally showered upon the he-
roes of the Bhargavas, and the interminable repetition of their stories and
legends are entirely unconscious — at least unintentional — ^and without any
ulterior motive, being just ordinary features of epic treatment, would be in-
deed naiVe.'^ In the first place, we have very clear and definite evidence of
the fact that our epic ha^ been consciously and deliberately expanded at
least in one instance : the surreptitious addition of a bunch of Bhargava
legends to the Kuru-Pajjdava epic in the shape of the so called Paulompar-
pan in the Adi which is entirely made up of Bhargava legends and has not
even the remotest intrinsic connection with the story of the epic.
Then we have equally clear and definite evidence of the tenden-
tious “ BhTguization of older l^ends, which occur in the epic itself in Iuh)
forms, one with and the other without some important Bh&rgava element, to
wit, the Stories of Sixteen Kings (Sodasarajikiya) and the Nahu§a-£68}
Agastya legend . We have also noticed that our Mahabharata contains t\\'o
variant openings, one of which is clearly inspired by a Bhargava,^ both for-

^ There isi only one explanation of the childish exaggeration and this repeated
mention on the annihilation of the Ki§atriyas by the Bhargava Rama. A deep
analysis of the motives underlying this (phenomenon) would suggest that these
fabrications are only a form of ‘over-compensation’, and endeavour to make the
Bhrgus feel important and * worth while’, after the disastrous blow to their ego-
ideals, It is the psychological revenge of the Bhrgus who were all but exterminated
by the K§atriyas. The slaughter of the Bhrgus admitted by the Bhrgus them-
selves in the Aurva legend deserves all the credence which unfavourable evidence
by a witness against one’s own self ordinarily does ; what the Bhrgus in turn (fid
to the K§atiiyas — namely, the annihilating the K§atriyas by Bhargava Rama 3X7
is known to us only from the account of the event from Brahmin sources. This
myth— the dream of the Bhrgus— is the sublimation of that intolerable inferiority
feeling . which had been repressed, but which was clamouring for expression.

? This was noticed by Holtzmann, Das Mahabharata, vol. 2 (1893), p.. 12.
'^Es liegt hier die Einleitung des Mahabharata der Bhargma vor, gerade wie im
Gesetzbuche des die Fassung der Bhargava sich eingedrangt hat”. He did

not follow, however, this fruitful idea any further, being misled by the immediate

tunately preserved by the coinservative instinct of the redactors, helped by a
process of conflation peculiar to the Mahabharata, which tolerates a close
juxtaposition of discrepant versions. We have further indirect testimony of
the effort made to connect some Bhiargava or other with the proi>agation of
the epic. We are thus told that it was the Bhargava Uttahka who instigated
Janamejaya to undertake the snake sacrifice at which the Mahabharata was
first publicly recited. Our Astika is that tale which was narrated to the
Bhargava Ruru by his father Pramati. And last but not least, we must take
account of the very important fact that the Kulapati saunaka himself, be-
fore whom the Mahabharata is said to have been recited by the Suta Ugra^ra *
vas, was also a Bhargava ! So when Saunaka says that he wants to hear
the history of the Bhargavas before anything else (1. 5. 3) :

tatra vomsam aham pur v am hotum kchdmi Bhdrgavam |,
the reason for this peculiar predilection of the host of the Suta! is very evi-
dent.

But it might be contended that we are unnecessarily emphasizing the
Bhargava element ; that the Mahabharata was or has come to be an encyclo-
paedia of Brahmanic tradition and it therefore contains also all the Bhargava
legends — in a slightly exaggerated form perhaps. The epic itself says (1.
56. 33) :

yad ihdsti tad anyatra yan nehdsti na tat kvacit [

That is undoubtedly true, to a certain extent. One can, however, easily con-
vince oneself that the diaskeuasts who boldly conceived the colossal idea of
converting the popular Epic of the Bharatas into the Encyclopaedia Brah-
manica, though generally catholic in their selection of Brahmanic legends and
doctrines, and eclectic as regards their religious and philosophical outlook,
yet they {69} were probably not entirely without their preferences and pre-
judices, and that they do not apportion anything like the same amount of
space and breadth of treatment to the myths and legends of other Brahmanic
families such as the Agastyas, Atreyas, Kai^vas, K^yapas, Gautamas, Va-
si§thas, and so on. The legends of these other families or clans are by no
means entirely ignored in our Mahabharata, but they are comparatively few
in number and hardly ever repeated. They appear like negligible details
on the vast canvas of the epic and are easily lost sight of in this colossal
accumulation of apparently most heterogeneous elements, which are all the
same carefully balanced so as to produce a more or less homogeneous impres-
sion. Very differently treated are the Bhargava legends in our Mahabharata.
To make any impression by the side of the titanic figures of the old epic like
BhS§ma and Karrja, Krgpa and Arjuna, the Bhargavas had to be magnified a
great deal and their legends, which were probably not so well known then

sequel. '' Unser Mahdhkdrata/* he remarks, kehrt aber sofort wieder zur ander-
^ en Fassung zuriick. In Folgenden erzahlt nicht Pramati den Ruru, sondem, wie
friiher, Ugrc^rmm dem Smnaka'*

EPIC STUDIES


as now had to be repeated. And we accordingly find that the legends have
been repeated, so often that the redactors themselves must have in time come
to believe in them ; and the figure have been magnified, so liberally that
they app>ear almost to eclii>se the heroes of the Great Epic itself.

Just for the sake of contrast, we might compare the other great epic
of India, the Ratnayanja, for Bhargava references. That epic also is a Brah-
manic epic, containing a host of Brahmanic legends and stories.
The result of his quest for Bhargava’ references will astonish the
reader. The references are remarkably few and extremely meagre.
About our Bhrgu, a viMuti of :§ri“KT§ha» the only thing recorded in
the Ramayaija is that his wife was decapitated by Vi§nu ! Cyavana has
been introduced in Valmiki’s epic only to narrate some stories. The solitary
reference to our Rama Jamadagnya {&arvasastrabhrtam varah) has been no-
ticed above ; it is the one in which he challenges Rama Dasarathi and is
worsted in the encounter ! We learn nothing more about Jamadagni from
the Ram^yaiija than the bald fact that he was slain by Arjuna Kartavirya.
Aurva, who as an infant had blinded the Haihayas by his effulgence, is not
mentioned at all, so far as I know. Comment is superfluous.

£70} Now there can be no question that all this Bhargava material in
our present Mahabharata is entirely foreign to the plan of the original saga
of the Bharatas, occurring as it does almost wholly in the episodic portion
of the epic. There should foe, therefore, in my opinion no hesitation in con-
cluding that in our version of the Mohabhdrata there is a conscious — nay
deliberate — weaving together or rather stitching together of the Bhdrala le-
gends with the Bhargava myths.

The question how precisely this Bhargava element, which we find con-
centrated mostly in the updkhyasnaSy came into the cycle of the Bharata le-
gends is intriguing, but unfortunately the answer is largely a matter of spe-
culation. Even according to the traditional view, it was not the work of Vyasa,
the reputed author of the Mahabharata, because the diaskeuasts have been
fortunately frank enough to admit that his work, the Bharata, which originally
consisted merely of 24,000 stanzas, had no episode to speak of (1. 1. 61) :
caturvimsatisdhasrtm cakre Bhdratasamhitdm j
updkhydnair vind tdvad Bhdratam procyate budhaih i]

It could again hardly have been the work of Vaiiampayana, the direct
pupil of VyaSa, according to tradition, who is said to halve recited the Bha-
rata of Vyasa, in the presence of Vyasa himself, as he had been taught by
his guru, during the intervals of the short snake Sacrifice celebrated by king
janamejaya.

The case was different with the next recorded recitation of the Maha-
bharata : it was by the Suta Ugra4ravas in the presence of the Bhargava
Saunaka during the twelve-year sacrifice instituted by the latter (1. 1. Iff;
4. Iff). Even before the recitation commences, iSaunaka explicitly asks the

333


Suta who had come there to recite his Mahabharata, to narrate first of all the
history of the Bhargavas and, as directed by his host, the Suta obediently
does sq. There is a very clear shifting of the centre of gravity. Here
we have a different milieu and a. different interest. The scene changes from
the bustling and scintillating pageantry of the Kaurava Court to the reflec-
tive calm and leisure of the sylvan retreat of the Bhrgus.

Few scholars, I imagine, would now be inclined to deny that our epic
text has undergone momentous alterations in the course {71} of its long and
eventful history. It is now generally recognized that the Bharata, like the po-
pular lays, ballads and early epics of all countries and all people, has always
been a fluid text, adjusted to the varying needs of the occasion and the differ-
ing tastes of the audience. No disp>aragement or condemnation of the text is
thereby implied. The process is quite normal, inevitable and in a wider
sense wholly right. To continue to be a vital force in the life of a progres-
sive people, the epic must be a slow-changing book. The fact of expurgation
and elaboration is only an outward indication of its being a book of inspira-
tion and guidance in life, and not merely a book lying unused and forgotten
on a dusty book-shdf. And this is no drawback in the case of our text.
Therein lies on the contrary its capital interest and importance for us. It
is a rapid motion picture reel of many ages of Indian culture— not necessarily
factitive history — arranged in a naive fashion : something like the sculptured
panels on the gateways and the railings of the Buddhist Stupa at Sanchi or
the mural frescoes of Ajanta, with scenes telescoped all in one plane, without
much regard to perspective or perhaps with its own peculiar technique of pers-
pective.

As already remarked, it seems probable that in the formative period of
the epic a powerful Bhargava influence — direct or indirect — ^has been at work,
so to say behind the scenes, in shaping our epic for us. This element had
obviously obtruded itself upon the original nucleus, certainly after the time
of the original author Vyasa and probably after that of Vaisampayana. The
next traditional link, however, in the transmission of the epic is the Suta. Is
the Suta then responsible for the conversion of the Bhlarata into the Maha-
bharata ? Now I do not doubt that some of the Sutas probably were gifted
versifiers, able to compose ex tempore short bardic poems and to improvise
lays to suit them to the varying tastes and requirements of the audience.
But if we consider these Sutas capable of composing on the spur of the mo-
ment such masses of narrative episodes and didactic discourses as we find in
our Mahabhfirata, we shall be asking these minstrels with an accomplish-
ment far beyond their natural capacity. Nobody is, however, so credulous
nowadays as to imagine the Suta as the author of those extensive innovation
that must {72} have been necessary in order to convert a heroic poem of about
24,000 stanzas (taking the traditional figure as a rough guide for our spe-
culations) into an encyclopaedia, of the present dimensions.

EPIC STUDIES


We are not in any case, as far as I can see, constrained to accept every
single statement of the epic in its exact literal sense. And when I say that,
I mean no disparagement either of the text ; far from it. Our epic does not
pretend to be a dry, prosaic, matter-of-fact chronicle, nor a statistical history
in the modem sense, based upon a laboriously compiled critical apparatus.
If it were that, it would surely not have lived for 2500 years. We have on
the shelves of our libraries hundreds of ponderous tomes and compendiums
of national and world history, prepared along approved lines by laborious
professors of history. But hardly anybody reads these works twice, and they
are mostly forgotten, in a generation or two, by an understanding and un-
grateful posterity. The Mahabharata never was a scientific chronicle of that
type and it would be egregious folly to regard it as such. It is above all
an inspired poem. It was actually regarded by later generations as a kdvya :

krtam mayedam bhagavan kdvyam pammapujitam |, '
the highest type of Indian poetry, like its sister epic, the Ramayapa. It was
before everything else a work of art, creative art, idealistic in conception,
informed with deep religious feeling, permeated by a conscious didactic pur-
pose, focussed more on ideas and ideals than on facts and figures, in which
people were not interested then so much as now ; a work in which a moral
was conveyed by a parable, an elusive truth by a tangible facile myth. And
to the inspired creators of a traditional book of that type we must at least
allow poetic licence and common imagination.

The entire story that the Suta had heard the epic at its first recitation
by Vaisarhpayana and reproduced it verbatim at Saunaka’s bidding, having
committed it to memory after a single hearing, is so obviously unnatural and
improbable that it seems clearly more appropriate to regard it merely as a
poetic fiction, a “ frame-story,'’ the most popular of Indian devices of literary
composition. But there is no symbolism without a basis, however difficult
it may £73} be for us to reach the elusive subconscious or unconscious. To
my mind, the frame-story of our Mahabharata is directly an unconscious
admission of the fact that the Bharata had at a critical stage of its evolu-
tion passed into the sphere of influence of the Bhrgus, through the medium
of the wandering minstrel. The Bhargava influence is implied in the person
of the Kulapati Saunaka. The Snta, who u^ to recite the poem in the
Heroic Age, is kept on, with due regard to traditional usage, to give the new
recension a setting appropriate to it and indicating the source at the same time.

The influence of the Bhargavas in the narrative portion of the Great Epic
is very evident and can hardly be disputed. But their influence in an en-
tirely different sphere, though less tangible and therefore more difficult to de-
monstrate, is to my mind nevertheless probable : I mean the incorporation
into the epic of large masses of didactic material, concentrated chiefly in the
iSanti and AnuSasana, especially so far as it concerns the Dharma and Niti
elements. Though the philosophy of the Mahabharata is often times rather



EPIC STUDIES VI

shaky, being in places abstruse and confused, and though the religious be-
liefs which find expression there are perplexingly eclectic, oscillating between
Vai§iDavism and Saivism, between Henotheism and Pantheism, there can be
no two opinions about the fact that the Mahabharata offers a very sound and
complete exposition of Dharma and Niti according to Indiah theorists, a
feature which has given this vaierable old monument of Indian antiquity
its rank as Smrti and its abiding value and interest to the Hindus, nay to all
true children of Mother India.

Now it happens that Dharma and NJti are just the two topics in which
the Bhrgus had specialized and with which their names are prominently as-
sociated. The connection of the Bhargava Sukra with NIti, which is prover-
bial in the Mahabharata, is so patent that it does not need to be especially
pointed out. The connection of the Bhrgus with the Dharma^stra is perhaps
not so well known, but is nevertheless equally certain. One has only to re-
call that, according to a tradition preserved in the work itself, our Manusmrti,
the most famous and popular of ancient Indian works bearing on the Dhar-
ma^astra, is the ancient Code £74} of Manu in the form in which it was
communicated to mankind by Bhrgu and is therefore even commonly known
as the Blifgusamhita, an explanation which I see not the slightest reason to
question or doubt. It is also recognized that there is intimate connection
between the Mahabharata and the Manusmrti. The Manusmrti, it may be
pointed out, has an introduction not unlike in conception to the first chapter
of our epic : a few stanzas agree to some extent even in their wording. The
opinions of Manu have been frequently cited in our Mahabharata {ity evarh
Manur abravU). According to Buhler's computation, there are about 260
stanzas of the Manusmrti, that is nearly 10 per cent, of the total, which are
again found verbatim (or with only slight vari^ions) in parvms 3, 12 and
13 alone of the Great Epic.^ Then on the side of the Mahabharata, Dharma
is the foundation on which the whole stately edifice of the Great Epic has
been reared, and to a great extent also the material of which it is composed.
Our Mahabharata is itself a dharmOtgrantha. The putative hero of the epic,
Yudhi§thira is called Dharmaraja, himself a son of Dharma ; he is Dharma
incarnate. The Bharata was a dhcnma-yuddha : yato dhmmas tato jayab^
The field of battle was a dharma-k^etra. Narayana incarnated himself
as Si^-Kr^na to restore the fallen Dharma. The essence of the book {Bhdra-
ta^sdvitri), embodying the moral of the story, is given as (B. 18. 5. 62 f.) :
urdhvabdhur viraumy esa na ca kascic chff^H me 1

336 EPIC STUDIES

The infiltration of masses of Bhargava material in the shape of Bhargava
myths and legends, the manner of its treatment, ahd even that strange admix-
ture of the Epic with the Dharma and Niti elements, which latter especially
has so long puzzled many inquirers into the genesis of the Mahabharata,
thus appear to find a simple and straightforward explanation in the assump-
tion of an important umtrny dmkeuasis of the epic under very strong and
direct Bhargava influmce. But this does not at all £75} imply that the text
has remained untouched after this first diaskeuasis ; far from it. Like all
traditional works, it was a slow-changing book ; and additions and alterations,
as already remarked, must have been made in it continuously throughout its
long history of about 2500 years.^

These further additions were in the main probably made in the first ins-
tance by the Bhfirgavas themselves in the centuries that immediately fol-
lowed) the first important diaskeuasis under Bhargava supervision, since it is
most likely that just as the different collections of Vedic hymns, the various
Brahmanas and the ritualistic manuals were all, for some time, the closely
guarded property of diverse Vedic schools and families of sages, which had
respectively cultivated and developed them, so also our remodelled Bharata,
now elevated to the rahk of the Fifth Veda, must have remained for some
time in the exclusive possession of the Bhargavas as their close literary pre
serve. That would, in my opinion, account for the apparent homogeneous
character of this heterogeneous mass : it all came from different hands, but
out of the same mould.

If the above considerations have any validity, they might help us to lift
up a comer of the thick veil enveloping our Great Epic and allow us to have
a covert peep into its history. Such a peep would show that there existed
in India, in very ancient tim^ an epic poem of about 24,000 stanzas, attribut-
ed to Vyasa (the ‘‘Expander'’), which described in great detail the Bharata
War and sang the glory of the P5ji?,davas. This heroic poem, the Bharata,
which used to be recited by the Sutas mostly at royal courts and had in
course of time become very popular, was at a critical stage of its history ap-
propriated by the Bhrgus (who had certainly specialized in the Dharma and
NitiSstra and probably also developed leanings towards Vi^puism), with the
idea of developing the epic into a vdiide of jxxpular instmction and edifica-
tion combined with entertainment. Theste anchorites, full of age-old wisdom

and wonderful masters of the art of inyth-weaving, took from the Sutas the
Bharata and gave back to the world the Mahabharata, the same book yet
different. In the process of the redaction by the Bhrgus, the work, naturally
and to an extent unconsciously, received that characteristic and inddiWe
stamp £76} which was predetermined by the eventful history, the natural
proclivities, the special endowments, and the peculiar ‘‘ Weltanschauung '' of
the Bhrgus. It was this little episode in its history that necessarily gave cur
poem the anomalous character of an Epos and “ Rechtsbuch coimbined. It
may be surmised that this remodelled Bharata remained for some consider-
able time in the hands of the Bhargavas, who had developed it and so to say
re-created it, as their exclusive literary property, and they exploited it there-
after and propagated it in their own way. The colossal success of the Bhar-
gava recension of the ancient Epic of the Bharatas, a success which in one
sense was richly deserved, was the indirect cause of the neglect and subse-
quent disappearance of the original heroic poem, which probably still existed
at the time of the composition of the Asvalayana Grhya Sutra (3. 4. 4).“^
Like other branches of the hieratic literature, when the epic at last passed out
of the hands of the Bhrgus and became the common property of the literati
of India, it still remained a fluid text, not entirely closed to minor altera-
tion and expansion, but retained its character as a traditional work, revered
and cherished by the people as the work of Mahar^i Vyasa and serving still as
a vehicle of popular education, fiispiration and edification as intended by
the Bhrgus. The further we pursue the study of the traces of Bhiargava in-
fluence on the Epic of the Bharatas, the clearer, it seems to me, will become the
history of our Mahabharata, the Great Epic of Bharatavar^a.

### The Oldest Extant MS. of the Adiparvan

Introductory^

A discovery of capital importance for Mahabharata studies is the accident-
al but singularly lucky find by Manyavara Gurujiu Hemraj Panditjiu, c.i.E.,
D.P.I., the well-known savant of Nepal, of a new Nepali MS. of the Adiparvan,
which according to the Panditjiu is between seven hundred and eight hundred
years old, and therefore easily the oldest extant MS. of the Mahabharata. It
was only a few years ago that I had remarked in the “ Prolegomena ” to the
Adiparvan : “ Only those who know the difficulties in the way of obtaining
any MS. from Nepal will be in a position to appreciate fully the debt which
the editor and the other members of the Mahlabharata Editorial Board, and
beyond that the whole world of Indolc^sts, owe to the Rajaguru. {202^

388 EPIC STUDIES

Sankritists have much to hope for from the dispassionate efforts of this truly
patriotic and cultured Rajaguru, who loses no opportunity of placing his im-
mensef learning and unbounded resources freely at the disposal of all serious
workers in the field of Sanskrit research How prophetic those words have
proved and how the Rajaguru has more than justified our expectations, is
manifested in the recovery of this singular old Nepali MS.

The MS., of which complete collations and specimen photos (reproduced
here in facsimile^) were kindly sent to me for my use by Rajaguru Hemaraj
Panditjiu, was recently acquired by him and is in his possession. The mate-
rial is palm-leaf and the writing, which is throughout uniform, is in old faded
ink. It contains only the first parvan of the Mahabharata, but is complete
in itself, there being no folios missing. The average folio measures
2r' X 2i" and each folio contains uniformly 7 lines of writing, except the
last folio, which has only 4i lines. The MS. is not dated but the high anti-
quity claimed for it is authenticated, apart from its antique look,^ by con-
vincing internal evidence. The best proof is that it is almost entirely free
from those modem accretions which are given in Appendix I of the Adiparvan
Volume, as also in great part from those other smaller insertions which are
listed in the foot-notes. More astonishing still is the fact that out of the
textual emendoHons hazarded by the editor, fifty per cent, are actually docu-
mented by this MS. It is therefore no exaggeration to say that this remark-
able MS, opportunely affords welcome* support to the Critical Edition in most
crucial matters. Moreover many of the variant readings of the new MS. are
diiflicult and obscure, marking out its text as distinctly archaic. And, finally,
in many of its readings it agrees fairly closely with a certain other MS. from
Nepal, which is symbolized as in the critical apparatus of the Adi, and
which is agmn the oldest dated MS. of the the Adiparvan. The tradition is
therefore fairly complete and well attested.

{2031 greatest value of this MS. lies, as hintedl already, in its cor-
roboration of the constituted text of the Critical Edition. Indirectly it
attests and justifies, as an independent witness, ^the principles according to
which the reconstruction of the epic text is achieved, thus placing the consti-
tuted text on still surer foundaticwis.

Long Insertions of the Vulgate.

Hitherto, it may be observed, the data of the Sarada and the “ K ver-
sions had mainly to vouchsafe for the purification of thel epic text attempted

1 The photographs are of the written surface of the first and last folios and
two intermediate folios (one of which latter is the penultimate folio of the MS.).

^ I have compared the script with the specimens reproduced in BOhlER's
Paleographtsche Tafeln. It comes closest to the script of Tafel VI, No. XI (Cam-
bridge MS. No. 1691 , 2 of A.P, 1179 ).

in the Critical Edition. Now, the omissions of the constituted text are sup-
ported from a new source and from an entirely different version, the Nepali.
Our MS. is in fact surprisingly free from most of the matter pronounced to be
spurious on the evidence of the then available MSS. of different versKMis. The
longer insertions given in Appendix I, are conspicuous by their abseiKe in this
MS. Here is a list of the l(Mig passages which are missing in the new MS.

Short Insertions of the Vulgate.

Like these long insertions our MS. omits most of the short insertions
given in the foot-notes to the constituted text. There are more than two



340


EPte stitoiES


thousand of such passages, the majority naturally from the Southern Re-
cension. The following instances, selected at random, of “ short ” passages
omitted by our MS. may be mentioned for the sake of illustration : 128*, 220*,
250*, 301*. 313*. 402*. 429*. 463*. 528*, 558*, 560*, 564*, 573*, 693*,
756*. 892* , 1001*, 1036*, 1038*. 1129*, 1131*, 1188*. 1242*, 1308*, 1312*,
1330*. 1331*, 1341*, 1365*, 1368*, 1377*, 1379*, 1444*, 1477*. 1492*,
1494 *, 1503 *, 1515 *, 1516 *, 1517 *, 1686 *, 1729 *, 1742 *, 1793 *, 1824 *,
1847*, 2132*.

These, it may be noted, are some of the many passages (extending from
three to tw^ty lines) which are found in all N MSS. (except K) — ^with or
without some S MSS. — but which are omitted by our MS. The following
omissions from among these deserve special notice :

128* : This is a passage of 72 lines, consisting of the longer version
of the contents of the Arapyaka-parvan, found in certain MSS. of the North-
ern Recension. It may be noted in passing that in its Parvasaihgraha chap-
ter, the new MS. gives throughout the shorter version, which has been adopt-
ed in the Critical Edition and which agrees with the version of this adhyaya
in P. P. S. Sastri’s edition of the Southern Recension.

560* : By omitting this, our MS. omits the reference to Pandu, found in
all N MSS, except those of the Ka4nfira Version.

£205} 693* : This is a passage of sixteen lines and contains the famous
couplet na jatu kamah kamdndm etc., recurring in many places.

892*' : This passage, occurring after 1. 89. 51, is found in all N MSS.
In the place where it is inserted there appears to have been a lacuna in the
origimd, filled up by the two recensions in different ways. In the consti-
tuted text the place is marked by asterisks.

1036* : Details of Brhaspati’s cohabitation with Mamata, wife of Uta-
thya and the godharma mentioned in that context, inserted in all N MSS.
exc^^ tSj Ro-2 ^1.3.

1341* : A passage of ten lines found in all MSS. except Sj K. It des-
cribes the approch of Droua to Rama Jamadagnya for the astravidyS.

1793* ; A passage of sevai lines found in all MSS. except Tj Gi.e e M.

These significant omissions, major and minor, prove that the text of our
MS. is shorter than that of all other MSS. hitherto known. Accordingly we
find that in the Parvasaimgraha chapter of this MS. the figure of the stanzas
for the Adi is given as 7784, which brings down the figure of the Vulgate by
eleven hundred and the figure even of the iSarada MS. by two hundred
stanzas ! It is however, curious that it apparently has the same number of
adhyayas as the Critical Edition viz. 225, while the Parvasaihgraha figure
for) the same is 218 both in this MS. and the Critical Edition. In other
words in differing from its own Parvasaihgraha figure, our MS. exactly agrees
with the critical text ! The number of adhyayas in the Vulgate, it may be
noted, is 234, while tiiat of the Southern Recension can be computed to ex-



EPIC STUDIES VII 341

tend to about 250 adhySyas. On the other hand, the number of adhyayas
in the Kumbakonam edition reaches the astonishing figure 260 !

Small Infltralims.

Even though our MS. is appreciably shorter than any other MS. of the
Adi so far known, we cannot indeed suppose it to have been absolutely free
from inflation and contaminafion. This MS. has in fact just a few inser-
tions not countenanced by the Critical Edition. For instance :

{206} App. I, No. 12 : The first three lines of this passage (of sixteen
lines) are substituted in our MS. in place of 1. 19. 1-2. This substitution is
common to 5)3 also ! The passage is characteristic of all N MSS. except those
of the KasmSii Version.

App. I, No. 33 : This passage is found in all N MSS., the Kasmiri Ver-
sion showing variation only in sequence. The passage is inserted after 1.
56. 31, and is a continuation of the eulogy of the Mahabharata, serving as
    an introduction to that redaction of the epic which begins with the episode
    of Uparicara. Here our MS. agrees with in omitting lines 3-11.

App. I, No. 58 ; This passage also is a common heritage of all N MSS.
It describe how Surya, when invoked by Kunfi, presses her to have sexual
intercourse with him.

Besides these major additions, some insertions from the footnotes to the
constituted text have filtered their way into our MS. The number of such
passages is not very large, being about ninety, and they consist mainly of
single lines. These are the passages in question : 90*, 220*, 288*, 291*,
476*, 478*, 479*, 485*, 494*, 495*, 549*, 601*, 678*, 708*, 709*, 710*,
750*, 868*, 873*, 875*, 879*, 903*, 906*, 909*, 962*, 999*, 1004*, 1013*,

1017*, 1018*, 1022*, 1068*, 1087*, 1096*, 1104*, 1110*, 1120*, 1124*,

1141*, 1142*, 1144*, 1146*, 1148*, 1155*, 1162*, 1166*, 1173*, 1178*,

1186*, 1196*, 1212*, 1219*, 1224*, 1230*, 1240*, 1305*, 1309*, 1357*,

1430*, 1436*, 1463*, 1470*, 1623*, 1644*, 1665*, 1698*, 1786*, 1789*, 1796*,
1812*, 1815*, 1818*, 1855*, 1882*, 1883*, 1919*, 1920*, 1921*, 1922*, 1951*,
1953*, I960*, 1975*, 2016*, 2087*, 2097*.

All these insertions are uniformly met with in all N MSS., or at least in
the majority of N MSS., and not a single one of them is sporadic.

An insertion of a single stanza from the yaddsrausam section (adhy. 1)
is the only unique insertion in this MS.

Conflation of Mahdbharata texts.

Here we may note, in passing, the light this MS. sheds in an indired:
way (Ml how the text gradually gets inflated. At several places we find addi-
tions malde marginally by another and a later hand. For instance, after 1.
5. 26, we find a marginal insertion of two lines etc., which is

taken from a passage {207} of ei^t Tines f(Mind in all N MSS. (except Ko.i
Dj). Again, after 1. 19. 15 we have a marginal addition of two lines



342


EPIC STUDIES


etc., of which the first line is merely a variant of a line

included in our text, but the second is an additional ” line found chiefly

in late Northern MSS. of the Central Group. It is clear that the copyist of
such a MS. as this, without further investigation — which of course is not his
business ! — cannot determine whether the lines added in the margin belonged
to its origial exemplar, or whether they were taken from some other source.

It is not the custom of the copyist to be very squeamish about such things.

He copies whatever he finds before him, provided it makes sense and has
something to do with the epic. It is thus that the corpus has got gradually
inflated to its maxirrtum capacity. Cf. the example of cited in the Adi-
parvan Volume (Prolegomena, p. xii).


Minor Readings.

Let us now consider the individual readings of our MS. Here also the
agreement of this MS. with the constituted text is quite remarkable. That
it cannot and must not be expected to have complete agreement with the
constituted text is only obvious ; like all other Mahabharata MSS., it also
represents a particular version of the epic, and nothing more.

Our MS. shows in point of readings the greatest agreement with MSS.
of the Nepali group : quite naturally, as it is written in the same script and
belongs to the* same provincial version. In particular, its agreements with
the best and the oldest MS. of the Nepali version belonging to our appa-
ratus, are unique and striking. The total number of variant readings in our
MS. amounts approximately to a little more than 2500. Out of these’, its
unique agreements with N 3 (or in a few places along with one or two other
MSS.) against all other MSS, count over 500. This shows that our MS. de-
finitely belonged to the Nepali version, and is not a copy of a MS. of the
Sarada or ‘‘ K '' version — a. very important point — ^though it has marked
affinities in many a place with the latter groups. Here are appended about
sixty instances, chosen at random, as specimens of the agreements of

our MS. with

Here it is necessary to emphasise the curious circumstance that while the
new MS. is almost on a par with 1^,3 in* respect of individual
readings, it is far superior to N 3 in so far that it lacks about ninety per
cent, of the insertions which Rg has in comhion with the Vulgate, that is to
say, the Bengali-Devanagari group. It thus gives its welcome support to
the Saradia-K group and our Critical Edition as regards that large mass of
passages in which £209} these texts are lacking. It may be incidentally re-
marked that iSfg is relatively purer than the other two Nepali MSS. and occa-
sionally has definite leanings towards the iSarada or Kasmiri version. These
additional passages in MSS. like f^g, we may reasonably infer, were gradu-
ally added by the epic artists, who worked out the details and filled in the
lacunae of this colossal composition. There must have been a free give-and-
take of these passages in the extensive comparisons of different manuscripts
of the* epic text at holy places and centres of pilgrimage and seats of ancient
learning. Beginning in the lowly way of marginalia and sodkapatras, these
additions must have got embedded in the text, through their transmission
from copyist to copyist, undergoing in this process a strange variation of de-
tails.


In a small percentage of cases, our MS. shows, it must be admitted,
readings documented mostly by Southern MSS. — ^with or without support of
a few other N MSS. It is naturally the most difficult thing in the world to
decide in these cases whether this sporadic agreement is due to late contami-
nation or to primitive connection through the lost archetype. In the light
of such variants, some readings of the Critical Edition will have to be recon-



344


EPIC STUDIES


sidered, and it may, in sporadic cases, be found necessary even to alter slight-
ly the readings of the Adiparvan in the Critical Edition. That work must
however be left over now for further research by a future generation of
scholars.

Unique Readings.


Like all MSS. modern or ancient, our MS. has quite a large number of
unique readings, that is to say, readings which have not been found in any
MS. so far collated for the Critical Edition. They consist of variants of pro-
per names, consciously or unconsciously manipulated ; synonyms or paraph-
rases ; and sometimes of, mere transpositions of words and phrases ; or even
insignificant variants of expletives and verse-filling particles. In a few ins-
tances the variants are obscure and archaic, but generally weak and incon-
sequential as compared to the readings of the Critical Edition. The Maha-
bharata problem is made a problem of problems and a problem sui generis
by the amazing diversity of MSS. in all imaginable details ; and our MS. is
not £210} behindhand in liberally contributing to this diversity. Here I
specify a few samples of unique readings of the new MS. :

Our Emendations.

Now we may turn to what is perhaps the most surprising feature of our
MS. That is the support our MS. affords to the constituted text of the Cri-
tical Edition, with regard to the emendations attempted therein. It is re-
markable to find that this single MS., which is certainly older than any of the
MSS. we had before, supports and confirms, as already remarked, fifty per
cent of these emendations. Out of the total of thirty-six emendations £211}
made in the Critical Edition the following eighteen are corroborated by our
MS :


30.7 ^ ( hyper-

metric ! )

37.10 M

51.8 ( hia-
tus )

57.20 ^ ( hiatus )

224.5 ( hiatus )

224.9 mflit t


Now, even though these emendations were put forward more as a hypo-


thesis than as a dogma (Prolegomena p. xciv), they have evoked severe cri-


ticism from certain scholars. It will therefore be advisable to consider here


some of these criticisms in the light of the readings of our new MS.

Professor A. B. Keith, in his review^ of the Adiparvan, admits that,
“ the editor has quite justly relied often on the maxim that the more difficult
reading is to be preferred to the simpler, since it is easy to explain the latter
as correction of what was poorly understood by careless scribes ”, but con-
tinues, we need not, therefore, accept as a necessarily correct theory the view
that we are to restore hiatuses, whenever we find variants in the MSS., which
might be explained by assuming that they are the different efforts made by
scribes, who were not accustomed to hiatus to remedy the irregularity”.
Whether the said view represents a correct theory of Mbh. text-reconstruc-
tion or not may be best judged from the circumstance that out of the eighteen
emendations which are actually documented and attested by this new MS.,
not less than thirteen were made just on the ground of £212} hiatus ! A
glance at the above list will convince the reader of the truth of this contention.


Stanza 1. 71. 36 in which there is an emendation is unfortunately omitted
in the new MS.

EPIC STUDIES


In all these thirteen instances there are violent fluctuations in the MS.
readings. These uncommon fluctuations pointed towards the possibility, which
this MS, has turned, into a certainty, that they represent more or less inde-
pendent attempts at correcting some solecism to which the scribes, editors or
commentators would naturally take violent objection. It is natural to infer
that this solecism is thej hiatus to which a steadily increasing antipathy is
noticeable as wd pass from the earlier to the later Sanskrit literature. It is
well-known that Vedic texts frequently contain hiatus which does not cause
any serious offence to the susceptibilities of the tnodem reader, but the same
hiatus in the work of a poet of the classical period would be rated as a capi-
tal blunder. The view of Hopkins (which Prof. Keith endorses) to the
effect that there is nothing peculiarly epic in hiatus, and that it is found in
precedent and subsequent poetry, is quite non-committal, and, if anything,
favours our position. The point at issue is the legitimacy of the hiatus in
the subsequent literaturq and not merely its occurrence. It is quite legiti-
mate in the earlier literature, but comes to be progressively regarded as a
solecism and therefore is an anthema to scribes bred and brought up in the
classical tradition. It is no doubt carelessness only, as Prof. Keith observes,
in the later stages of the growth of Sanskrit literature, but not necessarily so
throughout its history. Prof. Keith himself has not much faith in his own
scepticism and consequently much of his criticism loses point, as he concedes,
though reluctantly, the validity of certain restorations of hiatuses.-

Prof. Keith has altogether missed the significance’ of the variation of
MSS. between particles like, hi, ca, tu, vd, in these instances of emendations.
It is true that these particles show great variation from MS. to MS., as is
only natural in the corpus of a fluid text. But the scribes did not go out of
their way to vary the text and to replace deliberately one particle by another.
Often enough these small particlds are very instructive in determining the
complex relationship of MSS. Our present MS for instance, agrees with
55^3 scores of times in the choice of just {213} these particles against all other
MSS. But we need not press the point too far. It is sufficient to note that
the variation is not as arbitrary as it might at first sight appear. Moreover,
it is easy to undeTstand that these small particles do come in very handy
whenever the question of avoiding a hiatus arises and can be sandwiched
between the vowels without disturbing tfie metre.^ This is clearly the sim-
plest and most natural mode of avoiding the hiatus and explains the violent
fluctuations of the text. That it is not the only mode of avoiding the seem-
ing blunder hiay be seen from 1. 57. 20 kriyate ^*ucchrayo ntpaik, where T G
have entirdy recast the pada, changing it to : kurvanty ete dhv<ijocchrayam.


1 Cf. Hopkhns, The Great Epic, p. 199 f. : “ In both metres, to avoidUfttus,
irrational particles are often inserted. A good example is : purS krta5mge tata hy
asid laja hy Akampanah, vii, 2,029, where B., 52, 26, omits the first hi



EPIC STUDIES VII , 347

So the proof of an original hiatus does not always rest upon a mere variation
of particles, as Prof. Keith thinks.

Prof. Keith starts from the conviction (which is quite a priori), that
if at all a hiatus occurs, it must occur either between the padas where the
absence of sandhi is natural ; or else before a vocative, where it is easy to
feel a natural pause. He doefe not grudge the restoration of hiatus in 1. 99.
15 ; 103. 5 ; 110. 20 ; 119. 11 etc. on these grounds. In 1. 57. 20 kriyate
"^'ucehrayo nrpaih and 1. 100. 2 nisUhe dgamisyati, he haltingly admits the
validity of the restoration of hiatus and tries desperately to defend it on
grounds of metrical facility. He is adamant, however, when it comes to —
what he styles — unmotived hiatus. He has exemplified his scepticism in
the following instances.

In 1. 147. 2 he considers roramthas tv mdthavat as more legitimate.

Proceeding further, Prof. Keith says that it is very difficult to believe in
1. 207. 17 kule asmin habhuva ha : since such a hiatus as this is “ unmotived
        He can, however, easily persuade himself to believe that “ the sambabhuva
        of a large body of MSS. was erroneously curtailed to babhuva with the result
        that kule '^smm had to be extended ” !

In 1. 119. 11 tathty ukte Ambikayd, the position according to Prof.
Keith is uncertain ” ; tv may be right before Ambikayd,

£214} In 1. 98. 8, antarvatm aham Bhrdtrdi may be explained, in the
opinion of Prof. Keith, by emphasis ; but it is quite probable, he adds,
that “ tv is original, ty would be a blunder for it and hy a correction

1. 224. 5, samtapyamdnd abhito is quite ‘‘ needless according to Prof.
        Keith. The MSS. suggest, according to him, samt\apyamdmn as “clearly
        correct “ Misunderstanding of the accusative we are told, “ as follow-
        ing on the previous line has led to the mere corrections samt\apyamdnd bahu-
        dhd or purato

In 1. 157. 13, pahcakrtvas tvayd uktaJi ** seems unmotived and the vari-
ants of the MSS. hardly justify it

Prof. Keith calls 1, 110. 28, yadi dvdm mahdprdjna, “very dubious”,
and in 1. 51. 8, atho Indral} svayam evdjagdma according to him is “ not at
all certain ”.

1. 214. 9. is an interesting case. The pada in dispute reads Dharmardje
           *atipfityd, which is an emendation. It was first criticized by the late Prof.
           WiNTERNiTZ as being “ really unnecessary ”. A reply was given to his cri-
           ticisms in these Annals by me and I have devoted three pages of the journal
           (vol. 16. pp. 108-110) to explain the circumstances which, in my opinion,
           necessitated the emendation. Prof. Keith was left unconvinced by these
           arguments. Rejecting this explanation, he dogmatically lays down : “in 1,
214. 9, Dharnmdje hy atipAtyd should be read ; the variant tv is normal,
     and the hiatus is unmotived ”,

Now that most of these unmotived, needless, dubious, illegitimate, un-



348

necessary hiatuses are actually documalted and are no longer merely my con-
jectures, I am intrigued to know what hidden motives Prof. Keith will dis-
cover in them in order to explain their occurrence in an authentic MS. in the
possession of the Rajaguru of Nepal.

It is( sad that Professor Winternitz should not have lived to see some
of his doubts about the readings of the constituted text finally dispelled by
the evidence of this MS. The discovery of this valuable MS., so consequent-
ial for the text-criticislm of the Adiparvan, would certainly have delighted the
heart of this veteran scholar, who took a passionate and life-long interest in
epic studies. The text of the Critical Edition objected to in the £215} fol-
lowing places by thd late lamented Professor Winternitz is supported by

### The Rama Episode (Ramopakhyana) and the Ramayana

Sluszkiewicz’s elaborate dissertation^ on the recensions of the Rema-
yaoa has revived the interest in the question of the relationship between
the Ramayaija and the Rama Episode of the Mahabharata, a question
which appears to have been first mooted by Weber.^ Weber had contented
himself with formulating the four logical alternatives : (1) the Ramopa-
khyana is the source of the Ramayaipa ; (2) the Ramopakhyana constitutes
an epitome of the Ramayaiia, but of a Ramayajiia more primitive than the
epic in its present form ; (3) the Ramopakhyana represents an epitome of
the Ramayana, but an epitome nxxlified somewhat by the compiler of the
Episode himself ; and lastly ; (4) the two poems are derived independently
from a lost common source. The alternatives worked out by Weber may
be admitted ; but then logical possibilities, unfortunately, do not carry us
very far in historical investigations.

Jacobi, who has dealt with the question at great length in Das Rama-
ya^a, Geschichte und Inhalt (Bonn 1893), held firmly to the opinion that
the Ramopakhyana was based on the Ramayaiia, on our Ralmayana, on the
Rama Epic as we have it, — the episode forming a rather careless abridgment

of Valmiki’s epic (op. cit. p. 70). In discussing the question he has drawn
attention to certain passages in the Ramopakhyana which presuppose a
knowledge of the Ramayana, and which would be indeed unintelligible if
the reader did not know certain facts and circumstances which were detailed
in the Epic but omitted in the Episode. This argument {473} seems to be
not quite as sound as it appears at first sight ; because, for the allusions
in question, the compiler of the Episode might haVe been indebted to any
other source or sources which likewise contained those explanatory allusions
which happen to be omitted in the Episode. The allusions do not point
unequivocally to any one single definite source.

But Jacx)BI did not of course base his case on this fact alone. He
strengthened it from another side. He pointed out (op. cit. pp. 72 ff.) about
a dozen pa!ssages which the Episode had in common with the Epic. These
parallelisms carry naturally far greater weight than the allusions mentioned
above. Exact verbal agreement between the works of two poets, even though
they may be working on the sa!me theme, are always suspicious. The
human mind is not easily duplicated. Sinular ideas may arise independ-
ently : but the words in which they become clothed are still something per-
sonal and characteristic, varying with each individual.

Jacx>bi attached special importance to one particular stanza in the
Episode,-— a veritable doggerel which, (according to Jacobi) was evidently
a copy of the perfect Ramayaipa stanza — once heard never forgotten

The Mbh. caricature of this stanza, according to Jacobi, was :

Jacobi was of opinion that this statiza of inferior form proves borrow-
ing because it is inferior. This unquestionably proved also, Jacobi argued,
that the Episode is merely an epitome of our Ramayania. The argument
is again not quite conclusive, and the point has been contested by Hopkins.
“ A great poet/’ says Hopkins, “ is more apt to take a weak verse and
make it strong than is a copyist to ruin a verse already excellent” (Gteat
Epic, p. 63). Whatever the merits of this latter contention, Jacobi’s con-
clusion appears to be correct in the main, though his argument is certainly
fallacious. Jacobi should have stopped short with the stanza. The Maha-

bharata stanza appears to be — ^and very probably is — a weak £474} imita-
tion of the Ramayaina stanzal. The fallacy lies in the extension that the
Ramopakhyana is therefore a weak imitation of the Ramayaaja. The rela-
tion between the two stanzas does not necessarily prove an 5 dhing about the
relationship between the Ramayana and the Ramopakhylana as u/iholes.

WiNTERNiTZ^ has already warned us that each stanza of The Mbh. must
be judged on its own merits, — it may be added, whm we wanti to use^ the
stanza for historical and compctraiive purposes. We could not find a better
example of this dictum than the stanza on which Jacobi has relied for
establishing the posteriority of the Ramopakhyana. The stanza has an
intricate history. Though found in all our old printed editions, the MS.
support for it is surprisingly meagre. Of the two lines comprising the stanza,
the second was found only in Bengali MSS. in addition to some stray Nagari
MSS. ; but the first line is itself known in two variant versions ! The form
known to and cited by Jacobi, namely,




alternates with alnother :




which appears to be an attempt at remedying the awkwardness of thei for-
mer, which was the subject of Jacobi’s strictures.^ Both lines are however
completely missing in Kaimlrt and Southern MSS, {besides many old Nagari
MSS .^) ! This fact leaves no room now for doubting that the stanza in
question is but a very late addition to the Great Epic. It can therefore
naturally prove nothing whatsoever about the age or the character of the
original Episode to which it has been secondarily alppended by a recent
interpolator. All disquisitions based on this stanza from the Ramopakhyana
have consequently become futile. We must look for other criteria.


This only shows how very precarious are the conclusions that are based
on the Vulgate text of the Mbh, And it is very remarkable that many of
those very passages that have been used in the past lot literary-historical
purposes have turned out to be unhappily but also unquestionably spurious.^

H. Oldenberg to illustratel his Akhy^a theory. It is well known that Oldenberg
always maintained that the oldest foim of epic poetry in India wa^ a mixture of
prose and verse, the speeches being in verses, while the events were narrated in
prose. In this coimection he drew attention to the story of Sibi in the Vanaparvan

(475} However the fact that one pairticular stanza cited by Jacobi has
turned out to be unauthentic does not affect his gaieral conclusion about
the relationship between the Ramop^yiana and the Ramayana which, in
my opinion, is quite wdl-founded and can be supported on other grounds.

As far asi I cata judge, the minute differences in the details of the story,
which have been pointed out and exaggerated by some critics of jACOBrs
theory, tell us nothing whatsoever about the matter which is the subject of
discussion. The verbal agreements have, on the other hand, an unusually
great probative force. To strengthen the case of Jacobi, we need therefore
a large nuirber of agreements, I had this fact in mind when I was stud 5 ring
the Ramopakhyana for my edition of Vanaparvan or — ^to give it its correct
name — ^AraDyakapaWan.

Jacobi had found just twelve concordances. They are obviously too few.
But their actual number should be very much greater, even if we exclude
the epic iterata and standing phrases, which are the comimon heritage of the
epic bards and which have been listed separately by Hopkins in an Appendix
to his Great Epic, It would be premature, it seems to me, to discuss the
question which of the existing versions of the Ramiayaii>a our Episode stands
closest to. That question can be taken up only when we have a really criti-
cal! edition of the Ramayaija, which is promised by my friend and colleague
Professor Raghu Vira of Lahore from his International Academy of Indian
Culture. In the meantime, I shall just register the concordances which I
have been able to find, irrespective of the versions of the Ramayapa to
which they may belong.^ A scholar who knows his Ramayajoa better
than I do would naturally be able to handle the question with more com-
(476}petence and find more concordances. But in the absence of such an
exhaustive study by a savant who has mastered both the poems, the follow-
ing table which I have prepared may be found useful. I have consulted
only the Bombay edition (published in 1888 by the Nimaya Sagar Press)
and Gqrresio’s edition (1843-1867). Of the latter edition, moreover, the
last volume (Uttarakaijda) was not available to me and therefore could
not be utilized.


bharata, p/ 23) regarded as a survival from the oldest form W our great epic can
now on manuscript authority be proved to be one of the latest interpolations in
the epic. We are not concerned with the date of this passage. The passage may
jbe of hoary antiquity — ^though I doubt it personally — , but it certainly never formed
a part of the Oldest strata of the Mahabharata : that much we can xk>w say with
confidence. * One sees how even a scholar like Oldenbeko can make abysmal
blunders in the estimarion of the age and character of passages of the Mah^bhkratav
^ I must adcnowl^e here the help I have received from Mr. M. V. Vaidya,
and Pandit KaiSHNAMURtt Sabiri, two of my a^stants in the Bhandarkar
Oriental Research Institute, in tracing out and iifentifying the parallel passages

This cannot be considered as an exhaustive list.^ In fact I must 
frankly confess that my study of the Raniayaioa has been rather {487} per- 
functory, and moreover it is difficult to identify passages in a work like the 
Ramiayana’ in the absence of a verse-index. A closer study of the Epic and 
Episode, I am confident, would result in the tracing of many more paraWhsm^ 
in diction and phraseology. I must here add that I have intentionally ex-

eluded such passages as show merely parallelisms in ideas, and I have strictly 
confined myself to exact verbal similarities. The greater the number of such 
verbal similarities the weaker becomes the case for Hopk^s. He, relying 
on the many minor differences in detail, argues that the fact that the subject- 
matter of the Epic and the Episode is^treated differently in several particulars 
points to different workings-over of older matter rather than to copying or 
condensing'* (Hopkins, op. cit. p. 63). Hopkins loses sight of the fact that 
differences like those pointed out by him do not prove anything in such cases. 
Differences are! natural and may be expected ; nay, they could scarcely be 
avoided — as far as I can judge— when one is condensing a work of about 
26,000 stanzas. But ajgreements in the bulk can never be casual or acci- 
dental ; they show invariably identity of source. And the source, as already 
pointed out by Jacobi,^ was not a manuscript of the Ramayaina, but a memo- 
rized version of it, current in the time of the adapter and in his locality. Then, 
I expect, the compilers of such works could hardly avoid the influence from 
oral tradition which existed then. In this restricted sense we nxist under- 
stand the statement that the Ramopakhyana is an epitome of our Ramayana, 
a fact which we may regard as established on account of the numerous verbal 
agreements which have been shown to exist between the two poems.*

## ARJUNAMISRA 

A commentator of the Mahiabharaita who has suffered undeserved neglect 
at the hands of scholars and publishers alike is Arjunamisra. Not only is 
Arjuna's commentary better than that of NJlakaii^itha, his text also is supe- 
rior, in many respects, to that used or fixed by the Western commentator. 
And yet Arjuna’s Dtpikd has never been published in its entirety^ and, being 
difficult of access, is seldom consulted by scholars. Holtzmann has devoted 
a paragraph to him in his compendious work Das Mahdbhdrata, Vol. 3, pp. 
67 ff., but WiNTERNiTZ does not mention him even once in the 130 pages he 
devotes to the Mahabharata in his Geschichte. He is referred to en passant 
by Brockhaus, ZDMG, 6. 528 ; by Telang, Bhagavadglta Translation ; by 
Rajendralal Mitra, Notices, Vbls. 5 and 6 ; and in some other manuscripts 
catalogues. 

The version of Arjunamisra, as I pointed out in the Foreword (p. v) 
to the first fascicule of the critical edition of the Mahabhalrata (1927), is 
closely allied to the Bengali version. The simple reason for this affinity, 
not known to me then, is apparently that Arjunamisra was a native of Bengal, 
to judge from the extracts from the colophons of his commentary recently 
published by Mahamahopadhyaya Haraprasada Shastri in the Descriptive 
Catalogue of Sanskrit Mmu^cripts of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. 5 
(1928). 

The few facts about Arjunamisra and his commentary that 1 have been 
able to glean from the various available sources may be briefly summarized 
thus. The name of his commentary is variously given as {Mahd-)bhdratdr- 
tha- £566} {pra)dipikd and Bharatasamgrahadipikd. The commentaries on 
the different Parvans have been handed down singly or in groups of a few 
Parvans at a time. Complete manuscripts of the commentary exist in Bengal, 
but even there they are not common. The manuscripts, which are written 
in Bengali and Devanagari characters, bear various dates in the seventeenth 
or later centuries : the ea:rliest hitherto reported date is Samvat 1676 {ca. 
A.D. 1620). 

Arjunamisra, who styles himself Bharatiacarya in the colophons of the 
manuscripts of his commentary, was the son of Is^a, who was a “ reciter 
{pdthaka or pdthakctrdja) of the Mahabharata and who appears to have, 
like his son, borne the title Bhiaratacarya. Arjuna is cited by name, by

published by the Gujarati Printing Press, Bombay. 



404 AKJUNAMI^RA 

NJlakan^tha once in his commentary on the Mahabharata 3. 291. 70) and 
is, therefore, certainly anterior to Nilakai^tha, who belongs to the third 
quarter of the seventeenth century.^ He in turn mentions among his 
predecessors the commentators Devabodha, Vimalabodha, tSapdilya, Sarvajha- 
Narayaiaa, and he ai>pears to have based his scholium closely on that of 
Devabodha. He wrote also a commentary on the well-known Vedic hymn 
Puru^asukta, to which he himself refers in the Dtpik3 on Mbh. 14. 25. 26. 
Telang {op, cit. p. 204) surmises that he is posterior to sSaipkara, and 
Holtzmann assigns him to the thirteenth or fourteenth century : both with- 
out adducing any cogent reasons for their assumptions. Arjuna regarded 
and has treated the Harivairm as an integral part of the Great Epic, elabo- 
rately defending this position : his commentary, therefore, embraces the 
supplement Harivaipisa also. 

Arjunamisra lived in North India, in a town or village on the banks of 
the Ganges and, according to his own statement, compiled the great commen- 
tary on the Mahabharata under the patronage of one Satyakhlana. £567} Re- 
lying on one Bengal Asiatic Society's manuscript examined by him, Hara- 
prasada Shastri asserts that Arjuna was a Varendra Brahman of North 
Bengal. The Mahamahopadhyaya may indeed be right in this, but I am 
not wholly convinced. I find it a suspicious circumstance that this word 
Vaiendra occurs only in one place in one manuscript (No. 3422), while it is 
conspicuous by its absence in the others which contain a similar colophon. 
There is, however, another word which is often repeated in these colc^hons but 
not discussed by the Mahamahopadhyaya and which I think also contains a 
place name. The word is spelt in the colophons variously as Campahev(t)iya, 
Campahethi, Campih^ika. It is used there as an attribute of Kula. I take 
the reference to mean that Arjunamisra's family {ktda) belonged to a town 
or village, called Campaheft(t)i- Could this place be identified with cer- 
tainty, we should have a very definite clue as to ArjunamisrpTs provenance. 
I am tempted to identify it with Campah^ti mentioned in the Imperial Gazet- 
teer oj India (1885) as a small village. . . .15 miles south-west of Calcutta, 
in the district of the Twenty-four Pargarnasi, Bengal ” ; but owing partly to 
the erratic manner in which proper names are spelt in the Imperial Gazet- 
teer and partly to the lack of sufficient data as to the situation of the place 
in question, the identificaticm proposed above is necessarily uncertain. 

Following the example of my predecessors, I halve utilized Devanagari 
manuscripts of the commentary of Arjunamisra and treated his version as a 
sub-division of the Devaniagari version. The two Devanagari manuscripts 
I am using for my edition of the Adiparvah are extremely corrupt. In fact 
all the manuscripts I have consulted-^and they are all Nagaii manuscripts 
— ^have been surprisingly corrupt. Not only that, the text they contain is 


PRINTZ, KZ, 44, 70 ff. 




ARJUNAMlSU 405 

obviously contaminated from the vulgate text, as evidenced { 568 } by the 
glaring discrepancies that exist between the readings of the text and the 
lemmata in the commentary. This corruption of the Devanagaii manus- 
cripts I could not understand at first, but is, I cannot but think now, due 
to their being copies of Bengali originals. It would, therefore, be expedient 
to secure and use, whenever possible, good old Bengali manuscripts of Arju- 
namiSra’s commentary, treating his version as an offshoot of the Bengali 
vcrsiwi. Arjunamisra certainly seems to belong to the Eastern school of 
Mahabhiarata commentators. 



## THE NALA EPISODE AND THE RAMAYANA 


There must be indeed very few Sahskritists who have read the justly 
popular Nala-Damayanti episode of the Mahabharata and n<A felt disposed 
to echo the sentiments of A. W. V. Schlegel that the poem “ can hardly be 
surpassed in pathos and ethos, ini the enthralling force and tenderness of the 
sentiments.” * It is without doubt one of the most beautiful love stories of the 
world, striking on account of the simplicity of its style and the beauty of its 
imagery. Owing to its innate attractiveness and transparent lucidity, it has 
been the custom, since a long time, at almost all Western Universities, to 
begin the study of Sanskrit with the reading of this romantic little poem, for 
which purpose it is no doubt excellently suited. Its popularity may be judged 
from the fact that it has been translated not only into English. French and 
German, but also into Italian, Swedish, Czech, Polish, Russian, Greek and 
Hungarian amcMig the European languages.^ Every province of India can 
of course boast of its own version of this superb little epc^jee. 

Regarded as an integral part of the Mahabharata,^ the episode is a pal- 
pable “interpolation”, impending annoyingly the march of the epic story, 
and is forced upon the reader of the Epic in the most barefaced manner. 
During the exile of the Papdavas they receive a casual visit from a peripatetic 
sage called Bphadasva. Yudhisthira— as is usual with him — complains to 
him of the misfortune which has overtaken him and his family, and asks the 
sage whether there has ever been a more unfortunate king than himself. 
Thereupon Brhada^va forthwith relates the Nala story, in 27 adhySyas, com- 
prising something like l lOO stanzas or 2200 lines. There could be no clearer 
instance of deliberate interpolation, introduced with a coolness difficult to 
match. Yet we are really intensely grateful at heart in this case, as in the 
case of the Savitri ^isode, — ^the two immortal stories that are ktMWn and 
loved throughout the length and breadth of India— that s<Mne meddlesome 
interpolator had the courage to interrupt deliberately the smooth flow of the 
epic narrative with these beautiful digressions and thus saved them £295} 
from falling a prey to the ravages of Time. And so with a number of other

THE NALA EPISODE AND THE RAMAYAI^A 407 

interpolations in the Great Epic. Many of them richly deserved to be “ inter- 
polated ’ in this Golden Treasury of the Myths and Legends of India. 

Not only has the Nala-Damayandi poem what may be called a lively 
story-interest, but it is also clothed in a most attractive garb. The charm- 
ingly simple diction of this exquisite little poem is marked by a rigorous eco- 
nomy of words and “ ornaments ” ; the construction of the story is also on 
the whole remarkably faultless : qualities which have endeared it to con- 
noisseurs all the world over. The narrative, like a sylvan brook, runs its 
meandering course naturally and smoothly to its destined conclusion. And in 
spite of a few inevitable scenes of divine intervention and a little exaggeration 
necessary for artistic effect, we carry away the impression that the story rests 
on a foundation of fact, and we feel that it may all have happened, in those 
wonderful bygone times, exactly as it is narrated here. 

In the whole length of this carefully and artistically constructed poem 
there is just one passage which is apt slightly to perplex a careful reader. It 
is the soliloquy of the Brahman Sudeva in chapter 16 of the poem (B. 3. 
68. 8 ff.). On reading this passage a discerning reader would notice for one 
thing a sudden change to a rather florid style, marked by a plethora of epi- 
thets and a rich embroidery of similes. 

The situation is this. King Nala, having deserted Damayanti where 
she lay asleep, strode through the forest aimlessly until he met the snake- 
king Karkotaka, who, in return for a good turn done to him, transformed 
the handsome Nala into an ugly hunchback and advised him to go to Ayodhya 
and seek service as a charioteer with king Stuparipa. Nala does so and 
remains at the court of IJtupaiioa in the service of the king. His where- 
abouts and identity are not known tof any living soul besides himself : which 
is a very important point in the narrative. Damayanti, in the meanwhile, 
after a number of perilous adventures, reaches, by a fortunate coincidence, 
the palace of the queen of the Cedis, who is no other than Damayanti’s own 
aunt (as is revealed later), who takes compassion on her and gives her shelter. 
In course of time the evil tidings of the fateful game of dice and the subse- 
quent exile of Nala and Damayanti reached king BMma, I>amayantrs father. 
Thereupon he called to him some Brahmins and enjoined them, with pronuse 
of rich gifts, that they should search for Nala and Damayanti and bring them 
back to him. One of these Brahmins, the fortunate Sudeva, comes to the 
country of the Cedis and there, in the palace hall, he sees Damayanti and 
recognises her forthwith. On seeing the wan, unkempt and forlorn appearance 
of the beautiful princess of Vidarbha, he indulges in a soliloquy before 
addressing her directly. This passage, as already remarked, scenes marked 
out from the rest of the poem by attempts at higher flights of imagination, 
approadiing the requirements vof what is known as the Kavya style. Dama- 
yanti is here successively compared by Sudeva to i§if (or Lak?mi), to the full

THE NALA EPISODE AND THE RAMAYAljIA 


moon, to Rati (Cupid's consort), to the splendour of the full moon, to a lotus 
stalk, to a full-moon night, to a river, to {[296} a lotus pool, again to a lotus 
stalk, and finally to the crescent of the moon (B. 3. 68. 10-17). That, how- 
ever, is a minor matter. 

The really perplexing part of the soliloquy is the way in which Sudeva 
refers to Nala in the following stanza (B. 3. 68. 20) : 

duskaram kurute 'tyartham Inno yad anayd Nalali | 
dhdray<^y dtmano deham na sokendvasidati || 

'‘Extremely difficult is the trial of Nala who, deprived of lier (scil. 
Damayanti), supports his body and does not pine away in sorrow ! ” 

This can be properly said by a person who knows that Nala is heroically 
bearing the cruel blow of fate which had temporarily separated him from his 
beloved, and above all that Nala is alive. But for all Sudeva knew, Nala 
might have been dead. Here is a slight incongruity to start with. It might 
be argued that as it was not definitely known that Nala was dead, Sudeva was 
to a certain extent justified in assuming that Nala was alive, and so this out- 
burst was after all not so very incongruous. But, even if he were alive, how 
was Sudeva to know whether Nala wanted to recover Damayanti ; in fact, to 
know at all what feelings Nala entertained then about Damayanti : they 
might conceivably have been even hostile, for all Sudeva could say. Such 
minute analysis of hidden motives and distant possibilities might, however, 
be regarded as captious criticism, when considering such an old-world love 
poem as this. 

The disturbing; thought however recurs when a few lines later we read 
(B. 3. 68. 23 ab) : 

asyd nunam pmarldbhm Nakadhah pntim esyati j 
“ Through her recovery Nala will become happy indeed ”, 

words which again definitely presuppose that Nala is alive and anxious to 
rediscover his lost Damayanti, neither of which facts could have been known 
to Sudeva, and whose assumption by him is quite gratuitous and most puzzling 
to the reader. Inappropriate to a certain extent are in the same context the 
adjectives aprameyasya and viryasattvo^vatatj. (stanza 25) applied to Nala. 
Was it not through Nala’s own insane infatuation for dice that Damayanti 
was reduced to this condition, and all that great disaster was brought upon 
the two families ? A discordant note is likewise struck by the words Nai^adhc 
Wh>ati Vaidaribhtm (stanza 24), which under these circumstances seem pecu- 
liarly inappropriate. One rather feels at this stage that poor Damayanti had 
definitely made the wrong choice at the svayamvara : she would have been 
much happier had she chosen, in preference to the profligate Nala, one of the 
four gods who were wooing her. 

Another very curious thing we notice about this passage is that while 
Sudeva waxes eloquent about Nala and his sufferings, he has no thought at 



tHE NALA EI^ISODg AND THfe rAMAYA^JA 409 

the moment for king Bhima, who is Sudeva’s patron and who has dispatched 
him on this errand. Sudeva has not a, word to say in this long soliloquy as 
to how glad the fond parents would be on seeing their beloved Damayanti 
and how happy Damayantf would be on being reunited to her kinsfolk. From 
£297} his present words we could never guess that he had been sent by king 
Bhima or that he had any connection with the House of Vidarbha. 

Our first thought is that the whole passage is one of those modem inter- 
polations which have unintentionally disfigured many a fine old poem. The 
manuscripts do not however countenance such an idea. The passage is docu- 
mented uniformly by all manuscripts alike. It is therefore not in any case 
a recent interpolation. Moreover the idea itself of the soliloquy is not by 
any n^eans inherently inappropriate ; only the precise wording and some of 
the sentiments expressed seem a little incongruous. 

We are therefore led to conclude that the poet’s own knowledge of the 
real state of things, that Nala was not dead and that, repenting his hasty 
abandonment of Damayanti, he was then making reproaches to himself and 
was in fact longing to meelt his lost Damayanti, had betrayed the poet into 
putting those words in the mouth of Sudeva, anticipating what was actually 
going to happen : a mistake common in the works of careless and inexperi- 
enced writers. 

That this also is not the correct explanation of the anomaly follows, how- 
ever, from the fact that almost all the lines forming this soliloquy of Sudeva 
recur almost verbatim in the long soliloquy of Hanumat in the Sundarak;^<Ja 
(adhy. 18 ff., ed. Gorresio) of the Rannayaija at the time when he first sees 
Sita in the Asoka grove of Havana's Lanka, — a soliloquy which, as will be 
made clear, is the source of the passage under discussion from the Nala 
episode. 

The two situations, it will be recalled, have a superficial similarity. The 
heroine is lost, and messengers have been sent, by persons interested in her 
recovery, to find out her whereabouts. One of these messengers, more fortu- 
nate than the rest, suddenly and unexpectedly lights upon her, whereupon 
he just stands gazing at her and giving vent to his mixed feelings of joy and 
sorrow in the form of a soliloquy. 

The one important difference between the two situations — ^a difference 
obviously overlooked by the adapter — is that in one case — ^the RamayaDa — 
the messenger, Hanumat, has been sent by Rama himself, and the messenger 
therefore knows exactly the state of the mind of the husband of the missing 
princess ; whereas in the other case, the Nala episode, the messenger, sent 
by king Bhima, has not only no knowledge of Nala's feelings towards Dama- 
yanti, but he does not even know whether Nala, who is missing, is alive or 
dead. And that makes a deal of difference. The words of the Ramaya’oa 
soliloquy are wholly .appropriate in the mouth of the Monkey Chieftain ; 

27 



410 


THE NALA EPISODE AND THE RAMAYAI^A 

but the same words, in spite of a few necessary verbal alterations made by 
the adapter, prove on close scrutiny, as shown above, just a trifle incongruous 
in the soliloquy of Sudeva. 

The extent of the similarity between the two passages will be clear from 
the following table in which the related lines are given in parallel columns.

The question which of the two passages is the original one, need not 
detain us long. It is a priori not very likely that Valnflki who is credited 
with having composed an epic of the size and rank of the Ramayaioa would 
need to borrow the idea or the phraseology of such a commonplace soliloquy 
from a poem like the Nalop^ySna. The redactor of the Nala story is, 
therefore, clearly indicated as the poet who would be under obligation for his 
inspiration td the Adi-kavi. This a priori conclusion is happily confirmed in 
the present instance by the fortuitous circumstance that the passage turns 
out to be somewhat of a misfit in <xir poem. The anomaly, as has been 
suggested above, can be explained only on the supposition that the Nalopakh- 
yana lines were borrowed m bloc from a slightly different context. The 
exact phrasing of the speech of the messenger was originally conceived for 
a somewhat different set of circumstances as pictured in the Rimaya^?a, in 
which the soliloquy fits perfectly. The borrowed plumes, as is very often 
the case, do not fit the new incumbent as well as the adapter had imagined 
or at least hoped. We have, therefore, here an indubitable proof of the direct 
borrowing of some Ramayama material by one of the Mahibharata poets.-— 


^ The correspcmding line has been omitted by GoRRESio, but is correctly given 
in the Bombay (Nimaya Sagar Press) ed. (1888), 5, 30, 7ab (cf. p. 83% and in the 
Gujarati Printing Press ed. (1916), 5. 30.. Tab (cf. p. 1856), both editions reading 
aham for our ayam. Both Tilaka and Govindaifijiya mention (the pratika) aivi^q-

not necessarily of course Krsija Dvaijrayana Vyiasa, but one of the “ Epigoni ”, 
the Vyasaids, who carried on the good work commenced by Vyiasa. 

The conclusion that the idea of this soliloquy of Sudeva in the Nalopakh- 
yana of the Mahabharata must necessarily have been bi^rrowed by one of 
the redactors of the Great Epic from the Ramayania is perhaps not without 
some significance for an understanding of the general interrelation of the 
Ramiaya|i^ and the Mahabharata to which we may here advert in passing. ^ 

The soliloquy discussed above is, as is well known, not by any means the 
only passage in which the Mahabharata, shows contact with its sister epic,^ 
and the question arises each time in the mind of the textual critic whether 
£301} the Mahabharata or the Ramayana is the source of the passage com- 
mon to the two epics, a question to whidi, owing to the peculiar character 
and development of the Indian epics, no general answer is possible, though 
a partial solution of the problem may be attempted. 

As remarked already, the Nala passage is not the only passage for which 
a parallel exists in the Ramayana. In the Adiparvan, for instance, in a cos- 
mogonic chapter, I had occasion to draw attention to the fact that a passage 
of some 30 lines (1. 60. 54-67 of the Critical Edition) recurs almost verbatim 
in the Ramayaioa (3. 14. 17-32, ed. Nirnaya Sagar Press). J^o definite evi- 
dence was available in that particular instance to show whether the passage 
was original to the Mahabharata and had been borrowed by the Ramayaina, 
or vice verm, or again whether it had been borrowed by both epics independ- 
ently from a third source. There seemed to me, however, to be some slight 
abruptness in the manner in which the stanzas were introduced in the Maha- 
bharata, which would suggest borrowing from the Riamayalna where the con- 
text isl smoother ; but, as the contents of the passage were of a! very general 
nature, the third possibility mentioned above, namely that both epics owed 
the idea to a common (Pun^nic) source, could not be entirely eliminated. 

The Sabhiaparvan again supplies the well known kaccit chapter (adhy. 
5), which has its counterpart in the Ramayana.^^ Here also the contents are 
of a very general character, having no direct bearing on the context of either 
the Ramayapa or the Mahabharata, and the whole passage could well have 
been adapted by both epics independently from an older Niti tractate. 

On the other hand, in the Aranyakaparvan, commonly known as the

THE NALA EPISODE AND THE RAMAYAl^A 

Vanaparvan, the Ramopakhyiana closely follows in general our Riamayaiia, 
notwithstanding some isolated though striking discrepancies between the two 
accounts.^ There are also not wanting in the Riamopakhylana a few of our 
genuine Ramiayapa stanzas which have been reproduced either verbatim or 
with but slight verbal alteration. To suggest that the Ramopiakhyana was 
the original source which had inspired the revered Adi-kavi to compose his 
Ramayaiia would be again a reductio ad absurdum. The inevitable con- 
clusidn is that the diaskeuasts of the Ramopakhyana knew and summarised 
an extensive older Ramai epic. The only doubt is whether the redactors of 
the Mahiabharata had utilized our version of the Ramiayaina or some other 
older version unknown to us, to which the discrepant traits of our episode 
might be traced. After an intensive study and a close comparison of the two 
texts, the late) Prof. Jacobi had definitely expressed himself in favour of the 
former alternative, namely, that the Ramopakhyana was a passably accurate 
summary of out Ramayaioa, the discrepancies between the accounts being 
due either to casual misconception or else to natural and unavoidable failure 
of memory, of which instances are common in summaries and abstracts.^ 
£3023 Jacobi’s view, it seems to me, now finds further confirmation from the 
instance discussed above of direct borrowing from our Ramiayana text in a 
case where there is no intrinsic reason whatsoever for airy reference to the 
Rjamayaoa at all. Evidence seems to be, therefore, gathering to show that 
our Rianrayaiiia text — or the bulk of it, at any rate — was used as a 
‘'source ” by the diaskeuasts of the Mahabhiarata. We can even go further 
and admit with Jacobi that the Ramayana must already have been ** gene- 
rally familiar as an ancient work before the Mahabharata reached its final 
form.’'^ On the other hand it will have to be admitted that the Maha- 
bharata makes in various ways a distinctly more archaic impression, a fact 
which has led some scholars to regard it als even a much older work than the 
other epic. We thus arrive at the apparent paradox that the Ramiayaijia is older 
than the Mahiabharata and the Mahabharata is older than the Ran^yania. 
The only way we can resolve this paradox is by supposing — ais has already 
been suggested by Winternitz^ and other writers on the subject — that the 
period* of composition of the Ramayana, which is a work with a distinctly 
more unitary character, falls within the much longer period of the evolution 
of the MahablSrata, which latter compared to the other is, a very complex 
and complicated work indeed.

THE NALA EPISODE AND THE RAMAYAI^A 


415 


This Statement of the relationship between the two epics will appear per» 
fectly valid and even natural when we remember that the evolution of the 
Great Epic of India falls into two distinct and separate phases, namely, the 
Bharata and the Mahabharata, the caturvimsatisSham (1. 1. 61 Crit Ed.) 
and the satasdhd^sn, a fact which is documented in very clear terms by the 
work itself — and there is no reason to disbelieve it — but which for some un- 
intelligible reason is not taken very seriously by people. Assuming, however, 
this to be a fact — which it undoubtedly is — ^we may hazard what seems to me 
to be a perfectly legitimate conjecture that the Rjamayana was composed in 
the interval which separated the Bharata from the Mahabharata. Thus, 
though we may admit that the Ramayana was, as Jacobi says, a well-known 
work before the Mahabharata reached its ultimate form, we must reckon with 
the possibility that when the Ramayana itself (minus perhaps Books 1 and 
7) was composed by the poet Valmiki, the heroic poem Bharata— the nucleus 
of our Mahabharata — ^was already long in existence, current perhaps in some 
distant part of the country and in a different milieu. The Bharata and the 
Ramayana may have been indeed more or less independent products, different 
in origin ar?d treatment. But when the Bhargava' redactors^ set to work and 
converted the {303} Bharata into the Mahabharata, conceived on a much 
larger scale and with a much more ambitious programme, they had already 
the archetype of our Ramayaija text before them and they made full use of it, 
absorbing in their own encyclopaedic work all that they possibly could, and 
they were perhaps also influenced by it in no small degree. In fact the very 
impetus to the conversion of the Bharata and the compilation of the Maha- 
bharata may well have been given by the contact with the sister epic, which 
appears to have had a more elevated ethical standard, a more serious didactic 
purpose, a much higher idealistic view of life, and a wider popular appeal. 

A priori then, whenever our Mahabharata shows close verbal agreement 
with the older books of the Ramayana, the presumption would be that we 
have to look upon the Ramayaiia as the source, assuming of course that the 
common element is not of such a character that it could have been borrowed 
by both epics independently from a third source. It is naturally not excluded 
that the Ram&yaija in its turn might have been influenced to a certain extent, 
at a still later epoch, in its further development, by the Mahabharata, the 
new encyclopaedic Dharma Sainhita. In fact there is every indication that 
the interrelation between the two epics will reduce itself to a very complicated 
system of mutual actions and reactions, and it would be interesting to investi- 
gate the question more fully by collation^ of all possible parallelisms in ideas 
and expression between the two great epics of India.

## EPIC QUESTIONS 

### Does Indra assume the form of a swan ? 

Mbh. (Crit. Ed.) 1. 57.21 : Msyartipeiia samkaralf. 

This is the second pada of a stanza occurring in the AdipaVvan which 
reads : 

bhagavm pujydte catra hdsyarupej^ta samkarah j 

svayatn eva grhitena Vasoh prltyd mohdtmanah || 

The Vulgate (1. 63. 21cd — ^22ab) differs from this only in so far that 
it reads the second quarter of the stanza as hmsarupena cesvamh. 

I have discussed the text-reading briefly in the Annals of the Bhandarkar 
Orientol Research Institute (vol. 16, p. 100 f.) and justified it, in my reply 
to the late Professor Winternitz, who in the course of a lengthy review^ of 
the Adiparvan had drawn attention to it, observing that as the reading was 
a lectio difficilior and was “ far from certain ” it requires a “ wavy line ” . 
While admitting that the reading adopted in the Critical Edition was a lec- 
tio difjicilioT I contended that sin<» the documentary evidence in its favour 
was complete, therefore it need not be regarded as uncertain and there was 
no need of a “wavy line.” There would have been no reason for me now 
to revert to it but for two facts. On the one hand, it has been again, inci- 
dentally, criticized^ by the late lamented Professor J. J. Meyer in his last 
publication, Trilogie dtindischer Mdchte u. Feste d. Vegetation? (Zurich- 
Leipzig 1937),— a thick opus with extremely rich and varied contents, en- 
livened as usual by the author’s spicy wit and trenchant style. On the other 
hand, the reading receives srfme confirmati(»i from a new and unexpected 
source. 

Meyer argues for the reading of the Vulgate, characterizing the hdsya- 
rupena of the Critical Edition as an astonishing (“ verwunderliche”) read- 
ing, and dismissing hdsya- as the stupid mistake of some scribe (“ein dum- 
mer Schreibfehler” ) . 

The context in which the Mbh. stanza occurs is as follows. The righteous 
king Uparicara Vasu, having laid down his arms, retired to the forest and

began, practising penance. Indra and the {2} other gods, apprehending trouble, 
appeared before him, and, dissuading him from continuing his fierce austeri- 
ties; induced him to return to his royal duties. He should rule the king- 
dom of Cedi as Indra’s special friend. As a mark of his favour, Indra pre- 
sented Vasu with various uncommon gifts, among them a crystalline aerial 
car {sphatikani vimanam) and a garland of unfading lotusesf (known as In- 
dramald) which would protect the king against the missiles of his enemies 
and bring him wealth and victory (vmjayantim) . But he gave him also a 
bamboo staff {vainavtm yasiim), which would protect the good {sistdndm 
pratipdlinim) and of course chastise the wicked. King Vasu brought home 
these precious gifts, according the wonderful staff full divine worsliip. That 
was how, we are told, the custom began of bringing from the forest, at a 
certain specified season, the staff, pole or tree, which was then set up, deco- 
rated with flowers, wreaths, flags, and with pilakas — whatever these latter 
are — and worshipped in due form. Here we find the stanza cited above, 
which says in effect that on this occasion Indra is worshipped, according to 
ancient rites, in a certain form assumed by the god of his own accord, out 
of love for Vasu Uparicara. 

What was this form ? Was it the form of a swan, as the Vulgate has 
it and as Meye.r argues ? That is the question . 

Before we try to answer this question, it would be well to examine the 
MS. evidence a little more closely than Meyer appears to have done. The 
important MS. reading (ignoring that of D^), as given in the Critical Edi- 
tion, may be jxit in the following synoptical form : 

N (except K^) hamsarupena 

samkarah (Br, Dn) cesvarah, 

Ki M ( = Text) hdsyarupena} ) 

T. G. Ya^tirupena Vdsavah. 

To this we may now add the important, newly discovered eight hun- 
dred years old Nepali MS. of the Adi (of which I have given full collations 
in ABORI, vol. 19, pp. 201 ff.), which agrees exactly with Ki M and there- 
fore supports the critical text in an unambiguous manner. 

Now let us see what Meyer has to say about these readings. Accord- 
ing to him (p, 5), the original cesvarah (found in the Vulgate) was mis- 
understood as referring to god Siva ; and, with a view to clarifying its mean- 
ing, it was deliberately changed by some scribe into samkarah, which latter 
is a well-known epithet of Siva. And further hdsyarupena of the Critical

EPIC QUESTIONS 


Edition is, according to Meyer, as already £3} remarked, nothing more than 
the stupid blunder of some copyist for the original hamsarupena. 

It may be made perfectly clear once for all that at least as far as the 
Mababharata text is concerned, the time when one could juggle with read- 
ings of MSS and lay down the law ex cathedra as to what is the original, 
what is an emendation and what is a scribe’s mistake, is long past. It has 
now become a very much more serious and complicated matter, since the 
publication of the Critical Edition. To entitle anyone to a hearing, he must 
first of all show that he understands the critical appalratus and that he has 
studied the stemma codicum published, by me on p. xxx of the Prolego- 
mena of niy edition of the Adiparvan. 

Let us now go back to the MSS. There we find that samkarailt (of the 
Critical Edition) is documented by the whole of the Northern Recension (in- 
cluding the new Nepali MS.) and the Malayalam version, while cesvarah 
(championed by Meyer) is merely the reading of Br, Dn ! Now one would 
like to know why what Meyer considers the original reading (cesvarah) is 
found only in the most recent version represented by Nilakantha (end of the 
17th century) with the sporadic support of one aberrant Bengali MS. (B 5 ), 
while what he considers a recent emendation (sanikarah is found in still 
older versions represented by MSS. scattered all over India from Kashmir 
to Malabar and from Gujarat to Bengal, including the distant Nepal and 
excepting (in addition to the Vulgate) only the Tamil-Telugu zone, which 
latter has moreover a third and divergent reading (Vdsavah). How is it 
that only the Nilakantha version has preserved the correct reading, while 
all other— much older — versions of North India together with the entire Ma- 
layalam version from the South contain what Meyer regards as a corrup- 
tion ? If samkarah of all N and M MSS. be a corrupt reading, as Meyer 
maintains, then Nilakaittha could have got his cesvarah only by emendation, 
because I do not think that Nilakafr^tha had access to any really old Maha- 
bharata MSS., containing very original readings. In thousands of cases his 
text shows what can be proved, with absolute certainty, to be secondary, in- 
ferior, or corrupt readings. 

This inability on the part of Meyer to recognize in a patently simple 
case what is original and what is secondary shows that he had only very 
vague notions of the relationship between the different recensions, versions 
and manuscripts. And the ignorance of this relationship is absolutely fatal 
to any attempt to discriminate between original readings and emendations and 
scribes’ mistakes. You can never find out an original reading by selecting 
one which suits your purpose, or satisfies your aesthetic sense, or appeals to 
you in some other way, and then looking about for reasons in support of your 
a priori choice; because almost always “ good ” reasons can be found for 
nearly every reading. It is not a qu^tion of dialectic, but £4} of documenta- 



EPIC QUESTIONS I 419 

tion. And no amount of tendentious arguing will refute the objective evi- 
dence of MSS. 

MSS. in this case clearly prove that the process of alteration has been 
the reverse of what is imagined by Meyer. Here, it is evident, cesv^ah 
has not been changed into samkarah for the sake of clarity, as Meyer main- 
tains ; but, on the other hand, samkarah has been very clearly changed into 
cesvarah — already rendered suspect by the expletive ca — ^perhaps, to avoid 
confusion, samkara being here not the nomen proprium of Siva, but an epithet 
meaning “beneficent, promoting welfare 

We can now turn to the other word of the pada, the more difficult of the 
two: was it hdsyarupena, hamsarupena or yastirupena? Meyer (p. 5) 
rightly rejects the last. It is correct as far as the sense goes ; but it can hardly 
be the original reading. Were it so, no scribe would think of deliberately 
changing it into the obscure and almost unintelligible hdsyarupena or hanisaru- 
pena, both of which are, moreover, graphically unrelated with the former. 
From what we know of scribes’ emendations they tend generally to simplify 
the text, not to complicate it. If that be so, then either hdsyarupena or ham- 
sarupena i^ the correct reading. Moreover y astir upena is confined (like Vd- 
small) ^ to T G, and does not receive any support even from M, which in in- 
numerable cases has preserved — in contradiction to the T G version — the origi- 
nal reading, which has been emended or simplified in T G.^ 

There remains, therefore, only the two alternatives — hdsyarupena given 
by Ki M with the new Nepali MS, and hamsarupeum supported by N (ex- 
cept Kj ) . ByJ the test of the agreement between independent versions,'^ hds- 
yarupena is clearly indicated as the original reading, since we have here an 
agreement between the independent versions of the extreme North and the 
extreme South, it being preferable to hamsarupena, supported only by the 
central sub-recension. It is, moreover, undoubtedly the lectio diffidlwr (as 
was rightly observed by Winternitz in the course of the review mentioned 
above), which accounts for its being surreptitiously ousted by the other. 
Both documentary and intrinsic probability are thus unquestionably in fa- 
vour of the reading hdsyarupena adopted in the Critical Edition. 

What indeed are we to understand by the hamsarupetpa of the Vulgate ? 
The word hamsa has a number of meanings. Monier Williams gives the 
following : 

£51 a goose, gander, swan, flamingo (or other aquatic bird); the soul or spirit 
(sometimes 'the Universal Soul or Supreme Spirit’, identified with Viraj, Narayaoa,

found, however, a loophole in the meaning of hamsa as sungod”, and he sur- 
mised that perhaps the idea of this hamsarupa of Indra was to be dated back 
to the period when Indra was still recognized as a sun-god ! 

Nilakajitha, who has commented on this stanza, had naturally some diffi- 
culty in explaining this hamsarupa. According to him Indra was : hanisaru- 
pena yukto hamSarupt | tasya buddhisthasya rupasya visesariofh svayam eva 
etc. To Nilakaajtha the hamsa^iorm is present only in the mind (buddhistha) 
of the worshipper. To Meyer, on the other hand, who was a realist with a 
vengeance, this explanation naturally did not satisfy. According to him (p. 
4f.), Indra, who is ordinarily invisible to mortals, takes on the concrete form 
of a swan, so as to be visible to Vasu and his subjects. Meyer further found 
(p. 5) the aquatic bird admirably suited to the mirth and gaiety and the 
sportive games that accompany the ceremonial. 

Now which is the original and which is the emendation of these two 
readings ? The characteristic of a scribe’s emendation, as has been well said, 
is that it has all the appearance of improvement without its reality. Ours 
is a case in point, hiomsarupe^ is a phrase under which you can think all 
sorts of things, all equally vague ; but on closer inspection they prove to be 
uniformly inadequate. 

For why should Indra appear before Vasu, or the kings who followed in 
his footsteps, in the form of a swan of all things in the world, whether in a 
concrete shape before the eyes of his worshippers or in an abstract form 
in their minds ? He had assumed one form already : that of the ya^ti the 
staff. Meyer (p. 101) has himself established — ^absolutely incontrovertibly — 
that the tree or the pole or the staff which figures so prominently in the In- 
dramaha ceremony, was worshipped, if not by Vasu, at least by the people 
whom the writer of the Mahabharata account had in mind, as a symbol, {6} an 
image, or an incarnation of Indra himself, and not merely as a remembrance 
of a present from Indra to Vasu. As Meyer ha^ pointed out, the Puraqic 
writers, when speaking of the pde, refer to it unh^itatingly as Indra ” (or 
its synonyms “Sakra”, etc.) in such expressions as Sakr asthma or Indra-

And what a funny form to assume for the thousand-eyed god of gods, 
who had performed a hundred sacrifices, the wielder of the thunder-bolt, the 
destroyer of enemies’ forts, the killer of Vala (or Bala) and Vitra, and the 
hero of a thousand other wonderful exploits : the form of a bamboo staff, with 
wreaths and bells, flags and buntings hanging from it and with those curiously 
shaped pifakas, (sptne of which at any rate, according to Meyer 
(p. 96), were shaped like penies ! It was indeed a laughable form {hdsyaru- 
pa), calculated to provoke mirth and laughter. And this form, it must be 
borne in mind, was not given to Indra by any man ; such a thing would have 
been very likely resented by him. The great god, wishing to do good (iamka- 
ra) to Vasu, had assumed it himself {svayam eva grahitena) out of his great 
love for the high soul Uparicara Vasu {Vasoh prityd mahdtmanah). The 
jocular form — kriddvatdrarupa, as Devabodha^ puts it — assumed by the 
mighty god on this occasion caused great merriment ; and the feast was ac- 
cordingly celebrated with much laughter and gaiety, as described in the Bi*hat- 
samhita, the Vi§pudharmottara and other texts (Meyer, p. 103 f.). 

Thus both documentary probability and intrinsic considerations support 
the reading hdsyarupem ^amharah. This reading is therefore not so asto- 
nishing as Meyer seems to have thought ; but it is astonishing that 
Meyer who had with praiseworthy diligence extracted and trans- 
lated very lengthy passages from about a dozen original sources describing 
the ceremony in great detail, and not found anywhere (except in the Vul- 
gate) the remotest reference to Indra’s assuming the form of a ^wan or to his 
being represented as a swan, should have been so enamoured of the Vulgate 
leading, a reading which I am fully persuaded is nothing more than a scribe’s 
emendation in the archetype of the Central group. But perhaps even Meyer’s 
mistake is not so very astonishing : it is only an example of wishful think- 
ing. Does it not connect Indra with the sun (hamsa) {7} or at least with the 
sun-god ? And Meyer’s whole thesis (pp. 134-144) is that Indra was ori- 
ginally just not a rain-god or a thunder-god, but a sun-g)od, the vernal sun, 
the “ genius ” of fertility and vegetation, in fact, a phallic deity !

### The Parvasamgraha Figures 

The Parvasamgrahaparvan (Adi, adhy. 2) is a document of considerable 
importance.^ But its value has been unduly exaggerated by some scholars, 
a circumstance which has led to some highly misleading results and some 
curious conclusions It is thus supposed that Kr^na Dvaipayana Vyasa had 
himself counted and noted down the number of slokas he had composed, and 
that our Parvasamgraha was composed by Vyasa himself. No doubt it is 
sometimes stated in the Parvasarhgraha chapter that that sage had stated the 
extent of each of the eighteen parvans. But this attribution to Vyasa is 
naturally only pujarthe {honoris causa). It is nowhere suggested in the work 
itself that the first two adhyiayas of our epic were composed by Vyasa. They 
could not be, because they are obviously only a report of the conversation 
which took place between the Suta (Ugrasravas, son of Lomahar?ana) and 
the sages assembled at iSaunaka's twelve-year sacrifice in the Naimisa Forest. 
The erroneous supposition regarding the authorship of this adhyaya has led 
to the naive attempt on the part of some scholars to produce a text — a so- 
called critical text — of the Mahabharata containing the same number of 
adhyayas and slokas as that given in the Parvasarhgraha. Such an attempt 
is already negatived by our manuscripts and testimonia, which contain many 
variants of the figures in the Parvasarhgraha. Thus the figures for the Adi- 
parvan itself vary, according to different sources, between 7984 (Ka4mir|i 
Version and the Critical Edition) and 9984 (Andhra-6haratamu) . That is 
sufficient to discourage any attempt at too close a reliance on the data of this 
adhyaya of the Adiparvan. It has been common experience that figures in 
ancient works, if at all complicated, seldom come out right, and the figures 
of the Parvasamgraha are probably no exception to this rule.

in one of many different ways. The most probable suggestion has been that 
they were arrived at, not by actual counting of the stanzas, as we should ordi- 
narily do now, but by computing the extent in some other way. Even now 
we speak of a story of 5000 words or a broadcast talk of 1500 words, and so 
on. The individual words are never counted in such computations ; the 
figures are only approximations. The figures given in our Parvasarhgraha 
chapter must be approximations of that type. They are not “ slokas"’ or 
stanzas as we ordinarily understand them ; but are, properly speaking, what 
are technically known as, “ granthas,’' a grantha being a unit of measurement 
of written matter equal to 32 ak^aras. 

Assuming this to be the case, the first difficulty is that the figures given 
in the lists appear not as round numbers, as we should expect them to be, but 
are apparently correct to the last digit ; for instance, the extent is given not 
as 8000 slokas, but as 7987. We actually come across such figures as these : 
6698, 7998, 8909, 14525, where true approximations would be 6700, 8000, 

8900, 14,500, and so on. The approximation seems to me to have been 

reached by some such process as this. First, an average was obtained by 
counting carefully all letters in a certain number of lines. This average was 
then multiplied by the number of lines in a page and the total number of 
complete pages. The number of “ granthas ” of the last page, which was 
rarely fully written out, seems to have been computed separately, and added 
to the previous total. The grand total of letters (ak^aras) was then divided 
by 32 to give the number of “ slokas or “ granthas,’’ fractions being omit- 
ted. That is how figures like those mentioned above must have been ob- 

tained. They are careful approximations, but approximations all the same. 
Moreover, as has been pointed out by me elsewhere,^ it would be impossible 
to count the exact number of stanzas in a composite text made up of slokas, 
tri§tubhs, “ fancy metres ” and prose passages, which we actually find in many 
of the parvans of the Mahabharata, as for instance in the Adi, Arapyaka and 
Anusasana. 

The figures we find in the Parvasamgraha chapter are fairly old ; we 
cannot say now exactly how old. They are certainly prior to 1000 A. D., 
when tlfe Javanese Bhdrata and the Andhra Bhdratamu were composed ; be- 
cause both these works contain similar lists, which agree in many particulars 
with our list. 

Here are the figures given in three different sources.

kPlC QUESTIONS 11 4^ 

{552} The above is a conspectus of the figures for the adhyayas and slo- 
kas of the eighteen parvans of the Mahabhiarata according to (1) the Criti- 
cal Edition, (2) the Javanese Version,^ and (3) the Southern Recension by 
Professor P. P. S. Sastri. 

Observations on the Figures of the above Table. 

I. Adi : The first figure (8) of the Javanese number for the adhyayas 
of the Adi (818) is obviously wrong ; the other digits agree in the three texts. 
So we may take as correct the figures 218 , *2 which is given us by the Critical 
Edition and Southern Recension, the Vulgate reading (227) being certainly 
a mistake. — The number of slokas is no doubt a problem. I have adopted 
the figures given by the ;§aradia MS. and one “ K ” MS. (Ki),^ which is con- 
firmed by the Rajaguru MS. from Nepal,^ and I am still inclined to suppose 
that that was the original figure. The Javanese and Southern figures 8884 and 
9884 respectively differ by 1000 exactly, the Javanese figure being the same 
as that of the Mid-Indian group (Bengali-Devanagari). 

II. Sabhd : Tbe numbers are here absolutely certain. As regards the 
adhyayas, there is perfect agreement between the three sources, all of them 
giving 72, which is also the exact number of adhyiayas of our Critical Edi- 
tion of the Sabhia now passing through the press. The Vulgate figure (78) 
for the sloka is therefore unquestionably wrong. — The sloka number is also 
certainly 2511, as the Southern Recension, in which the first figure has been 
increased to 4, is demonstrably inflated to make it conform with the inter- 
polated text, and the additional stanzas of the Southern Recension do 
approximately amount to 2()(X). The correct figures for Sabha are therefore 72 
and 2511. 

{553} III. Aranyaka (commonly known as Vana) : As regards the 
adhyayas, the Javanese records 272 against the concordant figure 269 of all 
Indian version^. The latter may be taken to be the right figure, the discre- 
pancy of the Javanese, which is negligible, remaining unexplained. — The 
same is true of the figure for the slokas, the concordant figure (11,664) of 
all Indian versions being the original Parvasamgraha figure. 

IV. Virdfa : The Javanese figure for the adhyayas is unfortunately 
missing. But as our Critical Edition of the Virataparva has successfully 


1 The figures for the Javanese Version have been taken from JfUYNBOLL's Adi- 
parwa, Oudjavaansch prazageschrijt, Gravenhage, 1906. pp. 5-6. The passage is re- 
produced in a note by H. Kern, “ Inhoudsopgave van T Mahabharata in T Ka- 
wi ” in Bijdfagen, set III, Vol. IV, pp. 92-95, Kern has given in this paper a com- 
parative table of the Indian and the Javanese figures. 

2 Kern, op, cit., p. 95 also remarks that the Javanese figure 818 is incorrect, 
and that it ^ould be 218.

identified the adhyiayas on the basis of the colophons given in MSS., there is 
no reason to doubt that the correct figure is 67, as given by the Sanskrit 
Parvaisarhgraha. — The three sources give three different figures for the slokas. 
The Southern Recension is obviously inflated, and may therefore be ignored, 
its figure having been revised — as in Sabha — ^to accord with its interpolated 
text. It is likely that the Javanese translator has confused the Sahskrit words 
for 50 and 15 {pmcasat and pancadaia). The first two digits of the figures 
given in the Critical Edition alnd the Javanese Version do agree. We may 
therefore reasonably assume the original figure to be 2050, which is given by 
the Critical Edition of the Parvasamgraha, though the two last digits natu- 
rally remain somewhat uncertain.^ 

V. Udyoga : The three sources agreeing exactly as regards the num- 
ber of adhydyas of the Udyoga, the figure 186 may be taken as certain. — The 
figures for the slokas, on the other hand, are in a chaotic condition, the three 
texts giving three different figures 6698, 6928, 7998 ; which agree only in 
respect of the last digit ! The figures for the slokas remain, therefore, 
doubtful. 

VI. iBhi^ma : The number of adhydyas in the Bhii§ma is given by the 
Critical Edition and the Javanese Version as 117, but the Southern Recension 
gives their number as 118. In any case, the difference is not very significant, 
and the number may be assumed to be 117 or 118 — There is no such doubt re- 
garding the number of slokas, which is unanimously given as 5884. 

VII. Drom : There is likewise considerable agreement as regards the 
adhydyas and slokas of the Dronja. The adhydya number {554} is 170. — As 
regards the number of slokas, the first two digits (89) are certain. And since 
both the Critical Edition and the Southern Recension agree on the figure 8909, 
that is indicated as the correct figure. The probability in fafvour of this 
figure is strengthened owing to the circumstance that the last two figures of 
the Javanese Version (84) are in all probability due tp contamination with 
the previous sldsa-figure 5884, which ends in 84. We may therefore adopt 
with confidence the concordant figure of the Indian versions 8909, the differ- 
ence between the Javanese and the Indian numbers being 75 ; the 
error is in any event not more than 1 per cent. 

VIII. : The figures for Kanja are exactly of the same type. 
The three sources agree in giving 69 as the number of adhydyas.— The Java- 
nese MSS. give ithe number of slokas as 970, which is obviously wrong, it 
being almost certain that the word for 4000 has been omitted by the scribe 
by oversight f so we get the original Javanese figure as [4]970. We may

nfistake in the Javanese text.

tentatively adopt the figure 4900, on the concordant evidence of Indian ver- 
sions. The difference between the Indian and Javanese figures being only 
70, the discrepancy is only about 1-4 per cent. 

IXi. Salya : In this parvan there is fortunately no doubt about the 
sloka number, which is unanimously given a‘s 3220. — And again, fortunately, 
as regards the adhyaya number, the discrepancy between the Indian (59) and 
Javanese (121) figures is so great that the Javanese may be ruled out as 
hopelessly corrupt. There is another test we may apply, the Javanese figure^ 
(121) for adhyayas gives the average of about 27 slokas to an adhyaya, while 
the Indian average is 54. Now the total number of adhyayas in the Maha- 
bharata i^ supposed to be 2000, and the number of stanzas 100,000 (^ta- 
sahasriaiui® ) , which ogives the average of slokas to an adhyaya as 50 and that 
is much nealrer the average for the Indian figure for the adhyiaya number of 
the 6alyaparvani than the Javanese figure. 

X. Sauptika : The figures for the Sauptika call for no remarks. They 
are uniformaly given in all thel three sources as 18 and 870 respectively. 

£555} XI. Strl : The sources do not agree as regards the number 
of adhyayas, but the Javanese figure (70) which is nearly two and half times 
as large as the Indian (27) is extremely improbable.^ We may therefore 
tentatively take the concordant Indian figure (27) as correct. — The difference 
between the Javanese and Indian figures for the slokas is only five. It would 
seem that the last digit waS lost in the Javanese tradition ; if that be so, the 
correct number is 775, as given unanimously by the Indian MSS. 

XII. Sdnti : The sloka figure for Santi (14,525) is given unanimously 
by all the three of our sources, which is a fortunate coincidence and also a 
remarkable prooif of the reliability of our tradition. The Vulgate figure 
(14,725) for the slokas is positively wrong. — ^There is a difference of only six 
between the Javanese and Indian figures for adhyayas^ the Indian tradition 
giving the figure as 339, the Javanese as 333. The agreement between the 
different Indian versions is a weighty point in favour of 339, which we may 
tentatively assume to be the correct figure. 

XIIL Amddsana : iThe evidence of the Javanese Version is unfortu- 
nately missing, the version ignoring this palrvan altogether, for some reason 
which it is hard to guess. It cannot be argued that it; is included in the 
Sinti, since there is no appreciable increase in the number of adhyayas or

4lokaa of the Javanese Version of the Santi, as there would surely have been, 
had the two parvans been amalgamated as is done sometimes^ There 
being also no agreement between the various Indian versions, the figures for 
both adhyiaysLs and ^lokas of the Anu^sana remain uncertain. 

XIV. Asvamedhika : The number of adhydyas is unanimously given 
as 133, which may therefore be accepted as the correct figure. — ^There is a 
discrepancy as regards the number of slokas : the! Critical Edition gives the 
figure as 3320, while the Javanese and the {556} Southern Recension agree in 
giving the figure} asl 4420, this being one of the rare instances in which the 
Javanese and the Southern Recension agree against the Northern Recension. 
The Southern Recension contains here an additional sub-parvaln, comprising 
23 adhyayas and about 1700 Slokas, known as the Vaismavadharma parvan. 
There is no mention of any such parvan in the list of 100 pavans, given in 
the Pa!rvasamgraha, though some Southern MSS. do insert, in another place, 
a line which mentions the Vaistiavadharma among the contents of the Ai§va- 
medhika. In this Section, Yudhi§thira is instructed by iSr!-K|^a in the 
Dharma of the Vaisiriavas, which seems hardly necessary, after the instruc- 
tion he had received from Bha§ma in more than 21,000 stanzas on general 
Dharma (iS^ti and Anu^sana). The higher Southern number must there- 
fore be rega!rded as due to this inflation, and can in any case not be accepted. 
Nevertheless the peculiar agreement between the Javanese and the Southern 
is a disturbing factor. The number therefore may be regarded as doubtful. 

XV. Asrmuwdsika : There is not much doubt about the adhyayas of 
this parvan, though the Javanese Version has a high figure (92) i against the 
unanimous Indian figure 42, which may be assumed to be the correct figure.^ 
— ^As regards the number of slokas, there is a slight discrepancy of 2 between 
the Critical Edition and the Javanese Version, the former being 1506, the 
latter 1508. But the last digit in this number is not in doubt ; it must be 
six. The Southern Recension gives the figure 1906, which must be regarded 
as extremely doubtful, since even Professor Sastri, who has edited the 
Southern Recension, could not find more than 1108^ stanzas for this parvan.® 
There has been clearly a mistake in the countingl of the stanzas of this par- 

^ It is peihaps worth noticing that so late a commentator as Vadiraja (cf. 
P. K. Gone, ABORI, vol. 17, pp. 200^210, who assigns him to the seventeenth 
century), treats the Santi and Anu^sana as one parvan and has colophons like : 

—which ia quoted by Profeaaor P. S. Sastri in the Introduction to vrf. 17, 
(Anu^sana Parvan, part 2,) p. xxiv. 

2 Kern (lac, cit.) likewise suggests reading 42 for 92 of the Javanese. 

® It is interesting to note, as pointed out by Professor Sastri, Nannaya’s 
Andhra-Bhdratamu gives 1106 as the figure of slokas in the A4raiuav&$ika parvan, 
That probably is due to a fresh count,

van, and the Southern figure being palpably incorrect, we may utilize the 
approximate agreement between the Critical Editirm and the Javanese Ver- 
sion and adopt 1506 aa the probable original Parvasamgraha figure for the 
A^ramavasika. 

XVI. Mausala : All sources agree in giving the number of adhyayas 
aa 8 and the number of slokas aa 300, which may accordingly be taken as the 
correct figures. The text also seems to con-j;557}-tain; actually 300 stanzas. 
Consequently the vulgate reading 320, in the Parvasamgraha chapter, is 
clearly faulty and has been properly rejected. 

XVII. Mahaprasthdnika ; The Javanese figure for the number of 
adhyayas ia missing ; but the Indian sources, including the MSS., uniformly 
divide this short parvan into three adhyayals ; and the unanimous Indian 
reading cannot be called into question.— The number of slokas may also be 
regarded as correctly given in the Critical Edition, which is supported by the 
Southern Recension, though the Javanese Version adds, erroneously, three to 
the number, giving the figure as 123. I surmise that this addition of three to 
the 41oka number is a wrong tran^sition from the adhySya number, which 
is missing in 'die Javanese Version. The Vulgate figure (320) for the slokas 
is absurd and unquesticmably incorrect. 

XVIII,. SvatgoTohatia ; As in the previous case the adhyaya number 
is lost in the Javanese Version ; but there cannot be any doubt that the cor- 
rect figure is 5, which is given by all editions and MSS. of the Mahabharata. 
—The sloka number is unanimously given, by our three sources, as 200, which 
is a sufficiently correct approximation of the actual extent of this last parvan 
of the Great Epic ; and the Vulgate figure (209) may be unhesitatingly 
rejected. 

The table on the following page gives the figures for the adhyayas 
and slokas, book by book, arrived at by a collation of ’ the various extant 
versions of the Parvasarngraha chapter of the Adiparvah.

## A STATEMENT REGARDING THE PROGRESS OF THE CRITICAL EDITION OF THE MAHABHARATA 

Read by the General Editor, Dr. V. S. Sukthankar, on the occasion oj 
the publication of the Udyogaparvan and the presentation of it to 
the Rajasaheb of Aundh, on 6th July, 1940 

Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, 

On this happy and auspicious day, which is the twenty-third anniversary 
of the foundation of this Institute, I am glad to announce the publication of 
the edition of the* Udyogaparvan by Professor Dr. S. K. De of the Dacca 
University, which is volume six of our Critical Edition of the Mahabhlarata. 
This is, as you are no doubt aware, the third parvan to be completed by us. 
The Adiparvan, edited by myself, was completed in 1933. It was followed 
three years later by the Virataparvan edited by Professor Dr. Raghu ViRA 
of the Sanatan Dharma College, Lahore. And now we have the Udyoga- 
parvan, which, I hope, will testify to our industry and perseverance. 

The amount of matter published during the last 21 years, since the com- 
mencement of the work in 1919, may appear to you small. And it is a fact 
that some editions of the Mahabhlarata which were begun long after we had 
started have already been long completed. But you must not confuse those 
editions with ours. Those other editions implied only work for compositors 
and proof-readers. Their procedure, which is very simple, is this. Older 
editions of thdv Mahabharata are put in the hands of compositors, who pro- 
ceed to manufacture a new edition, faithfully copying, in every detail, all the 
old mistakes and adding some of their own making,, in the bargain. 

When this Institute undertook to bring out a Critical Edition of the 
Mahabharata, it was not meant to bring out a new edition in this time- 
honoured way, which has made the term Indian edition a synonym of a 
bad edition.’' In Indian editions of the past, the paper was bad, the type 
was bad, the ink was bad, and the text also was generally bad. I do not 
wish to say that we have produced an ideal edition of the Mahabharata, but 
I do maintain that we have taken a distinct step forward in that direction, 
and that our work has marked an appreciable advance in the technique of 
the editing of Sanskrit texts. And when I say that I am giving you not my 
own opinion but the considered opinion of savants, published repeatedly in 
the course erf lengthy and elaborate reviews of our edition, in high-dass and 
authoritative Journals throughout the world. The edition has been before 
the world of scholars for nearly fifteai years, and there has been a steady 



432 A STATEMENT I^GARiDING PROGRESS OF CRIT. ED. OF THE MBH. 

chorus of enthusiastic approbation greeting the appearance of every successive 
fascicule, whose publication is eagerly awaited by Indologists in all parts of 
the world. 

When we say we are bringing out an edition of the Mahabharata, we 
are really considerably underrating our own work. It is not merely a text- 
edition that we are preparing. What we have undertaken is a research into 
the Mahabharata manuscript tradition, which, you will realize, is a very dif- 
ferent thing and which — let me emphasize — has now been undertaken for the 
first time in the long history of our Great Epic. 

Let us glance for a moment at the history of the project. Since 1897 
there has been a steady and persistent demand for a critical edition of the 
Mahabharata, which was wanted, as the late Professor Winternitz put it, 
“as the only sound basis for all Mahabharata studies, nay, for all studies 
connected with the epic literature of India.” In 1904, as a result of the 
agitation which was kept up in Europe by certain Indologists, the Interna- 
tional Association of the Academies of Europe and America undertook the 
work. And for that purpose, even some money was collected by the Sans- 
kritists in England, through the Secretary of State for India, from certain 
sources in India, and the amount was placed in the hands of Trustees in 
England, which is still lying there, in the name of the Trustees, in some 
English bank. The last great European War put an end to this project of 
a European edition of the Mahabharata, which ended as a matter of fact 
without achieving anything beyond son^ preliminary work. After that war, 
this Institute undertook the work, making a fresh start. The difficulty was 
of course the money. What really made it possible for the Institute to launch, 
some twenty years ago, this gigantic and ambitious scheme was the promise 
made by Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, Raja Saheb of Aundh,-~-our 
worthy guest of this evening — ^to contribute a lakh of rupees to the Maha- 
bharata Publication Fund. Sir Ramkrishna Bhandarkar, the then senior- 
most Acarya of Indology in Western India, w*as naturally consulted. He is 
reported to have said that the project was certainly worth undertaking, but 
it would cost ten lakhs of rupees ; and if was no use undertaking the work 
unless there were prospects of raising that sum. When he was assured that 
that amount would be found, he agreed to sptmsor the undertaking, and as a 
matter of fact himself inaugurated it 'here, in this hall, in April 1919, by 
writing down the mantra of the Great Epic, ndrdyanam nafnskjtya etc. The 
Institute, it may be observed, undertook then to prepare an edition in which 
all the different versions of the epic have been turned to account and which 
will meet with the highest requirements of critical scholarship. 

With that our work has been chalked out for us. It divides itself natu- 
rally into five stages : (1) search for old and reliable MSS. ; (2) collation 
of the MSS. ; (3) constitution of the text with the help of the collations; 



A STATEMENT REGARDING PROGRESS OF CRIT. ED. OF THE MBH. 433 

(4) preparation of the critical apparatus, to be printed along with the consti- 
tuted text ; and, finally, (5) seeing the matter through the press. 

From the published volumes you will see that on every page from a half 
to two-thirds of the space is taken up by the critical notes, which give a very 
detailed account of the M9S. examined and collated and which form the bulk 
of our evidence for the text. It is this which necessitates laborious work and 
demands endless patience ; and its completion for the parvans so far publish- 
ed is, I consider, the abiding achievement of our edition. Our edition thus 
gives you not only a text, a critical text, but also a digest of the MSS. tradi- 
tion of the Mahabharata extending over nearly 2000 years. I may observe 
that in the case of every text, when the manuscript tradition fluctuates to any 
extent, it is only a careful study of the collations of the MSS., and nothing 
else, that can give you an authentic text ; just as when there is a dispute 
between two or more litigants an impartial judge trying the case would decide 
it only after examining the depositions and hearing the evidence of all the 
parties and their witnesses. 

I am glad to say that the method which has been worked out by the 
Institute for dealing with the Mahabharata textual problem has commended 
itself to all scholars who are competent to pass an opinion on the merits of 
the question. Professor Walter Ruben, of the University of Ankara, who 
has made a close study of Ramayana MSS., has declared that the same me- 
thod may be applied, mutatis mutandis, to the Ramayapa also. Appreciative 
reviews of our edition, as I remarked already, have been published during 
the last thirteen years not only in Indian, but also in English, French, Ger- 
man, Italian, Czecho-Slovakian, Polish and American Journals. The scheme 
has been commended by the International Oriental Congress, by the All- 
India Oriental Conference and by many of the learned bodies specializing in 
Oriental studies. There have been heard a few dissentient voices, but they 
are mostly of persons who do not know the ABC of textual criticism and 
who have never even seen a Mahabharata MS. in their whole life. Such 
uninformed criticism of self-styled scholars we may safely ignore. 

But we need not rest on the judgment of other scholars alone, for a 
justification of our method. The correctness of the method adopted by us 
has been vindicated now by independent and objective evidence. The now 
famous Rajaguru MS., discovered in Nepal by the Rajaguru Pandit Hema- 
RAJ, which is nearly 800 years old and is therefore the? oldest extant MS. of 
the Adi'parvan, confirms not only many of the disputed readings of the critical 
text but justifies even some of the emendations made by me, which is — it 
will be admitted— unimpeachable evidence of the correctness of the method 
we havd been following. 

We have completed now in this fashion, as I said, three whole bodts of 
the Mahabharata : the Adiparvan, the Virataparvan and the Udyogaparvan. 



434 A STATEMENT REGARDING PROGRESS OF CRIT. ED. OF THE MBH. 

As for the other parvans, you are no doubt aware that the Sabhaparvan has 
been assigned to Professor Frankling Eogerton of Yale University, who came 
over to Poona in 1938 in order to examine for himself the MSS. of the Sabha 
which had been collated by the Institute for him, and also to give* the finish- 
ing touches to his edition in consultation with me. His work has been lying 
with him ready for publication and would have been sent to the press long 
ago, but for this war, which is hampering inter-communication and delaying 
the publication of the parvan. 

The next parvan we took in hand is the Vanaparvan (or rather the 
Aranyakaparvan, to give it its correct name) , which is being edited by myself. 
It is passings through the press as rapidly as we can take it through. It will 
comprise about 11(X) pages of our edition, of which nearly 7(X) pages have 
already been printed off. I hope to finish it — if nothing untoward happens 
to hinder its progress— by the end of this year. 

As regards the Bhismaparvan, which has been assigned to Rao Bahadur 
Dr. Belvalkar, I am glad to report that considerable advance has been 
made by the editor in the preparation of the press-copy. Not only has Dr. 
Belvalkar completed his draft of the constituted text, but the compilation 
of the critical notes has been taken in hand and is proceeding apace. 

When the Bhismaparvan is completed, which we hope to do in a little 
over a year from now, we shall have completed nearly 45 per cent, of this 
gigantic work. You will realize the amount of work that will be accomplisli- 
ed when I tell you that we shall have critically dealt with a little under 40,(X>0 
slokas and printed about 4500 pages of our edition. 

The collation work has made considerable advance and is a long way 
ahead of the publication. We possess now nearly complete collations of all 
the parvans up to the Anu^sana, which means that we have nearly finished 
that part of our task ; because there remains now only the short tail, consist- 
ing of some easy and unimportant parvans, which I am confident, will offer 
no great difficulties either to the collator or to the editor. 

1 have given you, gentlemen, a very brief outline of the main work done 
under the name of the Critical Edition of the Mahiabharata. Our work has, 
moreover, given rise to many other sul>&idiary undertakings, which are being 
carried out by different scholars, in different places, to some extent independ- 
ently of our work here. 

Noteworthy among these works are the following four. Our edition has 
given to a student of the Dacca University a subject for a Ph.D. thesis en- 
titled '‘Studies in Epic Grammatical Forms,” which is an essay towards the 
compilation of epic grammar and which is based entirely on our edition of 
the Adiparvan. Our Mahabharata researches have further inspired another 
studmt of the epic to submit to the Bombay University a Ph.D. thesis oh 



A STATEMENT REGARDING PROGRESS 6F ORIT. ED. OF THE MBH. 43B 

the Bhrgvahgirasa element in the Mahabharata. There is a third Ph.D. 
dissertation for which a subject has been furnished by our edition. The 
subject is the phenomenon of case-variation in the epic dialect, which is being 
investigated by a student of Dr. S. M. Katre at the Deccan College Research 
Institute. A Spanish professor, Dr. Jose Canedo, I understand, has planned 
an elaborate grammatical work on Epic Syntax, which has made considerable 
advance and which would have been published by now but for this war, which, 
as you know, is paralyzing all literary and scholarly activity in Europe. 

I shall pass on to some minor studies which have arisen out of our Maha- 
bharata work. Arising out of his study of the Sabhaparvan, Professor Edger- 
TON has recently published three important papers. One of them is about 
the mention of the city of Rome in the Digvijaya section of the Sabhaparvan, 
which is the first time that a clear reference has been found in Indian litera- 
ture to the name of the capital of ancient Italy, Roma. Another paper by 
him deals with the question of “ Epic Tii^ubh and its Hypermetric Varieties.” 
A third paper by him' concerns the reading and interpretation of a Sabha- 
parvan! stanza, an old crux, which has become famous as the parable of the 
“ Goat and "the Knife ” (“ ajakrpamya ”) . 

In connection with his study of the BMsmaparvan, which is being edited 
by him, Eh. Belvalkar has published several valuable papers, among them 
the “Miscarriage of the attempted stratification of the Bhagavad^ta,*' the 
" Kashmiri Version of the Bhagavad^ta,” and the “ Cosmographical Episode 
in the Mahabharata and the Padmapuraina.” He has other papers in prepa- 
ration. 

You will thus see, gentlemen, that the time and the money spent during 
the last twenty years of silent and arduous work of the Mahabharata Depart- 
ment of the Institute have not been spent in vain. The Institute has not 
only brought out critical editions of three of the parvans of the Mahabharata, 
but it has built up an independent school of textual criticism and perfected 
the technique of the editing of Sanskrit texts. It has opened out new vistas 
of work with immense possibilities, which will occupy Indologists, I imagine, 
for at least half a century, if not more* It has stimulated vivid interest in 
Mahabharata studies, which were languishing for want of a critical edition 
of the text. They are carried out now on a sound basis and in a scientific 
spirit, differing conspicuously from the somewhat gassy ebullitions of previous 
writers on the subject of the Mahabharata. 

The Critical Edition of the Mahabharata is thus a comprehensive and 
many-sided literary activity, with ramifications in many directions. It is 
this aspect of our Mahabharata work, I imagine, which impressed the British 
Academy in London and which induced that august body to vote a grant to 
our Mahabharata Publication Fund in order to show its appreciation of the 



436 A STATt;MENT REGARDING PRCX5RESS OF CRIT. ED. OF THE MEH. 

work which is being done by the Institute and which is not merely of national 
but international interest and importance. 

It is gratifying to note that we have all along been staunchly supported 
in our enterprise financially by the Governments, the Princes and the People 
of India, — and at least by one University, the University of Bombay. During 
the last twenty years they have contributed in the aggregate some Rs. 3,50,000. 
That is a considerable sum, you will admit. But much more will be needed 
to complete the work. As we progress and inspire confidence among the 
people, who will begin to realize the great literary and scientific importance 
of this project, more help will, I am confident, be coming forth. Indeed there 
are indications that these are no false hopes. As the Secretary of the Insti- 
tute, Dr. Dandekar, has just told you, the Sir Dorabjee Tata Charities 
have only recently, despite the prevailing financial strigency, sanctioned a 
grant of Rs, 5,000 for the Mahabhfirata work, which has been a welcome addi- 
tion to our attenuated resources, and for which we* are extremely grateful 
to the Trustees of that Fund. Some of our annual subsidies, which had been 
granted for a fixed period of years, have expired. We have been endeavour- 
ing to get them renewed, and the response has been very encouraging, not- 
withstanding the chaos into which the? war has thrown our national economy. 
Of the patrons whom we have thus approached, the first one to respond was 
the Chief Saheb of Ichalkaranji, who, as the Secretary has just announced, 
has kindly promised to continue his patronage. This is a great encouragement 
to us and we are most grateful to the Chief Saheb, who is a staunch patron 
of learning and a great friend of all earnest students. On behalf of the 
Mahabharata Editorial Board I must also express our most grateful thanks 
to Shrimant Raja Saheb of Phaltan, who in response to our urgent appeal 
has, as announced by the Secretary, been pleased to continue his annual 
grant of Rs. 500 for the MahaWiiarata work for a further period of five years. 
If the work is not finished by then, we shall again have to approach the kind 
Raja Saheb, who, I am sure, will again be pleased to renew the grant. Small 
though these donations be which we have now secured, there is no need to 
lose courage. They are indicative of good-will and confidence, which are 
worth a great deal. When the war clouds have passed away, better days 
will surely dawn for us ; when the thoughts of men will again turn to the pre- 
sefrvation and growth of cultural values. We shall then have again, I am 
oanfident, the same share of bounty from our patrons of learning which we 
havei hitherto enjoyed and which will help us to cany to completion one of 
the most important of our national projects. 


/uly 6, 1940. 



A STATEMENT REGARDING THE PROGRESS OF THE CRITICAL EDITION OF THE MAHABHARATA 

(Read by Dr. V. S. Sukthankar, on the occasion of the presentation of the 
Araijyakaparvan to Shrimant Rajasaheb of Aundh on 5th January 1943.) 

Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, 

It is now more than seventeen years since I took over charge of the 
Mahabharata work and reorgani 2 ed, on somewhat different lines, this De- 
partment of the Institute, having profited by the experiences and experi- 
ments of my predecessor, the late lamented Mr. Utgikar. During this 
interval the Institute has published Critical Editions of four complete Books 
of the Mahabharata ; Adipatvan (1933), Virataparvan (1936), the Udyo- 
gaparvan (1940), and now the Arapyakaparvan (1942). These four 
parvahs comprise, according to the Parvasaimgrahaparvan, about 28,400 
slokas. In addition to this a fasdcule of the Sabhgfrarvan edited by Prof. 
Franklin Edgerton of Yale University (U. S. A.), which has been ready 
for some time and which could be takeni up for printing only owing to the 
very generous special grant of Rs. 10,000 recently made by the Government 
of Bombay, is being published today. Furthermore, the press-ct^y of the 
Bhismaparvan, which is being edited by Rao Bahadur Dr. S. K. Belvalkar, 
is almost ready and is now undergoing final revision at the hands of its 
editor. It will be ready for being sent to the press very shortly. In fact 
the work is advanced as far that it can be got ready for the press within 
three months. But can we send it to the press? Not unless we can find 
a generous donor prepared to pay for the cost of the printing of the new 
volume, in these days when the cost of printing has almost doubled. The 
present financial situaticm of the Department is such that we can just rngnagf 
to get the press-copies ready ; but the large world of schdars outside the 
walls of this Institute, eagerly awaiting the appearance of our now-famous 
yellow-covered fascicules, must unfortunately be kept waiting until more 
funds are available. 

Any way, during the past 17 years the Institute has critically dealt with 
the first 6 parvans of the Great Epic : the Adi, Sabha, Araajyaka, Virata, 
Udyoga and Bhisma. The six parvans make up a total of about 36,800 
3okas, out of an aggregate of 82,150 Slokas, a portion which is approxi- 
mately 45% of the entire Mahabh&rata, excluding, of course, the Harivaihla, 
which I have kept out of my calculation in order not to frighten you too 
much. Even this is tio mean achievement, I think. The part of the epic 



438 A STATEMENT REGARPING PROGRESS OF CRIT. EI>. OP THE MBH. 

critically dealt with so far is, I imagine, in bulk about four times as great 
as the Greek epics, Iliad and Odyssey put together and one and a half times 
as our Rami^yaiua. 

That a work of this nature and these din^nsions is not one man's job 
is very very evident* Many friends, collaborators, sympathisers and patrons 
have contributed to such measure of success as has been achieved so far, 
and they include among them princes and potentates, curators and librarians, 
printers and parvan-editors, not to speak of the General Editor and his 
modest staff of collators in the background. Surely, the most potent among 
these multifarious contributory factors have been our generous patrons, who, 
out of regard for this venerable monument of Indian antiquity, this great 
and lustrous heritage of Bhiaratavar§a', have in the past liberally supplied 
the Institute, through all these! years, with funds to carry on this costly but 
vital work. 

Ladies and Gentlemen, I must tell you frankly this is a costly work. 
All good work costs money now-a-days I Good mahuscripts cost money. 
Good printing costs money. Good editors cost money. 

The British natic«i once paid out one million pounds for one rare Ms. 
of the Bible. Would India pay a similar amount for any book ? Why not ? 
Are the British people greater lovers of books, greater lovers of literature, 
greater lovers of religion, greater lovers of knowledge than we Indians ? Cer- 
tainly not. Great Britain is a small nation, a young naticMi, compared to India'. 
And our love of knowledge, love of literature, love of scriptures, is greater. 
We are the inheritors of the great book, this “book of books" composed 
at a time when Great Britain was not yet entered on the map of civilized 
nations. And the entire cost of making this Critical Edition of the Maha- 
bharata is only one million! rupees — and not pounds — ^which is only l/15th 
of the cost of the Bible. We haVe collected and spent already 5 lakhs of 
rupees. We want now only 5 lakhs more. And we are not pessimistic 
about it. We have no reason to be that. When the war clouds have passed 
away, better days will surely dawn for us ; then the thoughts of men will 
again turn to the preservation and growth of cultural values. We shall 
then, I am confident, enjoy the same generous support from patrons of 
learning as we have hitherto enjoyed and that will help us to carry to com- 
pletion one of the naost important of our national projects. 

If you' want me to point out to you just one: man who is responsible 
for origiiialting and furthering the project, he is sitting in front of you, I 
mean, Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, the Raja of Aundh. 

The question may occur to you. Is it worth all this expenditure? 
Whether wd realize it or not, we still stand under the spdl of the MahS- 
bh^rata. Amid the deepest strands that woven in tbd thread of oqr 



A Statement regarding progress of crit. Ed. of the Mbh, 43& 

civilization, there is more than wie that is dravm originally from Bharata- 
var§a and from Sanskrit literature. And well in the centre of this vast mass 
of literature, there stands this deathless, traditional book of divine inspiration, 
unapproachable and far removed from possibilities of human competition. 

There is a danger that in our pseudo-scientific mood, we may be 
tempted to discard this great book, thinking that we have outgrown it. That 
would be a capital blunder ! That would in fact mean nothing but an 
indication of our will to commit suicide, national suicide, the signal of our 
national extinction. For never was truer word spoken than when the late 
German Indologist Hermann Oldenberg said that “in the Mahabharata 
breathe the united soul of India, and the individual souls of her people.” 
And why is that ? Because the MaMbharata is the national saga of India. 
It is, in other words, the content of our collective unconscious. And just 
for that reasm it refuses to be discarded. We must therefore grasp this 
great book with both hands and face it squarely. Then we shall recognize 
that it is our past which has prolonged itself into the present. We ari it : 
I mean the real WE ! Shall we be guilty of strangling our own soul ? 
NEVER!
