title = "devatA chitra saMgraha"

+++
The eldest son of the great king of Nepal, pR^ithivi nArAyaNa shahA (who
defeated the British and founded the Nepal Kingdom until its recent
destruction by Marxists), pratApa siMha, compiled a voluminous work on
the mantra shAstra during his brief life. As a companion to this a
collection of pictures for the dhyAna-s on various deities was prepared
by the artists in Nepal. A copy of this collection with R1’s father is
of considerable interest in terms of tradition Hindu dhyAna art of which
not many old samples survive. That this Hindu tradition was very old is
shown by the chitra-kalA section of the viShNudharmottara. Here the
bhArgava mArkaNDeya gives a lecture on drawing and painting and
specifically provides the principal lakShaNas that should depicted in
paintings of devatAs. Most of the drawings in this collection are pretty
exquisite and depict the following deities:  
1\) vinAyaka: 1 headed, 4 armed in bhadrAsana with chakra and 3-looped
pAsha.  
2\) sUrya  
3\) viShNu: seated with his two wives standing on either side. The
lakShmi-s have a horizontal tilaka in addition to the bindu.  
4\) matsya: Strangely with 2 horns and a fish face but arms holding
chakra and gada  
5\) kUrma: shown like the turtle Chelydra serpentina, and grabbing a
crocodile by the neck with the mouth. Having a peculiar chakra- probably
close to how the real chakras were used with a central rod.  
6\) varAha: 8-arms with various weapons, globe on the tusks, in a
war-like pose.  
7\) nR^isiMha with two lakShmi-s  
8\) vAmana: young boy standing on moon.
