`भुग्न-ग्रीवम् भुज-बिस-लतासक्तवक्त्राम्बुजाभिस् सस् अयम् सेनान्वयनृपस् इति त्रासकौतूहलाभ्याम् विष्वक्-पीतस्-कुवलयदलश्रेणिदीर्घैस् कटाक्षैस् पौरस्त्रीभिस् सपदि नगरीविद्रवे विद्विषाम् यस्`

The women of the cities of his enemy run quickly  
to drink him in from all sides,  
With their arms like fibrous stalks  
fastened to faces of water born lotuses ,  
Glancing as long at him as the lines of water-lilies  
the bend their necks and say “Oh, so this is the ruler of the Sena
Dynasty!”

  
`यस्य औत्सुक्यात् असमसमरालोकनोन्मादभाजाम्+ स्वर्गस्त्रीणाम्+अपरिगणितस्रस्तचेलाञ्चलानाम्+मन्ये धाराचतुरतुरगोत्खातरेणुप्रतानस्+सद्योलग्नस्+स्तनकलशयोस्+अन्तरीयत्वम्+एति|`

The innumerous ladies of heaven gone mad by their curiosity  
Watch his battles of which there is no match  
Little do they know the drapes of their robes fell off!  
I like to think the dust excavated by the galloping horses  
It diffuses immediately onto both the large round breasts on their
chests,  
Acting as their new robes,
