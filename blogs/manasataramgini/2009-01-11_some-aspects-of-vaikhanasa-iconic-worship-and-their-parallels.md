title = "Some aspects of vaikhAnasa iconic worship and their parallels"

+++
The spread of iconoclastic Zarathushtran and Abrahamistic cults over
Eurasia have all but destroyed most traces of ancient iconic worship. In
the midst of this destruction, which relentlessly continues under the
crescent and the cross banners, one tradition alone preserves an ancient
strain of the Eurasian systems of iconic worship. This is the system of
the vaikhAnasa-s, a miniscule group of taittirIyaka-s who are officiants
at several major viShNu temples of the drAviDa, Andhra and karnATa
countries. The inner worship at richest shrine of modern bhArata,
ve\~NkaTAdri, represents one of those old unbroken vaikhAnasa lineages,
so also several temples in the drAviDa country like kapisthala and
chitrakUTa (of Chidambaram). We had earlier pointed out that the
vaikhAnasa gR^ihya sUtra system of domestic viShNu worship, closely
parallels vidhi-s for iconic worship of deities found in the bodhAyana
gR^ihya sUtra and the atharvaveda parishiShTha-s and represent the
earliest surviving textual layer of iconic worship among the
Indo-Aryans. The rituals of iconic worship followed in these texts
suggested that a distinctive form of the iconic worship emerged in the
late vedic period with the following key features: 1) ritual actions
relating to bathing, installation and empowerment of the icon with
specific vedic formulae, modeled after the ritual actions using yajuSh
formulae deployed during a shrauta rite 2)vedic offerings made into the
aupAsana fire for invocation of a deity, resembling the regular
non-iconic vedic household worship of deities. The vaikhAnasa-s
additionally also possess a system related to their household worship of
viShNu icons that is used specifically for worship of viShNu installed
in public temples. The close parallelism of the temple and household
worship of viShNu suggests that the earliest temple worship emerged
within the vedic tradition as a mirror of the basic household system,
even as the shrauta (\~temple) and gR^ihya(\~household) systems mirror
each other in the older vedic layers.

The uniqueness of the vaikhAnasa temple worship is marked by the
vaikhAnasa mantra-prashna, which contains several accented mantra-s of
clearly vedic nature that are found in no other yajuSh saMhitA, but used
exclusively in temple worship. This feature suggests that the vaikhAnasa
system of temple worship is indeed ancient and that it predates the
emergence of tantrika temple worship of the vaiShNava, shaiva and
kaumAra variety. Indeed we find precursors for the tantrika worship in
the vaikhAnasa system. The deployment of unique vedic mantra-s
exclusively in the vaikhAnasa temple worship suggests that these actual
belong to the phase of worship of images in the oldest temples, the
chaitya-s, which were present before the nagna and the tathagata made
their advent. While the extant vaikhAnasa mantra prashna might show some
evidence for latter tampering, the core of it is archaic. The prashna-s
1-4 (vaikhAnasa saMhitA) are mantra-s for the gR^ihya rituals and
parallel the bodhAyana and Apastamba mantra prashna-s of other
taittirIyaka-s and the mantra brAhmaNa of the sAmavedin-s. The prashna-s
5-8 are devoted to the iconic worship of viShNu, his gaNa-s and other
deva-s installed in the temple. The proper understanding of the temple
worship using these mantra-s requires a knowledge of the saMhitA
traditions of the vaikhAnasa-s attributed to atri, bhR^igu, kAshyapa and
marIchi. I had the chance to study a ritual hand book compiled by a
great medieval vaikhAnasa ritualist known of nR^isimha vAjapeyin. This
lucidly provides the core of temple worship in a very succinct form. The
author is reputed by tradition to have been a spectacular triple scholar
who was simultaneously well-versed in vaikhAnasa temple ritual, vedic
shrauta rituals (he performed the great vAjapeya himself) and tantrika
mantra shAstra of various kinds. In the below descriptions we shall
follow his description of ritual injunctions and accompanying mantra-s.

The vaikhAnasa is enjoined to recite vedic mantra-s, perform prANAyAma,
japa, brahmayaj\~na and vaishvadeva homa similar to a smArta before
performing any temple action. But the vaikhAnasa is distinguished by the
recitation of a unique very late vedic sUkta, Atma sUkta. In addition to
his daily pArAyaNa with the Atma-sUkta the vaikhAnasa ritualist also
deploys the same sUkta just before he prepares to invoke viShNu into the
movable image.

An examination of the AtmasUkta shows that there is a mix of typical
vedic and classical features suggesting its composition towards the end
of the vedic productivity, like the nArAyaNa sUkta of the taittirIya-s:
The accents show some differences between the reciters from the drAviDa
and Andhra countries. Further, some accents are not consistent with the
vedic accents just as in the case of late vaiShNava material in the
taittirIya AraNyaka. There are words typical of the classical language
such as satataM and shruti-smR^iti. Yet it shows vedic elements – the
underlying Chandas in large part is a triShTubh (I have arranged it to
illustrate that). Importantly, it seems to have no mention of the
vibhava-s or avatAra-s of the sAtvata system such as vAsudeva and his
vyUha-s. Instead it mentions only 3 avatAra-s explicitly: varAha –
identified with vyAna; kapila with vyAna; hayashIrSha with apAna. Some
modern vaikhAnasa AchArya-s state that the phrase “yat sarvam ashnAty
ajaras samagra(g)M” actually refers to nR^isiMha. The only avatara-s
that find mention in the floral worship of icons of various devata-s in
the inner and surrounding shrines of a vaikhAnasa temple, according to
the core ritual are: kapila, varAha, nR^isiMha, vAmana/trivikrama and
hayAtmaka (hayashIrSha) (the penultimate one having two separate
images). There is no mention of the dashAvatara-s in the core vaikhAnasa
daily ritual manuals. They are only found in the bhR^igu saMhitA’s
kriyAkhANDa. This suggests that the Atma-sUkta preceded the classic
paurANic period and was possibly also before the sAtvata system. It also
suggests that original avatAra system as recognized by the vaikhAnasa-s
only had the above 5 avatAra-s. Of these it is not clear if kapila was
originally considered an avatAra or merely a respected muni of the early
vaikhAnasa tradition.. It is also possible nR^isiMha, vAmana and
trivikrama are considered among the 8 vidyeshvara-s of the vaikhAnasa
system – indicated in the invocatory formula in the VMP: 5.1.139.9.
These vidyeshvara-s might be an early attestation of a class of deities
whose cognates were also adopted by the shaiva saiddhAntika tantra-s
most probably from their pAshupata precursors.

The main function of the AtmasUkta appears to be the identification of
the officiant with viShNu in his cosmic form. This cosmic form of viShNu
is implied by the identification of viShNu with the puruSha – the
puruSha sUkta is recited after the AtmasUkta in vaikhAnasa practice. In
addition to the AtmasUkta the vaikhAnasa-s have the brahmanyAsa rite
which serves an identical purpose and is performed before bathing the
image of viShNu. The brahmanyAsa is not found in the vaikhAnasa gR^ihya
sUtra. It is mentioned in a rather abbreviated form relative to the
modern performance in the original saMhitA-s of atri, bhR^igu, kAshyapa
and marIchi. In modern performance is shows several tAntrika elements
that are found nowhere in the core saMhitA-s which instead use
distinctive vaikhAnasa-specific mantra-s. This suggests that
brahma-nyAsa was perhaps specifically derived with the emergence of the
vaikhAnasa temple ritual. It might have inspired the early evolution of
tantrika mantra-mArga and has subsequently been overrun by laterally
transferred elements of the tAntrika mantra mArga.

The core brahma-nyAsa comprises of a\~Nga-nyAsa, bIja-dhyAna, kara-nyAsa
and brahmaikvatvaM. While the modern performances have the usual
formulae of hR^idayAya namaH etc. there is no evidence they were used in
the old vaikhAnasa ritual. In fact they do not seem to appear in any of
the old saMhitA-s, which only specify the basic mantra-s for each
nyAsa.

\[This kavacha formula might be translated approximately as: By the
deva-s weapons I block \[the attackers\], by the brahman power of
mantra-s, by the manly strength of Isha(i.e. rudra) and by the heat of
the bhR^igu-s and a\~Ngirasa-s I pervade every thing. The last phrase is
reminiscent of the yajurvedic incantation during the laying of the
kapAla-s: bhR^igUNAM a\~NgirasAM tapasA tapyadhvaM.\]

vAma netra: chandro .asi yaj\~no .asi yaj\~nAyAdhAnam asi yaj\~nasya

Then the officiant carries out bIja-dhyAna by meditating upon the
Adi-bIja: a  
Some vaikhAnasa-s hold that the akAra bIja should be surrounded by OM-s
– this is found in the atri saMhitA and bhR^igu kriyAdhikAra. Then the
ritualist performs karanyAsa by invoking the devatA-s: AbhuraNya, vidhi,
yaj\~naM, brahmA, indra on the five fingers. Then he performs the
brahmaikvatva dhyAna with the formula:  
antar asminn ime lokAH antar vishvaM idaM jagat | brahmaiva bhUtAnAM
jyeSThaM tena ko .arhati spardhitum ||  
This formula resembles the atharva vedic kANDa tarpaNa formula
(AV-vulgate 19.22.21 and 19.23.30)

Now these vaikhAnasa practices represent an early version of the
eponymous rites performed in the tantrika system. But they can also be
compared to two other rites: One earlier than all these rituals — the
vedic formulae for the identification of the body with the immortal
devatA-s: the mantra-s beginning with “agnir me vAchiH shritaH …”
(kAThaka 1.8.4-9). The second one is the shaiva ritual of nyAsa, which
in turns occurs as the short laghunyAsa and the long mahAnyAsa. Such
identifications of parts of the body with devatA-s are also seen in the
medical saMhitA-s, like that of charaka. The laghunyAsa includes within
it the vedic mantra-s beginning with agnir me vAchiH shritaH. The modern
laghunyAsa and mahAnyAsa rites might be used in temples but there is no
evidence to suggest that they were originally used thus. In fact they
appear to be purely household rites for the worship of rudra by a
yajamAna and his family. We have no clear way of dating when these texts
were composed relative to other texts either. However, tradition holds
that there are two forms of mahAnyAsa – the tAntrika version attributed
to the rAkShasa rAvaNa and the vaidika version attributed to bodhAyana.
The core of the mahAnyAsa is entirely vaidika and so also the laghunyAsa
and these nyAsa-s are mainly performed by taittirIyaka-s. We propose
based on the parallels to the vaikhAnasa ritual that these nyAsa-s
represent the proto-shaiva versions of their own nyAsa-s. It is quite
likely that this system of nyAsa-s are also linked to the period of the
emergence of the medical saMhitA-s when they identified parts of the
body with deities and are the precursors of the classical tAntrika
nyAsa-s. The taittirIya tradition may be seen as the nidus of their
emergence. These early vaidika nyAsa-s in turn emerged from the early
shrauta ritual of saMbandha with the agnir me vAchiH. But the early
development of the temple ritual amongst the vaikhAnasa-s resulted in
these nyAsa-s being incorporated into their larger system of public
iconic worship.
