title = "Āryabhaṭa and his sine table"

+++
Everyone and his son have written about Āryabhaṭa and his sine table.
Yet we too do this because sometimes the situation arises where you have
to explain things clearly to a layman who might have some education but
is unfamiliar with the intricacies of, or in some cases lacks the
correct perspective on, Hindu tradition.

Regarding him Hindu tradition states:  
siddhānta-pañcaka-vidhāv api dṛg viruddham  
auḍhyoparāga-mukha-khecara-cāra-kḷptau |  
sūryaḥ svayaṃ kusumapury abhavat kalau tu  
bhūgolavit kulapa āryabhaṭābhidhānaḥ ||  
When the predictions of the five siddhānta-s and observations of
conjunctions, occultations and setting times of planets began to
conflict the solar deity himself incarnated in Kusumapuri in the Kali
age in the form of the geographer and head professor Āryabhaṭa.

The great astronomer and mathematician Āryabhaṭa-I’s, who was seen by
some Hindus as the incarnation of the solar deity, was born in 476 CE in
the Aśmaka country (close to modern Maharashtra-Telangana border). He
was active at Pāṭaliputra in the golden age of Hindu power during the
reign of emperor Budhagupta. He is known to have composed at least two
works the Āryabhaṭīya, which was an update of the old
Svāyambhuva-siddhānta tradition, and the Āryabhaṭa-siddhānta which was
modeled after the old Sūrya siddhānta. We are informed by Bhāskara-I
that in his Āryabhaṭīya Āryabhaṭa was following in the footsteps of the
great astronomer of antiquity Pārāśarya, who was likely one of the early
promulgators of the Svāyambhuva tradition. Āryabhaṭa as head professor
is said to have had the following notable students: Lāṭadeva, Niśaṅku,
Pāṇḍuraṅgasvamin and Prabhākara. Sadly their works have been lost. Of
them Lāṭadeva is recorded in old Hindu scientific tradition as having
written several works including on Hellenistic astronomy and likely
succeeded Āryabhaṭa as the ācārya of his school.

Thus, Āryabhaṭa’s work is the earliest surviving record of one of the
most important Hindu scientific traditions, namely that of
Svāyambhuva-s. In the manner of the scientists of old Hindu
naturalistic tradition Āryabhaṭa presents the acquisition of scientific
knowledge as the attainment of brahmavidyā:  
daśa-gītika-sūtram idam bhū-graha-caritam bha-pañjare jñātvā |  
graha-bha-gaṇa-paribhramaṇaṃ sa yāti bhittvā param brahma ||  
Having known these sūtra-s in the ten verses composed in the gītika
meter providing the motions of the Earth and the planets within the
celestial sphere \[pañjara: marked by the coordinate grid\], and having
penetrated the orbits of the planets and the stars he attains the
supreme brahman.

His clear mention of the movement of the Earth in the celestial sphere
along with the other planets in the celestial sphere has been taken as
Āryabhaṭa’s discovery of heliocentricity. However, here we are not
going into this issue and the real nature of his unique planetary model
which sets the old Hindu Svāyambhuva planetary model apart from those of
the Greeks. Nevertheless, as a testimony of his astronomical
achievements we will merely state the period of sidereal day of the
Earth as determined by Āryabhaṭa in modern units: ![23^h 56^m
4^{s.}1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=23%5Eh+56%5Em+4%5E%7Bs.%7D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"23^h 56^m 4^{s.}1"), which is practically the modern value.

One of the important features of Āryabhaṭa’s work was his presentation
of the old Hindu sine difference table. Āryabhaṭa gives the table using
his syllable-numeral equivalence which goes as:  
makhi bhaki phakhi dhakhi ṇakhi ñakhi ṅakhi hasjha skaki kiṣga śghaki
kighva |  
ghlaki kigra hakya dhaki kica sga jhaśa ṅva kla pta pha cha kalā
ardha-jyāH ||  
225, 224, 222, 219, 215, 210, 205, 199, 191, 183, 174, 164, 154, 143,
131, 119, 106, 93, 79, 65, 51, 37, 22, 7 are the
![R\\sin(\\theta)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Csin%28%5Ctheta%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"R\\sin(\\theta)") \[differences\].

So how do we understand this? As per Hindu terminology if the arc is
equivalent to the bow then the chord is equivalent to the bowstring
(jyā). Hence, the sine can be seen as half a jyā (ardhajyā) as
Āryabhaṭa terms it in the above sūtra. For simplicity call
Āryabhaṭa’s ardhajyā a function named jyā and represent it thus in
modern notation:  
Let the function jyā
![(\\theta)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Ctheta%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(\\theta)") be defined as,  
jyā
![(\\theta)=R\\sin(\\theta)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Ctheta%29%3DR%5Csin%28%5Ctheta%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(\\theta)=R\\sin(\\theta)"), where
![R=3438](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%3D3438&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"R=3438").  
Why the number 3438? Āryabhaṭa conceives a circle whose circumference is
divided into ![360 \\times
60=21600](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=360+%5Ctimes+60%3D21600&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"360 \\times 60=21600") parts. Now the radius of this circle given
Āryabhaṭa’s ![\\pi \\approx
3.1416](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+%5Capprox+3.1416&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi \\approx 3.1416") will be,  
![\\dfrac{21600}{3.1416}=3437.73 \\approx 3438 \\Rightarrow
1\\;radian](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B21600%7D%7B3.1416%7D%3D3437.73+%5Capprox+3438+%5CRightarrow+1%5C%3Bradian&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\dfrac{21600}{3.1416}=3437.73 \\approx 3438 \\Rightarrow 1\\;radian")  
Thus, Āryabhaṭa’s R value is for the first time a radian-like concept
was used in trigonometry. Now, Āryabhaṭa divides his quadrant into 24
parts; thus, his minimal angle is
![\\theta\_1=\\frac{\\pi}{48}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta_1%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B48%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\theta_1=\\frac{\\pi}{48}"). To see why he chose this value of
![\\theta\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\theta_1") note the following:

![\\dfrac{\\pi}{48} \\times 3438 \\approx
225](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B48%7D+%5Ctimes+3438+%5Capprox+225&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\dfrac{\\pi}{48} \\times 3438 \\approx 225")

jyā
![(\\dfrac{\\pi}{48})=3438\\sin(\\dfrac{\\pi}{48})=3438\\times0.06540
\\approx
225](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B48%7D%29%3D3438%5Csin%28%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B48%7D%29%3D3438%5Ctimes0.06540+%5Capprox+225&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(\\dfrac{\\pi}{48})=3438\\sin(\\dfrac{\\pi}{48})=3438\\times0.06540 \\approx 225")

![\\therefore](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctherefore&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\therefore") jyā ![(\\dfrac{\\pi}{48})\\Big/R\\cdot\\dfrac{\\pi}{48}
\\approx
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B48%7D%29%5CBig%2FR%5Ccdot%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B48%7D+%5Capprox+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(\\dfrac{\\pi}{48})\\Big/R\\cdot\\dfrac{\\pi}{48} \\approx 1"); actual
value 0.99982

Thus, Āryabhaṭa’s value of
![\\theta\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\theta_1") is chosen such that the angle and its jyā are practically
the same (Figure 1). This value as a proxy for ![\\displaystyle
\\lim\_{\\theta \\to
0}\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta}=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Clim_%7B%5Ctheta+%5Cto+0%7D%5Cfrac%7B%5Csin%28%5Ctheta%29%7D%7B%5Ctheta%7D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\displaystyle \\lim_{\\theta \\to 0}\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta}=1")
continued to be used in the subsequent development of Hindu calculus.
The
![\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\theta") and jyā
![(\\theta)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Ctheta%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(\\theta)") being nearly the same at this value allows linear
interpolation for intermediate values.

Now the rest of his table is in the form of differences. So to get a jyā
![(\\theta\_n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Ctheta_n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(\\theta_n)") we have to do the following:  
jyā
![(\\theta\_2)=225+224=449](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Ctheta_2%29%3D225%2B224%3D449&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(\\theta_2)=225+224=449"); jyā
![(\\theta\_3)=225+224+222=671](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Ctheta_3%29%3D225%2B224%2B222%3D671&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(\\theta_3)=225+224+222=671")…  
The table below compares Āryabhaṭa’s jyā
![(\\theta)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Ctheta%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(\\theta)") values to the exact modern
values.![AryabhaTa\_sin](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/aryabhata_sin1.jpg?w=640)
