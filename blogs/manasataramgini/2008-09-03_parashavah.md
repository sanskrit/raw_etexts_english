This was inspired by two sights from long ago. In 1987 we visited the
then rarely open State Archaeological Museum in the city of our birth
which housed an enormous collection of Indian arms assembled by a
mlechCha official. Then in April of 2000 we visited the art museum at
Chicago which had an impressive wall of European battle axes and
hammers. Some of those stuck well in our sub-cranial contours.
