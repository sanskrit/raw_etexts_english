The organizers of the new Indian project of preparing a critical edition
of the Mahlabharata are deeply indebted to both Geheimrat Luders and
Professor Winternitz not merely for their taking personally a keen interest
in the scheme, but for their bringing the project formally to the notice of
the savants assembled at the historic XVIIth International Congress of
Orientalists held at Oxford in August 1928, and moving resolutions convey-
ing messages of appreciation and congratulation. ^ A singularly happy
feature of this event was that this gesture of cordial sympathy and willing
co-operation should have proceeded spontaneously from just those two

veteran scholars who not merely enjoy the greatest amount of respect and
confidence in the world of Indologists but whose names are most intimately
connected with the earlier scheme of the International Association of Acade-
mies of publishing a critical edition of our Great Epic. It is a matter of
high gratification to the members of the Mahabharata Editorial Board that
their modest efforts in the cause of Mahabharata studies are being so keenly
appreciated by their fellow workers in Europe, just as it is a matter of relief
to the responsible editors that the general method and principles underlying
the preparation of this edition have won the warm approval of the two
eminent European critics^ who have themselves made the closest study of
the central textual problem and enriched the literature on the subject by
the contribution of several valuable papers and monographs.

At the said session of the Congress of Orientalists, Winternitz read
a paper entitled “The Critical Edition of the Mahabharata”, dealing with
the history of the project from its early beginning^. Much of what Winternitz
says in this {166} memorable address of his bears the unmistakable stamp
of being personal reminiscences, because he was the first scholar who more
than thirty years ago, at the Xlth International Congress of Orientalists held
in Paris (1897), emphasized the superlative importance of a critical edition
of the Mahabharata and proposed measures for its preparation.®

After nearly thirty years of restless endeavour, he is again one of the
small group of the first collaborators of the great and ambitious project.
EHiring 1922-3 he used his opportunities as a Guest Professor at the Univer-
sity of the poet philosopher Rabindranath Tagore to train some of his ad-
vanced pupils at the Visvabharatl to do collation work, thus helping to
establish there a centre for the collation of Bangali MSS. of the Mahabha-
rata, ^ a centre which is still doing excellent work under the supervision of
the Principal, Pandit Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya. Finally, Winternitz
has taken over some of the editorial burden on hi> own shoulders by kindly
agreeing to edit for the Institute one Parvan, the Sabhaparvan. This is in-
deed a very happy augury for the continued success of our cherished project.

To the text of his Congress address, which be has published in the
first issue of his Journal, Indologica Pr ageusia, Vol. 1 (1929), pp. 58-63,
Winternitz has appended (pp. 64-68) some critical remarks on my edition
of the Adiparvan. While expressing his whole-hearted agreement with the
general principles underlying my reconstruction of the text, he has given a
long list of passages in which he differs from me with respect to the readings
of the constituted text. With unerring judgement he has picked out those

passages in the first two adhyayas that had given me most trouble, and he
has criticized the readings of the constituted text, weighing the pros and cons
with great acumen, and pointing out the errors and imperfections with much
delicacy and courtesy. While tendering him my cordial thanks for the
honour he has done me by making so close and penetrating a study of my
critical work, I shall endeavour here briefly to answer his queries and critic-
ism. I write these notes not so much to justify my selection and establish
the readings of the critical edition as £167} to set forth the reasons that
have guided me in the choice of the readings in question and that may not
have occurred to my critic — remarksj which will not fail to throw some fitful
light on the obscure and complicated processes which go to make up Maha-
bharata textual criticism.

Minor Questions.

1. 1. 30 : WiNTERNiTZ observes that “in the notes the interesting re-
      mark of Arjunamisra is given ; paramesthy atha iti prdyasali pdtipdh, but the
      actual reading of the Da MSS. is not given The reading of the Da MSS.
      not being specifically mentioned, it must, in conformity with a tacitly assum-
      ed Paribha^, be taken to be the same as the text reading, namely, para-
      me^thy iatha. In that sense the reading of the Da MSS. (i.e. of Arjuna-
      misra) has been given, and my note is both complete and correct, because
      both the Da MSS. collated for the passage do, in point of fact, read para^
      me^thy atha.^ Nevertheless, as I discovered on referring to the commentcuy
      once more, the note does not represent the facts fully and correctly, because
      the MSS. which are corrupt, being contaminated from the vulgate, had suc-
      ceeded, for the time being, in completely misleading me.

That the true Arjunamisra reading must, against the testimony of MSS.,
be assumed to be paramemarah (agreeing then with Dq.s Q) follows,
with certainty, from the commentary itself, a fact I had overlooked when
I wrote the note. The commentary runs thus :

«Tg: I i;: I 1 51R5I'.

tr:; I i

In the Foreword to Fascicule 1 (p. 1), I have already drawn attention
to the fact that “ the (epic) text in the Arjunamisra codices is frequently
contaminated from the “ vulgate '' and has to be corrected with the help of
Arjunamisra’s commentary.” The examples cited there are 1. 1. I7b and

^ A reference to Prof. Luders' Druckprab<t\ (p. 6) will show that the (Deva-
niagari) MSS. of Arjunami^ra's commentary collated by him for his Specimen edition
read likewise paramesthy atha; only in one instance has the reading been cor-
rected (by a later hand) to paramesvarah. Accordingly Prof. Luders has also
taken paramesthy atha as the reading of the version of Arjunamisra.

22^. In the former case, the Da MSS. read putiyam (like the vulgate, with
which the constituted text here agrees ; the true Arjunamisra [168} read-
ing is, however, punya-, as follows clearly from Arjunamisral’s own observa-
tion :

In the latter case (1. 1. 22 b), likewise, tlie Da MSS. read sivam, agree-
ing with many K and D MSS. ; but the commentary shows (as I have
pointed out in the notes) that the true Arjunamisra reading is sucim, agree-
ing with the constituted text, Hvam being only a variant mentioned by the
scholiast ;

m I i m yjyi i to

1 must here add, tlierefore, a word of caution. In the critical notes
published with the text, the readings as actually found in the (epic) text (in
contradistinction to the commentary) of the Arjunamisra codices have, as
a rule, been taken to represent the readings of Arjunamisra ; the commen-
tary was consulted by me only occasionally, in case of doubt or difficulty,
or when a pdphantara was noticed. It is, therefore, more than likely that,
owing to the fact our I>a MSS. are conflated by contamination with various
types of MSS., in particular with the Nilakahtha type, a few errors of the
kind pointed out by Winternitz may have inadvertently crept in. Such
errors can be rectified only by working through the whole commentary, word
for word, and comparing the lemmata with the (epic) text of the MSS. ;
even then one can of course be sure only of the words and passages actually
cited and explained by the scholiast.

The version of Arjunamisra, as I pointed out in the Foreword to Fasci-
cule 1 (p. v), is closely allied to the Bangali version. The reason for this
affinity (as I have stated elsewhere) appears to be that Arjunamisra was a
native of Bengal.^ Following the example of my predecessors, I have uti-
lized, for the critical edition of the Adiparvan, Devanagari MSS. of Arjuna-
misra’s commentary. The two MSS. I am using are extremely corrupt. In
fact, all the MSS. of Arjunamisra’s commentary I have seen— and they are
all Devanagari MSS.— have been remarkably corrupt. Not only that, the
text they offer is, as already remarked, obviously contaminated from the
[169} vulgate. This corruption of the Devatiagari MSS. I could not ac-
count for at first ; but it must be due, I cannot but think now, to their being
copies of Bangali or Maithili originals. It would, therefore, be expedient
to procure and use, whenever possible, Bangali- or Maithili MSS. of Arjuna-

misra’s commentary, treating his version as an offshoot of the Bangali (res-
pectively Maithili) version.^

1. V 62 : WiNTERNiTZ points out that the lengthy interpolation App. I,
   No. 1 =(B.) 1 . 1 . 55c(/ — ^93 is inserted in the R. A. S. Whish MS. No. 65
   after 62^6, and not after 62, as in most of the Southern MSS. used by me.
   But two of my MSS, (T^ G^) also insert the passage in question after 62^7^,
   like the Whish MS.; only between 62ab and the Appendix passage, my MSS.
   further interpolate 29*, 64 and 30*, as stated in the very note cited by
   WiNTERNiTZ. The point of insertion of this interpolation varied in the dif-
   ferent MSS. Thus of the MSS. collated by Prof. Luders for his Druckprobe,
   two Go [? read G 3 I T^ read it after 62ab, while two others (G 2 T^) read it
   after 62 ; moreover, in To (of the Druckprobe) the inserted passage is pre-
   ceded by 29*, 64 and 65 (somewhat like T^ G^)-
   ♦ ♦ ♦

1 . 1. 13'1 : The printer’s devil, I regret to say, is responsible for the
erroneous spelling Samsaptaha — (with dental s) in this stanza; the correct
spelling Saihsaptaka — (with palatal s) is given at 1 . 2. 56 and 160. More-
over, the various readings have been given only at 1 . 2. 56, and, through some
unfortunate oversight, omitted at 1. 1. 131 and 1 . 2. 160. I make good the
omission here. At 1. 1. 131 the various readings are as follows. Ko. 2 - 4 .C
Da Dai. Dri 1 * 3 . r 4 Di~ 4 . 7 . 10 . n Ti Samsapata^; Ki Dn 2 Dr^

From the readings of the three passages in question, it should seem that,
anomalies apart, Kj (or the India Office Codex), Bangali and Southern MSS.
read it correctly (that is, with the palatal 5 ), while the rest of K agrees with
the commentators in reading it with the dental s. The balance of probability
inclines to the side of the palatal, I think, even if we restrict ourselves to the
MS. evidence. C. V. Vaidya {The Mahdbharata : A Criticism, p. 159)
speaks of them as the “ 7 clahs who came probably from the Afagan {sic)
borders,” but it seems to me more likely that they got their nickname from
the fact that they had bound themselves by an oath to kill Arjuna or die in

the great Bharata* battle (Dropap, 17).

1. 2. 85 : The spurious line (102*) kutasya Dhmdird^prena pre^mani
      Pmpdavdn prati stands in the MSS. not before 97* (as WINTERNITZ imagines
      and very naturally), but after 101*, as correctly stated in the critical notes.
      I haVe re-examined the MSS. concerned on the point and find that my note is
      perfectly correct. One cannot be dogmatic about the Mahabharata MSS.;
      there is no knowing what they may or may not contain. The line was found
      only in six Nilakantha MSS. in Devahagarl or Bangali characters, collated
      for the first two adhyayas. In all these six MSS. the line is found inter-
      polated at the same place, the place mentioned in the critical apparatus
      (namely, after 101*), although all printed editions without exception place
      it elsewhere (namely, before 97*), which is no doubt the reason of Winter-
      NiTZ’s remark. A note drawing attention to this patent discrepancy might
      have been usefully added in the critical notes. But I have found the printed
      editions so arbitrary and unreliable^ that I have almost £171} completely
      ignored them in the foot-notes, which have necessarily to be rather brief and
      to the point. The meaning of this enigmatic line found in Nilakaptha MSS.
      is as obscure toi me a’s the cause of its transposition in the first printed edi-
      tion. We need not inquire why the line occurs in the wrong place in the
      other editions as well, since the subsequent editors appear to have studiously
      and uniformly avoided consulting MSS. Winternitz could easily convince
      himself of the correctness of my statement regarding the point of insertion
      of this line in the MSS. by referring to the superb complete copy of the MahS-
      bharata in iSarada characters, with Nilakantha s scholium, he purchased in
      Kasmar during his stay there.

1. 2. 102 : Da Dn Dr do have magndm and Draupodim, as found in the
      printed editions and as rightly surmised by Winternitz. This group has,
      through oversight, completely dropped out of the long list of MSS. that read
      Draupadtm, ^d I am thankful to Winternitz for drawing my attention to it.
      The correction will be duly notified in the list of Errata, which will be added
      at the end of the volume. In passing I may draw attention to the superiority
      of the K MSS., the only group which, as Winternitz rightly remarks, gives
      the undoubtedly correct rendering of the whole stanza ; all other MSS.-— even

such as do not contain the interpolated line 112* — are in utter confusion.

This is indeed a difficult case, and I for my part doubt whether any
definite decision can be reached as to how the stanza originally read. I must
say, I cannot share the confidence with which Winternitz decides for the
reading :

yadd Vdyuh Sakiasuryau ca yuktau,

which is mentioned as a patha by Nilakantha and was adopted in the editio
prmceps. It is one of the eight rival readings and is found chiefly in the
Bangali version, and in MSS, and editions allied to or influenced by it. The
combinations found £172} in the different MSS. may be arranged schemati-
cally as follows :



Vdyu

According to Winternitz, the stanza refers to (B.) 7. 7. 34 ff. ‘‘where
the line vdtoddhutcmi rajas tivram etc., also testifies to the reading vdyuh,
while iakra {— Indra) probably refers to the rain of pieces of flesh, bones
and blood.” To start with I doubt whether Sakra could be held responsible
for the “ rain ” of flesh, bones, and sundry other articles ; but that is a minor
point, immaterial to the present discussion. In believing, however, that our
stanza refers to (B.) 7. 7. 34 ff., Winternitz is partly mistaken, as will
presently appear. The important point is that in the opinion of Winternitz
the stanza alludes to certain forces of Nature, certain elements, such as wind,
rain and so on, which were favourable to the P^davas and unfavourable to
the Kauravas. The commentators Nilakaptba, Arjunami^ra and Devabodha
(with the readings which they had adopted or which were before
them) have explained the stanza in a similar way. I hold a different view,
however. When I selected the reading of the constituted text, I thought—
and I still think— that in this stanza there is allusion not to the elements, but
to some mtrologicd factor or constellation — an allusion which was not under-
stood by commentators and which I could not then fully explain. On read-
ing the criticism of Prof. Winternitz, I therefore made a reference to my



210


EPIC STUDIES


friend Prof. Jyotish Chandra Ghatak, M. A., of Calcutta University, who
has made a special study of Indian Astrology and allied sciences and is rightly
regarded as an authority on these topics ; and I was not disappointed. Hav-
ing already worked through the whole of the Mahabharata in special search
of references which have a bearing on Astrology, Augury and kindred subjects,
he could at once lay his fingers on the right passage, the prototype of our
stanza, which throws a flood of light on the question, without however fully
solving the riddle of the stanza, so far as I cah judge. The said stanza,
(B.) 6. 20. 2, reads :

{173} [Dhrtara§tra to Sariijaya]

%5rt

sqWRT I

While the connection between the two stanzas is patent and indeed un-
questionable, the discovery of the prototype leaves, unfortunately, nK)st of
our real difficulties unsolved. The reading which agrees closest with that of
the Bhi§maparvan stahza is that of the vulgate text and is found only in the
MSS. of NilakaiTitba. These latter have Vayu-Chandra-Surya (lacking Sakra
or Sukra altogether) like Soma-Surya-Vayu of the Bhi§maparvan. Is the
Nilakaiptha reading then the original reading ? As I have pointed out else-
where, we are apt to prefer, at first sight, the readings of the vulgate, which
appear to be better than those of the critical text ; but that is only because
the text of the vulgate has been arrived at by the purging of the original by
the continuous emendations of scholars for centuries.^ It seems to me that there
is a long history behind the reading of the vulgate in the present case also.
Nilakaptha had evidently arrived at it by an emendation, by collation with
the prototype, because there is no indication of the re being any MSS. before
him which could have contained that particular combination. This fact may,
perhaps, supply us with a clue to the labyrinth of the readings recorded in
the critical notes for the line in question. An important factor is that Sukra
(or sakra), which persistently occurs in all the various categories of our
MSS. and which must, therefore, be regarded as an essential feature of our
stanza, is entirely lacking in the later stanza. This proves irrefutably that
the combination of the former was not identical, in every respect, with that
of the latter originally. That is an important point to remember. WlNTER-
NIT2 is emphatic in a'sserting that yadd Vdyuh of the original was changed
in S into the usual yada§rau$am. This assumption does not seem to me to

be at all well founded, because the very next stanza (130) begins yadd
Dr OHO vivid hm astramdtgm, and here no attempt has been made in S (or
anywhere else) to change the beginning into yadasrcdui^m. There are a few
more stanzas (133, 140, 145) in {174} this series which do not begin with
the oft-repeated formula. It seems to me much more likely, therefore, that
Vayu was introduced into our passage, secondarily, by some early Northern
redactor who knew the prototype and had noticed the omission of one of the
elements in the prior stanza ; precisely as Nilakantha, much later, appears
to have further altered the line by changing the difficult Sakra (or iSukra)
to Candra, thus equating the combination to that of the prototype. I there-
fore adhere to my original choice, explaining the genesis of the variants as
follows. The stanza in question, which was suggested to the author of the
yadakau^am section by the Bhi^maparvan stanza but was composed from
a vague recollection of the original, began like the other stanzas of the series,
and contained, moreover, an allusion to an astrological situation. Some Nor-
thern redactor (who had known the Bhi§maparvan stanza and noticed that
tlie first stanza did not contain Vayu) then deleted {a)srausam and substi-
tuted for it the missing Vayu, retaining, however, the original feature Sukra.
The corruption of Sukra into Sakra must be judged as easy and even natural
(in juxtaposition with Surya), in view of the famous episode of the Maha-
bharata which narrates how Indra‘, disguised as a mendicant Brahman, begs
for the miraculous ear-rings and the armour which had been Karpa s from
his birth and which had made him invincible. The emendatory activity of
the early Northern redactor was continued by Nilakantha, who expunged
the sakra (or Sukra) which he found in his MSS. (and perhaps did not
fully understand) and substituted for it Candra, thus equating the two com-
binations.

I am confirmed in the supposition that the original line contained only
two agencies instead of three by the fact that no MSS. hitherto collated
show yuktdh (plu. ) for yuktau (dual) in the first line, as they certainly
would have done, had there been three names in the original instead of two,
as I have given. ^

The question then arises whether Sukra and iSurya, as gMhas, were at
that time favourable to the P^ndavas or, what comes to the same thing,
adverse to the Kauravas. About {175} Surya I cahnot say. But as far as
Sukra is concerned, we may safely answer the question in the affirmative.
My friend Prof. Ghatak has kindly drawn my attention to a stanza in Vara-
hamihira’s Brhatsamhitd which, if dyutajivin may be taken to apply to the

1 It should be noted that even in the explanation of Winternitz, Sakra and
Surya do not make any combined effort. If the three elements wind, rain and
sun operate all together for the success of the Papdavas, then yuktdh is indeed the
correct word. What is the point of the dual, when the plural form would be even
metrically equally suitable?

Kauravas, would indicate that at the time of the Bharatal battle the planet
Sukra, which was then in the Purvabh5drapada (cf. 6 . 3 . 15), was in a
position which augured disaster to the Kauravas and was therefore favour-
able (anuloma) to the Paijdavas. The Brhatsamhitd reference ( 9 . 34) sup-
plied to me by my friend runs.

As Viayu is missing in the whole of S except Mj (which latter is a
conflated MS.), it can never be established that Viayu is an esseniwl element
of the original stanza ; on the other hand, (a)srausam, though of course no
less doubtful because it is documented also by only half of the entire evidence,
is rendered probable, if not required, by the context. But I am prepared
to leave the line as “ less than certain,” as indicated by the wavy line below
the words in question.

* ♦

1 . 1 . 180 : tava putrmr imkattamdli,

WiNTERNiTZ complains that the sentence is “ very awkward grammati-
cally”. To have called forth no less than nine attempts at emendation,
the original must indeed have been most awkward. Winternitz prefers
to read tava putrmr mahattardl}, pointing out that there is not much evidence
for the text reading. It is quite true that the text is weakly supported ;
but so are almost all the readings except that of the vulgate, which certainly

cannot be considered the original reading, as it is palpably an emendation.

The text is based on Ki. 5 G 5 . ^ only. But Winternitz’s reading is not
much better supported ; in its entirety it is found only in K 3 M ; because,
of the MSS. which do contain the questionable mahattkirdh^ Ko begins the
pada with tvatputrair ye and with tvatsutebhyo. I submit, therefore,
that the reading preferred by Winternitz is not better documented than
mine. That is the first point. Winternitz then seeks to explain the

variation on the ground that the scribes must have found difficulties with

the £ 176 } instr. putrmli. Now the so-called instr, comparationis is very
common in both epics and, I submit, that alone would not account for this
plethora of readings in the case of a simple line with a perfectly obvious
meaning. I know instances in the Mahabharata text where this instr. com-
porationis has called forth no variants at all in the MSS., no doubt because
it was felt to be quite normal by the copyists, editors and readers alike.
The cause of disturbance in this case must, therefore, be looked for else-
where, and that was principally, I think, the use of the superlative joined
to the instrumental.

In settling th^ original reading, the question is primarily one of fact, of
the actual MS. evidence, not of grammar. The Shakespearean “This was



EPIC STUDIES II


213


the most unkindest cut of all” cannot be judged and tended by modem
standards of grammar. It sounds harsh to our ears ; but there is, I suppose,
sufficient documentary evidence to prove or make it probable that the line
as I have quoted it was in point of fact written by the author of Julim Csesar
(who knew his English quite as well as, if indeed not better than, we do),
consciously or unconsciously using what our purists stigmatize as
vulgarism. The argument that a dramatist like Shakespeare could not com-
mit such a blunder (if blunder it be) would be without cogency, when the
MS. evidence supports the questionable reading.

The Mahabharata, I may point out here, has suffered from the great
misfortune of being always edited by learned Pahdits, who were concerned
more about the purity of diction than with the determination and preserva-
tion of the words of the author or the authors of the epic. One of the very
worst offenders in this way was Pandit Bohtlingk who, in the passages
edited by him in his Scmkrit-Chresthomathie, has ''corrected ” away the
few oddities of idiom and style of the original which had escaped the vigilence
of mediaeval Indian scholiasts and editors and found their way stealthily into
our printed editions

^ III the Pau§yaparvan (Adip. 3), especially, his editorial activities are very
much in evidence. He has not only introduced, with scrupulous care, the correct
Sandhi wherever it was at all possible, he has substituted the correct bandhum
for the (irregular) huddhum (1. 3.. 21), found even in the printed editions and
made many similar “ corrections independently of the MS. evidence. Most
amusing, however, is his regular and systematic substitution of the correct form,
as required by the Sutra of P§mm, out of etad and enad, a rule probably unknown
at any time to anybody outside a select coterie of AcSryas of Yyakaraoa.

It is an admittedly sound principle of textual criticism to give preference
to a reading which best suggests how the other readings may have arisen, and
it would be hard, I think, to find another reading which^ could explain all
these nine variants more satisfactorily. Winternitz’s choice, for instance,
does not at all explain the origin of any of the readings which contain
mahaltamdk (superl.)' such as 2 (a) and (b) and the text reading ; because
there is in that case nothing to be gained by changing the (supposed) original
comparative into superlative.^

En passant it may be pointed out that the so-called instr. campaTationis
is not a distinct category of the comparative at all ; it is only a special case of
the (Prakritic) coalescence of the instr. and abl. pi. {metri causa), an equi-
valence which comes out very clearly in such parallel phrases as :

I 1. 1. 198

{178} and

1-1- 209 and 494 *.

The latter does not mean he is left by all sins " but “ he is freed from all
sins.”

That the superlative is used in the epic in the sense of the comparative®
may be seen from :

^ % ^Tl^rntfr: \ Gita 12. 1
^ ^ I 18- 69

Of these which are more verged in Yoga ? ” Nor among men shall
there be any whose service is dearer to me than his.”

The superlative is normally construed with the gen. or loc.; but that it is

^ Unless it be a scribe’s error perpetuated through centuries or repeated
independently in different places and times.

2 This pada recurs^ frequently in the Ramayapa also.

» These derivative forms have probably a merely intensive value, and do not
necessarily and invariably connote comparison. The Prakritsl frequently confuse the
tara and the tama endings. It is further worth noting that a separate formation
of the comparative and superlative is unknown to the Modem Indian dialects.
The epics also sporadically furnish instances of the use of the ptmtive in the sense
of the comparative.



EPIC STUDIES II 215

construed sometimes also with the abl. may be seen not merely from the
example last cited but also from :

3Tfq I ibid, 4. 36

Though thou art of all sinners the most sinful/*

Then the above-mentioned equivalence of the instr. and abl. pi. ushers
in finally the construction of the superlative with the instr., which we find
in the passage in question.

Formally the two constructions tava puttair mahattardh and tava ptdrair
mahattamah are almost equivalent ; but there may be just a slight difference
of meaning between the two locutions. While tava puirair mahattamh
(comp.) evidently means only ‘"greater than thy sons’*, the other clause
( tava putrair mahattamdh ) may have been intended to convey some such sense
as “ far, very much, greater than thy sons.**

It may be finally observed that in dealing with the first two adhyayas
of the Adiparvan (a^ in fact with the whole of the earlier portion of this
Parvan ) the critic should never forget that he has before him what Hopkins
has justly called the “ pseudo-epic ** : the poetasters responsible for the com-
pilation of these passages are capable of the worst blunders of every descrip-
tion.

* *

£179} 1. 1. 269 : mdhattvdd bhdravattvdc ca.

As WiNTERNiTZ rightly observes, here the MS. evidence is almost evenly
balanced. Moreover, graphically there is so little difference between the rival
readings that we cannot expect much help from the side of the MSS., though
it may be pointed out that their evidence inclines, if at all, just a trifle to the
side of the text reading. Winternitz {Ind, Ant. 27., 93) admits that the
lines (69*) caturbhyah etc. and tadd prabhjti etc. are “quite superfluous.”
When these lines are expunged from the text, as has been done by me, the
line mahattve ca gurutve ca of 208c) stands adjacent to mahattvdd bhdra''
(of 209<?). The idea of 208c is evidently reflected and repeated in 209a.
Just as mahattvdt corresponds to nidfiattve, so Wmra'' should correspond to
gurutve. This clearly shows, as far as I can judge, that the doubtful woid
(ftfeira®), which should be a paraphrase of gunwft;c, must bt bhdravattvdt
and not bhdratatvdt. The latter seems to be an emendation made by some
revisor who wanted' to squeeze in somehow the significant word Bhdrata into
the context ; and, it must truthfully be confessed, it is a very ingenious emen-
dation indeed. But as to which is the orginal reading there cannot be much
doubt. The importance that Winternitz (like Buhler, Ind. Stud. 2. 9 f.,
before him) attaches to the circumstance that the verse is quoted in (our edi-
tion of) Kumarila's Tahtravartika with the reading bhdratatvdt is wholly un-
justifiable, and that for two reascms : firstly, because we have no critical
edition of the Tantravarttika, and so we cannot be wholly sure of what the



216


EPIC STUDIES


MSS. actually read at that place ; and secondly, because, even if Kumarila
should, in point of fact, have quoted the verse with bhdraiatvM, it does not
at all follow that this is ipsa facta the ariginal reading, notwithstanding that
Kumarila’s work is far older than the extant Mahabharata MSS ; because
Kumarila may have cited the stanza from one or the other of the versions
which contained (and still contain) that reading. Or again he may have
known both variants and preferred, for reasons similar to those adduced by
Buhler and Winternitz, the variant rejected by me.

The situation is somewhat clearer and the facts better capable of demon-
stration in the case of the other great mediaeval commentator Samkaracarya.
In many cases when the readings of the Mahabharata verses and stanzas cited
by him {180} differ from those of the Bombay and Calcutta editions, I was
able to identify i^aihkaraoarya’s readings in the Southern MSS. Being a
Southerner, he had naturally studied and cited from the Southern recension
of the Mahabharata. It is quite clear that he was not going to work through
all available MSS. and establish the original reading of the numerous Maha-
bharata stanzas cited by him in the course of his voluminous commentaries.
Therefore his citations, although of far greater antiquity than the oldest of
our extant Mahabharata MSS., do not necessarily give us in every case the
** original '' readings. Salmkara’s testimony applies to and affects mainly the
version, or the! recension used or cited by him ; and that was probably the
Southern recension in its Malayalam version. Even in the time of the Acarya
the Northern MSS. must have read differently in places, as they do now,
because the divagation of the recensions must be assumed to be far older than
the epoch of the great Vedantist.

I shall give only one example in order to clarify my meaning. 1. 1. 37
of the critical edition reads yathartda rtulingdniy agreeing with other printed
editions and with the majority of the MSS. of the Northern recension. iSam-
karadarya in his Bh^ya on the Brahmasutra (1. 3. 30 ; Anandasrama ed.,
p. 313) cites, however, the verse with the reading yalthartu^v jtulingdni.^
Now this reading is found only in Southern MSS. and in such of the Northern
MSS. as can be shown to be contaminated from the Southern source, but not
in any Kasmlri or Bangali MSS. collated so far. Here it would be clearly
wrong to cite the Bh^ya as an authority older than our MSS. to establish
the text reading as yathartu^v rtulingdni. The Bh^ya citation affects directly
the Southern version only, documenting that the divergent reading of our
Southern MSS. is as old as (or rather older than) the time of Sairhkaracarya ;
and that is aU. It does not take us beyond the Southern recension, much
less beyond the two rival recensions to the archetype.

When Winternitz further observes that “ from the etymologizer's point
of view ” hharatatvdt is a ** better ” etymology, since with the other reading


1 Only one of the Bhasya MSS. has our text reading.



EPIC STUDIES 11


217


the ta of the Bharata remains unexplained, he is bringing into the discussion
an element of finesse that is quite foreign to the view-point of £181} the
Puraijic writers, as will be evident from the following specimens of “etymo-
logische Spielerei ” culled from the earlier adhyayas of the Adiparvan :

(B.) 1. 30. 7 = line 3 of 343* (Garuda) :

1. 36. 3 (Jaratkaru) :

1. 56. 31 (Mahabharata) :

1. 69. 33 (Bharata) ;

In view of these bizarre specimens, it would be extremely strange should
a Puraoic “ etymologizer " fight shy of sacrificing a /la, if he, for the mcwment,
could not think of anything better.


1. 2. 2 : susrusa yadi vo viprd bruvatas ca kathdh subhdfj.

I admit that my reconstruction of the line is not wholly satisfactory.
The reading preferred by WiNTERNiTZ may also not appeal to other scholars,
as it does not wholly appeal to me. I therefore cite here the 15 different
readings found in the 48 MSS. collated for this passage, of which one (Dg),
unluckily or luckily, omits the line altogether. The lines containing ca (to
which WiNTERNiTZ takes exception in particular) have been underlined for
the sake of ready identification.

£182} As for the doubtful ca, I may remark that, besides its normal
use as a conjunction meaning and ”, ca is very frequently used in the Maha-
bhSrata (and the RamSyaioa) as an expletive, a pure and simple verse-filler
ipadapuratj^i) ^ without restriction of position, like hi and vai. It may occa-
sionally have served as a particle of emphasis, stressing the previous word
like eva. The second use is somewhat doubtful ; but of the first, one can find
scores of perfectly clear and certain instances in any portion of the epic, even
in the printed editions. In the line in question, I consider, ca has
been used in the first sense, as a mere verse-filler. Sporadically tm, which
improves this awkward line ever so slightly, appears to have been substituted
for it, independently in both recensions. The first half of the line was so
uncouth that it was recast in the vulgatei. There are numerous instances of
lines being recast ip the vulgate, as a careful study of the critical apparatus
will show.

* - 1 ;

1. 2. 29 : ydt tu Saunaka^tre te Bhmatdkhydnavistaram j
      dkhydsye Mra Pmlomam dkhydna^ cdditah param jj

This is again al most difficult case, and, as Winternitz rightly remarks,
” full of almost hopeless editorial cruces”. The reconstruction would be,
therefore, almost entirely a matter of speculation. Winternitz has rightly
surmised that I regard the Parvasaiiigraha as an accretion later than this
stanza, which, in my opinion, belongs to a much earlier stratum of the text
of the Mahabharata. That Samakasatre in line 1 is a regular trap for the
unwary. Misled by the printed editions, I had myself treated the words as
separate at first, realizing only much later that in this adhyaya the Suta is
addressing not Satinaka but the IJ§is, among whom iSaunaka is not
yet present. iSaunaka is not mentioned in the foregoing portion of the text
except once, in connection with his twelve-year sacrifice in 1. 1. 1. In
adhyaya 4, moreover, it is plainly stated that the Suta first approaches the
IJ§is assembled in thei Naimi§a forest and asks them what he should narrate.
The Iil§is request him to await the arrival of i^unaka. The latter, as soon
as he arrives, asks the Suta to relate the history of the Bhiargavas (adhy. 5).
If Saunaka was not afcmong the audience in adhySya 4, I do not see how he
could have been there in adhyaya 2. Moreover, Tn the latter adhyaya the in-
terlocutors are throu^out stated as being the IJ§is, while it is only from
adhyaya 5 onwards that iSaunaka appears in this £183} role. It should,
therefore, seem that the reading &aunaka satre is not easy to understand or
explain by any means. Or does Winternitz mean that it should be adopted
as the lectio diffidlior ? It would be admissible, in my opinion, only on the
supposition (which is not as improbable as it may at first si^t appear) that



EPIC STUDIES II


219


the compiler of adhyaya 2, when he wrote stanza 29, had overlooked the fact
that Saunaka was not then among the audience. I have preferred to give
the “ poet ” the benefit of the doubt and assume that the remark is addressed
to one of the Rsis i>resent.

WiNTERNiTZ has misunderstood my reconstruction in some other parti-
culars as well, yat, at the beginning of the stanza, is not a neuter pronoun
but an adverb = yada. The words aditah param offer no difficulties at all
for interpretation ; Sdital}. does not mean “ /row the beginning,” but “ at the
beginning” {=adau) ; param excellent.” dkhyasye must of course be
supplied in the first line ; but that is not difficult as it is the very first word
of the second line. Therefore I translate :

“ But when, during Saunaka’s (sacrificial) session, I (shall narrate) to
thee the very extensive Bh5rata Story, then shall I narrate, to begin with, the
excellent Story of Pauloma."

Even a cursory examination of the variants given in the critical notes is
sufficient to convince anybody that the stanza has been recast over and over
again. With, its history is bound up the history of the successive additions
of the three episodes AstOca, Pauloma and Pausya, which appear to have
been aH)ended successively to the main text in this order. The stanza in
question seems to have been written at the time of or soon after the addition of
the Pauloma, but before the addition of the Pausya. The purpose of the line
was originally not— as Winternitz imagines— to state all the episodes with
which the MahabhSrata begins, but to authenticate the latest interpolation
then made, namely, the Pauloma, by making the Suta declare beforehand his
intenti<Mi of narrating that akhyana at the beginning of the Mahabharata.
The .Astika must have formed at that time the recognized beginning of the
epic (cf. Mtptvadi Bhdratam kecid Astikddi tathd pare 1. 1. 50), and the
Pausya had not yet been added. This is the state of things the constituted
text envisages.

A study of the critical apparatus of this adhyaya shows that the adhySya
is best preserved in the Southern recension ; £184} in the MSS. group on
which the vulgate is mainly based (namely, BD) numerous additional stanzas
are found which are missing in S and Ko. j, « ; but even the three latter MSS.
occasionally indude some of such additional stanzas, which also nevertheless,
since they are missing in S, may safely be regarded as interpolations. Of this
character is interpolation 74*, which is found in almost the whole of N and
which must have been made with a view to documenting the fact— or rather
the fiction — ^that the MahSbhfirata as narrated by the Suta to tSaunaka was
identical with that narrated by Vai^ampSyana to Janamejaya (cf. Nilakaptka
ad loc.). Ko. 1 agree with S cm the reading of this stanza except for the in-
clusion of 74* in the one and the addition of the name of the Astika to the



220


EPIC STUDIES


Other. The text is formed by collating S with the inferable version of K
before the addition in the latter of 74*. The subsequent steps leading to-
walrds the reading of the vulgate consisted in the addition of the name of the
Astika episode (which intervenes between the Pauloma and the beginning
proper of the Mahabharata ) , of a statement of the identity of the Suta-
version and the Vai^a)rhpayana version, and finally of the name of the Pau§ya
interlude, all these changes being made in our stanza with a view to setting
the seal of authenticity on the three spurious additions. That adhyaya 3
must be an interpolation follows from the fact that it is wholly unconnect^
with the previous adhyaya and only loosely connected with what follows.
Noteworthy is also the fact that adhyayas 1 and 4 have the same beginning ;
Lomahursanctputra Ugrasravah sutah paurdniko Naimi^dranye dvddasavdr-
sike satre ! And in the text itself there is no explanation why after the Suta
has finished his narration of the Pau§ya episode, it is necessary to reintroduce
the Suta in the same words as approaching the same R§is assembled at the
same twelve-year sacrificial session of .^aunaka in the Naimi§a forest. There
is clearly a new beginning made in one of the two adhyayas.

Since many of the intermediate links are missing in the MS. evidence, it
is not possible to reconstruct the history of this portion of the text fully and
satisfactorily ; but that it must be reconstructed on the lines sketched above,
I have no doubt. Accordingly the successive stages in the development of
the reading of the vulgate (which is the reading preferred by Winternitz)
I would arrange in a scheme like the following, in which the innovations have
been printed in black type. £185} It will show anwng other things that the
vistmam of the text and of the Southern recension is not “ a remnant of vis-
tardrtham ” of the vulgate ; on the contrary, in the latter the first line was fill-
ed up with uttamam when the original vist\a7a was used in the interpolated
stanza. The view of Winternitz that at least Astlkam must remain in the
text is quite untenable ; because if the stanza had As^kam there is no reason
why it should not have Pau^yam as well. On the other hand, if Pausyam is
not indispensable, then Astlkam could go with it as well.

1. 2. 46 : mrgasvapnahhaymi Mah

Here again Winternitz prefers the reading of the \ailgate {mrgasvap-
nodbhavam) . It is clearer but, I must say, I am very doubtful about its
originality. The MS. support for this variant is only slightly stronger than
that for the reading of the constituted text. It is worthy of note that B,
which generally sides with the vulgate, has here a third and entirely different
reading : rnjgosvapno 'bhavat tatab I How would Winternitz account for
that ? I explain the compound of the constituted text as an irregular com-
pound with inverted sequence, common in Prakrit (PiscHEL, Gramm, der
Prakrit’Spracheft, §603)! and not unknown to the Low Sanskrit of the epics.
Hopkins, /AOS. 20 (1890X, 223, has cited two instances from the Rami-
yaaja : 7.22.36 dfstvu dandodyatam Yaman (for j 44 yatadan(}am)“ like Yama
with upraised staff” ; and ibid. 7. 26. 2 tulyaparvatmarcasi (for parvata-
tulyavm^asi) “glorious like the mountain (Kailasa).” I accordingly take
the compound in question as equivalent to svapna (df^la) mrgabhaymi

The readings of the vulgate and the Bangali version seem to represent
different attempts at emendation of the irregular con>pound which stood
originally in the Northern recension and which was perhaps misunderstood,
if it was not totally unintelligible. The wavy line below the pada was called
for also by the variant reading of S, which has parva or talah) prdyopa-
vesmam. This refers to an entirely different section of £187} the narrative,
the name being derived from the vow of fasting taken by Duryodhana.

the ligature rdhc), being opposed by the remainder of the MS. material

ment between independent versions on the reading '^sarjanam, but the con-
cord, I believe, is only apparent, being due to the conflation of MSS. That
G 4 . 5 are contaminated from some late Northern source, I think, I have esta-
blished with tolerable certainty in the note on 1 . 20 . 1 ; the conclusion is cor-
roborated by many less certain instances where these MSS. (along with Gi. y)
agree with Northern MSS, against other Southern MSS., and the agreement
cannot be regarded as one derived from their connection through the arche-
type.^ That further G^ and Mj are not reliable representatives of the
Grantha and the Malayalam versions respectively, I have already pointed out
in the Foreword to Fascicule 1 (p. v). There remains only one other MS.
(M3), which represents a moderately pure (Malayalam) tradition and must

1. 2. 96 : In the Editorial Note appended to Fascicule 3, I have given
      my reasons for selecting 7984 as the figure representing the number of slokas
      in the Adiparvan. That is the figure given by the India Office MS. (Kj
      and corroborated by the i^rada codex (iSJ. It may, therefore, be regarded
      as the extent of the Sarada version at any rate. I consider, as I have fre-
      quently stated, the Sarada (Kasmiri) version the best version now preserved,
      and my edition of the Adiparvan is based mainly (though not wholly) on
      this version.

I fully agree with Winternitz (op, cit. p. 61) that the Parvasariigraha
argument is necessarily of secondary importance and should not be pressed
too far.^ Be that as it may, it is extremely problematic whether we could
make any use whatsoever of the Parvasarhgraha enumeration in the case of
the Adiparvan at least, because it will be difficult to compute the exact extent
of this Parvan, and that for two reasons. Firstly, because this Parvan, as is
well known, contains two lengthy prose adhyayas (3 and 90) ; and it is diffi-
cult to say {189} now how the extent of the prose sections was computed by
the compilers of the Parvasarhgraha ; our section-numbers certainly can give
no indication of the extent in Slokas.'’- Secondly, this Par\^an also contains

^ The exaggerated importance Utgikar attached to the data of the Parvasam-
graha was, I believe, mainly due to his erroneous belief (induced probably by the
misleading character of the text of the Kumbhakonam edition) that the Northern
and Southern MSS. agreed completely with each other in all material particulars
for this acfliyaya. The Kumbhakonam edition, which claims to be an edition
“ mainly based on the South Indian texts ”, presents a text of this adhyaya which
is almost identical with that of the Calcutta and Bombay editions, taking no notice
of the Southern divergences, while in other sections of the epic it introduces numer-
ous innovations which are based on the Southern tradition.

® The lengths of the prose sections must have been computed on the basis of
32 ak^a^c^ to a slok’a, but such a computation in the cas^ of long prose sections can
be only approximate.



224


EPIC STUDIES


a large number of Tri§tubh-Jagati stanzas, which again introduce an element
of uncertainty in the computation. Was each Tri^ubh-Jagatl stanza counted
as one iSloka ” or did the Bh^ratacintakas compute the exact equivalent of
these long-metre stanzas in “ Slokas ? No definite answer is possible as yet.
The difference in the reckoning will be, however, between 40 and 50 per cent
of the total. As a very rough estimate, the Adiparvan may contain some-
thing like 500 long-metre stanzas. This factor alone would then introduce
a difference of a little less than 250 “ :§lokas in the total !

We must, moreover, not lose sight of the fact that the reading of the
number itself is never entirely free from doubt, since the MSS., as Winter-
NiTZ remarks, differ sometimes quite essentially in the Parvasamgraha itself ;
the figures differ not by units or tens, but by hundreds, and even thousands in
extreme cases.^ There can be no doubt, as I have pointed out elsewhere,
that the text of the Parvasamgraha has been tampered with and designedly
altered, in various ways, in order to make it harmonize with the inflated ver-
sions of a later epoch.^

These are some of the difficulties in the way of making any practical
use of the figures recorded in the Parvasamgrahaparvan for fixing the text of
the Mahabhiarata. The computations may have some value for a Parvan
in which there is no prose at all, which is almost wholly in Anu§tubh metre,
and for which finally the Parvasaaiigraha figure is tolerably certain.

It is quite within the range of probability, as far as I can judge now,
that the extent of the critical text of a pa<rvan may {190} fall appreciably
below or rise appreciably above the figure recorded in the second adhyaya, as
is actually the case with about half the number of Parvans in the Calcutta,
Bombay and Kumbhakonam editions when checked up with the figures given
in their respective Parvasairhgrahas.^ Moreover, unless it can be made prob-
able that the compilation of this “ Table of Contents ” is nearly synchronous
with the final redaction of the Great Epic, this discrepancy will be without
any cogency in questions relating to the constitution of the text. The value
of a MS. or a version cannot be said to depend exclusively or even mainly
upon its agreement with or discrepancy from the data of the Parvasamgraha.
It must, in the first analysis, be regarded as depending upon some intrinsic
criteria, upon the place it occupies in a logical and convincing scheme formu-


1 Thus for the Vii^taparvan, the Northern figure is 2050, the Southern 3500 ;
the difference therefore is 1450 41okas.

2 The actual number of ^lokas falls belotv the Parvasamgraha figure in the
following 10 Parvans : Adi, Udyoga, Bhi§ma, Sauptika, iS^nti, Anusasana, Mva-
medhika, AiramavSsika, Mausala and Mahaprasthanika ; while it rises above the
other figure in the following 8 Parvans : Sabha, Araijya, VirSfa, Dropa, Kanja,
Salya, Stri, and Svarg^rohaaja.

lated to explain satisfactorily the evolution of the different extant versions
and types of Mahabharata MSS.

It should further be carefully borne in mind that even if there is an exact
agreement as to extent between a constituted text and the Parvasamgraha*
this fact alone is no guarantee of the originality and the absolute correctness
of the entire text, line for line ; because the same number of stanzas could be
made up in innumerable different ways by accepting or rejecting, hesitatingly,
stanzas of doubtful authenticity and uncertain documentation, of which there
will always be a plentiful supply in every Parvan.^ The difficulty will finally
not be solved even if we happen to light upon a unique MS. which agrees
with the Parvasalrhgraha exactly and we should adopt its text verbatim ;
because there is every probability that while it satisfies the one criterion of
extent given by the Parvasalrhgraha, it may not satisfy, in every respect, other
and more exacting critical tests when compared, line by line and word by
word, with other extant MSS.

£191} 1. 2. 105 : paurmugamanam caiva dharmaputrasya dhimakih.

WiNTEiJsiiTZ is mistaken in thinking that the line is missing in the whole
of K : it is missing in only two MSS. of the group, albeit the best MSS.
These MSS. (Kq. j) are, however, by no means infallible, as a careful study
of the apparatus will show. Their evidence is, therefore, rebuttable and not
conclusive. In this instance, not only does the line occur in the rest of N,
but there is a corresponding line in S. I cannot think that the two lines : —
Text . paurmugamanam cairn dhar7naputrasya dlnmatah
S (except Ml) : paurdnukampd nirvedo dharmardjasyak dhlmatah

could have arisen wholly independently of each other. Even though the pur-
port of the lines is different, the construction is identical, which is a very
important point in its favour. Either these lines are connected through the
archetype, or else there is wholesale contamination between S and N except
Ko. 1 . The latter contingency being improbable in the extreme, we are led
to conclude that there must have been a line of that description in the ori-
ginal ; only its precise reading is doubtful ; the doubtful words have accord-
ingly been indicated in the usual manner.

The problem of the MahaWr^ta textual criticism, as I have pointed
out already, is a problem sui generis. Here the principles of textual recon-
struction, which must first be evolved from a study of the MS. material and
the MS. tradition, can be considered as finally settled only after considerable
discussion and exchange of ideas on the subject. I would, therefore, earn-
estly request Prof. Winternitz to continue his searching and exhaustive

results of his scrutiny, a proceeding which cannot but throw much- needed
light on at least some of the difficult problems the editors have to face, and
thus advance the cause of Mahabharata studies.
