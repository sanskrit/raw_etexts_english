A peculiar hymn in the Rigveda, a lullaby hymn makes mention of a dog,
presumably a guard dog of the family. A previous
[post](https://vriitrahan.wordpress.com/2020/11/27/wolf-in-the-rigveda/)
showed us the role of the wolf, the animosity for it amongst the Vedic
volk, here we see the role of the dog and a beautiful hymn in the form
of a lullaby for the family. Translation notes + morphological glossing
exists at the bottom of the page.

स्ते॒नं रा॑य सारमेय॒ तस्क॑रं वा पुनःसर  
स्तो॒तॄनिन्द्र॑स्य रायसि॒ किम॒स्मान्दु॑च्छुनायसे॒ नि षु स्व॑प

“O son of Saramā, bark at the thief or the robber! lunge again and
again, You are barking at the singers of Indra. Why do you harass us? Go
down to sleep!

त्वं सू॑क॒रस्य॑ दर्दृहि॒ तव॑ दर्दर्तु सूक॒रः  
स्तो॒तॄनिन्द्र॑स्य रायसि॒ किम॒स्मान्दु॑च्छुनायसे॒ नि षु स्व॑प  
  
“You tear the boar! Let the boar tear you! You are barking at the
singers of Indra. Why do you harass us? Go down to sleep!”  
  
सस्तु॑ मा॒ता सस्तु॑ पि॒ता सस्तु॒ श्वा सस्तु॑ वि॒श्पतिः॑  
स॒सन्तु॒ सर्वे॑ ज्ञा॒तयः॒ सस्त्व॒यम॒भितो॒ जनः॑  
  
“Sleep mother! Sleep father! Sleep hound! Sleep lord of the tribe! Let
all kinsmen sleep! Let all these men on all sides sleep!”

^(Footnote: I couldn’t help but mention this here. The word used for “lord of the tribe” is **viśpati \[cf.Zd.*viṡ-paiti*;Lith.*vḗsz-patis*\]** which literally means “father of the clan/tribe” – Sāyana-s commentary says it can be either the husband/brother-in-law or the protector of the tribe of men. So there is a dual relationship implied here– The father is patriarch or lord of his own tribe (his nuclear family) and the clanlord is the father/patriarch of the whole tribe.)

य आस्ते॒ यश्च॒ चर॑ति॒ यश्च॒ पश्य॑ति नो॒ जनः॑  
तेषां॒ सं ह॑न्मो अ॒क्षाणि॒ यथे॒दं ह॒र्म्यं तथा॑  
  
“The man who sits and the man who roams and the man who sees us, we
close their eyes like we close this large house \[of ours\].”  
  
स॒हस्र॑शृङ्गो वृष॒भो यः स॑मु॒द्रादु॒दाच॑रत्  
तेना॑ सह॒स्ये॑ना व॒यं नि जना॑न्स्वापयामसि  
  
“The thousand-horned bull, who rose from the ocean \[moon\], By his
might we make all the people fall asleep.”  
  
प्रो॒ष्ठे॒श॒या व॑ह्येश॒या नारी॒र्यास्त॑ल्प॒शीव॑रीः  
स्त्रियो॒ याः पुण्य॑गन्धा॒स्ताः सर्वाः॑ स्वापयामसि  
  
“The women lying on the benches, reclining on the palanquins, the women
who are resting on the couches. Those fragrant sweet-scented women, them
all, we make them fall asleep”

A few interesting things to be gleamed from this. The dog of the family
presumably, who protects them from thieves, robbers and boars sleeps
next to them. The dog is called sārameya (descendant of saramā, Indra’s
female dog that shows up in the story on Paṇi and the cows. stotṛ of
indra (praisers of indra) is the epithet given by the seer of the hymn
himself to his family. The family structure is reminiscent of clans of
the vedic tribe, with a tribal clanlord. The smallest iota of the tribe
is the core household unit, head by the patriarch. (Often, the patriarch
is addressed by a word dampati literally meaning lord of the house).
dampati is cognate with δεσπότης (despotēs) of Greek. Indeed, this is
the origin of the English word ‘despot’ meaning tyrant \[the origins of
tyrant itself are an interesting story\]. There is some dry humor here
and you might have guessed it, the husband is the patriarch is the
despot of the house.

A look into clan structure of the ancient Greeks, Romans, Vedics and
Iranians shall certainly find some similarity and it does. The Iranians
are the most conservative here, no surprise (to this date, islamicized
iranian tribes maintain a strong tribal structure and society). Avestan
has dmāna-pati (lord of the house), vis-pati (lord of the settlement),
zantu-pati (lord of the tribe) (Skt. jantu-pati), and even dahyu-pati
(lord of the country).  
  
The Iranian tribes were organized on the maxim of dam (house) \> vīs
(group of families) \> zantu (tribe) \> dahyu (country). and reflexes of
lords of each of these peeled off onion ring like cocoons survives. We
do see some reflexes on this original ancestral structure survive in
Skt. dampati/viśpati and Greek δεσπότης, the word viśpati the “chief of
the settlement” finds a relic in the Old Prussian feminine accusative
noun waispattin ‘the lady of the house’
