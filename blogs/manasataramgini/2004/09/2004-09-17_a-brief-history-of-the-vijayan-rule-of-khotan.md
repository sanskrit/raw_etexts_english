In the period that followed the death of the great emperor lalitAditya,
and the confusion during the reign of saMgrAmapIDa, the Chinese generals
Yao Yao and Wei-ch’ih-Sheng devised a daring plan to take Khotan. With
the help of the internal Sinitic population they engineered a revolt and
suddenly appeared at the head of a massive Chinese army of 80,000 to
beseige and conqueror the kingdom. First Sheng and there after Yao
declared themselves rulers of Khotan. Alarmed at this advance the
descendent of lalitAditya, jayAditya, son of saMgrAmapIDa, who ascended
the throne in 751 CE, assigned general vijaya vikrama a descendent of
the original Hindu royal family of Khotan to wrest it back from the
chInas, hUnas and “mlecchas”. With a mobile calvary force he cut off the
supply line of the chInas and then luring them into an ambush in narrow
escape route he destroyed the chIna army completely.  
In late 756 vijaya vikrama was crowned rAja of Khotan. His dynasty as
currently reconstructed:

vijaya nakShatra early 800’s  
vijaya kIrti around 820-40’s  
vijaya vikrama II mid-800’s  
vijaya saMgrAma late-800’s  
vijaya sambhava the great 912-966

Till vijaya saMbhava lived he stood like a pillar of the dharma and
protector of the brAhmaNas in the midst of the turushkas. His kingdom
was considered the geographic oDDiyAna pITha on earth (jAlandhara in
Punjab, purNa giri being in Orissa, kAmakUTa in Assam, mUla in
mUlasthAna/Multan). He placed a wall of steel in the path of the three
Qarakhanid Sultans: Abd al Karim, Musa Bughra Khan and Suleyman Arslan
Khan and defeated each one of them on multiple occasions in fierce
cavalry engagements, even though he was entirely cut off from receiving
aid from the Hindu rulers of Gandhara and Kashmir. He also routed the
Moslem army from Bokhara, which was led by the Arab chief Ahmed ibn
Ismail. Subsequently he defeated another Arab army of Abd al-Malik-I
from Bokhara. As a victorious ruler and builder of many temples (of
which fragmentary ruins still survive) he was like the last flash of
Indic glory in Central Asia.

vijaya surapati 967-977  
vijaya dharma 978-982

vijaya dharma faced invasion from Sultan Noah ibn Mansur from Bokhara
and the Qara Khan turks from Kashgar. vijaya dharma fought off the
attack and repulsed the Sultan but died shortly there after. He was
succeeded by vijaya kumAra who immediately resumed the struggle against
the Moslem hordes. Noah ibn Mansur and the other Turkic and Arab armies
formed a pact for surrounding the Kaffr kingdom. The Hindu king was give
the choice between his foreskin and his head. Though having no Hindu
allies anywhere near him, he and his people decided to uphold the dharma
or die in an attempt. He gathered all his troops and staved of the
Moslem hordes which were pouring ceaselessly from all directions. He
single-handed kept the terrible war raging despite the numerically
superior foes and better horsepower of the enemy.

The Moslems erected huge Majiqs (mangonels) and sarakels (trebuchets)
all around Khotan and bombarded it. But the heavy fortification still
held on. After 10 years of continuous fighting the Hindu kingdom was
entirely shorn of its resources, reduced in man and horse power, and
denuded in defences. Finally, the fortifications were breached and the
Mohammedan armies poured in. The king and his army died fighting the
invaders. The city was looted and the idols of gold with gems studded in
them were melted down. The male population was massacred and the women
taken. Thus ended last Hindu kingdom in Central Asia in its final blaze.
