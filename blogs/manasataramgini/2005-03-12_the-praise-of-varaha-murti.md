The earth with its mountains, cities, forests and waterbodies are in his
tusks, his grunts are sarasvatI (vAgIshI). The air is his breath and the
sun and moon are his right and left hands.

His belly is \[made of\] the vasus, in his ear are the directions, the
ashvins are his eyes, in his feet is the lotus born \[brahma\], in his
heart is viShNu and in his mouth is shiva.

This image is encountered on occasions in Hindu iconography with the
gods constituting the body of the boar. A famous example is the
Khajuraho varAha.
