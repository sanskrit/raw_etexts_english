title = "Iamblichus, quadratures, trisections and the lacuna of thexa0cycloid"

+++
Today Syria has been turned into a hellhole by the unmāda-traya.
However, just before the irruption of the second Abrahamism which ended
the late Classical world, it was home to great men like Iamblichus.
Hailing from a clan of priest-chiefs, Iamblichus taught at Apameia, a
site which is today being ravaged by Mohammedan vandals aided and
abetted by the sister Abrahamisms. After all one point where the
Abrahamisms see eye to eye is the destruction of the heathens and their
sites. Iamblichus was a key link in a great chain of tradition from the
yavana sage Pythagoras. Indeed, as Gregory Shaw pointed out in his paper
“Platonic Siddhas”, Iamblichus could be seen as a siddha among the
yavana-s. In the Lives of Philosphers, Eunapius Sardianus states that he
performed certain secret rituals. Regarding that a rumor is thus
provided:  
“*O master, most inspired, why do you thus occupy yourself in solitude,
instead of sharing with us your more perfect wisdom? Nevertheless a
rumor has reached us through your slaves that when you pray to the gods
you soar aloft from the earth more than ten cubits to all appearance;
that your body and your garments change to a beautiful golden hue; and
presently when your prayer is ended your body becomes as it was before
you prayed, and then you come down to earth and associate with us.*”
\[Translated by WC Wright\]

His epithet “most inspired” is clearly related to his status as the
cognate of the siddha-s among the yavana-s. This is reflected in his
ontology of the gods which can be compared in its theoretical
foundations to that of tantra-s of the Hindu siddha-s. On one hand, he
was the intellectual successor of Porphyry that famous critic of the
second Abrahamism who had been thrashed by a mob of Christians in
Palestine. On the other he was the teacher of Aedesius who in turn was
the teacher of emperor Julian, who for a brief moment in history almost
reversed the flow of the second Abrahamism. Iamblichus along with
[Proclus, that last sage among the
yavana-s](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/the-end-of-the-heathens/),
preserved traditions of Pythagoras that mark the pinnacle of yavana
knowledge, a height not scaled by other peoples of the ancient world.
From the fragments of their work we hear of the yavana heroics in
solving that ancient problem which goes back to the common ancestor of
the yavana-s and the ārya-s the squaring of the circle or the quadrature
of the circle. One of the last yavana heathen philosophers Simplicius,
who was hounded by the śavapūjaka Justinian had to flee along with his
fellow heathen yavana-s to the Sassanian court of Kushru. At the treaty
of 533 CE concluded between the Iranians and the śavapūjaka-s it was
enjoined that they should be allowed to return to their homes and
practice their heathen rituals. However, we hear nothing of them
thereafter suggesting they were either silenced by continued persecution
or killed. It was this Simplicius who preserved a fragment of Iamblichus
wherein we hear of the methods of the yavana mahāpuruṣa-s in achieving
the famed quadrature.

Iamblichus points out that a method for squaring the circle was first
presented by Sextus the Pythagorean and handed down to his successors.
He says that Nicomedes achieved the same using a curve known as the
quadratrix. The same was achieved by Archimedes using the Archimedean
spiral. Whereas, Apollonius is said to have used the curve he termed the
sister of the conchoid, which is the same curve as the quadratrix used
by Nicomedes. Further, he mysteriously states that Carpus used a curve
arising from double motion. Simplicius in his commentary adds that some
mechanical devices were invented for this but not a theoretical proof.
This indicates that between Iamblichus to Simplicius under the
destruction of Classical knowledge by the śavapūjaka-s the know-how of
these mechanical devices was already lost. In his commentary Proclus
confirms that Nicomedes performed the quadrature using the quadratrix.
On the other hand Pappus, one of the last in the tradition of yavana
mathematics, states that the use of the quadratrix in quadrature was
first due to Dinostratus, the disciple of Plato who had performed the
construction of the [doubling the cubical altar of
Apollo](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/a-personal-discursion-on-conic-sections/)
during the Delian plague sent by the god. The quadrature by Dinostratus
using the quadratrix also links it to another classical yavana problem
the trisection of the angle. Thus it can be used to simultaneously
trisect an angle and square the circle. This construction has a certain
magical quality to quality to it – a wonder in itself that shows why the
yavana philosophers and our ārya ancestors linked such constructions to
religion.

The quadratrix deployment in the Dinostratus construction goes thus:  
1\) In the quadrant of the circle with center at A divide the vertical
radius into n equal parts.  
2\) Divide the quadrant into the same number of equal parts n.  
3\) Mark the points of intersection of the radii dividing the quadrant
into n equal parts and the horizontal parallel lines dividing the
vertical radius into n equal parts. The locus of these points is the
quadratrix.  
4\) To trisect an ![\\angle
CAC'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+CAC%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle CAC'") let it cut the quadratrix at point H.  
5\) Then draw a parallel line to AC through H. It cuts the vertical
radius at G.  
6\) Trisect the
![\\overline{AG}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAG%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

![\\overline{AJ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAJ%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AJ}").  
7\) Draw a parallel line to AC through J to cut the quadratrix and draw
segment AT by connecting A to this point of intersection with the
quadratrix.  
8\) The ![\\angle CAT = \\dfrac{1}{3} \\angle

"\\angle CAT = \\dfrac{1}{3} \\angle CAC'")

1\) To perform the quadrature mark the point where the quadratrix
intersects the horizontal radius AC.  
2\) Draw the
![\\overline{KL}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BKL%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{KL}")=radius of circle and perpendicular to AC.  
3\) Draw the tangent line to the circle to be squared passing through
C.  
4\) Draw the line AL and mark the point M where it intersects the above
tangent.  
5\) Double the
![\\overline{CM}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BCM%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

6\) Create
![\\overline{CE}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BCE%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{CE}")= radius of circle to be squared along the same tangent
in the opposite direction.  
7\) Bisect the
![\\overline{EN}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BEN%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{EN}") to obtain point O and construct a circle with O as
center.  
8\) Extend AC to meet the above circle at R to deploy the geometric mean
theorem.  
9\) CR is the side of the square CRSP with same area as the starting
circle with center at A.

Today we know that this quadratrix of the old yavana-s is a curve
derived from the trigonometric cotangent function:  
![x=y\\cot \\left(\\dfrac{\\pi
}{2r}y\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Dy%5Ccot+%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi+%7D%7B2r%7Dy%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x=y\\cot \\left(\\dfrac{\\pi }{2r}y\\right)"). This function will cut
the x-axis at
![x=\\dfrac{2r}{\\pi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Cdfrac%7B2r%7D%7B%5Cpi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x=\\dfrac{2r}{\\pi}") and the line with that equation will be its
tangent at that point which is used to construct the segment used in the
above construction.

Now we shall look at the quadrature carried out by Archimedes using his
eponymous spiral which Iamblichus informs us about. First Archimedes
defines the spiral curve thus:  
“If a straight line drawn in a plane revolves uniformly any number of
times about a fixed extremity until it returns to its original position,
and if, at the same time as the line revolves, a point moves uniformly
along the straight line beginning at the fixed extremity, the point will
describe a spiral in the plane.”  
Today we can define it generally by the polar function:  
![r=a+b\\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{\\theta }{2\\pi
}\\right)^{\\dfrac{1}{c}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3Da%2Bb%5Ccdot+%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctheta+%7D%7B2%5Cpi+%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bc%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"r=a+b\\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{\\theta }{2\\pi }\\right)^{\\dfrac{1}{c}}")

![Archimedean\_spiral\_squaring](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/archimedean_spiral_squaring.png?w=640)  
Dynamic version: <https://www.geogebra.org/apps/?id=w4pVrsz4>

1\) Draw the circle to be squared centered on point A.  
2\) Draw the spiral as defined above. Now adjust the rate of the
movement of the point specifying the spiral so that after exactly
completing one turn from start point A the spiral meets meet the circle
at point C.  
3\) At point C draw the tangent to the spiral i.e. the line of
instantaneous velocity at that point. Extend it so that it cuts the
extension of the vertical diameter of the circle at point D.  
4\) This achieves two things: i) ![\\overline{AD} =2 \\pi
r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAD%7D+%3D2+%5Cpi+r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AD} =2 \\pi r") i.e. it is the perimeter of the circle, thus
being the rectification of the circle. ii) ![\\triangle
ACD](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+ACD&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\triangle ACD") has ![A= \\pi
r^{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%3D+%5Cpi+r%5E%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A= \\pi r^{2}"). Thus, it is the triangulation of the circle.  
5\) Now to square the circle bisect
![\\overline{AD}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAD%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AD}") to get point E.  
6\) Get point G by bisecting
![\\overline{EF}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BEF%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{EF}") which is the segment formed by summing
![\\overline{AE}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAE%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AE}") and
![\\overline{AF}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAF%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AF}"), which the radius of the circle to be squared.  
7\) Draw a circle with center G and
![r=GF=GE](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3DGF%3DGE&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"r=GF=GE").  
8\) Extended
![\\overline{AC}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AC}") so that it meets the above circle at point H  
9\) By the geometric mean theorem we get
![\\overline{AH}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAH%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AH}") to be the side of the square with same area as the
circle to be squared.

Elegant as these constructions are from a pre-modern perspective they
are hardly easy to perform if one does not have an effective way to
construct the curves like the quadratrix and the spiral. In principle,
with a large enough drawing space one could use a protractor and ruler
in addition to a compass to laboriously construct them taking some care
in course of doing so. Indeed, in our early youth we had performed such
constructions with just the above devices. But as Simplicius mentions
the yavana-s likely used mechanical devices for the purpose, which
probably had some level of finesse unlike the primitive, poorly working
mechanical devices we made in our youth (much to the irritated amusement
of our father and irritation of our mother for consuming her bangles in
making them). After all the yavana-s made the Antikythera mechanism so
such devices should have been entirely doable for them. The quadratrix
could have been achieved using the quadratrix compass made of two sticks
one which moved vertically and the other which rotated about origin. In
1866 CE William Stanley made beautiful instruments like the spirograph
(anticipated in a sense in the Antikythera mechanism) and the
conchoidograph to draw conchoids. It is likely Nicomedes and Apollonius
used some such device. We speculate that comparable mechanical devices
or a mechanical algorithm was used by the Hindus in the design or
construction of certain śikhara-s of certain śaiva temples like
Pattadakal Jaṃbuliṅga (below) and the ruined Kaffirkot temples F and G
(now in Mohammedan-occupied northwestern India). Of course we recognize
the need for caution in these inferences just as Stanley and Penrose
believed that the yavana-s used the conchoid at Parthenon, while others
seeing the same structures have instead suggested a hyperbolic arc or a
mere single circular arc. Nevertheless, the methods of śikhara erection
suggested in the sthāpana-tantra-s does suggest that a quadratrix-like
construction could have been achieved by moving vertically and along a
circular arc simultaneously.

The common feature of these curves used in squaring the circle is their
double motion – one which is translational which is coupled with another
which is rotational. This brings us to the mysterious curve which
Iamblichus mentions as being used by Carpus – one of double motion.
There has been one proposal that this was the cycloid. But to our
knowledge we do not encounter any knowledge of the cycloid in any
ancient culture. The yavana-s and ārya-s knew of the epicycloid but
notably we do not seem to encounter the cycloid among either of them or
other mathematically endowed people of the ancient world. This appears
very strange to us: one of the most important symbols of the
Indo-Europeans like the yavana-s and ārya-s was the rotating wheel.
Indeed, it had a major religious and cultural significance in Bhārata
being the symbol of the ārya emperors or the cakravartin-s. Thus, it
would almost seem natural that they might have converged on the cycloid;
yet, we see no traces of it in their work.

The cycloid appears to have made its presence felt only when the
reintroduction of Greek mathematics energized the revival of science in
Europe. We saw a claim that Leonardo da Vinci discovered the cycloid and
squared the circle with it. But we have no evidence for that being true
at all. As far as we can see it was the French renaissance intellectual
Charles de Bouvelles, who, having appropriated many Pythagorean ideas
into his Christian framework, successfully squared the circle with the
cycloid for the first time. The cycloid was since a matter of much
competition between various mathematicians in the context of various
problems. However, we shall not talk upon any of those here except a
couple of points (see below).

![cycloid\_squaring\_roberval](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/cycloid_squaring_roberval.png?w=640)  
[Dynamic version](https://www.geogebra.org/apps/?id=wcGjyUSN)

The squaring of the circle with the cycloid is probably the easiest of
all methods. Indeed, even without a mechanical device one can construct
a relatively clean cycloid with just a compass, ruler and protractor –
we had done just this in our youth using the famous “A book of curves”
by EH Lockwood. The procedure goes thus:  
1\) Take the unit circle with center at A and mark a point C’ on its
circumference where it touches the base line (“X-axis”).  
2\) Move the circle like a wheel so that it completes a full rotation;
the locus point C’ traces out is the cycloid and the circle is
accordingly termed the generating circle.  
3\) Since every point on the circle touches the base line cycloid marks
out a length of ![\\overline{BE}=2 \\pi
r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBE%7D%3D2+%5Cpi+r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{BE}=2 \\pi r") on the base line, i.e. the perimeter of the
circle, thus being the rectification of the circle.  
4\) Bisect
![\\overline{BE}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBE%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{BE}") to get point F  
5\) Extend
![\\overline{BE}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBE%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{BE}") along the base line towards point F by length equal to
the radius of the generating circle.  
6\) Bisect the
![\\overline{BH}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBH%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{BH}") thus derived to get point I and construct a circle
with I as center and radius
![\\overline{IB}=\\overline{IH}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BIB%7D%3D%5Coverline%7BIH%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{IB}=\\overline{IH}")  
7\) Draw a perpendicular to the base line at point F to cut the circle
at J. By the geometric mean theorem
![\\overline{FJ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BFJ%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{FJ}") is the side of the square with area equal to the
generating circle.

Because this method of the quadrature is the easiest and so much in tune
with the wheel, that symbol of the ancient, we find the absence of this
method in ancient literature to be something of a cognitive lacuna.
Indeed, we have often wondered why this was so\!

Like us, probably some time when one was in secondary school, one might
have thought: “Hey why not square the circle with a sinusoid curve?”
Indeed, the way to achieve that is via the same cycloid:  
1\) Draw a line parallel to the base line through C’ which will cut the
vertical diameter
![\\overline{OC}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{OC}") of the generating circle at point L.  
2\) The locus of point L is a sinusoid curve (in red) which you can use
just as the cycloid for the quadrature of the generating circle.

Indeed, that sinusoid curve was the one discovered and used by the
French intellectual Gilles de Roberval though he did not know it was a
sinusoid. But today we know that it is the curve ![y=r\\left(1-\\cos
\\left(\\dfrac{x}{r}\\right)\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dr%5Cleft%281-%5Ccos+%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7Bx%7D%7Br%7D%5Cright%29%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y=r\\left(1-\\cos \\left(\\dfrac{x}{r}\\right)\\right)") where r is the
radius of the generating circle.

Before we round off this little foray into the cycloid we may touch upon
another issue, namely the history of the determination of the area under
it. Today we solve this using integral calculus and one might even
recall encountering it, with a touch of relief, on the university
entrance exam. But it was not so easy in the past. The cycloid caught
the attention of the great scientist Galileo even as it had captivated
other minds big and small since its discovery. He apparently even gave
it the name we use and was the first to seek to find the area under it.
With calculus still being a thing of the future in the neo-western
world, he resorted to an experimental approach, which is much frowned
upon these days by the class which holds rigor as a fetish. But those
days there was much less of that and Galileo made a hump of the cycloid
and the generating circle from the same sheet of metal and compared
their weights. As a result he arrived at a ratio close to 3. But
interestingly he thought rather than being 3 it was some other non-whole
figure close to 3 \[Knowing this people might be less inclined to cast
aspersion at first attempts of the ārya-s to find
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi") as preserved in the yajur brāhmaṇa-s\]. But the correct solution
had to wait till Roberval took on the problem right around the time
Galileo was being sentenced for heresy by the Christians. He used a
somewhat complicated construction for a relatively straightforward
problem: He first constructed the sinusoid curve mentioned above to show
that that it bisected the area of the rectangle bounding a hump of the
cycloid, i.e. ![\\dfrac{1}{2} 2r.2\\pi r = 2 \\pi
r^{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+2r.2%5Cpi+r+%3D+2+%5Cpi+r%5E%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\dfrac{1}{2} 2r.2\\pi r = 2 \\pi r^{2}"). Then he showed by another
construction that the area between the sinusoid and the hump was equal
to that of the generating circle. Thus, summing it up he got it to be
![= 3 \\pi
r^{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3D+3+%5Cpi+r%5E%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"= 3 \\pi r^{2}").

Now we hear that Roberval and his hated rival Rene Descartes, as also
Pierre Fermat, fought a lot about this derivation of the area. But using
a simpler construction which was familiar to these dueling Frenchmen we
can use the method of Mamikon to easily arrive at this area:

![cycloid\_Mamikon](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/cycloid_mamikon.png?w=640)

1\) Construct the bounding rectangle AHIG for the hump of the cycloid,
which as noted above has ![A= 2r.2\\pi r = 4 \\pi
r^{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%3D+2r.2%5Cpi+r+%3D+4+%5Cpi+r%5E%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A= 2r.2\\pi r = 4 \\pi r^{2}")  
2\) Construct the tangent segments to the cycloid ending in the bounding
rectangle AHIG.  
3\) Translate the tangent segments to form the tangent cluster; by
Mamikon’s theorem the tangent sweep, which is the area between rectangle
and the hump, will have the same area as the tangent cluster.  
4\) We note that the tangent cluster recapitulates the generating
circle; ![\\therefore A= 4\\pi r^{2}- \\pi r^{2}=3 \\pi r^{2}
](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctherefore+A%3D+4%5Cpi+r%5E%7B2%7D-+%5Cpi+r%5E%7B2%7D%3D3+%5Cpi+r%5E%7B2%7D+&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\therefore A= 4\\pi r^{2}- \\pi r^{2}=3 \\pi r^{2} ")

This construction should have been easier than Roberval’s version. Yet,
it had to wait till centuries later to be discovered. Hindsight is
always 20-20 but what it could also mean as suggested by the above story
of the cycloid is that the Zeitgeist matters. Perhaps as Oswald Spengler
had hypothesized the mathematic (to borrow his term) is very much the
product of the civilizational epoch and certain things manifest
themselves as self-evident only when the right epoch has arrived. Thus
what seem trivial thereafter might not have been so before.

◊◊◊◊

Talking of this Zeitgeist, it appears that European scientific revival
indeed passed through its own recapitulation of the Classical mathematic
when it came to the hoary problem of trisection. As we saw above, the
yavana-s not only realized its link to the squaring of the circle, but
also invented other means to achieve it, like the conchoid of Nicomedes.
Now, even as the cycloid appeared in the neo-western mathematic as a
means of squaring the circle, other trisection curves too followed
along.

But we shall go to these trisection methods of more recent vintage only
after paying homage to the conchoid of Nicomedes and using it to offer
to the gods that “king of the constructions”, the regular heptagon.
First the trisection of the angle:

![conchoid\_trisection](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/conchoid_trisection.png?w=640)

1\) To trisect angle ![\\angle
BAC](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+BAC&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle BAC") take a point C on
![\\overrightarrow{AC}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverrightarrow%7BAC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overrightarrow{AC}")  
2\) Along
![\\overrightarrow{AC}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverrightarrow%7BAC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overrightarrow{AC}") mark point E such that ![\\overline{CE} =2.
\\overline{AC}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BCE%7D+%3D2.+%5Coverline%7BAC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{CE} =2. \\overline{AC}"); this
![\\overline{CE}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BCE%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

The locus of the points marked on the lines of the pencil by these arcs

*We offer this heptagon to the fierce god Rudra in his dinosaurine
manifestation as the most terrifying Śarabha. Following in the footsteps
of the tradition in which the rahasya-s of the most glorious yantra of
Śarabha, that container of mysterious geometries, have been passed down
we present its heart the sama-saptāśra – that figure which encompasses
within it the seven great goddesses Indrāṇi, Vaiṣṇavī, Vārāhī, Kaumārī,
Raudrī, Brāhmī, Cāmuṇḍā and seven tongues of the god Agni. kṣmlvryūṃ

The construction of the regular heptagon goes thus:  
1\) Draw a circle with center A and horizontal diameter BAC.  
2\) Cut this circle with an arc using B as center and radius
![\\overline{BA}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBA%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{BA}"), i.e. same as the circle, to obtain point E.  
3\) Trisect radius
![\\overline{BA}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBA%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{BA}") to get point D.  
4\) Use D as center to construct ![\\angle
BDE](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+BDE&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle BDE").  
5\) Trisect ![\\angle
BDE](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+BDE&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle BDE") using the conchoid as above to get ![\\angle BDR=
\\dfrac{1}{3} \\angle
BDE](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+BDR%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%5Cangle+BDE&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle BDR= \\dfrac{1}{3} \\angle BDE")  
6\) Draw line parallel to
![\\overrightarrow{DR}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverrightarrow%7BDR%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overrightarrow{DR}") through point E; it cuts line BC at point K.  
7\) With K as center and radius
![\\overline{BA}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBA%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{BA}") cut original circle at points L and M.  
8\) Now points L, C and M are three points of the regular heptagon; use
them to complete the required polygon CLNOPQM.

The Neo-Platonist from Harran, [Thabit ibn
Kurra](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/08/28/the-makings-of-islamic-science/),
preserves how Archimedes achieved the construction of the regular
heptagon once one can trisect an angle. However, it does not appear to
have been universally known even among the yavana-s – Heron provides
only an approximation by stating that one can construct it by making a
segment 7/8ths of the radius of the inscribing circle. The marūnmatta
scientist Abu al Wafa preserved a Hindu approximation which was
![\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3} }{2} .
r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D+%7D%7B2%7D+.+r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3} }{2} . r") which was easier for quick construction
than trisection which would have ideally needed a mechanical device.

The above construction of the regular heptagon using the conchoid has
some similarities to the new trisectors that emerged in Europe following
the renaissance. The first well shall consider is the elegant trisection
using the limacon by the great kṛśapuruṣa Issac Newton:

![limacon\_trisection](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/limacon_trisection1.png?w=640)

1\) To trisect ![\\angle
BAB'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+BAB%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle BAB'") draw a circle with apex of angle, i.e. point A as
center; its horizontal diameter is CAB.  
2\) Consider a pencil of lines passing through point C; other than point
C they will intersect the above circle at another point.  
3\) Consider an exemplar of that pencil of lines which cuts the circle
at point B”  
4\) Using B” as the center and radius same as the above circle cut arcs
on the said line CB” to get points E and F. The locus of points E and F
generated by the entire pencil of lines is the Newtonian limacon. This
limacon has a cross-over point at C and the midpoint of its inner lobe
passes through the center of the circle at A.  
6\) Extend
![\\overrightarrow{AB'}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverrightarrow%7BAB%27%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overrightarrow{AB'}") of the angle to be trisected to cut the limacon
at point G.  
7\) Draw
![\\overrightarrow{CG}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverrightarrow%7BCG%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overrightarrow{CG}") joining points C and G.  
8\) ![\\angle CGA= \\dfrac{1}{3} \\angle
BAB'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+CGA%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%5Cangle+BAB%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle CGA= \\dfrac{1}{3} \\angle BAB'"); incidentally ![\\angle GCA=
\\dfrac {2}{3} \\angle

"\\angle GCA= \\dfrac {2}{3} \\angle BAB'")

Finally we shall consider the construction of Newton’s associate Colin
Maclaurin who was a very intelligent man of his own right:

![Maclaurin\_trisector](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/maclaurin_trisector.png?w=640)

1\) To trisect ![\\angle
DBD'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+DBD%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle DBD'") consider a horizontal line passing through the same
point as the apex of the said angle, i.e. point B; let that line rotate
about that point.  
2\) Extend the base of the angle to be trisected,
![\\overrightarrow{DB}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverrightarrow%7BDB%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overrightarrow{DB}") in the opposite direction to obtain a point A.  
3\) Consider a horizontal line through A which rotates about A; this
line through A rotates through one third of the angle through which the
earlier line through B rotates.  
4\) The locus of the point of intersection of the two rotating lines is
the Maclaurin trisectrix, a curve shaped like an Indus valley
civilization sign. Its cross-over point is at A and the center of its
loop is at B.  
5\) The
![\\overrightarrow{BD'}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverrightarrow%7BBD%27%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overrightarrow{BD'}") of the angle to be trisected cuts the
trisectrix at point E.  
6\) Draw a line joining A to E.  
7\) ![\\angle EAB= \\dfrac{1}{3} \\angle
DBD'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+EAB%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%5Cangle+DBD%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle EAB= \\dfrac{1}{3} \\angle DBD'")

As we round up this reenactment of geometric experience we get the sense
of Spengler having apprehended something genuine when he speculated that
the mathematic of a culture tracks the evolution of the culture and its
“civilizational character”. Thus, some problems had a similar point of
appearance and interest between the cultures. However, we should point
out that in the case of post-renaissance Europe the source of many of
these common developments ultimately goes back to the yavana world. The
yavana knowledge indeed twice invigorated cultures which had limited
knowledge production before its introduction – that of the marūnmatta-s
and mleccha-s. In their respective mathematic, upon introduction, the
same class of problems interested them for period but they then diverged
and evolved along their own tracks rather distinct from that of their
yavana intellectual forbears. However, in each case the trajectory
appears to have been influenced by the inner civilizational character of
the respective recipient systems. The recipient scaffold in the case of
both the marūnmatta-s and mleccha-s was an Abrahamism. In the case of
the marūnmatta-s this transmission occurred primarily via the surviving
heathens who managed to hold on during the prolonged
Zoroastrian-Mohammedan struggle. It did shake the hold of Abrahamism in
some of the Mohmmedans resulting in the free-thinkers down to Ulugh Beg.
But the third Abrahamism was able to squelch any such rupture of its
fabric by free-thinking. But its heavy hand meant the civilizational
character of the marūnmatta-s could not take the yavana seed far beyond
the stages the yavana-s had earlier coursed through.

On the other hand when the same yavana mathematic reached the mleccha-s,
in no mean part via the marūnmatta-s, it unleashed a much stronger
counter-current against the second Abrahamism. This counter-current
proceeded far enough that it sparked a shift in the civilizational
character before it was digested and successfully incorporated into the
resurgent Abrahamistic scaffold. This modified civilizational character
of what self-identifies today as the western world \[Note Bertrand
Russell’s “Wisdom of the West”\] resulted in a mathematic that Spengler
recognized as distinct from the Classical one. Its calculus
manifestation was different from that of the calculus of the yavana sage
Archimedes, eventually settling to a world where limits precede
derivatives and derivatives in turn precede integrals (i.e.
anti-derivatives). We hold that methods like that of Mamikon did not
arise until almost by chance and in isolation in the 20th century
because the civilizational character behind the mathematic had changed.
Indeed, Mamikon’s method might have been closer to the yavana or even
the Babylonian world.

Finally, we may note the interesting case of Bhārata and Greece. Though
both were heathens sharing a specific common ancestry (including of
their traditions of knowledge) and interacted extensively in the ancient
world, their respective mathematic did not penetrate each other. Despite
all the white-indological assertion of Hindu mathematics being a
derivative of Greek and Mesopotamian mathematics there was little
penetration of the Hindu mathematic per say from the knowledge of the
Greeks. Where the Greek knowledge specifically influenced the Hindus was
in astrology but it at best weakly impacted the mathematic itself. Given
the Greek achievements, there was much in Hindu mathematics (contrary to
the assertions of white indologists and their Japanese imitators), which
could have taken the Greeks to atmospheric heights. But like with the
Hindus, there was little penetration into Greek mathematic. This
suggests being ancient cultures with intact knowledge systems \[unlike
the marūnmatta-s and mleccha-s, who started from close to the ground
level\] evolving in parallel their respective mathematic was too deeply
intertwined with their respective civilizational character to profoundly
influence each other \[This in part contributes to the notion of Hindus
as idiots seen among white indologists. The other part of it being
contributed by the much deeper conflict with the Abrahamistic
scaffold\]. Interestingly, we would say eventually the Hindus reached a
mathematic that converged partly to the mathematic of the western world
with its own comparable calculus and set theory. That does make one
think if the entry of the Hindu strain of mathematic into the west via
the marūnmatta-s contributed in some way to this.
