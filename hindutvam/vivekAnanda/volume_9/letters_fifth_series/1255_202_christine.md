## CCII

*To Sister Christine*

THE MATH, BELUR,  
DIST. HOWRAH, BENGAL,

*27th August 1901*.

DEAR CHRISTINE,

I am expecting a long, long letter from you; and, like all expectations
of mine, \[it\] will not be realized, I fear.

Well, I need not bother you with the usual string of questions: How are
you? What are you doing all this summer? etc. I am sure the Mother will
\[do\] so much as to keep you in good health at least.

Now, Christina, for many reasons this letter happens to be short, very.
It is written with the special purpose that as soon as you get this,
send me your latest photograph.

Did you write to Miss \[Sarah Ellen\] Waldo about the publication of the
books? I get no news and, what is more important, no money (that is
between you and me) from the sale.

Did you have any news of Margot \[Sister Nivedita\], of Mrs. \[Ole\]
Bull etc.? And are you happy? I sometimes feel I am, other times it is
clouded. Well, it is all the body, after all — material. Goodbye.

Yours with love and blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA.

PS — Do send the photo as soon as possible.

V.
