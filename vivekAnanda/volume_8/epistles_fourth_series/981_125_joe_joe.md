## CXXV

*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

DARJEELING,  
*18th April, 1898*.

MY DEAR JOE JOE,

I was down with fever brought upon, perhaps, by excessive mountain
climbing and the bad health in the station.

I am better today and intend leaving this in a day or two. In spite of
the great heat there, I used to sleep well in Calcutta and had some
appetite. Here both have vanished — this is all the gain.

I could not see Miss Müller yet on the subject of Marguerite; but I
intend to write her today. She is making all arrangements to receive her
here. Mr. Gupta is also invited to teach them Bengali. She may now do
something about her. I shall, however, write.

It will be easy for Marguerite to see Kashmir any time during her stay;
but if Miss M. is not willing, there will be a big row again to injure
both her and Marguerite.

I am not sure whether I go to Almora again. Much riding it seems is sure
to bring on a relapse. I will wait for you at Simla — whilst you pay
your visit to the Seviers. We will think on it when I am in. I am so
glad to learn that Miss Noble delivered an address at the R.K. Mission.
With all love to the Trinity,

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.
