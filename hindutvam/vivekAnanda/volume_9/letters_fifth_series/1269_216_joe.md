## CCXVI

*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

GOPAL LAL VILLA  
BENARAS CANTONMENT

*14 February 1902*.

DEAR JOE —

I received a note yesterday from Mr. Okakura \[Kakuzo\]. They have seen
Agra on their way to Gwalior. They must be there now.

The wire he sent to Japan was to Mr. \[Tokuno\] Oda to come immediately.
There was a work. "Six" in it also.

It is quite cool here even now — and will remain so for this month at
least. Is it getting warm in Calcutta?

I hope Mrs. \[Ole\] Bull and Nivedita are getting well rested after that
tremendous journey.

I am so so.

The boys all send love.

Ever Yours with love and blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA.
