## XXIX

54 W. 33 NEW YORK,  
*May, 1895*.

DEAR \_\_,

Since writing to you my pupils have come round me with help, and the
classes will go on nicely now no doubt.

I was so glad at it because teaching has become a part of my life, as
necessary to my life as eating or breathing. 

Yours,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. I saw a lot of things about \_\_ in an English paper, the
*Borderland*. \_\_ is doing good work in India, making the Hindus, very
much to appreciate their own religion. . . . I do not find any
scholarship in \_\_'s writing, . . . nor do I find any spirituality
whatever. However Godspeed to anyone who wants to do good to the world.

How easily this world can be duped by humbugs and what a mass of fraud
has gathered over the devoted head of poor humanity since the dawn of
civilisation.
