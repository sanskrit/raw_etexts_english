title = "08 The Rama Episode (Ramopakhyana) and the Ramayana"

+++

Sluszkiewicz’s elaborate dissertation^ on the recensions of the Rema-
yaoa has revived the interest in the question of the relationship between
the Ramayaija and the Rama Episode of the Mahabharata, a question
which appears to have been first mooted by Weber.^ Weber had contented
himself with formulating the four logical alternatives : (1) the Ramopa-
khyana is the source of the Ramayaipa ; (2) the Ramopakhyana constitutes
an epitome of the Ramayaiia, but of a Ramayajiia more primitive than the
epic in its present form ; (3) the Ramopakhyana represents an epitome of
the Ramayana, but an epitome nxxlified somewhat by the compiler of the
Episode himself ; and lastly ; (4) the two poems are derived independently
from a lost common source. The alternatives worked out by Weber may
be admitted ; but then logical possibilities, unfortunately, do not carry us
very far in historical investigations.

Jacobi, who has dealt with the question at great length in Das Rama-
ya^a, Geschichte und Inhalt (Bonn 1893), held firmly to the opinion that
the Ramopakhyana was based on the Ramayaiia, on our Ralmayana, on the
Rama Epic as we have it, — the episode forming a rather careless abridgment

of Valmiki’s epic (op. cit. p. 70). In discussing the question he has drawn
attention to certain passages in the Ramopakhyana which presuppose a
knowledge of the Ramayana, and which would be indeed unintelligible if
the reader did not know certain facts and circumstances which were detailed
in the Epic but omitted in the Episode. This argument {473} seems to be
not quite as sound as it appears at first sight ; because, for the allusions
in question, the compiler of the Episode might haVe been indebted to any
other source or sources which likewise contained those explanatory allusions
which happen to be omitted in the Episode. The allusions do not point
unequivocally to any one single definite source.

But Jacx)BI did not of course base his case on this fact alone. He
strengthened it from another side. He pointed out (op. cit. pp. 72 ff.) about
a dozen pa!ssages which the Episode had in common with the Epic. These
parallelisms carry naturally far greater weight than the allusions mentioned
above. Exact verbal agreement between the works of two poets, even though
they may be working on the sa!me theme, are always suspicious. The
human mind is not easily duplicated. Sinular ideas may arise independ-
ently : but the words in which they become clothed are still something per-
sonal and characteristic, varying with each individual.

Jacx>bi attached special importance to one particular stanza in the
Episode,-— a veritable doggerel which, (according to Jacobi) was evidently
a copy of the perfect Ramayaipa stanza — once heard never forgotten

The Mbh. caricature of this stanza, according to Jacobi, was :

Jacobi was of opinion that this statiza of inferior form proves borrow-
ing because it is inferior. This unquestionably proved also, Jacobi argued,
that the Episode is merely an epitome of our Ramayania. The argument
is again not quite conclusive, and the point has been contested by Hopkins.
“ A great poet/’ says Hopkins, “ is more apt to take a weak verse and
make it strong than is a copyist to ruin a verse already excellent” (Gteat
Epic, p. 63). Whatever the merits of this latter contention, Jacobi’s con-
clusion appears to be correct in the main, though his argument is certainly
fallacious. Jacobi should have stopped short with the stanza. The Maha-

bharata stanza appears to be — ^and very probably is — a weak £474} imita-
tion of the Ramayaina stanzal. The fallacy lies in the extension that the
Ramopakhyana is therefore a weak imitation of the Ramayaaja. The rela-
tion between the two stanzas does not necessarily prove an 5 dhing about the
relationship between the Ramayana and the Ramopakhylana as u/iholes.

WiNTERNiTZ^ has already warned us that each stanza of The Mbh. must
be judged on its own merits, — it may be added, whm we wanti to use^ the
stanza for historical and compctraiive purposes. We could not find a better
example of this dictum than the stanza on which Jacobi has relied for
establishing the posteriority of the Ramopakhyana. The stanza has an
intricate history. Though found in all our old printed editions, the MS.
support for it is surprisingly meagre. Of the two lines comprising the stanza,
the second was found only in Bengali MSS. in addition to some stray Nagari
MSS. ; but the first line is itself known in two variant versions ! The form
known to and cited by Jacobi, namely,




alternates with alnother :




which appears to be an attempt at remedying the awkwardness of thei for-
mer, which was the subject of Jacobi’s strictures.^ Both lines are however
completely missing in Kaimlrt and Southern MSS, {besides many old Nagari
MSS .^) ! This fact leaves no room now for doubting that the stanza in
question is but a very late addition to the Great Epic. It can therefore
naturally prove nothing whatsoever about the age or the character of the
original Episode to which it has been secondarily alppended by a recent
interpolator. All disquisitions based on this stanza from the Ramopakhyana
have consequently become futile. We must look for other criteria.


This only shows how very precarious are the conclusions that are based
on the Vulgate text of the Mbh, And it is very remarkable that many of
those very passages that have been used in the past lot literary-historical
purposes have turned out to be unhappily but also unquestionably spurious.^

H. Oldenberg to illustratel his Akhy^a theory. It is well known that Oldenberg
always maintained that the oldest foim of epic poetry in India wa^ a mixture of
prose and verse, the speeches being in verses, while the events were narrated in
prose. In this coimection he drew attention to the story of Sibi in the Vanaparvan

(475} However the fact that one pairticular stanza cited by Jacobi has
turned out to be unauthentic does not affect his gaieral conclusion about
the relationship between the Ramop^yiana and the Ramayana which, in
my opinion, is quite wdl-founded and can be supported on other grounds.

As far asi I cata judge, the minute differences in the details of the story,
which have been pointed out and exaggerated by some critics of jACOBrs
theory, tell us nothing whatsoever about the matter which is the subject of
discussion. The verbal agreements have, on the other hand, an unusually
great probative force. To strengthen the case of Jacobi, we need therefore
a large nuirber of agreements, I had this fact in mind when I was stud 5 ring
the Ramopakhyana for my edition of Vanaparvan or — ^to give it its correct
name — ^AraDyakapaWan.

Jacobi had found just twelve concordances. They are obviously too few.
But their actual number should be very much greater, even if we exclude
the epic iterata and standing phrases, which are the comimon heritage of the
epic bards and which have been listed separately by Hopkins in an Appendix
to his Great Epic, It would be premature, it seems to me, to discuss the
question which of the existing versions of the Ramiayaii>a our Episode stands
closest to. That question can be taken up only when we have a really criti-
cal! edition of the Ramayaija, which is promised by my friend and colleague
Professor Raghu Vira of Lahore from his International Academy of Indian
Culture. In the meantime, I shall just register the concordances which I
have been able to find, irrespective of the versions of the Ramayapa to
which they may belong.^ A scholar who knows his Ramayajoa better
than I do would naturally be able to handle the question with more com-
(476}petence and find more concordances. But in the absence of such an
exhaustive study by a savant who has mastered both the poems, the follow-
ing table which I have prepared may be found useful. I have consulted
only the Bombay edition (published in 1888 by the Nimaya Sagar Press)
and Gqrresio’s edition (1843-1867). Of the latter edition, moreover, the
last volume (Uttarakaijda) was not available to me and therefore could
not be utilized.


bharata, p/ 23) regarded as a survival from the oldest form W our great epic can
now on manuscript authority be proved to be one of the latest interpolations in
the epic. We are not concerned with the date of this passage. The passage may
jbe of hoary antiquity — ^though I doubt it personally — , but it certainly never formed
a part of the Oldest strata of the Mahabharata : that much we can xk>w say with
confidence. * One sees how even a scholar like Oldenbeko can make abysmal
blunders in the estimarion of the age and character of passages of the Mah^bhkratav

This cannot be considered as an exhaustive list.^ In fact I must 
frankly confess that my study of the Raniayaioa has been rather {487} per- 
functory, and moreover it is difficult to identify passages in a work like the 
Ramiayana’ in the absence of a verse-index. A closer study of the Epic and 
Episode, I am confident, would result in the tracing of many more paraWhsm^ 
in diction and phraseology. I must here add that I have intentionally ex- 


^ In the above list Nos. 5, 8, 23, 31, 79 and 82 were traceable to the Bombay 
ed. only ; Nos. 9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 19, 26, 33, 37, 41, 44, 53, 66, 74, 75 and 81 were 
traceable to Qoirresio^s edition only ; while the remaining 64 are common to the 
two editions of the Ramayaagia . — En passant I may add that even from these figures 
one can see that text of Gorresio's edition is nearer to the Critical Edition of the 
Ramopiakhy&ia than that of the Bombay Edition of the Ramiya^a^ a tondurion 
which is confirmed by the numerous agreements in individual readings between 
and our text as against the tradition represented by the Bombay text,

eluded such passages as show merely parallelisms in ideas, and I have strictly 
confined myself to exact verbal similarities. The greater the number of such 
verbal similarities the weaker becomes the case for Hopk^s. He, relying 
on the many minor differences in detail, argues that the fact that the subject- 
matter of the Epic and the Episode is^treated differently in several particulars 
points to different workings-over of older matter rather than to copying or 
condensing'* (Hopkins, op. cit. p. 63). Hopkins loses sight of the fact that 
differences like those pointed out by him do not prove anything in such cases. 
Differences are! natural and may be expected ; nay, they could scarcely be 
avoided — as far as I can judge— when one is condensing a work of about 
26,000 stanzas. But ajgreements in the bulk can never be casual or acci- 
dental ; they show invariably identity of source. And the source, as already 
pointed out by Jacobi,^ was not a manuscript of the Ramayaina, but a memo- 
rized version of it, current in the time of the adapter and in his locality. Then, 
I expect, the compilers of such works could hardly avoid the influence from 
oral tradition which existed then. In this restricted sense we nxist under- 
stand the statement that the Ramopakhyana is an epitome of our Ramayana, 
a fact which we may regard as established on account of the numerous verbal 
agreements which have been shown to exist between the two poems.*
