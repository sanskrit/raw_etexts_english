## ISHVARA AND BRAHMAN

In reply to a question as to the exact position of Ishvara in Vedantic
Philosophy, the Swami Vivekananda, while in Europe, gave the following
definition:

"Ishvara is the sum total of individuals, yet He is an Individual, as
the human body is a unit, of which each cell is an individual. Samashti
or collected equals God; Vyashti or analysed equals the Jiva. The
existence of Ishvara, therefore, depends on that of Jiva, as the body on
the cell, and vice versa. Thus, Jiva and Ishvara are coexistent beings;
when one exists, the other must. Also, because, except on our earth, in
all the higher spheres, the amount of good being vastly in excess of the
amount of evil, the sum total (Ishvara) may be said to be all-good.
Omnipotence and omniscience are obvious qualities and need no argument
to prove from the very fact of totality. Brahman is beyond both these
and is not a conditioned state; it is the only Unit not composed of many
units, the principle which runs through all from a cell to God, without
which nothing can exist; and whatever is real is that principle, or
Brahman. When I think I am Brahman, I alone exist; so with others.
Therefore, each one is the whole of that principle."
