## CLXVIII

(*Translated from [Bengali](b8450e8168.pdf)* )

*To Swami Turiyananda*

DEAR HARIBHAI,

I am glad to hear that your leg is all right and that you are doing
splendid work. My body is going on all right. The thing is, I fall ill
when I take too much precaution. I am cooking, eating whatever comes,
working day and night, and I am all right and sleeping soundly!

I am going over to New York within a month. Has Sarada's magazine gone
out of circulation? I am not getting it any longer. *Awakened* also has
gone to sleep, I think. They are not sending it to me any more. Let that
go. There is an outbreak of plague in our country; who knows who is
alive and who is dead! Well, a letter from Achu has come today. He had
hidden himself in the town of Ramgarh in Sikar State. Someone told him
that Vivekananda was dead; so he has written to me! I am sending him a
reply.

All well here. Hope this finds you and all others well.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.
