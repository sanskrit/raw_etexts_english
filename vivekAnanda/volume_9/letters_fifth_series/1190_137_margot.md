## CXXXVII

*To Sister Nivedita*

THE MATH, BELUR,

*April 25th, 1899*

MY DEAR MARGOT,

I could not come today. I am so, so sorry. The body would not allow —
neither can I come to the Boses'.[1](#fn1) I have written to them.

I have an engagement tomorrow.

Possibly I may see you in the evening.

With all love and blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA
