“Who is this damsel, tasted and set free, who is she with the wandering
eye and garments clung by sweat to her limbs?  
She wanders here and there at the break of dawn, a deer timid and
anxious she resembles,  
By which bee \[lover\] was the throbbing nectar of the lower lip of this
lotus faced damsel drunk? By which man has heaven been enjoyed today? By
whom was the God of Love, slain by the eye of Shiva satisfied?”
