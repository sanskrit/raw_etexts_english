title = "The guillotineâ€™s fall"

+++
Are standing in front of the guillotine?  
Or did you walk through the guillotine before the blade fell?  
Or is your head on the block waiting the fall of the blade?  
One verily does not know..  
Sometimes you do things you would have never done; why did you do
them?  
I really cannot tell.
