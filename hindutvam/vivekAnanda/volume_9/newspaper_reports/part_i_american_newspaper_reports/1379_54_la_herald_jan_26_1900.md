## THE SCIENCE OF YOGA

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 5, p. 276.)

\[*Los Angeles Herald*, January 26, 1900\]

Swami Vivekananda, the Oriental seer, lectured at the Shakespeare club
this morning \[Thursday, January 25\] on "The Science of Yoga". (Of
which no verbatim transcript is available.) He said that there is no
difference in kind between anything in nature, but that all differences
are of degree merely. The mind is the supreme power, the motor of the
world.
