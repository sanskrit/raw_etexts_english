The bus came to halt at the underground stop. Vrishchika of pretty
tresses got off the bus and walked up the stairs to reach the
over-bridge. She reached the middle of the bridge and stood there
looking out expectantly at the road. It was a remarkably clear day and
she could see the yonder horizon where the azure heights of father Dyaus
met his lover mother Pṛthivī clad in the verdant vesture of the distant
woods. Vrishchika passed into a reverie at that sight and remained
oblivious to the throng of people who criss-crossed the bridge in either
direction. Suddenly, an ugly man sidled up beside her and before she
could react to his presence he said: “Ma’am do you visit the Hindu
temple at Śukramārga?” Vrishchika: “On rare occasions.” The man
responded: “We need wealthy patrons like you to visit the temple more
often and make donations. Please do so devī”. So saying he handed a
pamphlet to her. Vrishchika wondered: “A soothsayer at the temple of the
Vāyu-born vānara had once told my family that I would be the wealthiest
of all my sisters. But I’m hardly in that state now. Yet, why does he
even think I’m wealthy?” She snapped out of that train of thought and
waved the ugly man away saying “śubham astu\! It is far way from my
place but I’ll try.”

She continued to look out at the road and not seeing what she wanted to
see, she turned to the pamphlet. It was crowded with temple events.
There was a Rudra-pūjā for the 13th pradoṣa and a Viṣṇu-pūjā for the
ekādaśī. There was another event for Vināyaka, for which there was a
call for people to join in a mass-recitation of the Gaṇeśopaniṣat. Yet
another corner mentioned a Vaṭakini-mahotsava for the fierce ape. Then
there was some announcements of secular events. A professor of Indian
origin, who was popular with the people at the local chapter of the
“right-wing debate club”, with a penchant for peddling false
etymologies and outrageous counter-factual theories was giving a lecture
series covering issues such as the autochthonous origin of Aryans,
reading Vedic mantra-s in the Harappan inscriptions, and situating the
Mahābhārata at earlier than 5000 years in India. Vrishchika said to
herself: “I’m sure the puruṣa would find this buffoon quite amusing
where it not for the pernicious consequences it has on our people.” Then
there was a call for people to attend classes for language acquisition
or learning the recitation of five sūkta-s from the Kṛṣṇa-yajurveda. She
noticed that the latter was organized by a bābā-crazed young lady who
had been her patient.

Just as her eyes wandered to the next item on the pamphlet the corner of
her vision lit up with the sight of a bus halting on the road below and
Indrasena saunter out of it. Upon meeting midway at the bridge the two
walked ahead to towards the station to board the train for a long ride
back home. Vrishchika: “Dear Ātreya, when I was waiting on the bridge, I
received this temple pamphlet from a man who, if my vague recollection
is correct, evidently supplements his income by playing a horoscopist
and palm-reader at the temple on Śukramārga. What is interesting is that
just as I caught sight of you I was reading this little announcement
here.” Saying so she handed it over to Indrasena. Even as he was looking
at it she articulated it: “It looks as though this banker Atigupta Sādhu
is commissioning the consecration of an image of the Yakṣarāṭ in the
northern niche of the temple on the ekadaśī of next month. It reminded
me that you have yet to impart to me the rahasya of the ekadaśī-vrata
that you had mentioned long ago in your hometown.” Indrasena: “That’s
quite remarkable. There is actually more than what meets the eye here.
Indeed, it was in my mind too that I convey the vidyā to you, O daughter
of an Aṅgiras, for after all I’d need a dīkṣita-patnī when I impart it
to the ācārya who will be doing that sthāpanā.”

Vrishchika: “That’s interesting. So you were aware of this?”  
Indrasena: “Yes Alini. There is a long story here that I’ve not had the
chance to tell you.”  
Vrishchika: “I’m now very curious to hear it all.”  
Indrasena: “Atigupta Sādhu was the student of a charismatic mantravādinī
from the regions of Mahākāla. He had received a magic square of Rājarāja
from her and consequently his wealth greatly expanded as befits a V3. He
wanted to install an image of Dhanada at the temple at Śukramārga. He
employed none other than the initial teacher of mine the vaṅgasiṃha, for
whom there is no “tataḥ kim?” after “dhanaṃ meru-tulyam” and he was
almost half an Uesugi Kenshin of the prācya-s. But, as I’ve told you
before, he only possessed incomplete vidyā-s. Thus, his sthāpanā failed
like that of Skanda by the marāṭhā chief Raghunātharāu and the image was
damaged when lightning struck the temple. The V3 was distraught and went
to his teacher back in Mālava. She happened have studied some
śāstra-siddhānta under Lootika. She then consulted your sister, who
not wanting to give out my identity publicly told her that if Vitteśa
were to be pleased with the said V3 he would find the right V1 who will
solve his samasyā. The vaṇij went around for a while until he
circuitously got introduced to me by Somakhya. I told the V3 that I
could not be a sthāpakācārya at a temple but I could impart a key vrata
to the vaiṣṇava sthāpaka at the temple who would then achieve success
with the endeavor upon performing the vrata. This, my pretty girl, is
the whole story. The vrata is none other than the one of the ekādaśī
that I’ll expound to you once we are home.”

Back home, taking in the good night air and the dark canopy of the
nakṣatra-s, Indrasena expounded to his wife the rahasya-s of the
Vāyavīyaṃ Kaubera-vratam: “Dear Gautamī, first you must know why it is
called the Vāyavīyaṃ Kaubera-vratam and why the ekādaśī is considered
the day of the yakṣa lord. In this regard the following has been
narrated by the brāhmaṇa Mahātapās to king Prajāpāla in the
Varāhapurāṇa:

mahātapā uvāca:  
śṛṇu cānyāṃ vasupater utpattiṃ pāpanāśinīm|

ya etāṃ śṛṇuyād bhaktyā puruṣaḥ paṭhate ‘pi vā |  
sarva-kāmān avāpnoti svarga-lokañ ca gacchati ||

The sage Mahātapas narrated this legend to king Prajāpāla:  
Now, listen to that other sin-destroying tale of the origin of the lord
of wealth, regarding how the wealth-giver arose from the body of the god
Vāyu. Within what was the primordial body, Vāyu came into being situated
in its interior. For the purpose of assuming a discrete form the deity
of the regions \[Vāyu\] emerged forth. Now, the origin of that form of
Vāyu will be made known by me. O sinless and most fortunate you ought
listen that narrated by me. Due to the god Brahmā’s creative desire Vāyu
issued forth from his face. \[He emerged\] with a tremendous shower of
grit/gravel. Brahmā restrained him by saying: “You should take on a
pacific discrete form.” He took the form as stated by Brahmā. \[Brahmā
said\]: “all this wealth of the gods, whatever they produce, you must
indeed protect it”. Thus, due to what was said by Brahmā he became
Dhanapati. The pleased lord Brahmā gave the ekādaśī \[as his\] lunar
day. On that day, if one with discipline purifies himself and only eats
food which is not cooked by fire, then the god Dhanada is pleased and
gives him everything. This form of Dhanapati destroys all that is ill.
If one verily listens to this narrative with devotion or the person
recites it, then he attains all desires and goes to the heavenly realm.

Now, Vrishchika tell me what you think of this narrative?”

V: “I believe it had its roots in the ancient Indo-Iranian system of the
supreme Vāyu, with a Prājāpatya overlay atop that. Indeed Kubera and
Vāyu simultaneously figure as mighty deities in the backdrop of the
Rāmāyaṇa and to some extent also in the Mahābhārata. Hence, their
connection does not seem unexpected. Moreover, along with the other
deity of the same class, Rudra, the three of them adorn the northern
face of the dik-maṇḍala — NE-N-NW. The primordial body referred to in
this narrative is verily the puruṣa of the śruti. There indeed it has
been said ‘prāṇād vāyur ajāyata |‘ and Vāyu was seen as the breath
within the puruṣa. In this myth we see an allusion the the role of Vāyu
in the creative process. It is amply clear from the śruti that in the
old system focused on Vāyu he was conceived as playing a central role in
this process. Indeed, in the mantra to Vāyu-Vāta we hear:  
‘ātmā devānām bhuvanasya garbho  
yathā-vaśaṃ carati deva eṣaḥ |  
ghoṣā id asya śṛṇvire na rūpaṃ  
tasmai vātāya haviṣā vidhema ||’  
The breath of the gods, the germ of the universe,  
this god wanders as he wishes.  
Only his sounds are heard, not \[seen is\] his form.  
For him, for Vāta, we would do honor with our oblation.

We see here that the deity is presented as the germ of the universe
(reflective of the creative process) and his formlessness which is
alluded to in the myth you narrated is also a central element of this
mantra. Tellingly, the very first mantra of the sūkta captures aspects
of his storminess mentioned in this myth as he emerged from the face of
Brahmā with a shower of grit.:  
‘vātasya nu mahimānaṃ rathasya  
rujann eti stanayann asya ghoṣaḥ |  
divispṛg yāty aruṇāni kṛṇvann  
uto eti pṛthivyā reṇum asyan ||’  
Now for the greatness of Vāta and his chariot:  
smashing he proceeds; thundering is his noise.  
Touching heaven as he drives, making things red,  
also blowing up dust from the earth he goes.

Thus, I would conclude that at the foundation of the Varāha-purāṇa
narrative are clear motifs coming from the old Vāyu-centric system such
as those expressed in the sūkta I just mentioned.”

I.s: “That is good, Vrishichika. It touches on something which will come
up again as I expound the ritual itself. One may also note the this idea
of the Vāyu within the primordial body might have been behind another
somewhat mysterious name of the god — Mātariśvan — he who grows within
the mother or womb. Thus, it is likely that what was meant in this name
was Vāyu filling up the interior of the ‘primordial womb’. His emergence
from the mouth of the protogonic deity is something that evidently had a
deep history: While in the Puruṣa-sūkta it is Indra and Agni who emerge
from the Puruṣa’s mouth, we have a bauddha text the
Avalokiteśvara-guṇa-karaṇḍavyūha where the nāstika-s have
appropriated the mythologem of the puruṣa for their invention, the
Avalokiteśvara. In that text we hear of the various gods emerging from
the different organs of the macranthropic Avalokiteśvara and Vāyu is
specifically mentioned as emerging from his mouth. This suggests the
existence of an old āstika source with such an imagery from which this
concept was borrowed by the bauddhas.

Now further, while in the Varāha-purāṇa myth the motifs acquired from
the Vāyu-focused system may have been placed in a Prājāpatya context
typical of the earlier paurāṇika narratives, we must not miss the fact
that right from the beginning Vāyu had an intimate connection with the
protogonic deity with roots likely going back to the para-Vedic systems
of the Indo-Iranian period with evolutes lasting until much latter on
both the Indian and Iranian sides. This is already apparent in the
prājāpatya portions of the late śruti. In the Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa we
hear: ‘sa eṣa vāyuḥ prajapatiḥ |‘ (This Vāyu is Prajāpati). It is
further expounded in the Kauśītaki-brāhmaṇa that the manifest form of
Prajāpati is Vāyu: ‘prajāpateḥ pratyaksaṃ rupaṃ yad vāyur iti|‘. The
Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa goes on to even present Prajāpati as a composite of
himself and Vāyu: ‘ardhaṃ ha prajāpater vayuḥ | ardham prajapatiḥ |
Regarding this intimate connection between the two deities, I could
point to a rather late survival of this idea in the Garuḍa-purāṇa
(mokṣa-kāṇḍa) in a rather pristine form albeit lodged within a larger,
quite unwholesome Vaiṣṇava section, which tries to establish the
superiority of Viṣṇu over the other gods:  
‘annābhimānaṃ brahma cāhur murāriṃ  
jīvābhimānaṃ vāyum āhur mahāntaḥ |  
na śakto ‘sau brahma-devo vivastuṃ  
vāyuṃ vinā saṃsṛtāv eva nityam ||  
na taṃ vinā mātariśvā ca vastum  
anyonyam āptiḥ kālato nyūnatā ca |  
yadā mahat-tattvani yāmako bhūd  
brahmāṇḍānta-sthūla-sṛṣṭau mahātmā ||  
tadā vāyur nāśakadvai mahātmā  
bāhye sṛṣṭau kālabhedena cāsti |’  
The great sages have declared that Brahmā and Murāri (Viṣṇu) are the
nutritive principle, \[whereas\] Vāyu is the metabolic principle.
Verily, this god Brahma does not have ever the ability to emit the
universe without Vāyu. Without him (Brahmā) Mātariśvan (Vāyu) does not
have place to dwell. (O great soul), their relative strengths and wants
depends on the course of time. When \[Brahmā\] restrained of the
principles \[evolving from\] mahat in the \[primordial\] world-egg from
manifesting as material creation Vāyu could not set it motion. The
evolution of the manifest universe \[by Vāyu\] happens only with passage
of time.

Thus, Alini, in this system Vāyu and Brahmā are close and almost equal
partners in the manifestation of the material universe. Indeed, it
appears that these ideas were preserved by a group of late-surviving
Vāyu-focused thinkers who later converted to the Vaiṣṇava-mata in
southern India. This becomes apparent from a discussion occurring
earlier in this section of the Garuḍa-purāṇa wherein the votaries are
asked to set up an image of Vāyu and worship it. However, it is then
clarified that Vāyu is merely a symbol of Viṣṇu and that Vāyu should
only be offered the ucchiṣṭa of Viṣṇu. Notably, it warns votaries who
offer fresh flowers, sandalwood and incense to Vāyu and says that they
would eternally suffer unless they meditate on Viṣṇu as an expiation.
The last statement clinches their Vāyu-focality prior to their
conversion. Their unconverted versions still exist, albeit in a
degenerate form, in the Lāṭa country — a point we will revisit in the
context of the paramparā of our ritual.”

V: “Ah\! Having sat in on a discussion Lootika and Somakhya once had, I
do see the parallels to the comparable Iranic systems. In the
Zoroastrian stream of the Iranic tradition, despite all the demonization
of the ancestral deva-s, Vāyu still retains his primacy. In the yasht of
Rama Hvastra even Ahura Mazdāh worships Vāyu to aid him in creation by
countering Angra Mainyu. In the para-Zoroastrian system of Zurvān
(Avestan: Zrva, cognate of Sanskrit sarva) he comes as an integral
partner of the great time deity Zurvān who has a fundamentally
protogonic character. Thus, Zurvān, associated with time and Vāyu
associated with space are the heart of the genesis of this Iranic
system. The integral association of Zurvān and Vāyu is already seen in
the Zoroastrian Avesta where they are invoked together and are supplied
with the epithet ‘deregho khvadhāta (dīrgha-svadhātṛ in our tongue)’.
i.e. those who have long-standing law of their own. That Zurvān was an
old deity with his own system is seen from the occurrence of his name
close to the Avestan form in the Nuzi documents from Iraq dating to
around 3200-3400 years ago where we find some of the earliest
attestations of the Iranians in archaeology. This association is also
recorded by Eudemus of Rhodes, the student of Aristotle, who notes that
the Iranians regard Time (Zurvān) and Space (Vāyu) as the foundational
principles of the universe. That he was referring to the
para-Zoroastrian Zurvān worshipers becomes apparent from a comparable
system presented in Zurvānistic Iranic traditions preserved by the
Zoroastrians in their Denkart, where Zurvan as time is the generative
principle and Vāyu provides the space for the entities that come into
being due to Zurvan. There, Vāyu is also the one who conveys the good
things bestowed by Zurvān to men — this perhaps captures a bit of his
nature as the messenger, which we see in his Mātariśvan form in our
tradition. Thus, his association with the Iranic protogonic deities, be
he Ahura Mazdāh or Zrva, in the generative process is indeed a parallel
to his association with Brahmā in our tradition.”

I.s: “As we move from Vāyu, who was specifically hymned by your ancestor
Vāmadeva, to Kubera, we again find these parallels between Indo-Aryan
and Iranian tradition as illuminating their association. Clearly in our
tradition Vāyu-Vāta has both a benign and malignant nature. In the
mantra you mentioned he is described as \`’rujan’ i.e. smashing. This
nature is clearly brought out in his earthly epic manifestations, the
ape Hanūmat and the Pāṇḍava Bhīma. On the other hand, as you correctly
mentioned, in the Iranic tradition Vāyu conveys the good things of
Zurvan to men. This is his benign aspect which comes up in the second
such Vāta-sūkta in the RV:  
vāta ā vātu bheṣajaṃ śambhu mayobhu no hṛde |  
pra ṇa āyūṃṣi tāriṣat ||  
uta vāta pitāsi na uta bhrātota naḥ sakhā |  
sa no jīvātave kṛdhi ||  
yad ado vāta te gṛhe ‘mṛtasya nidhir hitaḥ |  
tato no dehi jīvase ||’  
May Vāta blow towards us a medicine, which is auspicious and conferring
weal to our heart. May he lengthen our lives.  
O Vāta, you are father to us, and brother, and also a friend to us. Make
us live long.  
O Vāta, what wealth of ambrosia has been placed yonder in your house,
give us of that for us to live.  
Here, we see that the benign aspect of Vāyu is emphasized with him being
a bearer of medicines (note a similar role played by Hanūmat in the
Rāmāyaṇa), fellowship and the ambrosia. Importantly, note the amṛtasya
nidhiḥ, which becomes important for the connection with the Mahārāja. On
the Iranian side Vāyu again is invoked for benign gifts such as
protection from yātudhāna-s, a long life, offspring, and by women for a
good husband. On the other-hand, he is also the fierce ‘pitiless Vāyu’,
the bone-breaker (Astovidhātu) who slays the man (the bone-crushing
facet is well represented in the earthly emanations of our Vāyu, Hanūmat
and Bhīma, who more generally also have a certain malignant side to
them, which, O Gautami, your ancestors are said to have faced in the
case of the former). Thus, in later Iranic tradition we hear of two
Vāyu-s, the Vāy i veh the good Vāyu and the Vāy i vattar, the evil
Vāyu, who in the Iranic text known as the greater Bundahishn is
explicitly termed Astovidhātu who causes death.

Thus, even in our origin myth of Kubera, the two facets of Vāyu are
clearly laid out. He originally emerges in what is evidently his malefic
form showering gravel/grit and then assumes a benefic form which becomes
Kubera. Notably, Kubera, like Vāyu in the RV mantra, also holds the
nidhi of amṛta, which is described as the honey of Jambhala, known to
the V1s who have mastered the Kaubera lore, in the Mahābhārata.”

V: “Dear Ātreya, may be in the regard I should add that this benign form
of Vāyu, which becomes Vaiśravaṇa might relate to the magical
concealment power of the yakṣa-s, tirodhā that is alluded to multiple
times in the śruti. On one hand it connects Kubera with the primordial
goddess Virāj. The Puruṣa hymn, echoing the cyclic generation of the
primordial god Dākṣa and goddess Aditi from each other, states that the
goddess Virāj arose from the Puruṣa and that conversely the Puruṣa arose
from Virāj. The Atharvāṅgirasa-śruti adds that Kubera was a calf of this
goddess Virāj in the form of Tirodhā which conferred the concealment
(tirodhā) capacity on his folk (i.e. the yakṣa-s). This is again
mentioned and worshipped in his ritual in the Taittirīya-śruti. In the
AV it is said that he who knows this thing about Kubera causes his
pāpaman to vanish, whereas in the TA it makes his enemies disappear,
like the prācya Uesugi Kenshin experienced with his devotions. This
again reflects the beneficent nature of this deity whose origin is from
the primordial being. Perhaps the tirodhā power, which the
Taittirīyaka-s describe as coming from the waters represents, the
benefic clouds brought by Vāyu as opposed to the destructive sand storm.

Finally, before we go to the ritual, O Atri, I would like to to ask you
if you can think of any parallels to the connection between Vāyu and
Vaiśravaṇa which might exist in the Iranian world?”

I.s.: “Firstly, O Āṅgirasī, it is pleasing to see that you have
thoroughly acquired the śrauta-siddhānta of Puṇyajaneśa. Regarding your
question — I am aware of no direct cognate of Kubera in the early Iranic
world. However, we may note the following: interestingly, even in the
Avesta the benign Vāyu is described as being associated with gold, a
characteristic of the Yakṣarāṭ. Subsequently, among the non-Zoroastrian
and para-Zoroastrian Iranics of the Kuṣāṇa empire it appears that the
personification of royal power, Avestan Khvarena (Kuṣāṇa: Pharro), came
to identified with Vaiśravaṇa. This is not surprising given both their
association with royal power. This led to syncretic depictions in the
Kuṣaṇa age that appear to have eventually reached the eastern steppes
whose new masters were the Turkic and Mongolic people. This greatly
influenced the development of the Kubera-like deity Kut-Tengri among the
Uighurs and other central Asian Turks.”

V: “Now, O Atricandra, expound to me details of the ritual — the
observances, actions and the mantra-s.”  
I.s: “Sure. The vrata, as has been specified, should be done on an
ekādaśī, either in the afternoon or in the evening. After having had a
bath the ritualists should observe purity and abstain from sexual
activity for the entire day. They should eat air-dried fruits and nuts.
They should abstain from consuming milk products but they may drink
fresh fruit juices. In old Bhārata the ideal spot for the ritual was
said to be under an aśvattha or a vaṭa tree but these days such spots
are difficult to come by.

First the ritualists should offer tarpaṇa to the key teachers of the
lineage: the founder was a sage of the Vaikhānasa clan. That knowledge
then passed on to the queen Vāsavadattā. Her son the renowned
Naravāhanadatta was next. His minister Gomukha was next. These were the
teachers of the lore at Kauśāmbī. Then the lore was taught at the holy
city of Mathurā, where all the great dharma-s were expounded by the
mantra-vit-s. As you know both Somakhya and I trace our lineages to
gharāṃnāya-s of that holy city. There it was taught in the center known
as the Yakṣa-guhā, which is today Maholi near the Mathurā city. Here the
teachers were Gomitraka and Kunika. From there the tradition moved to
Gopagiri (modern Gwalior), where it was taught by your old clansmen, the
Gotama Rudradāsa and his son Śivatrāta. From them it was transmitted to
Śivanemi, Śivabhadra and Kubhaka.” From there it was transmitted along
the Candravati river (modern West Banas) to the V1 Maṇibhadra who lived
in Vāyvagrahāra (a little hamlet near modern Banaskantha) in the
Lāṭānarta country. He transmitted it to his students Kuberadatta and
Yakṣamitra who lived at Vāyuvaṭa (modern Vayad). All these V1s were
special worshipers of Vāyu at his prāsāda-s that were once prominent in
the region and the rite we perform takes its form in their teachings.  
V: “It is indeed rather remarkable that even today we have nearly
forgotten remnants of the old cult at these key cultic centers, like the
Vāyu temples in Lāṭa and the Vitteśa near a step-well in their vicinity,
or the images of Nalakūbara at Gopagiri and the fragment of the old
Yakṣarāṭ-prāsāda at Kauśāmbī.”

I.s: “If the Yakṣa is good to us, may be some day we shall visit those
cultic centers to revive our connection. To continue, the ritualist then
salutes his teachers: ‘oṃ gurubhyo namaḥ |‘. The spot of the rite should
be to the north of the trunk of the said tree for indeed the northern
line is where Vāyu, Vitteśa and Bhava, all deities of the rite, are
stationed. The ritualist begins by uttering the yajuṣ:  
iṣé tvorjé tvā vāyávaḥ sthopāyávaḥ stha devó vaḥ savitā́ prā́rpayatu
śréṣṭhatamāya kármaṇe |  
For vigor you; for nourishment you; the Vāyu-s abide, the approachers
abide. Let the god Savitṛ set you in motion for the most excellent
ritual.

Vrishchika, here you may note the multiplicity of the Vāyu-s reminiscent
of the Aeolian plurality seen among our yavana cousins. Then he stands
up and recites the following ṛk-s:  
stóma-trayastriṁśe bhúvanasya patni vívasvad vāte abhí no gṛṇāhi |  
ghṛtávatī savitar ā́dhipatyaiḥ páyasvatī rántir ā́śā no astu ||  
dhruvā́ diśā́ṃ viṣṇupatny ághorāsyéśānā sáhaso yā́ manótā |  
bṛhaspátir mātaríśvotá vāyúḥ saṃdhuvānā́ vā́tā abhí no gṛṇantu ||  
viṣṭambhó divó dharúṇaḥ pṛthivyā́ asyéśānā jágato víṣṇupatnī |  
viśvávyacā iṣáyantī súbhūtiḥ śivā́ no astv áditir upásthe ||  
O you of the 33-fold stoma, lady of the world, with winds set in motion
by Vivāsvān, may you be gracious to us.  
Rich in ghee, O Savitṛ, through your overlordship, may the generous
space be rich in milk for us.  
Firm among the quarters, wife of Viṣṇu, the benign \[lady\], the strong
queen of all, the desirable one;  
Bṛhaspati, Matariśvan, Vāyu, the Vāta-s blowing in unison, may all be
gracious to us.  
Stabilizer of the sky, supporter of the earth, ruling this world, wife
of Viṣṇu.  
Encompassing all space, invigorating all, prosperous, may the goddess
Aditi be auspicious to us in her lap.

He then marks out a square area on the ground with the side equal to his
full arm’s length and sweeps it clean. Within it he marks out another
square region with a side equal to his span. He does this with the sphya
(the wooden sword) while chanting the formula:  
ástabhnād dyā́m ṛṣabhó antárikṣam ámimīta varimā́ṇam pṛthivyā́ ā́sīdad
viśvā bhúvanāni samrā́ḍ víśvet tā́ni váruṇasya vratā́ni ||  
The bull has stabilized the sky \[and\] the atmosphere; he has measured
the circumference of the earth; he has set him in all worlds as the
emperor. All these are Varuṇa’s laws.

He then digs out a cuboidal excavation corresponding to the central
smaller square. While doing so he recites the yajuṣ:  
víṣṇoḥ krámo ‘si víṣṇoḥ krāntám asi víṣṇor víkrāntam asi | námo mātré
pṛthivyái mā́hán mātáram pṛthivī́m̐ him̐siṣam mā́ | mā́ṃ mātā́
pṛthivī́ him̐sīt ||  
You are the stepping of Viṣṇu; you are the step of Viṣṇu; you are the
stride of Viṣṇu. Salutation to mother Earth; may I not harm mother
Earth; may mother Earth not harm me.

The he fills the sruc with ghee using the the sruva and pours out the
ghee into excavation uttering the yajuṣ:  
vāyáve tvā váruṇāya tvā nírṛtyai tvā rudrā́ya tvā svāhā | vā́yo vī́hi
stokā́nām ||  
For you Vāyu; for you Varuṇa; for you Nirṛti; for you Rudra, hail\! O
Vāyu, taste the drops\!

He then fills the sruc again with milk pours it into the excavation
uttering the incantation:  
vásur vásupatir híkam ási| kṣatrā́ṇāṃ kṣatrápatir asi | áti divás pāhi |
vaiśravaṇāya svāhā||  
You are indeed rich, the lord of riches. You are the the king of the
kings. From the heavenly realm protect us. To Vaiśravaṇa hail.”

Indrasena then brought out a bronze image of a chameleon and showed it
to Vrishchika and explained further: “The ritualist should have such a
bronze image of a chameleon, which as you know is the special animal of
the Yakṣapati. Alternatively, he may have a metal plate with the image
of a chameleon etched on it. He deposits it in the excavation for the
rite and may reuse it over and over, each time he performs the rite. He
takes up the image reciting the following incantation:  
iyaṃ varṇagodhā vaiśravaṇa-rūpā bahuvarṇikā | tirodhā ‘si |
hiraṇyavaktro ‘si vaiśravaṇo ‘si | kṣatraṃ kṣatraṃ vaiśravaṇaḥ |
mahārājāya svāhā ||  
This chameleon of many colors is the form of Vaiśravaṇa. You are the
camouflaged one. You are the golden-cheeked one; you are Vaiśravaṇa.
Kingly power, kingly power \[is that of\] Vaiśravaṇa. Hail to the great
king\!

He then deposits the chameleon in the excavation and with the last
mantra of the above he pours out ghee from the sruva on to image. He
then covers up the image by filling the excavation. To the north of the
square he sets up a platform with a silk cloth on it. On that he should
place an ornate bronze jar with a lid. He should thereafter invoke Vāyu
and his wife Śivā in the jar and offers them water for arghya and pādya
and incense with the following incantation of Mārkaṇḍeya:  
vāyum āvāhayiṣyāmi sarvagaṃ dīptatejasam |  
deva vāyo tvam abhy ehi sarva-bhūta-jagat-priya |  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ||  
I shall invoke Vāyu of blazing splendor, who can go anywhere. O Vāyu,
dear to all beings and the world, you must come here. Please accept this
arghya, pādya (water for washing the feet) and incense.

śivām āvāhayiṣyāmi vāyoḥ patnīṃ prabhāvatīm |  
śive ‘bhy ehi mahābhāge varade kāmarūpiṇī |  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ||  
I shall invoke Śivā of great luster, the lady of Vāyu. O highly
distinguished goddess Śivā, who can assume any form, the boon-giver,
come here. Please accept…

He then places an image of Kubera inside the jar. The image should
ideally be fashioned generally following the teaching in this regard of
the Bhārgava Mārkaṇḍeya to Vajra, the great-grandson of Kṛṣṇa, the king
of Indraprastha: The image of the wealth-giver Kubera should be painted
dark green, i.e., the color of a lotus-leaf. He should be shown as being
borne by a naras yakṣa. He should have all kinds of golden ornaments
with necklaces resting on his belly. He should be shown wearing a
beautiful cloak. He should have four hands and one of his eyes should be
yellow. He must have two fangs in his mouth, and a mustache and beard on
his face. His head is adorned with a jeweled crown. On his left lap, his
wife, the beautiful, boon-giving goddess Ṛddhi should be comfortably
seated. She should be shown with two hands. One of them should be shown
hugging the Mahārāja and the other should display a jewel-pot. In one of
his left hands he should be shown holding a jeweled vessel and a
gold-spitting mongoose in the other. In his two right hands Kubera
should be shown with a mace and a śakti missile. Beside him there should
be his dhvaja with the lion-emblem. A palanquin should be shown near his
feet and his treasure-chests should be shown beside him in the form of a
conch and a lotus filled with treasures.

If he cannot obtain such an image, any other image that is properly made
might be used. However, he must use the above teaching of Mārkaṇḍeya for
the dhyāna of the great Yakṣa because if he does so he obtains wealth.
Mārkaṇḍeya gives the following symbolism for the image: The lord should
be seen as the embodiment of all arthaśāstra-s. It is only by the
institutes of arthaśāstra-s does any endeavor of a living-being exist,
as was taught by Cāṇakya who devised the overthrow of the barbarous
Macedonians. Kubera’s śakti weapon stands for royal power and his gadā
represents daṇḍa-nīti. Goddess Ṛddhi represents a full worldly life. The
jeweled vessel in her hand is the receptacle of good qualities. The
kingdom over which the Yakṣapati rules is the body itself. The lotus and
the conch are the reservoirs of all treasures in nature from which
wealth perpetually flows. His lion flag is desire. Hence, he is known as
Kāmeśvara in the Yajurveda. His two fangs are the reward and the
punishment that he metes out. He who mediates thus has Kubera dwell in
him.

Having placed the image of the Rājarāja in the jar he invokes him and
his retinue and offers them worship with the following incantations:  
yākṣān āvāhayiṣyāmi dhānādhyakṣa-samanvitān |  
āyāntu varadā yakṣās trailokya-viditā mama |  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ||  
I shall invoke the yakṣa-s together with the lord of wealth. Let the
yakṣa-s renowned in the 3 worlds come to me giving boons. Please
accept this arghya, pādya (water for washing the feet) and incense.

bhadrām āvāhayiṣyāmi dhanādhipati-sundarīṃ |  
ehi ṛddhi mahādevi varade kāma-rūpiṇī |  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ||  
I shall invoke the lucky one, the beautiful lady of the lord of wealth.
Come, O great boon-giving goddess Ṛddhi of much desired form. Please
accept…

aham āvāhayiṣyāmi tvām eva nalakūbaram |  
samabhy ehi mahābhāga dhanadasya+ātmasaṃbhava |  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ||  
I shall verily invoke you O Nalakūbara. May you, O fortunate one born of
Dhanada, come here. Please accept…

aham āvāhayiṣyāmi śibikāṃ paramāyatām |  
śibike tvam ihā ‘bhy ehi sarva-sattva-sukhaṅkari |  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ||  
I shall invoke the wide palanquin of Kubera. O palanquin who generates
all good and pleasures may you come here. Please accept…

naram āvāhayiṣyāmi narādhipati-vāhanam |  
nara śīghraṃ tvam ‘bhy ehi tathā nṛpatināyaka |  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ||  
I shall invoke the Naras yakṣa who is the vehicle of the king
\[Kubera\]. O Naras may you quickly come here, you have the king as your
lord \[Kubera\]. Please accept…

śaṅkham āvāhayiṣyāmi nidhi-pravaram uttamam |  
śīghraṃ śaṅkha tvam abhy ehi dhānādhipati-vallabha |  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ||  
I shall invoke the conch, the foremost of excellent treasures. May you,
O conch, quickly come here, the one dear to the lord of wealth. Please
accept…

padmam āvāhayiṣyāmi nidhi-pravaram uttamam |  
padmaṃ śīghraṃ tvam abhy ehi mahāvibhava-kāraka |  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ||  
I shall invoke the lotus, the foremost of excellent treasures. May you,
O lotus, quickly come here producing great prosperity. Please accept…

Then he offers flowers, honey and bhakṣaṇa-s to the image of Kubera with
the famous incantation from the Taittirīya-āraṇyaka:  
rājādhirājāya prasahyasāhine | namo vayam vaiśravaṇāya kurmahe | sa me
kāmān kāmakāmāya mahyam | kāmeśvaro vaiśravaṇo dadātu |  
kuberāya vaiśravaṇāya | mahārājāya namaḥ ||

He should thereafter make the triple-arghya offerings as ordained by the
gāyatrī-s of Vaikhānasa-s:  
rāja-rājāya vidmahe dhanādhyakṣāya dhīmahi | tan no rājā pracodayāt ||  
rudra-sakhāya vidmahe vaiśravaṇāya dhīmahi | tan naḥ kuberaḥ pracodayāt
||  
yakṣeśvarāya vidmahe gadā-hastāya dhīmahi | tan no yakṣaḥ pracodayāt ||

Then he offers bali to Dhaneśa and Nalakūbara meditating upon them
traversing the heavens in the Puṣpaka space-station made by the god
Tvaṣtṛ which is alluded to in the mantra. This is as per the
Aruṇa-ketuka-vidhi with the incantations:  
adbhayas tirodhā’jāyata | tava vaiśravaṇas sadā | tirodhehi sapatnān naḥ
| ye apo ‘śnanti kecana | tvāṣṭrīṃ māyāṃ vaiśravaṇaḥ | ratham̐
sahasra-vandhuram | puruś-cakram̐ sahasrāśvam | āsthāyāyāhi no balim |
yasmai bhūtāni balim āvahanti | dhanañ-gāvo-hasti-hiraṇyam-aśvān | asāma
sumatau yajniyasya | śriyam bibhrato ‘nnamukhīṃ virājam | sudarśane ca
krauñce ca | maināge ca mahāgirau | śata-dvāṭṭāragamantā | sam̐hāryan
nagaraṃ tava | iti mantrāḥ | kalpo’ta ūrdhvam | yadi balim̐ haret |
hiraṇyanābhaye vitudaye kauberāyāyam baliḥ | sarvabhūtadhipataye nama
iti | atha balim̐ hṛtvopatiṣṭheta | kṣatraṃ kṣatraṃ vaiśravaṇaḥ |
brāhmaṇā vayam̐ smaḥ | namaste astu mā mā him̐sīḥ ||

After that he makes bali offerings to the rakṣa-s, yakṣa-s and yakṣī-s
in the entourage of Kubera with:  
miśra-vāsasaḥ kauberakā rakṣo-rājena preṣitāḥ |  
grāmam̐ sa-jānayo gacchantīchanto paridākṛtān ||  
Wearing mixed clothes the agents of Kubera, directed by the king of the
rakṣa-s together with the \[yakṣī\] consorts go as they please to the
villages granting protection.

There after he sets up a sthaṇḍila in the square he has marked out. He
strews darbha grass with the shoots facing north. He installs the fire
therein from his aupāsana or āhavanīya altar or kindles it afresh. He
recites this ṛk:  
vaiśvānaraṃ kavayo yajñiyāso ‘gniṃ devā ajanayann ajuryam |  
nakṣatram pratnam aminac cariṣṇu yakṣasyādhyakṣaṃ taviṣam bṛhantam ||  
The gods, the poets of the ritual, generated the unaging Agni
Vaiśvānara,  
the primordial star, wandering but not violating \[the natural law\],
the mighty and great lord of the yakṣa.

He makes an oblation of ghee with: agnaye vaiśvānarāya svāhā | idam
agnaye vaiśvānarāya na mama |

If he is a purohita performing it on behalf of a yajamāna other than
himself, like at the temple it would be done with the V3, then the
yajamāna must recite the tyāga-mantra ‘idam…na mama‘ as the oblation is
offered. Then he recites:  
dhātā́ rātíḥ savitédáṃ juṣantām prajā́patir nidhipátir no agníḥ |  
tváṣṭā víṣṇuḥ prajáyā saṁrarāṇó yájamānāya dráviṇaṃ dadhātu ||  
May Dhatṛ the giver, may Savitṛ, rejoice in this \[oblation\],
Prajāpati, the lord of treasures, and Agni, for us; may Tvaṣtṛ and
Viṣṇu generously give wealth with offspring to the ritualist.

He makes an oblation of ghee with: devebhyaḥ svāhā | idam devebhyo na
mama |

He then prepares for the core oblations of the yajña by deploying the
nigada recitation as in the vaidika rite calling upon the god Agni who
is of the brāhmaṇa-s and the Bhārata-s to bring the gods of the rite for
receiving the oblations:  
oṃ agne mahām̐ asi brāhmaṇa bhārata | deveddho manviddha ghṛtāhavanaḥ
praṇīr yajñānāṃ rathīr adhvarāṇām atūrto hotā tūrṇir havyavāṭ | tvaṃ
paribhūr asy ā vaha devān yajamānāya || vāyuṃ niyutvantam ā vaha |
kuberaṃ vaiśravaṇam ā vaha | rudram paśupatim ā vaha | devām̐ ājyapām̐ ā
vaha ||

He then offers in the northern side of the sthaṇḍila with the sruva:  
prajāpatye svāhā | idam prajāpatye na mama ||

He utters the call ‘astu śrau3ṣaṭ |‘ and starts filling he sruc and as
he does so he recites:  
tava vāyav ṛtaspate tvaṣṭur jāmātar adbhuta |  
avāṃsy ā vṛṇīmaho3m ||  
Vāyu, lord of the natural law, of wondrous form, Tvaṣṭṛ’s son-in-law,
your protection we choose.

Then he recites:  
pra vāyum acchā bṛhatī manīṣā  
bṛhadrayiṃ viśvavāraṃ rathaprām |  
dyutadyāmā niyutaḥ patyamānaḥ  
kaviḥ kavim iyakṣasi prayajyo3m ||  
vau3ṣaṭ | idaṃ vāyave niyutvate na mama ||  
\[Our\] great meditation (goes) forth to Vāyu; with great wealth and all
that is excellent, he fills his chariot; on the brilliant path, master
of horse-teams, you the poet seeks to reach the poet \[i.e. the
hymn-composing vipra\], you who are worshiped at the forefront of the
ritual.

At the vauṣaṭ call he makes the oblation and then utters the
tyāga-mantra. He makes the oblation facing whichever direction the wind
blows at the time he is reciting the this mantra. He utters the call
‘astu śrau3ṣaṭ |‘ and starts filling he sruc and as he does so he
recites:  
rāyas poṣāyāyuṣā tvā nidhīśo bhrātṛvyāṇāṃ mahasāṃ cādhipatyo3m |  
\[I invoke you\] for riches and prosperity with a long life. The lord of
wealth \[is worshiped\] for taking over the glory of our rivals and for
overlordship.

This peculiarly-formed mantra is that of the old Jambhala-vit
Vaikhānasa, the master of divine rituals. Then he recites:  
dūre pūrṇena vasati dūra ūnena hīyate |  
mahad yakṣaṃ bhuvanasya madhye  
tasmai baliṃ rāṣṭrabhṛto bharanto3m ||  
vau3ṣaṭ | idaṃ kuberāya vaiśravaṇāya na mama ||  
In fullness he dwells in the distance, is left behind in distance on
diminishing;  
A mighty Yakṣa is in the center of the universe:  
to him the tributary rulers bring tribute.

At the vauṣaṭ call he makes the oblation and then utters the
tyāga-mantra. I should mention that this is the mysterious mantra is of
the Bhṛgu-s by knowing which one becomes the complete Jambhala-vit. It
was taught to me by Somakhya on a dark new moon night as we were
wandering in a beautiful mountainous region. This completed my learning
of the tradition and conferred on me the ability to perform this ritual.
The thing which dwells in distance in full and then diminishes is an
allusion to the moon. This disappearance of the moon is in turn
indicative of tirodhā, the famed concealing power of the Yakṣa. He then
utters the call ‘astu śrau3ṣaṭ |‘, starts filling he sruc and as he does
so he recites:  
kad rudrāya pracetase mīḷhuṣṭamāya tavyase |  
vocema śantamaṃ hṛdo3m ||  
What might we say to Rudra, the wise, the most generous and mighty one;
what might we say that is most pleasing to his heart?

upa te stomān paśupā ivākaraṃ  
rāsvā pitar marutāṃ sumnam asme |  
bhadrā hi te sumatir mṛḷayattamā  
‘thā vayam ava it te vṛṇīmaho3m ||  
vau3ṣaṭ | idaṃ rudrāya paśupataye na mama ||  
Like a cowherd, I have driven these praises close to you.  
Grant your favor to us, father of the Marut-s,  
for your benevolence is auspicious, most merciful.  
It is indeed your aid that we choose. \[translation after Geldner\]

At the vauṣaṭ call he makes the oblation, then utters the tyāga-mantra
and then touches water.

Then with the sruva he utters the following mantra-s and makes an
offering of ghee at each svāhā followed by the tyāga-mantra ‘idaṃ na
mama‘:  
indraḥ svāhā | marutaḥ svāhā | sarva-nidhido ratna-dhātumān svāhā |
tirodhā bhūḥ svāhā | tirodhā bhuvaḥ svāhā | tirodhā svaḥ svāhā | tirodhā
bhūr-bhuvaḥ-svaḥ svāhā | kāmeśvarāya svāhā | kuberāya svāhā | dhanyāya
svāhā | vaiśravaṇāya svāhā | yakṣa-rājāya svāhā ||

He then initiates the expiatory sviṣṭakṛt-yāga by reciting the mantra of
my ancestor Vasuśruta Ātreya:  
oṃ juṣṭo damūnā atithir duroṇa  
imaṃ no yajñam upa yāhi vidvān |  
viśvā agne abhiyujo vihatyā  
śatrūyatām ā bharā bhojanāno3m ||  
As the satisfied lord of the house and the guest in the home,  
journey to this our yajña, the learned god,  
Having demolished all assaults, O Agni,  
bring here the sustenance of our enemies.

He utters the call ‘astu śrau3ṣaṭ |‘ and fills the sruc. He then
recites:  
agniṃ sviṣṭakṛtam ayāḍ vāyor niyutvataḥ priyā dhāmāny ayāṭ kuberasya
vaiśravaṇasya priyā dhāmāny ayāḍ rudrasya paśupateḥ priyā dhāmāny ayāḍ
devānām ājyapānāṃ priyā dhāmāni yakṣad agner hotuḥ priyā dhāmāni yakṣat
svaṃ mahimānam āyajatāmejyā iṣaḥ kṛṇotu so adhvarā jātavedā juṣtām̐
havir mārjālyo mṛjyate sve damūnāḥ kavi-praśasto atithiḥ śivo naḥ |
sahasra-śṛṅgo vṛṣabhas tad ojā viśvām̐ agne sahasā prāsy anyān vau3ṣaṭ
||

At the vauṣaṭ call he makes the offering from the sruc and utters: ‘idam
agnaye sviṣṭakṛte na mama|‘ The terminal mantra of the sviṣṭakṛt-yāga is
also composed by my ancestors Budha Ātreya and Gaviṣṭhira Ātreya:  
Fit to be kindled, he is kindled in his own (house) as master of the  
house, praised by poets, our auspicious guest.  
A thousand-horned bull having its virility,  
O Agni, in might you excel all others.

Then he offers a homa to the Vināyaka-s, Skanda, and other anuyāyin-s of
Rudra which include the Yakṣapati himself so that the yajamāna-s rite
might be successful and he and his family not be harmed. He utters the
tyāga-mantra ‘idaṃ na mama‘ after each svāhā call:  
Om̐ śālakaṭaṅkaṭāya vināyakāya svāhā | kuṣmāṇḍarājaputrāya vināyakāya
svāhā | usmitāya vināyakāya svāhā | devayajanāya vināyakāya svāhā |
vimukhāya svāhā | śyenāya svāhā | bakāya svāhā | yajñāya svāhā |
kalahāya svāhā | bhīrave svāhā | yajñavikṣepiṇe svāhā | kulaṅgāpamārāya
svāhā | yūpakeśyai svāhā | sūkarakroḍyai svāhā | umāyai haimavatyai
svāhā | jambhakāya svāhā | vīrūpākṣāya svāhā | lohitākṣāya svāhā |
vaiśravaṇāya svāhā | mahārājāya svāhā | mahāsenāya svāhā | kumārāya
svāhā | viśākhāya svāhā | śākhāya svāhā | nejameṣāya svāhā | ṣaṣṭhyai
svāhā | rudrāya mahādevāya svāhā ||

He then touches water. Thereafter he takes up some grain and throws it
in the south-west direction for the rakṣa-s uttering: ‘rakṣasām bhago
‘si |‘ Then he touches water again and takes up the darbha grass and
casts it into the fire reciting:  
Om̐ sáṃ barhír aṅktām̐ havíṣā ghṛténa sám ādityáir vásubhiḥ sáṃ
marúdbhiḥ sám índro viśvádevebhir aṅktāṃ divyáṃ nábho gacchatu yát
svā́hā || idaṃ divyāya nabhase na mama | rudrāya paśupatye svāhā | idaṃ
rudrāya paśupataye na mama||  
Auspicious \[is\] the grass smeared with offerings and ghee. Let Indra
together with the Āditya-s, the Vasu-s, Marut-s, and the Viśvedeva-s go
(having been honored). Let svāhā-offerings rise to the heavenly ether.
Hail to Rudra Paśupati.

Then he recites the following to conclude the yajña with the recitation
of Agastya:  
agne naya supathā rāye asmān  
viśvāni deva vayunāni vidvān |  
yuyodhy asmaj juhurāṇam eno  
bhūyiṣṭhāṃ te nama-uktiṃ vidhema ||  
O Agni, lead us to wealth by an easy path:  
you know all the rituals, O god.  
Keep us from ritual transgression.  
May we offer you the greatest reverence.

He finally recites the śānti-mantra-s: ‘tac chamyor…‘ and ‘namo vāce yā
coditā…‘ He then goes to the jar with the image of Kubera and utters the
formulae: ‘vāyuḥ suprītaḥ suprasanno yathā sthānaṃ tiṣṭhatu | vaiśravaṇo
rājā suprītaḥ suprasanno yathā sthānaṃ tiṣṭhatu |‘ He and his family
drink some of the honey offered to the yakṣa and he distributes the
bhakṣaṇa-s to the beholders of the ritual. He gives a toothbrush,
sandals and umbrella along with a hefty ritual fee if he is a yajāmāna
who has employed a purohita to do the rite for him.”

V: “I must remark that the final homa has a set of rather remarkable
deities. Perhaps we are seeing the worship of Vārāhī for the first time
in Sūkarakroḍī. I also wonder if Yūpakeśī is some early version of
Cāmuṇḍā. Beyond that I’m most inspired by this account of the rite
and feel that I have become a Jambhala-jñā”
