After visiting the shrine of the fiery ulka, accompanied by his two
shaktI-s, we were filled with the urge to pay a visit to the shrine atop
the massif of Jejuri. It houses khaNDobA, a pastoral deity, an evolute
of the ancient
[revanta,](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/08/31/the-deva-revanta-mythology-iconography-history-and-ritualism/ "The deva revanta: Mythology, iconography, history and ritualism")
in Andhra, Karnataka and Maharashtra. A Sanskrit tale is narrated in
association with this shrine:  
\-The brAhmaNa-s inform rudra that the world was being tormented by the
demons maNi and malla.  
\-They go to rudra to ask him to save them from the demons. From his
locks he produces a fierce shakti named ghR^itamArI  
\-He himself manifests as mArtANDa bhairava. He is described as having
golden flaming robes, with teeth like flashing rubies and he was
surrounded by a troop of fierce dogs.  
\-mArtANDa bhairava appointed kumAra as the commander of his forces with
a horde of skandagraha-s mounted on peacocks.  
\-kumAra further partitioned his division under indra, agni, yama,
nirR^iti, varuNa, kubera, brahmA and viShNu. There was also a horde of
vinAyakas mounted on rodent-faced horses led by the fiery ulka.  
\-The forces of mArtANDa bhairava and those of maNi and malla fought a
fierce battle.  
\-In the final fierce battle the horse-faced maNi fought mArtANDa
bhairava riding a white horse. Finally, he was struck by an arrow of the
bhairava and thrown into a lake termed maNichal along with his horse.
mArtANDa bhairava then stamps him underfoot, when he pleased the god
with a hymn, and asks for a boon to be stationed at the door-step of his
temple. He also gives his white horse as a vAhana to the bhairava.  
\-Then malla attacked the deva army with his own personal force by
uttering so loud a roar that it caused pArvatI-s crown to fall in
kailAsha. mArtANDa bhairava dispatched ghR^itamArI to attack his
hordes.  
\-ghR^itamArI swooping down on them like a kR^ityA swallowed all of them
and ground them the dust.  
\-Then ghR^itamArI and malla fought a terrible battle. He pierced her
head with 100 arrows, her breasts with 27 arrows each and another 100 to
immobilize her shoulders and neck.  
\-Then mArtANDa bhairava entered the field riding his white horse. With
a cresent-headed arrow he cut off the demon’s bow, but the demon
retaliated by hurling his axe to cut the bow of the bhairava. The then
two joined a hand-to-hand fight with swords.  
\-Finally the bhairava struck him down and placed his foot on him.
Before he was beheaded, he asked the flaming bhairava that his head
should be placed outside the temple of the god and that he should be
given sacrifices of goats or sheep. He also asked that his name be
mentioned before that of his conqueror. mArtANDa bhairava conferred
these boons and dispatched him — he took the name mallAri to satisfy the
point of the the asura’s name coming first.

This is the canonized Sanskrit work. However, the shUdra-s of
maharAShTra and Andhra also narrate a colloquial version. Several
shUdra-s I have spoken to were well aware of the connection between
mArtANDa bhairava and khaNDobA, and also generally know the Sanskrit
version of the story. The colloquial version is usually narrated by a
pious shUdra bard called a vAghyA or in the midst of the shepherds by a
sooth-sayer termed the “devarShi”. The Andhra and marAThA version differ
in minor points, mainly place names. Some Andhras seem to have located
the tale to Mallikarjuna or shrIshailam; in the kaNNaDa country I have
noticed some say that it was malleshvaraM, now within Bangalore city.
Clearly these places were there in the marAThA mind too, because shivAjI
bhosle and his clan, great worshipers of khaNDobA, associated him with
shrIshailaM and malleshvaraM. shivAjI even wanted to renounce the world
and become a mendicant at shrIshailaM, but his men reminded him of his
great role to play for svarAjya. This grandson emperor shAhu himself,
like a vAghyA came to his court along with his dog on which he placed
the royal crown thinking of khaNDoba. But I supply below the story as
narrated in the frame of the marAThA country, for that is where I have
explored the many shrines of the deity:

The brAhmaNa-s asked shiva to help the people from the depredations of
the two demons on earth. shiva told umA that he was leaving kailasa to
deal with two asuras.  
umA:” You are always taking avatara-s leaving me alone here. I want to
come along this time.”  
shiva: “Alright, after I kill the asuras you can come along. We will
settle there and live for a while. You incarnate as mhALsA the daughter
of a tima-sheTTi, a li\~NgAyata shopkeeper. After killing the asura-s I
will come marry you and take you to my palace atop the hill of
jejuri.”  
ga\~NgA who saw all this, held in the coils of rudra’s hair said: “This
time I want to come too”.  
shiva: “OK- you take the incarnation of a shepherd girl bAnU among the
shUdra-s known as the dhangar (cattle herders). I will come to your
hamlet and bring you over to my palace.”  
umA: “Alright, but why can’t we come now? You may need us for battle.”  
ga\~NgA: “You will need us\! see when the time comes, you will need
us.”  
shiva: “OK ladies go and take your incarnations, I really need to be
doing this man’s work of fighting asura-s.”  
rudra took some haridra and sprinkled it on his snake — it became a
metal chain that he wore around his neck. In due course rudra incarnated
as mallaNNa or khaNDobA starts a war on maNi and malla. viShNu also
incarnates as IThobA or hegaDi pradhAn as bAnU’s brother.

In the fight maNi on being wounded starts spawning new maNi-s from his
blood- like raktabIja or andhaka. khaNDobA seeing the trouble sends for
the ladies mhALsA and bAnU to come an join him in the battle. mhAlsa
taking up a sword and spear rushed to the field. bAnU picked up a magic
bow and arrows and ran to the field. Behind bAnU came their dog. First
the two ladies try to drink up the blood. But seeing it to be too much
they used skulls of beheaded asuras to catch the blood. When even that
did not suffice they ran around shouting in consternation and were hit
by the arrows of the asuras. Then their dog seeing the predicament came
and lapped up all the blood. With his blood drying up maNi was losing
strength. Then IThobA also came to the field and gave khaNDobA a chakra,
with which he killed maNi.

bAnU and IThobhA killed many demons in malla’s army. Then khaNDobA
attacked malla, with mhAlsA mounting his horse and wielding a spear.
After a prolonged fight, malla finally rushed on khaNDobA and seized his
horse’s reins. But the horse reared and allowed mhALsA to spike him on
his flank, even as khaNDobA struck off his head with his sword. The day
of victory was a bright ShaShThI day in mArgashIrSha. Then khaNDobA
married mhALsA and also brought bAnU along, and settled down with the
two ladies in his hill-top palace at jejuri \[kaNNaDa-s explicitly call
bAnU a concubine\].  
….  
In jejurI, the shrine of viShNu as IThobA or hegaDI pradhan is half-way
up the hill. In front of his shrine goat sacrifices are made- he is
suppose to convey the goat sacrifices to the recipients. khaNDoba
himself only takes vegetarian offerings in the main shrine on the top of
the hill. There, on one side in the courtyard, there is a large image of
maNi and one of the steps has the image of the head of malla. mhALsA has
her own shrine, while bAnU has a little platform on which her image is
placed. In the smaller, but venerated, dhamankeL shrine in Junnar near
Pune, khaNDobA is seated on a muNDa mancha with the two demons’ heads as
the foot-rests. mhALsA is seated next to him, while bAnU is peeping from
behind his shoulder. In his hands he has a sword, trident and shield.
Besides the 3-peaked tryaMbaka li\~Nga, IThobA or viShNu stands with a
sword and shield.
