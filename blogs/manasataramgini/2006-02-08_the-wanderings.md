The god was our only companionâ€“ we descended to pAtAla and walked around
the regions where we had seen yasha and roga. We began to reminesce:
Then there was AshA, there was the indrajAla too. We flew like a bird
that had never seen a cage, we were filled with the confidence of youth.
Then we saw Hayastanika and her grandmother and started moving slowly
towards the great shmashAna. We first passed the wooden bridge where
numerous revellers were sporting by the river. Then we advanced to the
path by the shmashAna. We were all by ourselves. There were trees and
the rustling of their in the breeze. There was a little pond and a
hollow beyond that and great grassy plains further beyond. There in
silence we sat- we were seeing the vidyA. Towards us came those reduced
to pretas. While those full of jIva ran away from us. That was the realm
of bhavA-sharvA, the bhUtapati.
