The boons offered by the deity kumAra are of great certainty, but they
be extremely perplexing and their good result may only be seen after
some ironic hardship undergone by the recepient. Hence is he known as
the roguish dhUrta, who composed the taskara vidyA by manifesting as
kanakahastin and bhAskaranandin. But even the paths to the attainment of
chaurya perfection were not straight. amba wanted to slay bhIShma for
which she received a garland from kumAra but none ever wore it. So she
had to wait till as shikhaNDin she could wear it herself and slay the
kuru warrior. Likewise, kAtyAyana could not receive the kaumAra grammar
till he found the boy who learned things on hearing only once.

Thus, when we stood over the wastes of khANDavaprasta which was offered
to us by the 6-headed one we were engulfed by perplexity. We were
catching our head in dismay, when our interlocutor was laughing at our
jokes thinking that life itself was a big joke. We wondered what had
befallen us. Was this khANDava supposed to be a boon or a curse? When we
had survived the fall of the blade that could have lopped our head off
we realized that we had been favored by the peacock-rider. When we moved
towards victory in that great strife of himaprArambha we though we had
been favored. But what does this khANDava have for us we wonder?
