## CXLI

*To Mrs. Ole Bull*

RIDGELY MANOR,  
*4th September, 1899*.

MY DEAR MOTHER,

It is an awful spell of the bad turn of fortune with me last six months.
Misfortune follows me ever wherever I go. In England, Sturdy seems to
have got disgusted with the work; he does not see any asceticism in us
from India. Here no sooner I reach than Olea gets a bad attack.

Shall I run up to you? I know I cannot be of much help, but I will try
my best in being useful.

I hope everything will soon come right with you, and Olea will be
restored to perfect health even before this reaches you. Mother knows
best; that is all about me.

Ever yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
