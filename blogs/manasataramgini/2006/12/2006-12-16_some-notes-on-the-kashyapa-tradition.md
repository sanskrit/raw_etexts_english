title = "Some notes on the kAshyapa tradition"

+++
There is much reason to believe that the kAshyapa tradition is a real
coherent tradition of magico-medical practices in post-Vedic India that
survived in some form or the other in the midst of other traditions
until recently. At some point, after we discovered the coherence of this
tradition, we had thought of a 3-way collaboration with shAradA and R to
produce a more scholarly piece on the various aspects of this tradition
— both in terms of the printed texts and what ever little information
we could gather about unpublished manuscripts of this tradition.
However, the travails from saMsAra-bandha-s have prevented us from doing
this. In any case here are some notes on the topic.

Many tangled lines of our investigations over the years led to this body
of unique sanskR^it literature that we came to term the kAshyapa
tradition.  

1\) The tracing the post-atharvaNic development of medicinal practices
has lead most students to the obvious successors in the form of the
great saMhitA-s of charaka and sushruta, which represent early high
points in the development of Hindu medicine. However, more careful
investigation also leads to the now incompletely preserved but fairly
extensive text of early Hindu medicine the kAshyapa tantraM (also called
saMhitA, hence forth KT) that covers a wide range of topics especially
pediatrics.  
2\) The investigation of the early kaumAra mythology and liturgy leads
to the same KT that has extensive chapters on kumara and his graha-s,
revatI, mukhamaNDikA and ShaShThi, and their pacification in the context
of application of pediatric drugs. It provides the complete narrative of
kAshyapa on how devI revatI dispatched by skanda destroyed the asura
kanyA dIrghajihvI and others.  
3\) The investigation of the early history of Hindu zoology — the study
of snakes, insects, arachnids and rodents leads to another kAshyapa
saMhitA or the kAshyapa garuDa saMhitA (henceforth KS-G).  
4\) The study of the successors of the atharvaN tradition on toxicology
and the link to the treatment of snake bites obviously leads to the same
KS-G.  
5\) The search of remnants of the once extensive shaiva garuDa tantra-s
also points to the KS-G which is the source book of several garuDa
prayogas.  
6\) The common section on magico-medicinal practices presented in the
tantric treatises of the ishAnashiva mishra and the Chera magician
chenas nArAyaNan nambuthiripAD also suggest that their source was the
same KS-G.

As we can currently identify it this kAshyapa tradition covers the
following texts: 1) The kAshyapa saMhitA, KS-G 2) The kAshyapa
tantra/saMhitA- KT 3) The manuscript termed kaShyapa saMhitA of
shiva-pArvati saMvAda, which covers several diseases like tuberculosis,
leprosy, tumors and the like. 4) The kAshyapIya roganidAnaM also on
diverse diseases. The paippalAdas in their assorted late productions
preserve a text termed garuDopaniShat. While not mentioning kAshyapa its
contents suggest a close relationship with KS-G. The viSha sections of
ishAnashiva paddhati and tantra-sAra-saMgraha also are derivatives of
the kAshyapa works.

The KT is wider in its scope and its surviving portion covers a variety
of medical topics under the following headings:

kalpa on the kAshyapa tantra. It gives the following origin mythology
for the tantra: Diseases first emerged from the wrath of rudra that
destroyed the sacrifice of prajApati dakSha. Then kashyapa produced this
great saMhitA of the medical lore counter the ravages of disease.
jIvaka, the son of the bhArgava R^ishi R^ichika mastered this medical
lore of kAshyapa and systematized and summarized it as the kAshyapa
tantra even as a young boy. But when he went to teach medicine the other
vipra-s refused to take him seriously as he was just a boy. He then he
took a bath in a lake formed by the ga\~NgA and emerged as a serious
elderly man. The R^iShis now learned from him calling him
vR^iddha-jIvaka. Subsequently the tantra was lost, but the yakSha
anAyAsa recovered the text and restored it. Then a descendant of jIvaka
of the vAtysa clan of bhArgava-s pleased the yakSha with rites and
re-obtained the tantra and propounded it in the kali yuga.

khila: This is a large appendix that follows the main saMhitA and
provides further technical details on many of the topics in the saMhitA
as well as other topics like dermatology.

Thus, the KT resembles the more famous early medical saMhitA-s like
those of charaka or sushruta. However, it is distinct in having a major
body of kaumara material and several prayoga ritual practices that
accompany the conventional medical practices typical of Hindu medicine.
It provides one of the most detailed early accounts of pediatric
practices and in this connection deploys several kaumAra prayoga-s to
the kaumAra deities.
