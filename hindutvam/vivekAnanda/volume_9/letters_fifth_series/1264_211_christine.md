## CCXI

*To Sister Christine*

THE MATH, P.O. BELUR, HOWRAH

*12th December 1901*

DEAR CHRISTINE,

Well, then, you wanted to know all about my state of health, and you
insist. You shall have it.

You know, the last three years I have been getting albuminuria now and
then. It is not constant, nor is it yet of any organic character. The
kidneys are structurally all right. Only they throw out albumen now and
then.

This is worse than throwing out sugar in diabetes. Albumen poisons the
blood, attacks the heart and does all sorts of mischief. Catching cold
always increases it. This time it has caused a small blood vessel in the
right eye to burst, so that I scarcely see with that eye.

Then the circulation has become very rapid. The doctors have put me to
bed; and I am forbidden to eat meat, to walk or even stand up, to read
and write.

Already there is some benefit in this lying-down process, as I sleep a
lot and have a good appetite and am digesting my meals. Curious, is it
not, that inactivity should bring on sleep and appetite? There is no
cause to be anxious at all.

Mrs. \[Charlotte\] Sevier arrived in Calcutta three days ago; and by the
last advice from Nivedita, Mrs. Bull and she will start on the 13th
December, if they can secure berths, or on the 30th December at least. I
pray Mrs. Bull has already invited you and that you have got your year's
leave and are coming over, and that you will get this letter in India
redirected. If Mother does not fulfil this prayer, sure She will take me
across the water soon, and \[line excised\] . . . . The doctor says if I
keep to my bed for three months, I will get completely cured.

Now, don't worry. If good days are not coming, we will make them, that
is all. Hang it! I must have good days now and, that too, very soon. You
know, I always keep my word. Mother must do it, or I throw Her
overboard. I am not so submissive as you are.

Our old-school physicians pour in tons of iron and other metals —
including gold, silver, pearls, etc. — down our throats. I should be a
man of iron by this time; perhaps yours will be the last touch to make
my body one of steel.

This is our best season for eating turtles, but they are all black. The
green \[ones\] can only be found in America. Alas! I am prevented from
the taste of meat.

Now, noble heart, take courage. Don't mope: you have buffeted \[too\]
many a storm in life, old war horse, to be like a silly boarding-school
girl. Things must go all right. I am not going to die or to be ill just
now; I am determined to be healthy. You know my grit.

Miss \[Josephine\] MacLeod sent you your letter. What was it about? Was
there anything queer? I am glad she had it. She writes beautifully about
you. She has already started, and we will have a jolly good company this
winter here in Calcutta. Mrs. \[Ole\] Bull, Miss MacLeod, Mrs. Sevier
and Nivedita and I will be overjoyed if somebody else will be thrown
into the bargain. I can't get any more value, eh? I must stop. Am going
to look after my geese and ducks just for five minutes, breaking the
doctor's command to lie down all the time. One of the geese is a silly,
fearful bird, always despondent and anxious. She likes to be all alone
by herself and is miserable — very much like another goose I know in
another place.

Here my story ends  
And spinach top bends.  
Why is spinach withering?  
Because the goat is browsing.  
Why is the goat browsing?  
Because no grass is growing.  
Why no grass is growing?  
The gardener is not watering.  
Why there is no watering?  
The Master is not commanding.  
Why is he not commanding?  
An ant has bitten the Master!

This is a nursery rhyme told after a story, and it is true of us all. It
is only an ant bite, after all — the trouble here; is it not?

Ever yours,  
VIVEKANANDA.
