<p class="TEXT-English">1. Considering the time of human-life as invaluable and transitory, one should make use of it in performing the very best deeds and should not waste even a single moment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">2.	If, for some reason even a moment is wasted without remembrance of God, one should repent for it even more severely than one mourns at the death of one’s son, so that such an error could not be repeated in future.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">3.	One, whose time is wasted, has failed to realize the value of time.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">4.	Man should never keep idle, rather he should be always busy in doing good deeds.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">5.	Thinking of God in mind, reciting His holy name through speech and rendering through the body disinterested service to the world, treating all as the manifestation of God—this is the best form of action.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">6.	While speaking one should make use of such words as are true, pleasing, moderate and beneficial and that conform to the injunctions of scriptures.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">	7.	One should feel pleasure to hear one’s own faults.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">8.	If one points out our drawbacks, we should not plead ‘not guilty’ to it, as by so doing, the roots of the faults are strengthened and it creates hesitation in the mind of fault finder in pointing out our faults. Thus we cannot be free from faults.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4"><span>	9.	If we are innocent (faultless), we should keep silence on hearing the accusation, as it causes no harm to us; and if we are at fault, we should get rid of it.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span>10.</span> <span>One should respect the fault finder</span> <span>like a preceptor, so that in future he may be encouraged to point out the faults.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">11.	One should not tell the faults of a kinsman instantly as it may pinch him and make his reform impossible.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">12.	 If one has to extract work from a person, he should not send for him, rather should call at him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">13.	 One should lead a simple life.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">14.	 One should be self-dependent.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">15.	 One should not make the life much expensive. The lives of sages and hermits were not expensive. A much expensive life makes man a slave to money and other persons, consequently, he has to commit many a sin and has to resort to waggery.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">16.	 Even for the maintenance of body, one should use objects only in a dispassionate manner.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">17. Taste should not be the object of taking meals as it leads to our downfall. Even the consideration of health shows our lack of dispassion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">	18.	A seeker after benefaction should take food dispassionately, only for the sustenance of the body.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">	19.	Even in daily life Bhajana and meditation should be given primary importance and worldly transactions secondary. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">20.	Even at the time of bed, the name and form of the Lord should be remembered carefully so that sleeping hours may not go a waste. In order to make a means of sleeping time one should forget the flow of worldly thoughts and go to bed only thinking of the name, form, quality, power and character of the Lord. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">21.	 One should always be happy holding that motiveless divine grace and love fully showers on him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">22. One should have motiveless grace and love for all beings.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">23. In seclusion, one should convince one’s mind not to ponder over anything except the supreme self, as the worthless thoughts cause great harm.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">24.	 There is no benefactor of our own like God. Therefore, like king Bali, one should surrender oneself to God along with all his possessions.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">25.	 One should first make him deserving for God-realization, On becoming qualified (for His vision), God may himself grant His vision very soon.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">26.	 The speaker should not unfold the secret topics of Satsaṅga if the hearers are not interested.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">27.	 Where there are so many speakers one should try his best to desist from delivering a discourse.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">28.	 One should always keep himself away from adoration and veneration, and high seat and rank.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">29.	 So far as possible, one should never think of becoming a preceptor.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">30. On getting the information of death of a relative, one should pay visit if and where necessary, but on the death of a member of one’s family, the relatives living at distant places should be advised politely not to come.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">31.	 One should give dowry and donations, but never seek them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">32.	 To his best one should keep away from being an arbitrator. If he accepts to be so, he should not be partial at all.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">33.	 To his best one should never be mediator in arranging engagements and marriages.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">34.	 One should wake up in the early morning. If one get up after sunrise, one should observe fast for the day and make Japa.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">35.	 In order to make the spiritual discipline practised in loneliness more valuable, one should resort to the practice of Sandhyā, Gāyatrījapa, meditation, worship, recitation of sacred texts, singing hymns, offering prayers and salutations making out their meaning and spirit. All this should be characterised by reverence and devotion and should be carried out in a disinterested manner.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">36.	 For God-realization, there is no means equal to living in a lonely and holy place, attending holy company, Svādhyāya (study of scriptures), Dhyāna (contemplation on the supreme truth), utterance of His holy names, disinterestedness, JÛāna, Vairāgya (dispassion) and Uparati (indifference to the worldly objects).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">37.	 It is obligatory to all Dvijas to do Sandhyopāsana and Gāyatrījapa before the sunrise and sunset.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">38.	 Dwelling on the Name and form of God one should perform all the social day to day dealings and commercial activities and so on with an unselfish motive and in a just way, as blessedness is realized only by doing all the acts in a disinterested way for the good of others.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">39.	 One should not take anything in mouth except water and tooth-brush prior to taking bath and having performed the daily observances.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">40.	One should take meals after having offered it to the Lord and doing Balivaiśvadeva if he is so competent.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">44.	While walking one should abstain from causing injury to any being.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">45.	One should make use of such things as ghee, milk, oil, water, etc., after having filtered them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">46.	In the event of negligence in observance of duties, one should remorse, so that it could not be repeated.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">47.	Considering the duty as cumbersome it looks a burden and proves not much beneficial.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">48.	The same action, if done delightfully and remembering God, becomes a Sādhana (means) of a very high order.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">49.	Indolence is very harmful. There is atonement  for a sin, but no expiation for this. The only atonement is to give it up.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">50.	The highest effort in the form of observance of duties is a vital means to salvation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">51.	Though acquisition of wealth is not within one’s power, nevertheless one must make appropriate efforts with the spirit of duty for the support of body.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">52.	On getting pleasure and pain, one should ever be quite sated regarding them as the gracious dispensation of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">53.	One should make efforts to accomplish supremely good deeds very soon, as there is no certainty when the body may fall. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">54.	One should not make use of a thing that involves violence to beings.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">55.	One should not use silk and Tush.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">56.	One should not use honey, deer-leather, and musk involving violence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">57.	One should try one’s best to refrain from eating commodities prepared by mills.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">58.	One should have more faith in the existence of God than in a visible thing, as the stronger is the belief in God, the more will the striver be saved from commission of sins and the more will be his spiritual efforts intensified.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">59.	One should always depend on God. By this, there is an enhancement in virtues, such as patience, boldness, serenity, fearlessness and self-confidence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">60.	Unadultered love for God is the most secret thing. Nothing is greater than this.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">61.	There is no wisdom equal to the knowledge of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">62.	There is no glory equal to the glory of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">63.	No vision stands at par with the vision of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">64.	Conduct of great souls is the highest ideal to be followed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">65.	There is no sentiment higher than the sentiment of seeing God everywhere and in every being.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">66.	There is no justice higher than equanimity.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">67.	There is no penance like truthfulness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">68.	There is no other gain equal to God-realization.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">69.	There is no friend like Satsaṅga (association of holy men).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">70.	There is no enemy like evil company.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">71.	There is no piety like compassion, no sin like violence, no vow like celibacy, no Sādhanā (discipline) like meditation, no pleasure like quietude, no pain like debt, no purifier like knowledge, no deity like God, no wicked like a sinner. Each one of these is great in the respective field.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">72.	An amorous man has no sense of relation. An avaricious man enjoys no honour in society. A man overpowered by ill-temper (anger) has no consideration even for his father. An ignorant person has no sense of prestige. A devotee (votary of the Almighty Lord) can never give a curse. An atheist has no faith in Japa. And on the same lines, a man of wisdom is beyond measure with respect to his wisdom.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">73.	There is no pilgrimage like the Ganges, no one deserving to be served like cow, no scripture like the Gītā, no Mantra like Gāyatrī and no deity like Govinda.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">74.	Bathing in the Ganges, service of the cow, practice of the Gītā comprehending the implied meaning and spirit, Japa of Gāyatrī and contemplation on Govinda— taking to anyone of these with faith and devotion, one can get the ultimate good.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">75.	No enemy in the world can cause even the least harm to a person who is equipped with the weapons as veracity, non-violence, forgiveness, equanimity, contentment, simplicity, endurance and renunciation etc.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">76.	The very key to the refining of conduct is to renounce selfishness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">77.	In order to avoid falsehood, one should not make future commitments.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">78.	One should not entertain any desire, except for realising God; as the desire is conducive to rebirth. Therefore, wish, lust, longing, thirst etc., all the forms of desire should be given up.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">79.	Ask your mind time and agin as to what it desires. And, the reply from the mind should be in the negative. Desire perishes by such a practice. It is certain.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">80.	No great soul entertains any sort of desire in his heart. We should also follow him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">81.	We should not be attached to any worldly thing, as such attachment may create a desire at the time of death and such desire causes rebirth.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">82.	A Saṅkalpa is the thought that springs up from the feeling of existence in relation to a sense-object and attachment for the same.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">83.	The blessed souls are not reborn, as there is absolutely no desire in their hearts. Initially, only thoughts rise according to Prārabdha, not being associated with the feeling of their existence and attachment with them. They are unable to cause birth. Also, they do not have pleasure and pain in the least meeting with success and failure in their missions. This is the difference between a resolve and a thought.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">84. A passionate person has attachment and pleasure when agreeables happen and aversion and sorrow with disagreeables.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">85.	On hearing praise and slander one should not have in the least the feelings of pleasure or sorrow, attachment or aversion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">86.	A seeker of benediction should treat honour and fame as blots.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">87.	One should always consider the world and the body to be entering the mouth of Kāla (the all devouring aspect of the Lord.)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">88.	Mirage is not water in reality. Therefore, a thoughtful man even thirsty does not go there for water. In the same way, pleasures appear (seem to be) in the mundane objects, but are not there in reality. Knowing thus a dispassionate and discerning person does not seek them for happiness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">89.	In the eyes of liberated great souls, the world is just like a dream. It is for this that although living in the world, they do not get entangled at all in the worldly enjoyments.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">90.	Liberated is the man who even while alive treats the body as dead. As there remains no relation of a man with one’s own lifeless body. Similarly a liberated soul has no relation at all with his own body while living. He is a free soul.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">91.	Howsoever a faithful person may reckon the power of a realised soul, it would be but meagre, as the power of a saint is immeasurable.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">92.	Attainment of God is made through the divine power of a great soul and worldly achievements are made through his worldly powers.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">93.	Whatever the great souled persons do, they do it caused by their own as well as people’s Prārabdha (destiny) or else by the Divine will.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">94.	Even if everything is at stake one should neither commit a sin nor cause one to do so, nor should he accord consent.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">95.	Money should be earned by just means and never by the unjust even at the cost of starving to death.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">96.	One must not forsake one’s Dharma and devotion to God even though he has to face death.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">97.	Fortitude, forgiveness, mind-control, non-thieving, purity—both external and internal, sense-control, Sāttvika intellect, spirituality, truth and absence of anger—these are ten general characteristics of Dharma (piety). </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">98.	In order that the remembrance of God should persist in adversity, Kuntī prayed to God for unceasing distress.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">99.	The PāṇÎavas accepted the attendance upon the king Virāta, king of a lower order, but never abandoned their Dharma in the least.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">100.	Mahārāja Yudhiṣ¢hira shunned paradise, but did not forsake his follower though a dog even.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">101.	Renouncing self-interest is even superior to equanimity, therefore, one should render service to all selflessly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">102.	For a woman, chastity is the sacred most vow. Therefore, she should,while constantly remembering God obey her husband sincerely. She should also bow in the feet of her husband and the elders and render proper service to all of them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">103. Indifference to the sense-enjoyments; devotion to God, cultivating noble qualities, observance of good conduct and rendering selfless service to all—this is the most virtuous duty for a widow.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">104. There is no sin like causing pain to others and no virtue equal to doing good to others. Therefore, effort always should be made for wellbeing of others.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">105. Of the family, village, district, state, country, Dvīpa, the earth and the universe—one should give up the cause of preceding one for the sake of the latter.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">106. One should not observe, hear, think over or talk of the demerit and evil conduct of anyone. It may however, be done if it comprises in the benefaction of a person; but since the mind may mislead, so it should be done carefully and discriminatingly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">107. When one obliges another person, one should neither want the person to be grateful to him, nor narrate it to anybody, nor take pride in it; otherwise; the value of good done, is diluted. One should hold that everything happens by the will of God, he is mere instrumental to it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">108. One should not retaliate to a wrong-doer in exchange but forgive him, as sin occurs to the man of vindictive attitude.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">109. If the wrong-doer is benefitted by inflicting punishment to him, then there is no harm in punishing him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">110. During his whole life one should never forget a favour done to him by a person and even after doing more good to him one should ever feel obliged to the benefactor.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">111. If one happens to cause harm to a person, he should always go on doing good to him, so that he may entirely forget the wrong done to him; this is the true expiation. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">112. One should subjugate the mind and senses in such a way that instead of moving in worthless and sinful acts they may be devoted to our desired objective of God-realization.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">113. Everybody should pay special attention to the observance of celibacy.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">114. It is Saṅkalpa that generates lust. Chastity is destroyed through the contact with youthful beautious women and handsome young boys.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">115. A householder should not take to sexual intercourse more than once a month. He who cohabits with his wife once after her menstrual period, is equal to a Brahmacārī.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">116. The mind and senses, if subdued, act like friends but uncontrolled one sindulging in sense objects, act like an enemy.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">117. The attachment with the body and the world is the root of all evils, it should be relinquished altogether.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">118. None of the worldly enjoyments is free from danger. Therefore, one should keep away from them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">119. Wealth, women, honour, praise, envy, indolence, error, luxury and comfort, gratification of senses, evil traits and sin—treating these as great obstacles in the path of discipline, one should totally discard them like poison.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">120. Wisdom, dispassion, devotion, virtues, righteous conduct, service and continence— treating these as nectar, one should practise them at all times.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">121. Virtuous conduct is much higher than purificatory act. Devotion to God is a still higher virtue.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">122. God does not care for lineage etc., He cares for only love for him. Therefore, one should love God alone.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">123. God—the high-souled, scriptures and the next world—a believer in these can never commit a sin. Virtues such as fortitude, boldness, earnestness, equanimity and tranquility of mind are automatically imbibed in him. As a result, his every conduct becomes naturally the better and better.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">124. One should be delighted at all times by remembering the name, form, virtues, glory, Tattva, the secret and pastimes of the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">125. One develops reverence (for God) by hearing, reading and reflecting the virtues, glory, character, truth and secret of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">126. Veneration enhances also by taking to weeping in a piteous voice choked with emotion, offering praises and prayers with a sincere heart in solitude.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">127. Veneration develops by bringing the above mentioned utterances in practice with reverent faith in them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">128. On having veneration, one experiences a novelty even in relation to a minor behaviour of the venerated.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">129. The deliverance of the soul can be attained quickly by rendering in a disinterested way, service to the parents, the husband, the master, men of wisdom, the great saints and the preceptors with a heart saturated with reverence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">130. By practising disinterested service, Nāmajapa, Dhāraṇā (steadfastness of the mind fixed on the object of contemplation), meditation and Satsaṅga combined with study of scriptures, one can attain God-realization by removing the evils of impurity, distraction and obscurity.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">131. An aspirant should not entertain the desire for anything other than God-realization as all the desires except for this are conducive to whirling a being in the ocean of the world e.g., the rotation of birth and death.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">132. For the God-realization, man should regularly and daily take to the practice of sincere study of scriptures making out meaning and spirit, Japa-dhyāna in a solitary place and reflection on spiritual topics.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">133. As the darkness can never appear before the sun, so also on treating, an incident occurring against one’s will or by other’s will, a reward sent by God, one can always be safe from such enemies like desire and anger.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">134. In order to know the nature of Jīva, Brahma and Māyā (the delusive potency), one should remember the Lord, take to reflecting on spiritual realities daily in secret with a heart endowed with discrimination and dispassion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">135. There is no limit to the peace and bliss of a person who has experienced the truth and the secret of divine compassion and love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">136. One who has surrendered oneself to God and relies only on Him, is protected by God at all times and in all conditions subsequently, he attains Divinity free from all fear.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">137. The practice of meditation combined with devotion and Japa, Satsaṅga with faith and reverence, study of sacred texts keeping an eye on their implications, disinterested service of the miserable, the destitute, the venerable and the old—if these are pursued with a sense of duty, then each one of these is conducive to quick welfare (blessedness) of the striver.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">138. God is very much compassionate and loving. A striver who experiences the mystery of this fact, will attain to the supreme peace very soon by taking refuge in God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">139. There is no attitude like the attitude that all is the manifestation of God. Having gained this vision, the striver automatically wins over the flaws and bad conduct and inculcates in himself virtues and virtuous conduct.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">140. By experiencing everything as a form of God and every action as a sport of the Lord, one can understand the truth of God.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">Invaluable Teachings<span class="char-style-override-7"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-8">Importance of Nityakarma—</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The ‘Nityakarma’ that we perform every morning and evening has a most salutary effect on our life and is an exceedingly important item of our daily routine. It should, therefore, be performed with due attention and in right earnest. If we perform our Nityakarma with faith and reverence, we shall be instantaneously benefited by it. Sandhyopāsana combined with Gāyatrī is the foremost constituent of the Nityakarma and is the most valuable, most sacred and most useful among the acts that we perform in our everyday life and it is in itself worship of God. The most important factor in Upāsanā is love combined with reverence. Love transforms work into worship. Through the work performed with love and reverence is the worship of God performed. On the other hand, even worship done in a desultory manner, in a half-hearted way bears no fruit, though done for years. Upāsanā done with reverence and love even once will yield speedy results and be a source of untold joy and peace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-8">The</span><span class="char-style-override-8"> </span><span class="char-style-override-8">Glory</span><span class="char-style-override-8"> </span><span class="char-style-override-8">of</span><span class="char-style-override-8"> </span><span class="char-style-override-8">the</span><span class="char-style-override-8"> </span><span class="char-style-override-8">Divine Name and its practice—</span><span> </span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As a spiritual Sādhanā, practice of Divine name is the easiest and the best; there is nothing higher than this. The more secret the practice, the higher is its effect. It is therefore necessary that Japa of the Divine Name should be performed most secretly, so that others may not know it. Not only that but the fact of practising  Japa in secret should not be disclosed to others, as it thereby loses much  of its value and efficacy.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is also essential that the Sādhaka while performing the Japa should bear in mind the meaning and significance of the Name; for that will add to his joy. Nay, his heart will thereby be filled with the joy Eternal and will be carried away, as it were, by the magnetic current of Supreme Bliss.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Sādhaka should have absolutely no desire—earthly or heavenly in his mind. When offered a boon, Prahlāda thankfully declined, saying that he who asks for anything in lieu of his Sādhanā or Bhakti is verily not a Sādhaka but a businessman, a ‘Vaṇik’. But when the Lord still persisted, Prahlāda said, “I pray you to destroy my desire for asking, if there be any. This is the only boon I ask of you.” The Sādhaka should thus devote himself heart and soul to the Divine Name—remembering the inner significance of the Name and bearing in mind the Divine Forms of the Lord, and should have absolutely no desire, no ambition, no motive other than love for the Name itself. Japa performed in disinterested manner has an immediate effect on the mind and heart of the aspirant. Let the Japa be carried on in all conditions, at all times. Let our heart be surcharged with love of the  name. The ‘Japa’ carried on with love, faith and reverence has nothing on earth as its equal. It is unparalleled. And the deeper the love the more silent, the more inward is the Sādhanā.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-8">Three things are thus, necessary for the practice of Nāma Japa—</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1) The practice should be carried on quite secretly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(2) The significance of the Name should always be borne in mind.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(3) The practice should be absolutely disinterested. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Divine Name is the Truth Eternal and it works wonders. Its very remembrance dries the ocean of mundane existence, the shackles of birth and death break off and one gets attuned heart and soul with the Divine Life, Divine Light and the Divine Love.</p>

What more should be said in praise of the virtue of the Divine Name!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The poet sage, Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsajī, went so far as to say—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">The Divine Name is identical with God; that is to say, there is not the least difference between God and His Name. The Lord said in the Gītā— ‘‘<span class="char-style-override-10">यज्ञानां जपयज्ञोऽस्मि</span> (X. 25)”Other forms of sacrifice are only means to my realization, whereas the sacrifice in the form of Japa is the verily as Myself. As a matter of fact, God reveals Himself in the form of His Name. God’s form, God’s knowledge and God’s name—these three are identical things; hence when Japa of the Name is performed, it automatically leads to remembrance of God. The understanding of this fact means understanding the truth about the Name.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Ka¢hopaniṣad says—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Mental practice of Japa is hundred times more powerful  than practice through lips.

<p class="TEXT-English">The seeker after God-vision, who understands the secret of the Divine Name will never commit sin, or practise hypocrisy, under the protection of Name, commission of a sin under the belief that the Divine Name is potent enough to eradicate all its evil effects, and the practice of Japa, only as an external show, to create an impression on people, while secretly engaged in the commission of sin, are what is meant by committing sin and practising hypocrisy under the protection of the Name.

Just as the rising of the sun totally drives away darkness, even so remembrance of, and meditation on the form of God drive away all forms of misery, modification of the mind, and evil sinful conduct and endowing man with divine qualities and good conduct, take him across the ocean of mundane existence and bring about God-realization.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">And, he who meditates on the form of the  Lord is very dear to the Lord. This is also a top secret. The Lord himself said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">जद्यपि सब बैकुंठ बखाना।</p>
<p class="Shlok">बेद पुरान बिदित जगु जाना॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">अवधपुरी सम प्रिय नहिं सोऊ।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">The Virtue, Glory, Truth and Secret of The Lord’s Sports—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is a story connected with the Lord’s manifestation as śrī Rāma. When Vibhīṣana came to take shelter under śrī Rāma, the Lord requested Sugrīva to give his opinion as to what should be done. Sugrīva said— “Lord! The Rākṣasas are very deceptive by nature. Who knows with what intention he has come—whether as a spy or with any other motive? When a favourable opportunity presents itself, a Rākṣasa may cause us injury. That is why, in my opinion, he should be treated as a prisoner.” Thereupon, the Lord replied—“Friend! What you say is no doubt very judicious; but a man possessed of a wicked heart can never approach me. If he has come as a spy, even then we have nothing to fear, for Lakṣmaṇa possesses the power to exterminate in a moment all the Rākṣasas of the world. And if he has come to seek refuge out of fear, then the rule I follow is—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मम पन सरनागत भय हारी।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“My vow is to destroy the fear of one, who surrenders himself to me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, there is this verse—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सकृदेव प्रपन्नाय तवास्मीति च याचते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अभयं सर्वभूतेभ्यो ददाम्येतद् व्रतं मम॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(VI. XVIII. 33)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who saying even once, “Lord, I am thine, expresses the desire for surrender to me, I make him free of fear from all beings—this is my vow.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After this deliberation, śrī Hanumān and others brought Vibhīṣaṇa in the presence of the Lord. The moment hecame there, Vibhīṣaṇa fell prostrate to His bosom, and then  and there getting water of the ocean śrī Rāma anointed him as the ruler of Lanka.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">With reference to this, the fact of asking Sugrīva as to what should be done with Vibhīṣaṇa, and then praising his opinion as judicious, expresses both high policy and love on the part of the Lord. Not to abandon one who has taken refuge under him—this is love for the surrendering soul; and the anointing of Vibhīṣaṇa as the ruler of Lanka—this expresses both policy and generosity. These are in a general way the virtues of the Lord’s sports.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That a person possessed of a wicked heart cannot approach the Lord—this indicates the Lord’s glory. And Lakṣamaṇa’s capacity to kill all Rākṣasas in a moment, derived as it is from the LordHimself, also expresses the Lord’s glory.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God Himself, the Supreme Brahma, manifested Himself on earth as śrī Rāma. This form of knowledge of the divinity is understanding the truth of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord wanted to give protection to Vibhīṣaṇa. But concealing this motive, He asked the opinion of Sugrīva and other counsellors and praising what all of them said, actually did what he wanted to do. The deception and illusive power of the Rākṣasas could not operate in the presence of the Lord, Sugrīva and others were ignorant of this; that is why the Lord revealed the secret to them—</p>
<p class="Shlok">जो पै दुष्ट हृदय सोइ होई।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मोरें सन्मुख आव कि सोई॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“If he really possessed a wicked heart, would he come to me ?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By this statement, the Lord indirectly revealed His hidden glory that a man with a wicked heart could not go near Him, and that he who went near Him was devoid of all evils. Understanding of this revealation by the Lord of His own secret means understanding the secret of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The actions of God,  in as much as they are devoid of selfishness and egoism, are supremely pure and auspicious by nature i. e., whatever God does with reference to an individual, He does it only for the individual’s good; and all his actions are extremely pure. The understanding of this fact is understanding the glory and secret of the Divine sport.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">The Divine Abode—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The word Abode, here, is intended to mean that Supreme Abode of God, which is consciousness itself, eternal and divine in quality; which is above all, best of all, eternal and true; which is regarded by the worshipper of Brahma as the Abode of Brahma, by the knower of the Vedas the Abode of truth, by the worshipper of śrī Rāma as Sāketa, by the worshipper of Viṣṇu as Vaikuṇ¢ha, by the worshipper of śiva as the Abode of śiva—which is thus called by various names by the worshippers of various schools of thought, and which all of them regard as the highest, best and supremely divine; but which being beyond the reach of the intellect, mind and speech is quite extraordinary from all the descriptions given of it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The virtue of the Divine Abode, forgiveness, compassion, peace, equanimity, love, justice etc., which are the constant virtues of God, are naturally present in the Divine Abode. For the God Himself is manifest there in the form of His abode. That is why devotees living in this Abode are endowed by nature with these qualities. Lovers of God, who obtain a direct vision of the Lord, go to that Supreme Abode, and as the  result of their direct sight of God, these qualities naturally make their appearance in them; and Sādhakas who reach the Divine Abode with the help of practices like Bhajana, meditation, Satsaṅga, and study of the scriptures etc., develop almost all these qualities before they enter there; but in case there remains some deficiency in any of them, it is removed the very moment he enters that region. This, in a nutshell, is the merit or virtue of the Divine Abode.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-8">The Glory of The Divine Abode—</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The glory of the Divine Abode is such that he who goes there does not return. If for the good of the world, he at all comes on earth, either together with God, as an associate of God, or under the behest of God, with special powers, in the form of Kāraka-Puruṣa, his birth, actions and body in both cases being blameless, pure and divine, his descent is equivalent to no descent at all. For he remains wholly untouched by the illusion of the  world and all products of that illusion, and his body also though a product of Māyā, is above all blemish. Those who live in that Abode possess bodies, which are free from birth, death, decay and disease, and all other kinds of modifications, and which attaining utmost purity become like God’s own body, divine in essence, full of consciousness, transcendent and endowed with all virtues, and except the powers of creation, preservation and maintenance of the world. They come to possess all other glories and powers of God. Whatever objects there are in that world are all divine, conscious and transcendent in character. This in a nutshell is the glory of the Divine Abode.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-8">Truth About the Divine Abode—</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God manifests Himself in the form of His abode. Hence God’s Abode is the same as God Himself. The formless and attributeless Supreme Brahma, the embodiment of Existence, Sentience and Bliss, first becomes formless God, possessed of attributes, and thereafter manifests Himself as the Supreme Abode. Thus the abode of God is identical with God. This knowledge constitutes the truth about the Divine Abode.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-5">The Secret of the Divine Abode—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All the mysteries and secret divine facts connected with the virtue, glory, truth and secret of God and His abode, which cannot be comprehended while in this world, can be properly comprehended, exactly as they are, when one goes to that Supreme Abode. That is no sooner one goes there than does he directly realize the truth and secret of what God and His abode are in reality. There he comes to know what was unknown before, experiences what was beyond experience, sees what was unseen, hears what was unheard of and comprehends what was incomprehensible, for on reaching there, the intellect, mind and senses all become divine what we hear and understand about God and His abode in this world, the actuality about them is quite different for the intellect, mind and speech of this world cannot reach that region. Their secret and mystery get wholly revealed only when one reaches that abode, and then alone all doubts about the same cease to exist. The comprehension of this fact is comprehension of the secret of the Divine Abode.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Places on earth, which were sanctified         by the Lord’s sports, such as Ayodhyā,          Mathurā, Vr̥ndāvana etc., are also regarded as His Supreme Abodes. For residence in these places, with faith and love, endows one with the qualities of God, and understanding of their truth and secret leads to the growth of reverence, love and devotion, and death in those places removing the stains of sin, brings about liberation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-8">Glory of Saints or Exalted Souls—</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The fellowship of exalted souls is very difficult to get and even if it is had, it is difficult to recognize them as such. If, however, their fellowship is cultivated after recognizing them, one is sure to get the great reward in the form of God-realization; for the fellowship of exalted souls never goes in vain. Even if cultivated without knowing them, the fellowship of exalted souls does not cease to bear fruit; for it is unfailing in its effect. The Yoga-Sµutras of PataÛjali go so far as to declare that the very thought of exalted souls enables a man to silence his mind forever and realize God—</p>
<p class="Shlok">वीतरागविषयं वा चित्तम्।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(1.30)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Exalted souls have no relation based on any selfish motive with any living being. Regarding this the Lord Himself says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">नैव तस्य कृतेनार्थो नाकृतेनेह कश्चन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">न चास्य सर्वभूतेषु कश्चिदर्थव्यपाश्रय:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā 3.18)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“That exalted soul has no use whatsoever in this world for things done nor for things not done; nor does he have selfish dependence of any kind on any creature.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nevertheless actions which are intended exclusively for the good of the entire creation are done by him. Really speaking, it cannot be said that exalted souls who have realized God are non-existent today. Due to lack of faith, however, we are unable to see and recognize them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">No action of an exalted soul is purposeless. All his actions are intended for the good—for the welfare of others. If he takes work from others, he does so for their good alone, not for his own sake.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Exalted souls who get merged in the Supreme Spirit become absolutely one with the latter. To worship them is  just the same as to adore the Supreme spirit.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The mind of a man gets purified by the very thought of exalted souls, to say nothing of their sight and talking with them. The sight, touch, thought and conversation of such a saintly soul confers sanctity on all. Offering the homage of his heart to śrī śukadeva, Parīkṣit said in the Bhāgavata—</p>
<p class="Shlok">येषां संस्मरणात् पुंसां सद्य: शुद्धॺन्ति वै गृहा:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">किं पुनर्दर्शनस्पर्शपादशौचासनादिभि:॥</p>

<p class="Shlok">सद्यो नश्यन्ति वै पुंसां विष्णोरिव सुरेतरा:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(I. XIX. 33-34)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O sage! your very remembrance purifies a householder. What have we not gained when we got this opportunity of your sight and touch and of your service in the form of washing of feet and offering of a seat etc.? Chief of Yogīs, your very presence destroys even the greatest of sins, even as demons disappear in the presence of Bhagavān Viṣṇu.” </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The very atmosphere of the place, where such a saint resides, becomes sacred. Devarṣi Nārada says—</p>
<p class="TEXT-HINDI"><span class="char-style-override-8">तीर्थीकुर्वन्ति तीर्थानि सुकर्मीकुर्वन्ति कर्माणि सच्छास्त्रीकुर्वन्ति शास्त्राणि।</span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“He confers sacredness on sacred places, makes all deeds virtuous and all scriptures uplifting scriptures.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That is wherever he resides becomes a sacred place, or his residence in a sacred place makes the sanctity of the place permanent and bright; whatever deeds he performs become the standard of virtue; his very words are scriptures, and whatever books are treated as authority by him are regarded as the highest scriptures.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Enumerating the ways of overcoming Māyā, Devarṣi Nārada says in his “Aphorisms on Bhakti”—</p>
<p class="TEXT-HINDI para-style-override-5">कस्तरति कस्तरति मायाम्? य: सङ्गं त्यजति यो महानुभावं सेवते यो निर्ममो भवति॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Who crosses Māyā? He who shakes off attachment, serves the saints and owns nothing as his own.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The poet-sage, Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsajī went so far as to say</p>
<p class="Shlok">मोरें मन प्रभु अस बिस्वासा।</p>
<p class="Shlok">राम ते अधिक राम कर दासा॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Lord! it is my belief that the devotee of Rāma is greater than Rāma Himself.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A Hindi poet says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">पारस में अरु संत में बहुत अंतरौ जान।</p>
<p class="Shlok">वह लोहा कंचन करै, यह करै आपु समान॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Know that—there exists a world of difference between a saint and a philosopher’s stone. While the latter converts iron into gold, the former casts one in his own mould.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this connection, the Nārada Purāṇa goes the length of asserting as follows—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Looked at by exalted souls, even those who are guilty of major sins or are tainted with subordinate sins do reach the highest goal. If any such virtuous soul happens to behold a dead body, the smoke rising out of its pyre (while it is being cremated) or even its ashy remains, the deceased attains the supreme goal.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is for this very reason that the fellowship of exalted souls has been particularly glorified in our sacred books. Says the Bhāgavata— </p>
<p class="Shlok">तुलयाम लवेनापि न स्वर्गं नापुनर्भवम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">भगवत्सङ्गिसङ्गस्य मर्त्यानां किमुताशिष:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“We cannot compare with a moment’s fellowship of loving devotees of the Lord either heavenly bliss or even final beatitude (the cessation of birth and death), much less the enjoyments sought after by mortals.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Referring to the goodwill of such exalted souls as the principal means of developing devotion, the sage Nārada says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मुख्यतस्तु महत्कृपयैव भगवत्कृपालेशाद् वा।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Bhaktisµutra 38)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">“Such (unswerving) devotion can, however, be developed primarily through the good-will of exalted souls (who have developed unflinching love for God), or by a little bit of Divine Grace.”<span class="char-style-override-11" xml:lang="en-GB"></span></p>
