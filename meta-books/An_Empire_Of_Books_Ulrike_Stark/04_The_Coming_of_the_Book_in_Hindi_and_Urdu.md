title = "The Coming of the Book in Hindi and Urdu"

+++
The introduction of print to India dates back to the year 1556, when 
Portuguese Jesuit missionaries set up the first printing press in 1 Goa.' Two decades later, the first book in an Indian language and script appeared in the form of the Doctrina Christam (1577), a Tamil translation of a Portuguese catechism prepared by the Jesuit Henri Henri ques. By contrast, it was not until the last decades of the eighteenth cen tury that northern India saw a similar turning point in its cultural history when, for the first time, the introduction of movable type founts enabled the production of printed matter in Arabic, Persian, Bengali, Urdu, and Hindi on Indian soil. This momentous event marked the 'real advent of print' in the East and North of the subcontinent. It was followed by an other revolutionary development in the 1820s, when the introduction of lithography opened up the realm of print to Indian agency, allowing for widespread Indian ownership of printing presses. At the technological level, these innovations together formed the starting point for the emer gence of the Indian-language press and the printed book in Hindi and Urdu. 
Several explanations have been offered as to why the North Indian Muslim rulers showed no apparent interest in the printing press, despite the early presence of Jesuit missionaries at the Mughal court and the vigorous interaction of the court with European scholars and travellers. The sophistication of manuscript production and culture under Mughal rule may have been a disincentive, preventing the adoption of print techno logy. The prestigious and influential establishment of professional copy ists, the monopoly maintained by cheap and easily accessible bazaar 
The first books printed in India are said to be Antonio de Quadros's Conclusoes (1558) and Gaspar de Leao's Compendio spiritual da vida christa (1560). For the early history of printing in India, see Priolkar 1959 and Kesavan 1986.

writers, ritual objections to printing religious texts, and politically motivated hostility to the press among indigenous rulers have been cited as further impediments." Francis Robinson also cogently points to the valorization of oral transmission in Islamic tradition, which had to be compromised only when Islam came under attack from various sides in the nineteenth century (Robinson 1993; 1996). In addressing the important question of why, at that point, Indian Muslims adopted print technology with so much vigour and at a much faster pace than other Islamic popu lations, Robinson persuasively argues that in the colonial situation print was for Indian Muslims a powerful weapon in counteracting the combined threat of colonial rule, Christian proselytizing, and a Hindu majority population." At a time when Islam was perceived to be under threat, print became crucial in asserting Islamic identity; it was key to broadcasting religious knowledge and fostering a deeper understanding of Islamic traditions among Indian Muslims. Indian ulama used the new technology of print to compensate for the loss of political power: 'If Islam could no longer be supported by the swords of Muslim princes, it could now be supported by the enhanced religious understanding of Muslims them selves' (Robinson 1996: 72). 
Serving as a preliminary to our study of the NKP, this chapter will look at the phenomenon of print in modern North Indian languages in its wider historical context. The first sections will sketch the history of the Hindi and Urdu printed book from the time it was ushered into life and raised by colonial scholar-administrators and Christian missionaries, to the time it reached adulthood and flourished under Indian aegis. In tracing this process, the focus will be on the Indian agents at the heart of book production, that is the printer-publishers of East and, subsequently, North India. Having looked at several early centres of print in the NWP and Avadh, the later sections probe the emergence of commercial print culture in the post-1857 period. The social background of some North Indian printer-publishers will be explored. The final section will outline the conditions imposed on the domestic publishing trade by colonial rule and describe some of the specific difficulties that Indian publishers en countered in their profession on account of state regulation.

Priolkar cites instances of Brahminical rejection of print on acount of issues such as fear of pollution: it was feared that printing ink contained animal fat that would defile the texts (Priolkar 1958: 128-9). However, this difficulty could easily be solved by substituting vegetable oil for unclean animal fat (Diehl 1973: 122-3).

The Coming of the Book in Hindi and Urdu 
31 
The printed book features prominently in a number of processes mark ing Indian modernization. The emergence of Hindi and Urdu as modern print languages and the concomitant development of the regional language book trade coincided with their rise in the North Indian public sphere in a mutually stimulating process. Print culture shaped the public sphere even as it was shaped by it. Urdu and Hindi were put to new pub lic uses via processes that relied heavily on print, while these uses in turn generated an increasing demand for printed literature in the modern languages. The new print media generated modes of 'public' opinion and participation and facilitated the formation of collective identity They also opened up new ways of acquiring, managing, and diffusing knowledge, which were equally essential to modern political, social, and cultural discourse. Together, print and the vernacularization of education induced far-reaching changes in the cognitive and literary realms. 
From the late eighteenth century, Urdu began to gather prestige as the lingua franca of the educated classes and gained momentum as a prose idiom. Urdu got a great boost in 1837 when it replaced Persian as the language of the court and administration in the NWP. Preceding and ac companying its new public status of 'official vernacular' was the ac ceptance of Urdu as a language of religious expression and a vehicle of rationalist and scientific discourse. Avril Powell has shown how printed texts came to form an essential element of the early Christian-Muslim encounter (Powell 1993). The circulation of the Mizān al-haqq(Balance of the Truth, 1835) and other influential tracts by a German pietist mis sionary, Karl Hermann Pfander, provoked a series of refutations on the part of Lucknow's leading ulama, marking the beginning of 'an era of prolonged tract warfare between Islam and Christianity in northern India' (ibid.: 172-3). Print came to be closely intertwined with Islamic revival. Muslim traditionalists and reformers were pre-eminent in making use of the print media to publish religious classics and their own contemporary writings. In the process, Urdu gained ground as the language of an original religious literature. The first translations of the Qur'an into Urdu, under taken in the late eighteenth century by Shah Abdul Qadir Dehlavi and Shah Rafiuddin Dehlavi, the sons of the great Muslim thinker Shah 
5 The mutual stimulus of the Indian-language press and the creation of public opinion can first be witnessed in the socio-religious controversy over sati in the 1830s. The sati debate gave an enormous impetus to the Indian press and generated a number of short-lived journals that acted as mouthpieces of either orthodox or reformist opinion.

Waliullah of Delhi, had constituted an important landmark in the accept ance of Urdu as a religious idiom. They provided the impetus to much further translation activity, initiating a proliferation of religious texts in Urdu which, from the late 1820s, began to circulate in print. This wide spread dissemination of religious and scientific classics in the modern idiom was 'clearly key to the effectiveness of the reformist movement (Metcalf 1982: 206). 
As a new means of disseminating Islamic knowledge and reformist thought across a broader section of society, mass-printed Urdu texts had a profound impact on religious education. Circulated in print from the 1820s, an influential reformist text such as the Taqwiyat al-imán (Streng thening of the Faith) not only marked the beginning of an original religious literature in Urdu, but was able to reach far larger audiences of readers and listeners than had ever been known before. By opting to write in simple Urdu its author, Shah Muhammad Ismail, explicitly addressed himself to a large new audience of 'ordinary' Muslims (Metcalf 1982: 200–1). By the late 1850s, cheap tracts and pamphlets churned out by Indian presses were making inroads into traditional Islamic education. As Robinson has argued, the mass-produced printed text, while initially strengthening the position of the 'ulama, ultimately undermined their authority. In breaking the Culama's monopoly over the transmission of knowledge, print gradually induced religious change (Robinson 1993: 245). 
The nineteenth century saw the consolidation and linguistic codifica tion of Urdu and Hindi as modern literary idioms, a process in which printed textbooks produced under missionary and colonial aegis played an important part. The rise of the modern languages generated a flurry of translation activity on the part of literary and scientific societies, scholars, and literati, who sought to revive old and propagate 'modern knowledge through the printed word in Urdu, and increasingly, in Hindi. With nascent Hindu nationalism and revivalism, Hindi was assigned an important new role as the vehicle of a distinct Hindu consciousness and was soon to challenge the position of Urdu (Dalmia 1996). In the literary domain within both languages the shaping of a literary canon was under way. The emergence of new literary genres, such as the modern novel and discursive prose writing, was closely linked to new publication for mats in the print media.

The Coming of the Book in Hindi and Urdu 
33 
Despite the centrality of the printed book in these processes, research on the history of the book in Hindi and Urdu has been fragmentary and uneven. That the earliest phase of Hindi and Urdu printing in the subconti nent is comparatively well documented is largely due to the efforts of Graham Shaw, who, alongside his pioneering study. Printing in Calcutta to 1800 (1981), contributed a series of seminal essays. Urdu publishing in the nineteenth century has received a fair amount of attention in the pioneering works of Imdad Sabiri, Muhammad Aliq Siddiqi, Nazir Ahmad, and Nadir Ali Khan, who painstakingly collected data on indi vidual printing presses from all over northern India. These studies and compilations contain a mine of valuable information for the book historian. None of them has so far been translated into English. 
The picture looks more dismal for the history of the book in Hindi. Information on the early spread of Hindi printing in the Hindi-speaking region is especially hard to come by. While missionary and official efforts have received some attention (Vedalankar 1969), there is hardly any work that explores Indian involvement in early Hindi book production. This is of course owing to the fact that the North Indian book trade was for a long time dominated by Persian and Urdu, with Hindi printing cons tituting only a secondary activity for most presses. A full-fledged Hindi print industry only developed from the late 1860s. As a result, the period 1830-60 stands out as a largely undocumented dark area', within which the long-awaited third volume of B.S. Kesavan's History of Printing and Publishing in India (1997) is a telling example. Contrary to its claim to cover the Origins of printing and publishing in the Hindi heartland', it fails to provide any substantial insights into the development of Hindi publishing during precisely the period 1830–57, passing more or less directly from Fort William College and the Calcutta presses to the post 1857 scenario. Moreover, Kesavan's study contains much inaccurate information. 
The first classificatory overview of Hindi books, attempted by Mata prasad Gupta in 1947, is equally lacking, in that it covers a period be ginning only from 1867 (Gupta 1947). To gather reliable data on early imprints in Hindi, one needs to resort to the holdings of libraries, private collections, and other bibliographical source material and from these

deduce a history. This was the approach adopted by Krishnacarya in his pioneering study Hindi ke ādimudrit granth (1966), the first systematic attempt at a bibliography of early printed books in Hindi. While Krishna carya's work remains unsurpassed in many ways. his periodization of Hindi printing into three periods (1) Lalluji period (1801-22). (2) Mis sionary period (1822-44), and (3) Shiva Prasad period (1845-70) appears problematic. Although his effort to highlight the contribution of individual figures is commendable, he grossly overstates the role of Lalluji Lal (d. 1825) and Raja Shiva Prasad (1823-95) in the domain of print. Undoubtedly, both were eminent figures in nineteenth-century Hindi literature, but dubbing Lalluji the 'Caxton of India' is as fallacious as calling Shiva Prasad the leading force in Hindi printing up to 1870. 
A more convincing classification of major periods in early Hindi printing has been offered by Dhirendranath Singh in his pioneering study on the Khadgavilas Press of Bankipur (Patna), the first influential literary publishing house in Hindi, which rose to fame as the publisher of Bhara tendu Harishchandra (Singh 1986). In distinguishing between three periods—(1) Missionary period (1800-58), (2) Naval Kishore period (1858–80), and (3) Khadgavilas period (1880-1926)-Singh was the first to highlight the role of individual Indian publishers in shaping Hindi print culture. He was also the first to point to the central importance of the NKP in Hindi publishing during the second half of the century, a formative stage in the development of modern Hindi literature. Although Singh's periodization favours the misconception that the NKP's heyday was over by 1880, it clearly underscores the pivotal role of the Lucknow press in commercial Hindi printing for a period stretching more than three decades. 
What did the landscape of Hindi and Urdu printing book like before the middle of the nineteenth century, before large commercial publishers like Naval Kishore entered the scene? What were the circumstances un der which early printer-publishers operated, and what was the size and scope of book production? In drawing on a variety of English-, Hindi-, and Urdu-language sources, the following account seeks to give a brief sketch of the early phase of printing and publishing in the North Indian languages, moving in subsequent stages from Calcutta and its environs to the Hindi-Urdu region. As we will see, in early Hindi and Urdu book 
9 The most voluminous modern compilation which purports to be a comprehensive bibliography of Hindi imprints from the beginning to 1964 is the Hindi-sāhitya sāriņi (1971) issued from the Hoshiarpur Vishveshvaranand Institute. It follows a generic rather than chronological arrangement of titles and is utterly defective in its documentation of pre-1870 imprints.

production, success and failure came in equal measure: encountering severe financial difficulties, many of the early Indian private and com mercial printer-publishers were forced to relive the experiences of their European precursors in the late eighteenth century. Even though litho graphy opened up the realm of print to Indians by greatly reducing costs, for more than one North Indian pioneer of print the words uttered by the French-born Calcutta printer Haji Mustapha at the end of his career would become a prophesy: Printing in this country requires a young man and a rich man, and I am neither (cited in Shaw 1981: 27). 
1.1 Early Printing in Hindi and Urdu 
The earliest known specimens of printing in Nagari, and in the Perso Arabic script used for Urdu, hail from Europe. Specimens of Nagari first appeared in books printed in Europe from 1625 onwards, while movable Nagari types were cast in Rome as early as 1740.11 Benjamin Schultze's translation of the New Testament into Urdu (Dakkhini) was printed in Halle in 1758 using Arabic type. When, in the late eighteenth century, movable types first came into use in the northern part of the subcontinent, it was in Calcutta, the youngest of the presidency towns and seat of the East India Company administration, that printing in various Indian languages really took off. Calcutta was not only a trading place of a cosmopolitan character; under Governor General Warren Hastings it also became a stronghold of Orientalist scholarship which centred around three important institutions—the Calcutta Madrasah (est. 1781), the Asia tic Society of Bengal (est. 1784), and, later, under Hastings' successor Marquess Wellesley, Fort William College (est. 1800).!? Although Mad ras was the first of the colonial metropolises to print books in an Indian 
10 The line of demarcation between private and commercial printer is particularly difficult to draw for the early phase of printing in North India. I largely follow the definition of a 'private press proposed in Ransom 1963, that is, a press reserved for personal and not public use, usually set up in a private residence or the buildings of an association, for which financial gain is clearly secondary to literary, scholarly, artistic, and typographic pursuits. 
11 The first known printed book to make use of Nagari types is the China monu mentis illustrata (Amsterdam 1667) by the renaissance scholar Athanasius Kircher, which contains a description of the entire Devanagari syllabary supplied by the Jesuit missionary Heinrich Roth. The earliest specimens of printing from movable metal types in Nagari can be found in the Alphabetum Brammhanicum seu Indostanum universitatis Kasi (Rome 1771). For early Nagari printing in Europe, see Shaw 1997a.

language, notably Tamil (Blackburn 2003: 58), from the 1780s onwards Calcutta developed into the largest centre of printing in South Asia. It was here that the printed book in Hindi and Urdu first saw the light of day. 
The beginning of regional-language printing in Bengal is generally associated with the Orientalist scholar-official and pioneer of Indian typography Charles Wilkins (1750-1836). Wilkins had come to Calcutta in 1770 as a writer in the East India Company's service. At the governor general's request and with the assistance of the Bengali blacksmith Pan canan Karmakar, he cast the earliest known founts of Bengali type in 1778. They were used to print Nathaniel Halhed's A Grammar of the Bengal Language (1778). As superintendent of the newly set up Com pany's Press, he also manufactured an elegant fount of nastaliq types used to print Francis Gladwin's A Compendious Vocabulary, English and Persian (1780), Francis Balfour's Insha-yi Harkaran (The Forms of Herkern, 1781), and a plethora of other works in Persian. Wilkins did not, however, cast any Nagari fount until his return to England in 1786.15 The credit for preparing the first Nagari founts used for printing in India goes instead to the Chronicle Press, one of the earliest commercial presses of Calcutta, established jointly by Daniel Stuart and Joseph Cooper in 1786. The two Englishmen set up a type foundry where Bengali, Nagari, and Persian types were cast. In 1789 the Chronicle Press issued a volume of the New Asiatick Miscellany, which contained some Sanskrit verses and an ode (rekhta) by the Dakkhini poet Wali Gujarati in the Devanagari script. These verses not only constitute the first known instance of a Nagari fount having been successfully cast in India; Wali's ode also stands out as the first Urdu literary text to be printed in India (Shaw 1981: 32). The Chronicle Press assumes importance in the early history of Hindi and Urdu printing in several respects: it issued John Gilchrist's Dictionary, English and Hindoostanee (1786-90) and his Grammar of the Hindoostanee Language (1796); its Nagari and nastaliq founts were used to print a number of celebrated works, such as Ulfaz udwiyeh (1793), a materia medica containing a large number of names printed in Nagari. Around the same time, Peter Spalding, type-founder at the East India Company's Calcutta mint, also began to cast nastalig and Nagari founts. His Nagari types were used for printing translations of government 
13 Wilkins's Persian types were described as having come from his hands in so perfect a state of beauty, as hardly to admit improvement' (cited in Khan 1999: 62). His Nagari fount was first used after 1800 to print his Grammar of the Sanskrit Language (1808) and several other grammars. Further details in Shaw 1981: 34.

regulations and first appeared in an Indian newspaper in the Calcutta Gazette of June 1796 (Shaw 1981: 33–4). 
The year 1800 marks a major turning point in the history of print in Hindi and Urdu with the simultaneous establishment of the Baptist Mis sion at Serampore and the College of Fort William in Calcutta. A training academy for young British civil servants, Fort William College began producing a vast array of classical and modern-language grammars, lexicons and textbooks for the instruction of its students (Das 1978:154 64), while the Serampore Mission engaged in the huge venture of spreading the scriptures and edifying Christian literature in the regional languages of India. Common to these efforts, whether of an evangelical, educational, or academic thrust, was their reliance upon, and trust in the power of the printed word. 
Missionary Printing The relatively late introduction of print in the North Indian regional langu ages is partly a consequence of the East India Company's policy of 'non-interference in religious matters. Until 1813 it forbade the initiation of missionary activities within its territories. Prior to that, it was only in the Danish enclave of Serampore that the Baptist missionaries William Carey, William Ward, and Joshua Marshman could engage in proselytiz ation and start to spread the gospel in printed form. Opened in 1802, the Serampore Mission Press soon grew into the largest printing press in South Asia, inaugurating a period in the history of Indian-language print ing that was dominated by missionary activity. While print was central to proselytization, missionary printing also made a pioneering contri bution in the field of vernacular education. Besides translations of the Bible and Christian tracts, missonaries produced a plethora of textbooks, grammars, dictionaries, and other educational works. The output of the Serampore Mission Press alone was immense: despite a devastating fire in 1812 that destroyed the press and valuable manuscripts, a total of over 212,000 volumes in forty different Indian languages were issued from Serampore between 1801 and 1832 (Grierson 1903: 241). 
Missionary printing received a great boost when the Charter Renewal Act of 1813 opened India to missionary activity. However, the Company continued to invoke its neutrality in religious matters and remained hostile to proselytization; missionary activity, therefore, was still considerably impeded (Powell 1993: 80). In view of this, the dimensions of missionary publishing during its early phase are all but astounding: the legendary Baptist Mission Press in Calcutta (est. 1818), an institution closely linked 
38 
An Empire of Books 
to the Calcutta School Book Society, reportedly published by 1820, a total of 710,000 volumes in various languages. The Calcutta Auxiliary Bible Society (est. 1813), within three decades of its establishment, is sued vernacular versions of the Christian scriptures in over half a million copies (Long 1848: 511). 
Missionaries were eminent pioneers of Hindi and Urdu print culture. After 1820 there was a gradual expansion of missionary activity into the upper Gangetic region. The opening of missions in the towns and urban centres of the north-west was accompanied by the establishment of print ing presses, notably the Surat Mission Press (1820). American Mission Press in Ludhiana (1836), Mirzapur Orphan Press (1838), Allahabad Mission Press (1838), Sikandra Orphanage Press (1840). and Muzaffar nagar Mission Press (1846). Together with the simultaneously emerging tract and school book societies, these institutions generated a huge number of printed texts for use in missionary and government schools, making a profound impact on the spread of literacy. Indeed, it was through the two pillars of missionary activity, romantically invoked in a Christian journal as 'the schoolhouse rising in the desert' and 'the creative crash of the printing press, as it pours forth its intellectual bounties', that a large number of Indians first became acquainted with the printed word in their mother tongue. 15 By 1868 the North India Tract and Book Society (an amalgamation of the Benares and Agra tract societies) had alone produced Hindi and Urdu tracts in almost 180,000 copies. The complex ideological and pedagogic implications of this spate of Christian literature have been dealt with elsewhere and need not be reiterated here. It may suffice to point out one consequence of missionary engagement in Hindi and Urdu printing: in following an ideologically determined policy to address Hindus and Muslims separately through publications in Nagari and the Urdu script, missionary printing was a first step in cementing the separation of the two languages (Dalmia 1997: 170). 
Missionary printing also introduced important improvements in the quality of book production. The achievements of the paper mill of the Serampore Mission Press will be discussed later. Its type-foundry, esta blished in 1803 and run by Wilkins's former assistant Pancanan, made significant progress in the production of oriental founts. The various

It was only much later that the Serampore types were superseded by the more refined and elegant Bombay type produced at Javaji Dadaji's Nirnay Sagar Press after 1869. 
Remarkable improvements were also made with regard to the founts used for printing in Persian and Urdu. Nonetheless, the Serampore Mis sion Press continued to import Persian founts from England. Urdu typo graphy was still in its infancy: owing to the scarcity of suitable founts, nearly all Urdu books printed in India before 1800 were in nastaliq. The naskh character, which lent itself much better to movable type-printing and was much used for oriental printing in England, only made its appearance in India when it was popularized by missionary printers and schoolbook societies. Among those who favoured it for its appearance and ease of learning (Ahmad 1985: 107-8) was John Gilchrist of the College of Fort William-an institution that maintained close ties with the Serampore Mission Press. 
The Hindustani Department at Fort William College 
The first books in Hindi and Urdu were not issued from the Serampore Mission Press but from Calcutta. The beginning of book printing in the North Indian languages, much like the history of their modern literatures, is associated with Fort William College and the name of John Borthwick Gilchrist (1759-1841). Gilchrist, a Scotsman who had entered the Com pany's service as an assistant surgeon in 1782, had already gained a reputation as a scholar and skilled linguist of Urdu when he was appointed supervisor of the College's Hindustani Department in 1801. He empha sized the importance of modern spoken idioms as vehicles of com munication. He initiated the preparation of a substantial number of Urdu and Hindi texts, many of them adaptions or translations of the Persian and Sanskrit classics.17 His intent in popularizing Urdu—or Hindustani, as the language was usually referred to by him—transcended the func tional needs of the college and was directed at a more general revitalization of the language. As he wrote in 1803: 
17 For an overview of the publications of Fort William College, see S.K. Das 1978: 68–78. 
40 
An Empire of Books 
I shall engage soon to form such a body of useful and entertaining literature in that language as will ultimately raise it to that estimation among the natives which it would many years ago have attained among an enlightened and energetic people ... May not we then reason thus from analogy, that the Hindoostanee will ascend as high on the Indian scale... as the English has done in a similar predicament in our own country's 
To this end, Gilchrist set up the Hindustani Press in 1802. The press pro duced several celebrated works which not only figure prominently in the history of modern Urdu prose, but also constitute the earliest printed books in Urdu. The first two, appearing in 1802, were Mir Amman's Bāgh o bahār (The Garden and the Spring), a prose rendering of the fam ous Persian tale of the Four Dervishes, and Bāgh-e Urdū (Garden of Urdu), a translation of Sa'di's Gulistan by Mir Sher Ali Afsos'. Subsequent publications included a prose adaptation of Mir Hasan's famous Masnavi Sihr al-bayān entitled Nasr-e Benazir, and Guldasta-e Haidari, the first tazkirah of Urdu poets in the Urdu language to be published (Pritchett 2003: 880). 
Despite his predilection for Hindustani, Gilchrist also recognized the importance of what he identified as `hindavī' or 'bhākhā', a 'vulgar' or ‘rustic' style which he associated with the spoken idiom of the Hindus. His giving employment to a number of .bhākhā' munshis, who were to teach and prepare texts in Hindavi, has been viewed as a decisive step in institutionalizing the dichotomization of Urdu and Hindi into autonomous linguistic entities. It formed the starting point for the estab lishment of a separate literary corpus for Hindi and nourished the future concept of mutually exclusive literary canons of Hindi and Urdu (Dalmia 1997: 164–9). In the present context, Gilchrist's measure is significant in that it entailed the publication of the earliest-known printed books in Hindi and the Nagari script. Issued at his instance from various Calcutta presses in 1802, these were Simhāsan battisi; Mādhunal, being a Hindi version of a Brajbhasha narrative by Motiram; and Sakuntalā nātak from the Brajbhasha of Nevaj.19 A fourth title, a Nagari-script edition of the Marsiya (elegy) by Mir Abdullah ‘Miskin', illustrates the fact that the division between Hindi and Urdu was not yet a clear-cut one. Among other texts simultaneously issued in Nagari and Urdu-script versions

were Simhasan banisi and Baitāl paccisi, two popular folk narratives of Sanskrit origin. 
After 1803 Gilchrist's activities were continued by his successor William Hunter. As the new owner of the Hindustani Press, Hunter pub lished some forty Urdu and twelve Hindi works, including the poetic collections of several famed eighteenth-century Urdu poets-Divan-e Mir Soz(1810). Intikhāb-e Saudā (1810), and Kullivāt-e Mir Taqi (1811) and also versions of popular qissas such as the Qissa-e Hatim Ta'i (1803). Publications in Hindi include the first (incomplete) edition of Lalluji Lal's Premsāgar (1803), Biharilal's Sarsai (1809), and Lalluji's Rājniti (1809)—a Brajbhasha translation of the Sanskrit collection of fables, Hitopadeśa. Simultaneously, Hunter's own Urdu translation of the New Testament came out in a Nagari-script edition in 1805.20 
Indian critics have tended to dismiss the importance of Fort William College texts in the development of modern Hindi and Urdu literature. The Urdu literary historian Muhammad Sadiq has denied this importance altogether, asserting that 'Fort William College did not enter as a form ative factor in the development of modern Urdu prose' (Sadiq 1995: 291). Sisir Kumar Das, while also judging the impact of the texts produced at the college as being of little consequence, has nevertheless underlined their importance in the development of book printing in Indian languages (Das 1978: 79). Arguably, the initial impact of Fort William College publications was limited, the texts being designed for a non-Indian audi ence and at first hardly read outside the college. Yet it must not be over looked that works such as Lalluji's Premsāgar, Mir Amman's Bāgh o bahār, and Maulvi Ikram Ali's Urdu version of Ikhwan al-safā (1811) subsequently gained immense popularity among Indian readers and, even if somewhat belatedly, came to figure among the most frequently reprinted works in the nineteenth century 21 As Frances Pritchett has shown, narratives of the qişşa genre-Qissa-e Hātim Tā'i, Simhāsan battisī, Baitāl paccīsi—especially, were eagerly picked up by the mass publishing industry after 1850.22

From the book historian's perspective the importance of Fort William College in shaping the Hindi and Urdu book is incontestable. Ata more technical level, the Hindustani Department's effort to standardize printed texts made a lasting impact on Indian literary practices in introducing principles of Western typography. The most important innovation was the use of punctuation marks. Other momentous changes in Indian writing systems were the insertion of spaces between words and indents to mark paragraphs. Although it would take some time for these innovations to be more widely adopted in Hindi and Urdu printing, Fort William College books provided the first model of a standardized system of arranging printed texts. 
The early missionary, government, and European-run private or com mercial presses played a key role in providing the impetus and opportunity for Indian participation in the arts of printing and publishing.?? While owned and controlled by Europeans, these presses were usually operated by Indians. In giving training to local pressmen, compositors, and binders, they functioned as important multiplicators in spreading knowledge of printing technology. The early decades of the century were thus marked by a printing trade that was already heavily dependent on an Indian workforce and Indian expertise. By contrast, Indian ownership of presses was still scarce. Up until the 1820s press proprietorship remained by and large confined to Europeans. Of course there were famous excep tions—such as the enterprising South Indian Raja of Tanjore, Serfoji II, who possessed both the means and the intellectual curiosity to set up his own typographic press. It was first used for printing Sanskrit and Marathi works in 1805 (Shaw 1997). Around 1810 the Nizam of Hyderabad ac quired a press as a 'curiosity of western technology', but apparently never used it (EI 6: 806). The first North Indian ruler to take an active interest in the new technology was Ghaziuddin Haidar of Avadh, who had a typographic press installed in Lucknow in 1817. 
Previously, Fardunji Marzban, a learned traditional mullah from Surat and member of the affluent Parsi trading community of Bombay, had founded the first Indian-owned commercial press in western India in 1812. Marzban apparently began his career in books as a caretaker 
years for the Bāgh o bahār to acquire sufficient popularity to warrant publication in the Urdu homeland. In Lucknow, the text was initially made the target of much ridicule on account of its very simple prose style. However, during the period 1850– 79 it saw twenty-three different editions in the Urdu-speaking region and also appeared in several Nagari versions (Russell 1992: 84; 263).

working in a compatriot's bookstore. Yet it was protits made from trading which allowed him to set up on his own as the first Gujarati publisher (Naregal 2001: 177-8). If Indians of humbler means and origin entered the realm of print at the time, it was usually owing to government patron age. Baburam, the pioneer among Indian printer-publishers in Calcutta, is a case in point. A Bengali Brahmin from Mirzapur. Baburam became associated with the Sanskrit Department of Fort William College. At the behest of the department's head, Henry T. Colebrooke, he opened the Sanskrit Press in 1807. becoming the city's first Indian press proprietor (Kopf 1969: 118). Under the patronage ofthe college, Baburam produced a substantial number of books in Sanskrit, Bengali, and Hindi. He was the first to print two of the most frequently reproduced Hinditexts, notably Lalluji Lal's Premsāgar (1810) in its first complete edition, and Tulsidas's Rāmāyan (1811), in an edition prepared by Sadal Mishra. Backed by Fort William College, Baburam did brisk business and within a few years amassed a fortune estimated at Rs 400,000 (Diehl 1964: 71). Around 1815 he sold the Sanskrit Press to Lalluji Lal. Lalluji, whose role as a publisher has been eclipsed by his literary activities as bhākha munshi in the college's Hindustani Department, continued to print texts prepared by himself and other munshis for the use of the college, while also undertaking some publishing on his own. One of the first texts of old Hindi literature issued from his press in 1815 was Vinavapatrikā (The Petition to Ram), a devotional classic by Tulsidas. Lalluji remained active ly engaged in the printing trade until the time of his retirement in 1824, when he had his press transferred to his native town, Agra. No imprints are recorded from the Sanskrit Press after 1824. In fact, it is extremely doubtful whether Lalluji ever had a chance to operate from Agra, for he died the year after. 
By the 1820s Hindi and Urdu printing in Calcutta was coming into its own. Simultaneously, the first Indian-owned newspapers began to appear in the city. In 1822 Rammohan Roy (1774–1833) issued his celebrated Persian weekly Mirāt al-Akhbār, while another Bengali, Harihar Datt, launched the first Urdu paper, Jām-e Jahān Numā. Datt was no novice in journalism: he had previously served as editor to Sambād Kaumudi, a Bengali weekly established by his father Tarachand Datt. The chequered career of Jām-e Jahān Numā—which went from an Urdu to a biglot Pers ian-Urdu publication, was then temporarily published in separate Urdu 
24 Apparently Lalluji employed one Gurudas Pal as printer at the Sanskrit Press. The books issued from his press were sold by various Calcutta booksellers (Nair 1990: 47).

and Persian versions, and finally ended up as a Persian paper with an Urdu supplement-illustrates the still limited acceptance of Urdu as a language of journalistic prose writing. With no more than nine Indians among its twenty-six subscribers (1828), the paper catered largely for a European readership in both content and style. Rather than its high quality and the able editorship of Munshi Sadasukh Lal, it was government support to which Jām-e Jahān Numă owed its survival. No sooner was the support withdrawn than the Urdu supplement of the paper ceased publication.25 The Udant Mārtand or 'Rising Sun', the first Hindi paper appearing in Calcutta in 1826, did not fare any better. Its proprietor editor, Pandit Jugal Kishore, a native of Kanpur and proceedings reader at the chief civil court of Calcutta, had clearly overrated the support that his target audience, the affluent community of Upper Indian businessmen settled in Calcutta, was willing to lend to the paper. His attempt tocirculate the paper in the Hindi region was equally unsuccessful, with the Govern ment refusing to support the paper through postal concessions. After a struggle of one and a half years to keep Udant Mārtand alive, Jugal Kishore ended up bankrupt, with his property seized. All that remained was for him to express frustration over the lack of reader support in one of his last editorials: 
Sudras serve and perform menial work, they have nothing to do with reading and writing. The Kāyasths learn Persian and Urdu and the group of Vaisyas, after learning the alphabet, write account books, the Khatris sell cloth, they do not read or write and Brahmins assuming the form of “Kaliyugi Brah mans” have given up their studies. Who then should [buy and read a Hindi newspaper? (Cited in Vedalankar 1969: 179) 
Clearly, there existed no readership at the time to sustain periodical publications in Hindi or Urdu. By contrast, book publishing in the North Indian languages was developing into a viable commercial activity. After 1816 Calcutta witnessed the rise of several commercial type printing offices run by Indians.27 Before long, printing no longer remained confined to the eastern metropolis but spread in a westward movement to the Doab region. Lalluji Lal's decision to ship his press to Agra in 1824 pro vides a nice image of the way in which Hindi and Urdu printing extended chiefly along the Ganges into north and north-western India. This process

was set in motion and much encouraged by the introduction of a new printing technique in the early 1820s—lithography, or drawing on stone. 
1.2 The Impact of Lithography 
The invention of lithography in the 1820s represents a watershed in the history of print in northern India. With its enormous impact on regional language printing, the introduction of the new technology would prove far more significant than the arrival of typography in the 1550s. Litho graphy was invented around 1798 by Alois Senefelder (1771-1834), a native of Prague residing in Munich. Within twenty years it was introduced into England and France. Even though it became widely accepted, lithography remained a subsidiary method of book printing in Europe, to be employed mostly for reproducing works of music and art (Scheglova 1999: 12). By contrast, the new technique met with immediate and over whelming success in the subcontinent. Almost three times as many works were lithographed in India than in Europe during the period 1824-50 (Shaw 1998: 90). 
It was only three years after the reputed London publisher Rudolph Ackermann had issued an English translation of Senefelder's treatise A Complete Course in Lithography (1819) that the new printing technology was first practised in India with some success by two Calcutta-based French artists, Jean Jacques Belnos and Philippe de Savignhac. While the two Frenchmen produced specimens of lithographic engraving in 1822, the person generally credited with establishing lithography for purposes of book printing in India is James Nathaniel Rind, an assistant surgeon in the Bengal Medical Service. Returning from a period of sick leave in Scotland in 1822, Rind brought with him a lithographic press which was subsequently bought by the Bengal Government and officially established as the Government Lithographic Press on 1 April 1823. Soon afterwards, the Bombay Government followed suit, requesting six litho graphic presses to be imported from England in 1824.29 The new printing technique also attracted private investment and led to the establishment of the first commercial lithographic presses in the Presidency capi tals. In 1823 Rind's former partner George Wood opened the Asiatic 
28 Senefelder's original Vollständiges Lehrbuch der Steindruckerey first came out from Munich and Vienna in 1818. The following section is largely based on Shaw 1998, who gives a detailed account of the French connection and the early phase of lithography in Calcutta; see also Cook 1989; Losty 1989. 
29 Shaw 1998: 94–9; on the early use of lithography in Bombay, see also Shaw 1989.46 
An Empire of Books 
Lithographic Company's Press; similar firms followed in Bombay and Madras in 1826–7. Wood's press is important in several respects: unlike the government presses, which were primarily interested in the usefulness of lithography for reproducing maps (Cook 1989), it concentrated on the pictorial use of lithography. It was also the first to exploit in book form the versatility of lithography in reproducing the naskh and nustarliq scripts, leaving a profound impact on the subsequent use of lithography by Indian printers.30 The first Indian-run lithographic press in Calcutta was opened in 1830 by the Muslim Faiz Ali (Shaw 1998: 110–11). 
Meanwhile, in 1826 the first upcountry lithographic press had been set up at Patna (Bihar) by the East India Company servant and amateur artist Sir Charles D'Oyly. From his press, later known as the Behar Amateur Lithographic Press, D'Oyly published a number of famous books of drawings (Losty 1989). In 1830 the Asiatic Lithographic Com pany's Press opened a branch in Kanpur and put it under the charge of Henry Archer. Archer, however, was soon to move on to Lucknow where, at the behest of the Nawab of Avadh, he established the city's first lithographic press in the same year. 
Within a decade lithography thus spread from Calcutta right across Upper India. A crucial yet hardly explored corollary of this process was the shift to private Indian ownership of printing presses. Besides the Nawab of Avadh, one of the first Indians to own a lithographic press in the upper Gangetic region was Munshi Wajid Ali Khan, who had left Hooghly in search of new opportunities and set up a newspaper press in Agra in 1833. It was not before the late 1830s that Indian press ownership became widespread in northern India. While inextricably linked to the advance of the new printing technology, the process was much enhanced by colonial legislation, notably the removal of earlier restrictive press and print laws through the liberal Metcalfe Act of 1835. 
The advantages of lithography over printing from movable type were considerable: lithography was portable, easy to operate, and cost-effect ive; it allowed for faster reproduction and involved fewer material costs. Unlike type-printing, it did not involve expensive and sophisticated equipment, nor did it require a high level of expertise to master. It allowed even small-scale printers to simultaneously produce works in several languages, a fact of much consequence in the multilingual setting of nineteenth-century India. The low cost factor permitted many an enter prising Indian to set up his own shop. Moreover, lithography lent itself 
30 See Shaw 1998: 102-4 for the origin and contribution of the Asiatic Lithographic Company's Press. 
The Coming of the Book in Hindi and Urdu 
47 
particularly well to the reproduction of the aesthetically prestigious nastaliq script; it was thus ideal for printing in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu. In this respect. it continued the manuscript tradition, a crucial cul tural factor in its widespread acceptance across the subcontinent. The observations made by Ulrich Marzolph on the success of lithography in Iran are equally important in the North Indian context: 
Lithography offered itself as the logical continuation of manuscript pro duction. This evaluation is, moreover, substantiated by what one may assume was the determined opposition of professional scribes to the technique of typography. While printing from movable type must have been perceived by them to gravely menace the eminent position of their traditional profes sion, lithography allowed for a smooth continuation of previous modes of book production while maintaining aesthetic standards and ensuring emp loyment for the artists involved. Lithography even contributed positively to keeping the tradition of calligraphy alive, for it made written texts more accessible, thereby widening the circle of readership and stimulating 
demand. (Marzolph 2001: 15) Scholars of South Asian print culture, too, have emphasized the fact that lithography drew much of its cultural authority from its visible proximity to the manuscript tradition. Lithography, as Graham Shaw puts it, allowed for the 'mass-produced manuscript'; it was 'in essence, a link with the past. It combined the cultural attributes of the manuscript with the tech nical advantages of mass-production' (Shaw 1994: n.p.). The cultural factor was to play an important part in the adoption of print by Indian Muslims (Robinson 1996). 
From a technical, economic, and cultural point of view, the new printing technology encouraged the emergence of autodidact printers. Litho graphy, in short, made 'Every Man his Own Printer', as the title of a con temporary English manual had it. 32 Hence the enthusiastic response it met throughout northern India. It was with the spread of lithography from Calcutta to the urban centres in the north-west-Patna, Benares, 
31 The spread of lithography in Iran, where it had been introduced by way of Russia, took place almost simultaneously with developments in India. The new technology became known in Iranian cities from the mid-1820s, the first known lithographed item being a Qur'an produced at Tabriz in 1832-3 (Marzolph 2001: 13). However, Indian publishers soon surpassed Iranians in exploiting lithography for commercial printing, as suggested by the large holdings of nineteenth-century litho graphed books from India in Iranian libraries. 
32 The wide appeal of lithography is also reflected in a title like W. Abraham's Lithography in India. Being a few practical hints for the Indian amateur (Bombay 1864).

Allahabad, Lucknow, Kanpur, Delhi, Agra, Meerut, and Lahore and the concomitant rise of numerous, if mostly small-scale, indigenous presses that printing in Hindi and Urdu really took off. The importance of lithography as a prerequisite for widespread Indian participation in the book trade and the development of regional language publishing cannot be overstated. Ultimately, it played a large part in the process of 'democratizing print in South Asia (Shaw 1998: 89)." 
An immediate effect of the mushrooming of Indian-owned presses in the NWP&Oudh was the flourishing of the Urdu press. Unlike Calcutta, where commercial presses survived on an existing demand for books, the first phase of printing in North India was characterized by a prevalence of newspaper presses.34 Their emergence was much enhanced by the substitution of Urdu for Persian as a court and administrative language in 1837. In 1848 Marshman reported the existence of 17 lithographic presses in the NWP, which issued at least the same number of newspapers and periodicals.35 By 1850 their number had risen to over 23, and 26 Urdu journals were said to exist (LLH 1850:2).36 While Urdu journalism flourished, the Hindi press only made its appearance in the Hindi heartland in 1845, with the Banāras Akhbār, and did not successfully establish itself until a quarter of a century later when Bharatendu Harishchandra launched his Kavivacansudhā (1868) and Hariscandra-candrikā (1874). The retarded growth of early Hindi journalism has been well documented and does not need further elaboration here. It is important to note, however, that Indian printer-publishers made numerous, if mostly abortive, attempts to establish Hindi journals right from the late 1840s. 
3 Orsini posits a hierarchy between typeset and lithographed Hindi books, stating that high-print-run government publications or books for wealthy patrons were printed (typeset), while books published on a smaller scale or issued by small commercial printers were lithographed (Orsini 2004: 437). While small printers could indeed hardly afford the high investment in typesetting machinery, my own probings into NKP Hindi imprints do not endorse her view. 
34 Ghosh relates the flourishing of the early Bengali book market to the strong tradition and popularity of manuscript writing in Bengal: "To be economically viable ... the safest item for the earliest commercial printers to publish was a book. The new vernacular presses simply built upon this existing relationship’ (Ghosh 1998: 177). In 1878-9 only 26 papers were published in Bengal, as opposed to 591 in the NWP&Oudh (Gupta 2001: 269). 
35 Friend of India of 23 November 1848, cited in Vedalankar 1969: 183. Of the 19 newspapers in circulation in the NWP in 1848, five were in Persian, eleven in Urdu, and three in Hindi. 
30 In light of recent research findings, such estimates seem far too low and should be read with care.

At first, commercial printing and publishing in North India was largely confined to the urban sphere. Were is not for the exhaustive surveys compiled by Indian scholars, little would be known about indigenous enterprise in the printing business during the period 1830–57. As already noted, the history of early Hindi printing is very poorly documented and would be almost impossible to reconstruct but for the information con tained in Urdu-language sources. As it is, determining the date of estab lishment or the lifespan of an Indian press is often quite difficult, with extant sources tending to give contradictory information. As a result, even an important landmark such as the date and place of publication of the first Hindi literary text printed in the Hindi heartland cannot be established with certainty. There is some agreement that the credit goes to a Tulsidas Rāmavan issued from the Asiatic Lithographic Company's Press in Kanpur in 1832.7 This press has also been credited with printing the first Urdu book in the Urdu-speaking region, an edition of Būgh-o bahār dating from the same year (Ahmad 1985: 139). 
The following overview will sketch the growth of regional-language printing up until 1857 by looking at three principal sites of early book production in the Hindi-Urdu region: Agra, Lucknow, and Benares. While all three cities provide excellent illustrations of the nature and dynamics of this growth, each has its own distinguishing features. A fourth important centre of print in the region, the former Mughal capital of Delhi, has al ready been well researched for the period under review and is not therefore considered here. However, we will revert to Delhi later, when exploring the social and professional background of some eminent pioneers of print in the NWP.

Singh 1986: 43, 55).

importance in the early nineteenth century when, following the British annexation in 1803, it became the seat of the NWP provincial government and location of the Sadr Divāni Adalar (Superior Revenue Court). From the 1830s onwards Agra was the site of intense missionary activity on the part of the American Presbyterian Mission and the Church Missionary Society (Powell 1993). Book printing was at first monopolied by the Agra School Book Society which, soon after its establishment in 1835, set up a printing press to engage in the production of missionary and educational works. The press could hardly keep pace with the rapidly increasing demand for textbooks in the provinces. After 1840 it was supported by the famous Secundra (Sikandra) Orphanage Press, estab lished by the society's director W. Greenway and subsequently run by Rudolf Hoernle. The Orphanage Press was a flourishing business operat ing six typographic and six lithographic presses. By 1845 it had distributed over 5,000 copies of Christian religious literature and a total of 16.000 copies of educational tracts in Hindi and Urdu. It also served as an im portant training institution to Indian printers, employing over fifty young men as apprentices or pressmen (Long 1848: 53-60). Meanwhile, the Agra Government had judged it expedient to no longer leave printing to missionaries, and set up its own press. Official printing in the city receiv ed much stimulus in the late 1840s, when Lieutenant Governor James Thomason introduced his pioneering schemes of mass primary education, directing his attention towards the establishment of vernacular schools and the production of elementary textbooks. A substantial amount of educational printing was undertaken at the Agra jail, whose prisoners 'were not only taught to read and write, but ... worked some thirty or forty presses in the Jail itself, supplying Hindi and Urdu books by tens of thousands' (Long 1859: Ixiii). Agra remained the main centre of offi cial educational printing up to the 1850s, supplying the NWP with large numbers of English and vernacular textbooks. Implied in textbook production was a massive translation venture, in which textbook know ledge from English and other language sources was transferred into Hindi and Urdu. Since the scheme relied heavily on the mediation of Indian translators, these early textbooks constitute an important site of the discursive encounter between colonial empiricism, with its under lying concept of 'useful knowledge'-and Indian learning and literary forms. 39

The Coming of the Book in Hindi and Urdu

If the early Indian-owned presses in Agra were overshadowed by the overwhelming presence of missionary and official printing, they also profited from the latter. Job printing became an important source of in come for the first local Indian print shops which, without exception, had started out as newspaper presses. Since the publication of a daily news paper was not yet a commercially viable undertaking, the standard format adopted was that of a weekly. Even these weeklies, consisting of no more than a couple of handwritten and lithographed sheets, had few subscribers and depended heavily on government support and the patronage of Indian rulers for their survival. Zubdar al-Akhbar, a Persian paper issued from Agra's first privately owned printing press in 1833, was subsidized by five Indian rulers and a rich local merchant. On the strength of local patronage and under the able editorship of its proprietor Maulvi Wajid Ali Khan, the paper flourished; its circulation of 157 copies in 1848 was the second highest among newspapers in the NWP and the Punjab. By contrast, only two books are recorded as having been issued from the Zubdat al-Akhbar Press between 1833 and 1853. Both were authored by Wajid Ali Khan, who reportedly hoped to realize a gain of Rs 3500 from their sales. The first, Matla' al-culum va majma al funūn (1848), was a Persian encyclopaedia of the arts and sciences.' 
The second, Guldasta-e anjuman, was an Urdu grammar. Of the 250 copies printed in 1848, only 100 had been sold by the end of 1851 (Siddiqi 1962: 143-5). 
Wajid Ali Khan's Zubdat al-Akhbar served as an important model for the emerging Urdu press at Agra. Much of the news it carried was reprinted in As'ad al-Akhbār, one of Agra's first Urdu papers, owned by Munshi Qamaruddin Khan, an erstwhile munshi of the German Pietist Missionary Karl Hermann Pfander.+1 His As'ad al-Akhbar Press (est. 1847) is typical of the approximately sixteen lithographic presses operated by Indians in Agra before 1857: initially centred around a newspaper, it made book printing an increasingly important additional business. Its first publication in book form, a pocket edition of the Qur'an with an Urdu translation, came out in 1848. Although heavily priced at Rs 8, it realized over Rs 3250 in sales proceeds. Of the six books printed in 1849, five were Government or private commissions, the only press publication being an edition of Sa'di's Gulistān. That Qamaruddin is

recorded to have printed books' worth more than Rs 11.000 in 1850 is due to the printing of maps and official forms for the government. The yearly output of the press hardly ever exceeded ten titles, consisting mainly of Persian classics, religious or educational tracts in Persian or Urdu, qissas and small prayer books in Urdu and, infrequently, Sanskrit. The first Hindi publication in 1851, printed in 350 copies, was an edition of Tulsidas's Rāmāyan. Qamaruddin's perhaps most noteworthy publication of contemporary poetry, duly advertised in As'ad al-Akhbar, was the Persian Divān (1848) of Munshi Hargopal "Tufta', a prominent pupil and associate of Mirza Ghalib (Siddiqi 1962: 147-53). 
With its allure of government job work, by the 1850s Agra had become an increasingly attractive venue for Indian printer-publishers. Among those who were drawn to Agra was Babu Shivchandar Nath, the Bengali owner of the Jam-e Jamshed Press at Meerut. From there he had suc cessfully issued Jām-e Jamshed, an Urdu weekly that enjoyed a circul ation of over 100 copies. Upon his arrival in Agra in 1850, he secured a large government contract for textbook printing from Henry Stuart Reid, the new Visitor General of Schools in the provinces, allowing him to invest in some book publishing on his own. Shivchandar Nath's case exemplifies the risks implied in the heavy dependence of Indian printers on government patronage: in 1851 he derived most of his income from official contract work for textbook printing. When the contract was with drawn in the following year, the number of books issued from his press dropped dramatically to only two items, one an Urdu almanac, the other an illustrated Hindi Rāmāyan. While official patronage had accounted for his initial success, it also proved to be his ruin. In 1853 the Jam-e Jamshed Press was closed down (Siddiqi 1962: 159-61). 
Official patronage often not only determined whether or not a press survived, it also proved a crucial factor in allowing presses to extend their activities from newspaper-printing to book publishing. The Nur al Absar Press (est. 1852) of Munshi Sadasukh Lal is a case in point. Sadasukh Lal, a man well-versed in English, Hindi, and Urdu, was seem ingly Babu Shivchandar's successor in receiving the patronage of Henry Stuart Reid. Having been alloted a fair amount of job work, his press thrived on educational printing. On the strength of government patronage Sadasukh Lalalso maintained two weekly journals, Nür al-Absār (Urdu) and Buddhi Prakās (Hindi). Both were distributed to schools and colleges in the provinces. The extent of official support for these journals can easily be gauged from the fact ti each paper, while private subscriptions barely amounted to 40 and 
eri 
The Coming of the Book in Hindi and Urdu 
20 copies for the Urdu and Hindi versions respectively. Sadasukh Lal's papers were commended for their informative articles and their lucid style. Reid approvingly noted that, on his suggestion, the editor had filled his paper with interesting items of current news and was about to introduce articles on History, Geography. Vernacular and Female Edu cation' (cited in Vedalankar 1969: 186). Sadasukh Lal's career in pub lishing continued to rely on government patronage: in 1865 he was appointed Chief Government Translator and shifted the Nur al-Absar Press to Allahabad. 
Two more local presses thrived on official patronage. One was the Mufid-e Khala'iq Press (est. 1856) of Munshi Shivnarayan Aram', who is known to the Urdu world as a publisher and correspondent of Mirza Ghalib. Shivnarayan had won a contract for printing the Agra Government Gazette. His two weekly journals, Mufid-e Khalā'iq (Urdu) and Sarvo pakārak (Hindi), were heavily sustained by government subscriptions. The second was the Aftab-e Alimtab Press (est. 1857) of Munshi Ganesh Lal, editor of the twin journals Aftāb-e Alimtaband Surajprakās. Unlike most of Agra's smaller presses, the aforementioned businesses were strong enough to survive the uprising of 1857, and resumed operations in 1858. 
With the shift of the administrative capital to Allahabad and the estab lishment of a large government press there in 1858, Agra lost some of its former importance for official printing. Yet it seems, in a reversal of earlier circumstances, that it was precisely the absence of a government press and the decline of missionary activity in the city that opened up new avenues for an indigenous publishing industry to develop. It was only in the wake of 1857 that the city witnessed the dawn of non-edu cational book publishing. This is attested by the rise of some large Indian printing firms: besides Mirza Agha Ali's Ahmadi Press (est. 1864), the Mufid-e Am Press (est. 1869) run by Ahmad Khan Sufi was to gain spe cial importance for its paper Mufid-e Amm and its publications on Islamic literature, especially the reformist Ahl-e Hadis (Metcalf 1982: 204). 
Lucknow 
As the capital of an independent Indian state, with a flourishing intellectual and religious culture of its own and comparatively little direct colonial or missionary influence, Lucknow presents a markedly different case from Agra. While the impact of the British and European presence on the cultural concerns of the city has usually been dismissed as superficial,

Avril Powell attributes an unusual receptivity ... to Western contacts (Powell 1993: 56) to the Lucknow court. This is certainly true for new printing technology. Under the munificent patronage of the nawabs of Avadh, Lucknow saw the evolution of an eminent tradition of book print ing well before it became a major site of modern commercial publishing. The introduction of print in Lucknow goes back to Nawab Ghaziuddin Haidar (r. 1814–27) who, presumably in 1817, founded Lucknow's first typographic press, the Matba'-e Sultani or Royal Press. Rather than just one of the ruler's fancies, print technology can be seen as a logical continuation of the court's eminent patronage of scholarship and written culture, to which the magnificent royal library bore ample testimony. The Royal Press soon engaged in the production of scholarly and religious works. Among its first major imprints were Haftqulzum or Seven Seas', a Persian dictionary and grammar in seven volumes, compiled by the nawab's courtier Qabul Muhammad in 1820–2, as well as Taj al-lughāt, a dictionary of Arabic into Persian. While these early imprints are signi ficant in their own right, the real impetus to the development of a local print culture in Lucknow only came in 1830 with the advent of lithography. In this year the anglophile King Nasiruddin Haidar (r. 1827-37) invited Henry Archer, Superintendent of the Asiatic Lithographic Press at Kanpur, to shift his establishment to Lucknow. Archer readily complied, and in 1831 was able to present the king with what is presumably the earliest book lithographed in Lucknow, an Arabic commentary by al Suyuti entitled al-Bahjah al-Mardiyah (Sprenger 1954: vi; Ellis 1894: 62). 
Lithography in Lucknow did not remain confined to the royal court for long. From the late 1830s the new technology was taken up by private citizens. The strong impulse it provided to private and commercial enterprise is not only visible in the emergence of small-scale amateur presses but also in the establishment of some highly sophisticated and lucrative personal businesses. Very little is known about the background of the early printers of Lucknow and the extent to which the Royal Press played a part in their professional training. Nearly all of them were ashraf Muslims of considerable means and learning. Maulvi Muhammad Husain, the pioneer among Lucknow printer-publishers, was a noted Islamic scholar who generally went by the name of Haji Harmain Shari fain. In 1837 he set up the Muhammadi Press where he assembled some 
** The following paragraphs are largely based on Diehl 1973, Khan 1990: 305-25, and Khan 1991:294-355. According to Khan, the very first book printed in Lucknow in 1819 was Al-munāgab al-Haidariya, a praise of Ghaziuddin Haidar written in Arabic.

of the city's finest calligraphers, among them the famous Maulvi Hadi 
Ali who would later serve the NKP. In 1839 the city saw the establishment of its second principal press by Mustafa Khan, a rich glass merchant.** If Abdul Halim Sharar is to be believed, Haji Harmain Sharifain was not uninvolved in the rise of the Mustafa'i Press, which soon became his strongest competitor. The story, as told by Sharar, is that one day Mustafa Khan took some sheets to Haji Harmain Sharifain to be printed. The Haji was so rude to him that on returning home he decided to start his own press (Sharar 1975: 107). Born out of an impulse, the Mustafa'i Press quickly rose to fame as one of the finest lithographic presses in northern India. The quality and artistic excellence of its Arabic and Persian imprints were said to be unsurpassed in the entire subcontinent. Run by an ex perienced merchant, it was also the most commercially successful of the early Lucknow presses. 
The 1840s saw the emergence of two more presses operating on a larger commercial scale: the Alavi Press of Ali Bakhsh Khan and the Muhammadi Press of Wali Muhammad. Together, these four firms came to account for almost two-thirds of the city's total book production (Diehl 1973: 120). In addition, there was a proliferation of smaller businesses. Aloys Sprenger, who from 1848 to 1850 was in Lucknow to catalogue the collection of Arabic and Persian manuscripts in the king's libraries, reports the existence of twelve private lithographic presses at the time (Sprenger 1854: vi). Nadir Ali Khan lists over twenty newly founded presses for the period 1839-57 (Khan 1990: 311-17). 
Unlike other urban centres in the north-west, where early commercial printing revolved around newspapers, Lucknow printers, from the very outset, cultivated the art of the book. Headed by Mustafa Khan, they won fame for establishing an exquisite lithographic style distinctive of Lucknow. Causing the temporary abandonment of printing from movable type, lithography developed into an art in its own right. In its concern with aesthetics and its valorization of fine calligraphy, early book pro duction in the city clearly reveals the dual influence of navābi court cul ture and Islamic scribal traditions. As Sharar narrates: 
At first printing was not undertaken on a commercial basis but purely as a private pursuit. The finest quality paper, highly appropriate for lithography, was used and the best calligraphists were employed at high salaries. They were shown great favour without any stipulations as to working conditions or how much they wrote in a day or whether they wrote anything at all. In the same way the printers were never asked how many pages they had

An Empire of Books 
printed in a day. For the ink, thousands of lamps of mustard-oil were lighted to produce fine-quality lamp-black. Instead of acid, tine-skinned lemons were used and sponges took the place of cloth. In short, only the finest materials were employed. As a result, Persian and Arabic educational and religious books in the days of the monarchy could not have been printed anywhere else but in Lucknow, where they were produced irrespective of 
cost for discriminating eyes. (Sharar 1975: 107) As the example of Lucknow shows, lithography did not simply supersede the traditional method of manuscript writing. Rather, the two forms of book production coexisted for some time, with lithography drawing heavi ly on the manuscript tradition. Early lithographed books, whether in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu, or Sanskrit and Hindi, followed their respect ive manuscript traditions in the organization of their material as well as their textual, graphic, and artistic layout. At the same time, local practices did not remain untouched by the influence of European book-printing but underwent a gradual transformation, resulting in new graphic designs, formats, and arrangement of material. One of the more conspicuous in novations was the introduction of a separate title page and pagination (Scheglova 1999: 12-15). During the 1840s Lucknow printers developed a distinctive style of lithographic book format and title-page design that was visibly different from the style prevalent in Bombay and elsewhere. Its distinguishing feature, a horizontally oriented figure surrounded by an amply ornamented frame, would later be adopted by Naval Kishore for commercial book production (Scheglova 1999: 15). While orna mentation in these early books was usually in black and white, special hand-coloured copies were occasionally prepared on commission: an illustrated volume of Mir Amman's Bāgh o bahār, prepared for the Nawab of Rampur by the Murtazawi Press in 1843, had gold and colour on its pages. Even the uncoloured volumes of the edition were an object of pride for its editor, who praised the novelty of having a title page in white letters and stories printed in bold letters, 'looking like a garden with beds of flowers here and there' (Diehl 1973: 123-4). 
The year 1849 saw a curious incident in Lucknow's printing history, when Wajid Ali Shah (r. 1847-56) ordered all presses in the city, includ ing the Royal Press, to be shut down. This followed the publication by the Royal Press of a laudatory history of the royal family by Kamaluddin Haidar, a courtier and clerk at the Royal Observatory. The king's anger had presumably been incurred by the author's referral to an incident relating to Lord Hardinge's visit to Lucknow in 1847, when Wajid Ali Shah was required to wear English patent leather shoes to receive the

Englishman (Pemble 1979: 9). Local printers were badly affected by the king's drastic measure and were forced to move their establishments to the nearby town of Kanpur. Some of the more influential businessmen were able to defy royal orders and only shifted part of their presses to Kanpur (Diehl 1973: 118; Sprenger 1854: vi). When a few months later the ban was lifted and printing in the city resumed, it was under severe restrictions: the presses were only allowed to function under royal control; every published book had to bear the seal of the manager of the Royal Press (Khan 1991: 297). In the wake of the events of 1849. Lucknow lost two of its oldest and most renowned presses, the Muhammadi Press and Mustafa'i Press. Mustafa Khan, while maintaining his Kanpur branch, temporarily returned to Lucknow, only to shift his establishment to Delhi soon afterwards. By 1853 he was widely acknowledged as a large book dealer who commanded several sales agencies and whose books were 'in demand in innumerable circles' (cited in Khan 1991: 122). Another important consequence of Mustafa Khan's temporary shift to Kanpur was the rise of Kanpur's foremost commercial press, the Nizami Press. At Mustafa Khan's instance, his cousin, Maulvi Abdul Rahman Shakir, had joined him in Kanpur and temporarily served at the Mustafa'i Press before he set up on his own in 1854. His Nizami Press quickly rose to prominence, producing more books than any other NWP press during the pre-1857 period. In attracting a large number of scholars and literati, it also anticipated the future role of Naval Kishore's press as an intel lectual meeting place. 14 
The title pages of Lucknow or Kanpur imprints dating from 1849 to 1854 usually failed to state their place of publication, making their exact 
total number of books issued from both cities at c. 700 titles. Mustafa Khan alone published an impressive eighty works in 1853.45 Sprenger did not fail to note that this spate of printed books had introduced far reaching changes in both literary practice and religious education: 
Some of the books) have gone through more than ten editions. The books most in request are of course school books and such other dialectical and religious tracts as every Mawlawy reads or pretends to read. But we already observe symptoms that the press is enlarging the narrow cycle of learning, and what is more important, that it extends education to all classes and even

to ladies. Twenty years ago verses of the Quran were repeated as prayers and charms, and even the whole book was learned by heart, but without be ing understood, and the Sunnah was almost unknown: in our days people are gradually beginning to study the book, and I shall have to describe several commentaries on it in Arabic, Persian and Hindustany which have lately been published... After the Musalmans had several centuries ago, entirely lost sight of the original idea of their religion, they are now beginning to make their sacred books intelligible to all. This must lead to results ana logous to those which the translation and study of the Bible produced in Europe. (Sprenger 1854; vi-vii) 
Sprenger also commented on how print was giving rise to new textual genres and expanding the readership. Most remarkable was the rapid increase of 'periodical and light literature, including tales and religious works 'written expressly for ladies'. As he put it: Though the new lite rature which is rising has not much intrinsic value, things are progressing as rapidly and as healthily as they did in Europe, when the art of printing came first into vogue. The tendency is oriental and Mohammadan, but already a spirit of liberality is manifesting itself, which is the natural result of progress from school-learning and court refinement to a general civilization' (ibid.: vi-vii). 
Yet for the early Lucknow publishing trade the period 1849-56 was not free of difficulties. The effects of the strict censorship in operation are most clearly visible from the absence of printed newspapers. These made a relatively late appearance, only with the British annexation of Avadh in 1856: no sooner had the reign of the Nawabs come to an end than at least seven Urdu papers were launched in Lucknow within a year. 46 Local journalism had only just made a promising start when the outbreak of the Mutiny' brought all efforts to an abrupt end. Its effects on Lucknow's early print industry were devastating. Only a few busines ses-the Asafi Press of Beni Prasad, the Alavi Press of Ali Bakhsh Khan, the Gulshan-e Mohammadi Press of Masahib Ali and the Samar e Hind Press of Pandit Baijnath-survived and resumed work after some time. Over a decade later, the number of printing presses operating in post-1857 Lucknow was still no more than fifteen.47 
46 See Khan 1991:294–355 for a detailed account of early Lucknow papers. Khan and others mention an early Lakhnau Akhbar, edited by the company chronicler Lalji in 1847. Presumably it was a handwritten newspaper in the akhbūrāt style.

When, in the aftermath of 1857, the British started to grant licences to indigenous printers again, the first licence was given not to a local printer but to a young outsider who, significantly, was at once of Hindu origin and a newcomer to the city. The choice was to prove an apt one, for Munshi Naval Kishore would use the unique opportunity given to him to revolutionize the Lucknow book trade. Under British patronage he not only reintroduced typography and set commercial publishing in Arabic. Persian, and Urdu on a new footing; he also established Sanskrit and Hindi printing in the great center of Indo-Persian and Urdu culture. 
Benares 
Whereas pre-1857 Agra remained dominated by a strong Christian mis sionary presence and official publishing. Benares provides a classic example of how intimately Indian press ownership and the emergence of a local print culture were linked to the spread of lithography. The early printing shops that sprang up in the city from the mid-1840s were with out exception lithographic presses. With its religious and economic importance as a pilgrimage site, excellence in Hindu scholarship, well established patronage structures, and vibrant cultural life, Benares was predestined to become a centre of print in Sanskrit and Hindi, the langu ages associated with Hindu culture. It was indeed the first North Indian city to gain importance in non-educational Sanskrit and Hindi publishing. However, even in Benares it would take some time for a full-fledged Hindi print culture to develop. Although a medium of primary education, Hindi was still devoid of an official function and had not yet been assigned its future role as a vehicle of Hindu nationalism and revivalism. It would thus be wrong to assume that any of the commercial presses in pre-1857 Benares survived on Hindi printing alone. In fact none of them justly deserve to be called a 'Hindi press',for, much as in Agra, business was sustained by publishing government-sponsored journals in Urdu and Hindi, while the bulk of book printing was still undertaken in Persian and Urdu. As it was, the early printers of Benares struggled hard to make a living. 
While there is some evidence suggesting the existence of printing presses in the city before 1840, up to the mid-1840s most print ventures 
Kaliparshad's Press, Nasim Lucknow Press, Anjuman Press, and Sehr-e Samri Press (OAR, 1869-70: 145).

initiated at Benares were executed in Calcutta. For instance, the famous Brajbhasha Mahābhārai, prepared under the aegis of the Maharaja of Benares, was printed at the Calcutta-based Shastra Prakash Press in 1829-30. The earliest Indian-owned press of Benares on which reliable information is available is the Benares Akhbar Press.opened in 1844 by the Maharashtrian Brahmin Govind Raghunath Thatte. Thatte's pressis best known for launching the Banāras Akhbar, which is generally held to be the first Hindi or, correctly speaking, Nagari-Script paper its style was clearly Urdu) in the Hindi region. The paper was contined to local news, while also carrying serialized translations from Sanskritlaw books. It was heavily patronized by the Raja of Nepal. Thatte's second paper. the Urdu weekly Benares Gazelle, enjoyed higher subscriptions than the Banāras Akhbār but suffered from being poorly lithographed (to the ex tent that it was often barely legible) as well as from its editor's aggressive polemic against Christian missionaries. Following a case of libelin 1853 publication of the Benares Gazelle was suspended. In the present con text, Thatte assumes importance as the first Benares publisher to issue a substantial number of books in Persian and Urdu, as well as some Hindi titles. Moreover, he was the city's first large commercial publisher of Sanskrit books. Despite its sizeable output, the Benares Akhbar Press (probably as a result of the libel case) was closed down in 1854. Thatte with a resilience characteristic of early professionals in the book trade joined the establishment of a compatriot. 
The second important press of Benares was the Sudhakar Press (est 1847), run by Pandit Rataneshwar Tivari, proprietor of the weekly Sudhākar. The paper, which drew its readership primarily from among the city's educated Hindus, opposed the language policy of the Banāras Akhbar and instead advocated chaste Sanskritized Hindi. 50 Its difficult and highly Sanskritized style, however, did not go down well even with Banarasi Hindus.

It is said to have circulated 25,000 copies of vernacular tracts by 1836 (Vedalankar 1969: 106). Krishnacarya (1966) lists two early Hindi titles, namely the Mānasdipikā, a famous commentary on Tulsidas allegedly printed in 1835, and a work called Harirās by one Udaykarn, printed in 1840. However, he does not give printers' names.

prompted a change in language policy and the introduction of a bilingual news column in Hindi and Urdu. The attempt was of no avail, the number of subscribers dipping even further (Siddiqi 1962: 83). It was only when the government came to the paper's rescue in 1852 that Sudhakar was able to survive, this time in a fortnightly format and with articles on scientific, educational, and literary subjects as a new feature. Given its precarious financial situation, the Sudhakar Press was hardly able to invest in book publishing. The few Hindi and Sanskrit books it issued after 1851 were nearly all commissioned by the Maharaja of Benares, whose patronage was an all-important force in the early development of a local print culture. 51 
Among the more successful print entrepreneurs of Benares was the Bengali Brahmin Kashidas Mitra, proprietor of the Kashi Press (est. 1851) and Kāsī Yātrā Patrikā, presumably the only Bengali paper pub lished outside Bengal at the time. Catering to the city's sizeable Bengali community, the paper flourished. Its circulation rose from 92 to 130 copies within a year. Even more successful was its Urdu counterpart, Aftāb-e Hind, which came to enjoy the longest life among the early regio nal-language papers of Benares. If the Kashi Press fared better than most other local presses, it was because it operated along sound commer cial lines. The way in which Kashidas advertised his services in Aftāb e Hind suggests a keen sense of competitive marketing. The paper announced that anyone wanting a book or map printed in Bengali, Persian, Nagari, or English could get it done at the Kashi Press 'on more eco nomical terms than in other printing houses' (cited in Khan 1991: 220). 
The Kashi Press was the exception rather than the rule. A more typical illustration of the fate met by most early Benares presses is provided by the short-lived Bagh-o-Bahar Press (est. 1848), which was run jointly by Babu Kedarnath Ghosh and Kali Prasad. Having failed to establish Mirāt al-Ulūm, a monthly periodical that did not see more than three issues, the two men launched Bāgh-o-Bahār. It lived somewhat longer but in 1853 also had to be discontinued. Given its tight budget the Bagh-0 Bahar Press would not have survived even to that point had it not been for job work executed for the government and occasional commissioning by the Maharaja of Benares. In 1851 Kedarnath Ghosh announced that, due to want of purchasers, the small amount of book publishing undertaken at his press would have to be abandoned. Two years later the

An Empire of Books 
press was closed down. Meanwhile, the editor of the short-lived Mirar al-Ulūm, Harivamshlal (Harbanslal), had tried his luck in establishing a printing press of his own, the Mufad-e Hind Press (est. 1850). Again. his efforts were not met by much success. His paper Za'irin-e Hind lost half its Indian subscribers after a year and began to depend solely on European subscriptions. It seems that Harivamshlal was forced to tempo rarily suspend operations in 1853. However, he showed much resilience and is reported to have still been running a press, possibly under a different name, in 1863.52 
The case of Benares illustrates the limitations imposed on the early development of commercial print culture by the small size and purchasing 
publishers was not to set up business but to remain in business. To launch a paper was relatively easy, to sustain it a much more difficult task. Frequent editorial complaints about defaulting subscribers and the general indifference of the Indian readership testify to the endless prob lems that raising subscriptions and sustaining sales caused. 
If newspapers, in Khan's view, were the chief victims of poverty and economic depression (Khan 1991: 220), books fared even worse. For the average urban middle-class reader in the 1840s and 1850s the printed book was still an expensive commodity. In times of economic distress it was a luxury that could easily be foregone. As the example of Agra and Benares shows, few early commercial presses survived on book printing alone; instead, business was usually sustained by newspaper publishing. The Gulzar-e Hamesha Bahar Press (est. 1849) is another interesting example. Its proprietor, Virsingh Khatri, a scholar of local repute, had planned to set up a press with shareholders' money but found no support for his project. Undeterred, he set up shop on his own, making an im pressive debut with sixteen different titles in Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi, and Urdu in 1849. His ambitions were thwarted when it turned out that his books sold very poorly and profits from sales in no way met production costs (Table 1.0). Virsingh complained—to no avail—that the public showed no appreciation of their learned compatriots' efforts to dis seminate knowledge and information through print. In the following year his business was dissolved (Siddiqi 1962: 175-6). 
52 Several publications from the press of Harivamshlal' are listed in Krishnacarya and in official reports of 1862-3. In 1874 Harbanslal resurfaces as the manager of Pandit Gopinath Pathak's famous Benares Light Press (QLP, NWP 1874, fourth quarter).

According to official sources, prior to 1857 no less than five newspaper and eighteen other presses were operating in Benares.53 As we have seen, information is largely confined to the former, while there is precious little documentary evidence on the early book-producing presses. For the time being, printing shops such as the Hariprakash Press, Ganesh Press, Divakar Press, and Kedarnath Prabhakar Press must remain mere names to us. 
Since the impact of the 1857 uprising in Benares was less disruptive than elsewhere, a considerable number of the city's presses were able to resume work in 1858. During the following decades, the development of

book publishing into a viable commercial activity was accompanied by the rise of several large printing and publishing firms. By far the most influential establishments were the type press founded in 1857 by the British medical doctor E.J. Lazarus, known as Medical Hall Press or E. J. Lazarus & Co. Press, and the Benares Light Press set up in 1860 by Pandit Gopinath Pathak. Later, the Candraprabha Press(est. 1882?) run by Pandit Lakshmishankar Mishra, and the Bharat Jivan Press(est. 1885) run by Ramkrishna Varma were to gain special importance in Hindi and Sanskrit publishing. 54 
The preceding overview of three early centres of print in the NWP and in Avadh underscores the importance of localization in the study of Indian print culture. The emerging local print cultures of Agra, navābi Lucknow, and Benares were shaped by markedly different circumstances and featured different actors. Yet some important common denominators can be identified: prior to 1857 the number of viable and large-sized Indian publishing firms operating in North India was decidedly small. A large share of the book production in Hindi and Urdu still occurred out side the commercial market under missionary or colonial agency. A fair amount of book publishing was initiated and patronized by Indian rulers and nobles. The marketplace alone was not yet a force significant enough to sustain commercial publishing. A second point to note is that, being dominated by Persian and Urdu publications, the commercial book trade reflected official language use. With the exception of the occasional almanac, no Hindi imprints are recorded from Lucknow before 1857, while the number of non-educational Hindi titles issued from the private and commercial presses of Agra and Benares was still minimal. Besides a few select devotional classics (nearly all early Benares publishers relied on a pre-print favourite, Tulsidas's Rāmcaritmānas), publishers' output in Hindi was confined to popular forms of chapbook literature, including religious tracts, tales, folk dramas, and almanacs. This situation was to after dramatically when a number of changes ushered in the age of commercialization in the North Indian book trade. 
1.4 The Age of Commercialization Although the first commercial presses in North India date back to the late 1830s, the era of commercialization in Hindi and Urdu publishing, with its concomitant phenomenon of 'print capitalism', really only dawned

The Coming of the Book in Hindi and Urdu 
65 
in the second half of the nineteenth century. The boom of the Bengali print industry pre-dated it by nearly two decades. According to rough estimates made by the Reverend James Long, no less than 2,000,000 Bengali books had been printed by 1854, and a total of 8,000,000 by 1859 (Long 1859: [i]). So profound was the impact of print in Bengal that, by the second half of the century, the printing industry constituted one of the largest indigenous enterprises in Calcutta (Roy 1996: 30,34). While no comparable figures exist for the NWP&Oudh, printing in Hindi and Urdu had definitely come into its own by the 1860s. In 1868, the first year of official registration, over 600,000 printed books were recorded in Hindi and Urdu. The number of private and commercial presses operating in the NWP had risen to fifty.Ss Two decades later, in 1888, over 110 presses were in operation. There was a marked concentration of presses in six urban centres-Benares, Allahabad, Lucknow, Aligarh, Agra, and Kanpur. During the period 1868-1900 these cities accounted for about 80 per cent of the total production in the provinces (King 1994: 41-2). 
If lithography was paramount in enhancing print in the regional langu ages, it was only one of several technological factors preceding the boom of an indigenous print industry. A number of other technical inno vations introduced in the subcontinent from Europe was essential in paving the way for industrial mass printing. The first was the replacement of the wooden press by the iron printing press invented by Earl Stanhope in 1803. Iron presses were quickly adopted in India. In the 1820s India's first lithographic printer James Rind printed from Ruthven's iron presses. Three decades later James Long attested to their widespread use in the Bengal region, noting that the wooden press had become a 'curiosity' (Long 1859: 12). Following the iron printing press, the invention of the steam-powered cylindrical printing press by the German engineer Friedrich Koenig in 1811 constituted a further epoch-making event. When the steam press was first adopted by the Times of London in 1814, it was hailed as the greatest improvement connected with printing since the discovery of the art itself' (cited in Steinberg 1996: 139). Replacing manpower by steam power, it raised the output of a press from approxi mately 300 to 1100 sheets an hour and lowered printing costs by twenty five per cent. 
While steam presses had become widespread in Britain by the 1840s, their adoption in India was slow. Even though steam engines had been utilized for various purposes since the early nineteenth century (a steam 
55 PGNWP&Oudh. General Dept., 13 March 1869: 4.66 
An Empire of Books 
engine, for example, was operating at the Serampore paper millin 1820 the Indian print industry did not make use of the new technology unti much later. Inhibiting the general use of steam-powered presses by Indian printers was the high expense involved. Given the cheapness of labour in India, the cost of a steam press was indeed prohibitive. When steam presses were at last adopted in the late 1880s, only the largest commercial firms could afford the investment: the Venkateshvar Press in Bombay the Vangavasi Steam Machine Press in Calcutta, the Mutid-e Am Press in Lahore, and the NKP in Lucknow were among the first Indian-owned firms to introduce steam printing. However, the revolutionary technology had attracted public attention as early as 1850, with As'ad al-akhbar of Agra marvelling at the invention by the ingenious Europeans of the new steam printing machine, which was reported to print no less than 25,000 copies of a paper in a day (cited in Khan 1991: 197). 
A second crucial preliminary to the commercialization of print in northern India was the growth of the indigenous paper industry. Until mid-century the Serampore Paper Mill constituted the sole source of industrially manufactured paper for North Indian printer-publishers, who otherwise had to import expensive foreign paper from Europe. The difficult paper situation only changed in the 1870s, when the colonial government introduced special measures to stimulate the growth of the paper-manufacturing industry. It is a telling fact that the first paper mill in northern India owes its existence to the initiative of an Indian printer publisher: none other than Naval Kishore, who seized the occasion to found a company of shareholders and establish the Lucknow Paper Mills in 1878-9 (see Chapter 3). The paper mill soon turned into Lucknow's largest industrial enterprise. It gave an enormous impetus to the printing trade in the north-west, functioning as the main supplier of inexpensive paper to printers in the NWP&Oudh and the Punjab. By 1888 the situation in industrial paper production had markedly improved. However, production remained confined to only nine big mills, of which five were situated in Bombay, two in Bengal, and one each in Lucknow and Central India (Watt 1892: 312). 
One of the most important implications of the advance in printing technology and the growth of the indigenous paper industry was a con siderable reduction in production costs and, consequently, the prices of printed matter. At the beginning of the century printed books were still very expensive. As noted by William Ward in 1818, an edition of the Mahābhārat cost as much as Rs 60, while the Rāmāyaṇa sold at Rs 24 (cited in Diehl 1964:61). As Veena Naregal has shown for early Marathi 
The Coming of the Book in Hindi and Urdu

books, even with differential pricing for whites' and 'natives', prices were hardly conducive to promoting the reading habit among Indians. Molesworth's Maratha-English Grammar and Dictionary, issued from 
the Bombay School Book Society in 1829. sold at a forbidding Rs 90 (Naregal 2001: 165). From mid-century the impact of industrialization on book prices becomes clearly visible. By 1860 the Bombay publisher Ganpat Krishnaji was able to advertise a 1700-page Bhagavata Purana for Rs 12. Similarly, the average price for a lithographed Hindi or Urdu almanac had dropped to 2 annas, i.e. only one-sixteenth of the price at which Fardunji Marzban had sold his firsttype-printed Gujarati almanac in 1814. 
The emergence of the low-priced book in the Hindi and Urdu book trade can be dated roughly to the 1850s and 1860s. S' The introduction of mass-produced cheap formats, sewed and bound in paper covers, resulted in a situation where, for the first time, books became an affordable com modity for a large section of the urban literate classes. The following Table 1.1 gives an indication of price patterns, listing books published from the NKP during the period 1863-87. 
Various factors account for the great variation in sales prices: size, binding, and paper quality; whether the book was a publisher's production, a textbook, or a private commission; whether it was a first edition or a reprint; whether or not it contained illustrations. After the mid-1860s the prices of NKP publications slowly fell: for example, Gulistan-e mutarjim, an Urdu translation of Sa'di's Rose Garden, went from Rs 1 for the first edition of 1867 to Rs 0-8-6 in 1875 (17th ed.), and declined to Rs 0-7-0 in 1882 (27th ed.). Similarly, Rajab Ali Beg's popular tale Fasāna-e ajā'ib, originally priced at Rs 0-12-0 in 1870, was sold at Rs 0-7-0 in 1875 (4th ed.), and at Rs 0-6-0 in 1882 (14th ed.). The NKP's 1876 re print of Durr al-mukhtār, an authoritative law book by Hashkafi in Urdu translation, was already 25 per cent cheaper than the first edition issued from Muhammad Ahsan Nanautawi's Siddiqi Press four years earlier. 57 
To put these book prices into perspective, some figures relating to the late 1870s may be helpful: at the time, one rupee would buy 20 ser of 
56 In England, the price reversal process from a market dominated by books in the high-price category to one dominated by books in the low-price category took place somewhere in the period 1840–55. From 1855, low-priced books accounted for the largest percentage share in the English market, while expensive books went into a steady decline (Eliot 1995: 39–40). 
57 The respective prices for the voluminous edition of over 2200 pages being Rs 16 (Siddiqi Press: 1872) and Rs 12 (NKP: 1876).

By contrast, Nazir Ahmad, when embarking on a job in the dominions of the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1877, was initially offered a handsome salary of Rs 800 per month but was readily granted Rs 1200 on demand.61 
Large print runs were another factor that brought prices down. During the early decades of the nineteenth century, books in Hindi and Urdu were usually printed in editions of 500 copies. This, for example, applies to the books issued from Fort William College. The Lucknow-based Mustafa'i Press in 1850 published twenty different works in Persian and Urdu in prints run of 500 or 600 copies each. Only three years later, ave rage print runs had gone up to 1000 copies (Orsini 2004b: 111). By the early 1870s the institutionalization of formal education had created a

huge demand for educational titles, which sustained a flourishing govem ment and private printing industry. Official estimates of an average fi print run of educational works ranged from 3000 10-1700 copies. Mus higher circulations were attained by alphabetical primers, which toppa the list of educational bestsellers. Aksar dipikā, a Hindi alphabet bool was issued in a ninth edition of 100,000 copies in 1868. sold at 6 pai each. Its Urdu counterpart Tashrih al-hurufenjoyed an even higher circu. lation. Naturally, the corresponding figures for non-educational works were much lower. These were estimated to command first editions 700-900 copies on average.62 
Large-scale commercial printing in Hindi and Urdu began relatively late. At first growth was slow, the number of printed books in Urdu ris. ing from 217,153 to only 284,511 during the period 1868-84. With rapid advances in technology, increased official demand, and expansion of the readership, the growth rate picked up considerably during the last decades of the century and, at 548,030 Urdu books in 1900, had more than doubled. Hindi books displayed a similar growth pattern, except for an even slower start during the first period, the corresponding figures being 392,316 printed books in 1868, 399,882 in 1884, and a large 758,992 in 1900 (King 1994: 38-44). 
In sum, the period 1868-95 showed a nearly fourfold quantitative in crease in the production of Urdu books and a nearly threefold increase in Hindi books. The number of titles published in each language followed a similar growth pattern. Here, however, it is more difficult to establish reliable data on account of several imperfections in the sources. Official registration of books began in 1868 but during the first years was often incomplete (discussed below). The number of Urdu titles issued and re gistered in the NWP&Oudh increased from 214 in 1875,10 491 in 1885, to 560 in 1895. The corresponding number of Hindi titles was 121 in 1875, 295 in 1885, and 354 in 1895.63 While books on law and religion were most numerous in Urdu, works on language and religion scored highest in Hindi, followed by poetry and history. Both languages showed a marked increase in fictional literature from the late 1880s onwards. 
The importance of commercial publishing as a new branch of the colonial economy was for the first time documented in the NWP Census of 1872, which, in its occupational survey, contained a statement of professions connected with the book trade. Listed in the 'industrial class',

these so-called 'workers in books' (printers, newspaper proprietors, bookbinders, booksellers, inkmen, eic.) amounted to a total of 1981. The list counted three times as many booksellers as printers. In the subsequent Census of 1881, by then including the province of Avadh, the ratio was inverted: while the number of booksellers had risen by a mere 10 per cent, the number of printers had shot up from 332 to 1657. greatly surpassing that of booksellers. This large increase was because of the inclusion of Lucknow printers as well as those associated with the Allahabad Government Press, which the earlier Census had failed to list. Booksellers, bookbinders, printers, librarians, newspaper proprietors. and copyists now came to a total of 2753 persons. Noting that this was 'a poor fraction among a population exceeding 44 millions!', the accom panying Census report made an unfavourable comparison with England, where 58 out of 10.000 people were said to be workers and dealers in books.os The corresponding figure for the NWP&Oudh was given as 1.2.66 Over 65 per cent of them were located in the five urban centres of Agra, Allahabad, Benares, Kanpur, and Lucknow. 
While these official figures provide some interest, they can hardly be regarded as accurate. Not only did they fail to include members of the book trade who ranged at the lower end of the social scale-notably pressmen, compositors, hawkers, and distributors—they also did not take into account those individuals for whom book copying or calligraphy was not a full-time occupation. Moreover, smaller towns like Meerut and Bareilly, which boasted a burgeoning print industry of their own, were not even taken into consideration. In retrospect, the figures seem much too low and as inaccurate as those given by Garcin de Tassy and other contemporaries, in terms of the number of indigenous lithographic presses operating during the first decades of Hindi and Urdu printing. Absent from official statistics were a large number of small private printing shops that often consisted of nothing more than a hand press set up at home. The figures reproduced in Table 1.2 below must therefore be read with caution. 
Arguably, much of the intellectual and literary activity taking place in the realm of print escaped colonial statistics. Furthermore, official figures fail to shed light on a significant development: the easy accessibility of print to those living in small-town India, outside the urban centres. A

more accurate impression of the changes wrought by commercial print culture can be gathered from contemporary testimonies such as that of George A. Grierson. To the great linguist and admirer of Indian literature the triumph of print was a mixed blessing:

At the same time a mushroom growth of smaller establish ments has sprung up all over Hindūstān, and there is now scarcely a town of importance which does not possess its printing-press or in. Every scribbler can now see his writings in type or lithographed for a few rupees. and too often he avails himself of the power and the opportunity. (Grierson 1889: 145)

Printer-Publishers and their 
Social Background Information on the social background, economic status, and motivation of the men associated with the nascent print industry in North India is still scarce. These printer-publishers came from a variety of backgrounds. Many belonged to the traditional scribal classes with a history in service and a cultural background in the Indo-Persian tradition. Unlike South or West India, where learned pandit-publishers played a decisive part in shaping regional-language print culture (Blackburn 2003; Naregal 2001), Brahmins were only one of the groups that dominated print in the North. 
The Coming of the Book in Hindi and Urdu 
73 
In the erstwhile Mughal territory, ashraf Muslims, Kayasthas, and Khatris were equally important agents of the new print culture. 
A characteristic pattern among Hindi and Urdu printer-publishers was that of 'men from families and/or castes with a literary heritage' who received some formal education and then learned the printing and newspaper business on-the-job training' (Kerr 1979:286). Whether pro fessionals or amateurs, many entered the world of print as journalists and newspaper editors. In this they differed markedly from those printer publishers based in the metropolises of Madras, Calcutta, and Bombay, who usually received their training at missionary or government pres ses.67 Pioneers like Munshi Naval Kishore, or his mentor Munshi Harsukh Rai(1816–90), exemplify a different pattern, in that they were men with journalistic leanings who were drawn into the realm of print through the newspaper business, having usually learned their craft in the establish ment of a compatriot. Harsukh Raihad served as editor to Jām-e Jamshed, an Urdu journal of Meerut, before he shifted to Lahore in 1849 to set up his own shop and launch the Punjab's first Urdu paper in the form of Koh-e Nür. It was here that Naval Kishore, in turn, served his apprentice ship in printing and journalism. 
Few among these enterprising pioneers of print were endowed with the necessary financial resources and entrepreneurial talent that would allow them to turn their presses into viable publishing houses. Many, in fact, had no interest in doing so. The most conspicuous result of the rapid spread of lithography in northern India was the proliferation of small and short-lived newspaper presses that generally maintained a precarious existence on the brink of bankruptcy. Such was the allure of the newspaper press (and the degree of failure) that the educationist Raja Shiva Prasad remarked at one point: 'In this country a man not fit for any business undertakes one of the three professions-teaching, medicine or editing some newspaper. '68 The proprietors of these small presses were often autodidacts who, willy-nilly, combined the jobs of writer, printer, and editor. Given the volatility and financial risks involved 
67 Gangakishore Bhattacharya, the first Bengali publisher, was a former emp loyee of the Serampore Mission Press (Kopf 1969: 120). Ganpat Krishnaji, founder of Ganpat Krishnaji's Press in Bombay (est. 1831) was a pressman at the American Mission Press, who used his expertise to build up his own press-machinery and cast fonts in Marathi, Gujarati and Hindi. Javaji Dadaji Chaudhuri, a man of humble origin, worked at the American Mission Press and Times of India Press before he founded the famed Nirnaysagar Press in 1869 (Priolkar 1958: 102–3).

in the newspaper trade, its allure can hardly be explained by the hope of profits alone. 
If not material gains, what then motivated Indian pioneers of print? For many, editing a vernacular paper constituted an intellectual pursuit rather than a commercial activity. Journalism, in Sudhir Chandra's telling phrase, was 'a mission rather than a profitable business (Chandra 1992: 25), inspired by a variety of reformist, religious, educational, social, and political concerns. This in part also holds true for early book publishing. To the aspiring literate classes, print opened up new possibilities of cultural and political participation, of voicing individual and collective concerns. Whether in the form of journalism or book publishing, it was an agent of progress and change, and a potentially powerful weapon in colonial and indigenous debates over Indian modernity. Print afforded an opportunity to spread information, knowledge, and reformist thought on a supra-regional level. To many, it was a means of entering the fray of political, rationalist, and religious discourse and shaping public opinion, be it in the name of a particular community, class, sect, or the general public. 
With the commercialization of the publishing trade, print also began to offer new opportunities of subsistence which linked neatly with the traditional occupations of the scribal and clerical castes. As elsewhere, North Indian press proprietors fall into two main categories: professional printer-publishers who operated presses for their livelihood, and amateur or private printers, for whom book printing may have constituted a supple mentary means of income but was most of all an intellectual pursuit, a reformist concern, or simply an artistic pastime. In the latter category we find a predominance of government servants who followed a regular job in the educational, judicial, or revenue sector and adopted printing as a sideline. The two categories frequently overlap, with many Indian in tellectuals of public service or professional background embarking on temporary careers as 'professional printer-publishers at some stage in their lives. Others took to printing after their retirement from public service. 
As regards their educational background, North Indian printer-pub lishers characteristically combined a grounding in Indian literary and knowledge traditions with some exposure to Western education, usually received at one of the government colleges at Delhi, Agra, Benares, or Bareilly. In forging the career of many a future publicist and publisher, Delhi College (est. 1825) provided an especially significant impetus to the development of the printing profession in the North. A pioneering

institution in combining Western and Oriental learning, the college set up its own press in 1845, from where it issued various journals, textbooks, and works of scientific literature (Minault 1999; 2003). Even prior to that, it produced several alumni who rose to prominence in the realm of print. 
Among Muslims, editors and printer-publishers typically belonged to the high social strata of the ashraf. Some came from highly respectable and learned families, who played an important part in the intellectual life of their time. The most salient examples are Sayyid Muhammad Khan and his younger brother Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan, who belonged to one of the great service families of the Mughal empire. In 1841 Sayyid Muhammad established a lithographic press, from where, under the editorship of Sayyid Abdul Ghafoor, Savvid al-Akhbar as well as a number of learned and poetical works by distinguished contemporaries were published among them Ghalib's Dīvān. In turn, Sayyid Ahmad Khan maintained a small private press for some years, through which he supported the publication of scientific and literary works by the Scientific Society at considerable personal expense. The press, and printing material worth Rs 8,000, were later made over to the society (Muhammad 1978.1: 129). Another well-known figure among the pioneers of print in Delhi was Maulana Muhammad Baqir, a member of a Persian émigré family, who published Dehli Urdū Akhbar (est. 1837), the first Urdu paper in Delhi, from his lithographic press.69 Educated at Delhi College, Muham mad Baqir had taught there for some time before taking up a post in the collector's office. In his publishing work he was assisted by his father Maulana Muhammad Akbar, as also by his son, the eminent future literary critic Muhammad Husain 'Azad' (1831-1910), who, following his edu cation at Delhi College, served as 'printer and publisher' at the Delhi Urdu Akhbar Press for some years (Pritchett 1995: 11-12). 
Another remarkable Delhi College student who embarked on a short lived career in print was Maulvi Karimuddin (b. 1822?). He belonged to a family of Sunni (ulama of Panipat. A prolific translator and author, Karimuddin is best known for his biographical anthology Tabaqāt-e shu'arā-e Hind (1847) and his history of India Wāqi'āt-e Hind (1863), a classic of colonial textbook literature.70 In 1845 he and some partners

set up the Rifah-e Am Press with the express purpose of printing tra, lations of difficult scientific works. Soon after, he also launched Urdu journals, Karīm al-Akhhār and Gul-e Ra'nā, and began publishin a number of non-scientific Persian and Urdu books. However, he frauded by his business partners and in 1848 had to close down press, having sold its stock of books at a dumping price. He later embar on a career in the Punjab education service. 
A third future editor-publisher among Delhi College graduates was Munshi Muhammad Azim who belonged to a reputed family of Musli pirzādas (descendants of Sufi masters) from Mecca. He was trained a compositor at the Delhi Gazette Press. In 1849 he established th Lahore Chronicle Press, from where he launched the Lahore Chronicle the first English newspaper in the Punjab (Latif 1981: 342). Later founded an influential Urdu paper in the form of Panjabi Akhbar. 
Delhi College not only produced newspaper editors but also distinguished publisher of Islamic literature in the person of Maulana Muhammad Ahsan Nanautavi, scion of a famous family of ulama closely connected with the Deoband madrasah.?! The Nanautah family epitomizes the way in which reformist ulama availed themselves of print. Muhammad Ahsan's father, Maulana Mamluk Ali, was a highly reputed'alim who had worked as head teacher of Arabic at Delhi College His cousin, the well-known religious leader and co-founder of the Deoband school Maulana Muhammad Qasim, took employment in 1850 in the Delhi Ahmadi Press (est. 1845), owned by his teacher Maulana Ahmad Ali Saharanpuri, a pioneering publisher of Islamic literature and the reformist teachings of Shah Wali Allah (Metcalf 1982: 77-8). After 1857 Muhammad Qasim went to Meerut, where he joined the Mujtaba'i Press as a proofreader and collator. Later he became associated with the local Hashimi Press (est. 1859), from where he published a substantial number of Islamic works.72 In turn, Muhammad Ahsan, having graduated from Delhi College, took up employment as head Persian teacher at Bareilly College. In 1862 he bought two lithographic presses, and, together with his brother Maulana Muhammad Munir, established the Siddiqi Press in Bareilly in order to bring out Arabic and Persian classics in translation, as well as a number of original religious works in

Urdu.?? His multifaceted career-he was ‘at once an'alim, a government servant, a writer, a newspaper editor, a book publisher, and a business man' (Metcalf 1982: 242)-illustrates the versatility of Muslim 'ulama in making use of the modern print media. It also testifies to their new reliance on the printed word (increasingly in Urdu) in spreading religious tenets. Muhammad Ahsan's work was continued by his stepson Abdul Ahad who, in 1886, acquired the distinguished Mujtaba'i Press (est. 1863) in Delhi. Specializing in editions of the Qur'an and Islamic litera ture, it achieved a stature second only to the NKP (ibid.: 243-1). 
The Deobandi 'ulama were not the only religious leaders to embrace print; the Farangi Mahall family of Lucknow, if somewhat later, did like wise. Mention has already been made of Muhammad Ya'qub, who published two influential journals, Tilism-e Lakhna'ū and Kārnāmah, from the two presses he ran in Lucknow before and after the 'Mutiny'. Maulana Fakhruddin of Farangi Mahall worked for some time as a translator and editor of Avadh Akhbar at Naval Kishore's press. Yet, for the longest time, most of the works emanating from Farangi Mahall were printed outside Lucknow, at Delhi's Mujtaba'i Press and at other presses run by 'ulama (Rizvi 1980:84). It seems that it was only in 1894, with the establishment of the Yusufi Press by Maulvi Muhammad Yusuf, that Farangi Mahall began operating its own printing offices. 
Among Hindus, unsurprisingly, it was the scribal community of the Kayasthas, followed by various Brahmin castes, which constituted by far the strongest presence in the book trade. Munshi Harsukh Rai, the doyen of Urdu printing and journalism in the Punjab, was a Bhatnagar Kayastha from Sikandarabad. Munshi Shivnarayan 'Aram', founder proprietor of the Mufid-e Khala'iq Press, belonged to an affluent Kayastha family of Agra.' Like Naval Kishore, he had received his higher edu cation in Persian and English at Agra College, but quite unlike the former he graduated from the college and went on to work there as a teacher of English before setting up his press. With his English education and employment in educational service, Shivnarayan corresponds to what

74 Shivnarayan's grandfather, Nazir Bansi Dhar, was a high court officer who invested his wealth in landholding. According to the testimony of Mirza Ghalib, whose family had long-standing connections with that of Bansi Dhar, the latter acquired a big estate 'which paid something like ten or twelve thousand rupees in land revenue to the government' (Russell/Islam 1994: 179).

C.A. Bayly has called the 'new munshi' (Bayly 1996a: 229-30): eve while embarking on a career in publishing he remained closely tied in British patronage and served not only as a collaborator in educational schemes but also as a prime source of native opinion'. Another English educated 'new munshi' who assumed the function of mediator-informan for the British was Munshi Sadasukhlal, the proprietor of the Nur al. Absar Press at Agra. His services to government were rewarded by his appointment to the post of Chief Government Translator. He shifted hie press to Allahabad where it continued to thrive on official patronage Little did it matter to Sadasukhlal that his journal Nur al-Absar was no longer popular with the Indian public who regarded him as a turncoa (Bayly 1996a: 342): government support more than compensated for the decline in public subscriptions." 
The preponderance of Brahmins among Benares printer-publishers has already been noted. Unfortunately, no information is available on the background of these enterprising pandits hailing from Bengal, Maha rashtra, or the Gangetic core region. Precious little is known about their individual motives and the specific circumstances under which they established their printing houses. While Dhirendranath Singh (1986) and, more recently, Orsini (2004a and b) have provided some valuable insights, this important chapter in the intellectual history of Benares remains unwritten. The sizeable number of learned Brahmins entering the publishing trade in Benares and elsewhere indicates that print was well compatible with their scribal and intellectual concerns. 
Even Kashmiri Pandits could be seen to overcome the traditional aversion of their community towards commercial enterprise and enter the realm of print (Sender 1988: 164-5). Perhaps the first to do so was Pandit Moti Lal Kashmiri, who served as printer-publisher at the Delhi Urdu Akhbar Press in the 1830s. The most salient example, however, is that of Pandit Mukund Ram (1831-97), the founder-proprietor of the Mitra Vilas Press in Lahore (est. 1861). The son of a Kashmiri Brahmin priest of Srinagar, Mukund Ram provides a prime example of a self made man who displayed a remarkable degree of enterprise and resource fulness in his career. In 1848 he set out penniless for Lahore, where he opened a small calligraphy shop. According to his son, Kanhaiyalal, 'from his earning a[nna]s 2 a day he rose to be the Chaudhri (head man) of all the caligraphists of Lahore and transacted business of thousand rupees. From thence through the help and encouragement of the late

79 
chief Pandit Radha Kishen, he was successful in establishing his press' (Kanhaiyalal n.d.:6–7). The account fails to mention that Mukund Ram derived a substantial amount of his income from serving as a calligrapher to Harsukh Rai's Koh-e Nur Press. The Mitra Vilas Press was established with the avowed purpose of publishing 'rare old MSS. and new works of distinguished scholars of Sanskrit of the rising generation' (ibid.: 10). Yet Mukund Ram's rise to prominence rested largely on his publications in Persian and Urdu. In 1870 he launched Akhbar-e Am, introducing the concept of a low-priced "penny' paper in Urdu journalism. 
Among the Kashmiri Pandits of Lucknow it was Pandit Kishan Nara yan Zardchop, a former tahsildār and the first president of the Lucknow Reform Club (Jalsah-e Tahzib), who initiated the move to the new print media with a view to fostering community interests. Upon his retirement in 1872, together with Pandit Sri Kishan Takru, he launched the monthly Murāsala-e Kashmir, the first caste organ of the Kashmiri Brahmin community. The journal was first printed at the NKP: in 1875, however, the Kashmiri Pandits decided to set up their own press. It was named Bahar-e Kashmir Press after Shivnarayan Bahar', the late editor of Murāsala and a pivotal community member. Alongside the reformist Journal Mirāt al-Hind, it issued a number of ephemeral writings expres sing caste concerns.77 
It was not only to the literate upper-caste elites that print offered new opportunities. With the industry's rapid commercialization in the second half of the century, the social background of those connected with the printing trade expanded to include men from humble origins as well. Anindita Ghosh has noted the influx, from the 1860s onwards, of non Scribal lower castes of smiths and artisans into the thriving Calcutta printing industry, which provided much better opportunities to them than their traditional occupation (Ghosh 1998: 180; 2002: 4332). While no comparable data exist for the NWP&Oudh, there is some evidence to suggest that in the North, too, people from lower social strata gradually began to avail themselves of the opportunities offered by print. This can De gathered, for example, from a rather disparaging comment made by DPI M. Kempson in 1874: 
Obviously, very little capital or enterprise is embarked in the printing and publishing trade. These are not the attributes of the class of natives who manage the business. Many of the publishers are poor and involved in debt, and keep up next to no establishment. Their stock consists in two or three

lithographic stones and some coarse paper, with a rude Press for securing the impressions. Some of them are mere pressmen who have learned the work in service, and have set up for themselves.? 
Kempson professed to know of only one instance in which the lithograph work taught in jails had been utilized by an ex-prisoner as a means of livelihood. It is difficult to say whether he underestimated the impact of state prisons in providing training to large numbers of Indian pressmen. Printing had indeed become the most profitable branch of the colonial jail industries, with the central prisons in Agra and Lucknow running large typographic and lithographic departments. 
While little is known about non-elite participation in the printing trade. by the 1880s a different and fairly heterogeneous social group comes into the foreground among Indian editors and publishers: writers and literati. Print had always constituted a natural attraction for the writer community, long before commercial printing, with its new genres of fic tional literature, produced the professional' author who could live by his writing. Over the last decades of the century increasing numbers of aspiring authors were lured into setting up their own presses, more often than not at great financial risk. Many of them were largely ignorant of the practicalities of publishing and unable to effectively deal with the more mundane aspects of press proprietorship. The scholar-poet Pandit Mannalal Sharma 'Dvij', who in the early 1860s established the Kashi Sanskrit Press at Benares, was a notable exception in his successful career as a publisher of Sanskrit and Hindi works (Singh 1991). Rather more typical in their ephemeral attempts at press proprietorship were the writers of Bharatendu Harishchandra's literary circle. Harishchandra himself ran a small private press under the name of Harishchandra Chandrika Press for some time, but does not seem to have printed much apart from a few works authored by his father Gopalchand Girdhardas', a prolific Brajbhasha poet (Singh 1986: 76). While Harishchandra used the services of an array of publishers to publicize his writings, his own interest in print rested chiefly in deploying it as a journalistic medium. The way in which he availed himself of print as a publicist, essayist, and founder-editor of the influential pioneering magazines Kavivacansudha (1868), Bālābodhini (1874), and Hariscandra-candrikā (1874) provided an example to many literati: in 1876, the drama and fiction writer Shrinivas Das opened a small press in Delhi from where he launched a Hindi jour nal called Sadādars and later published his Parīkşāguru (1882), generally

acclaimed as the first modern novel in Hindi. Pandit Ambikadatt vyas followed suit and in 1883 set up a press in Bhagalpur to bring out his own writings as well as two journals. Other contemporary Hindi writers Balkrishna Bhatt, Chaudhari Badarinarayan Upadhyaya “Premghan', Pratapnarayan Mishra, Balmukund Gupta-turned to the new print media primarily to engage in a kind of journalistic writing that combined literary and patriotic concerns. 7° By contrast Devkinandan Khatri, the famed author of the first best-selling serial novel in Hindi. Candrakāntā (1892), used the income from his novel to found his own press. Churning out a continuous stream of fiction, his Lahri Press (est. 1898) flourished and became one of the foremost commercial presses in Benares (Orsini 2004b: 123-4). 
The community of Hindi writers found a liberal benefactor in the per son of Ramdin Singh, founder-proprietor of the Khadgavilas Press of Bankipur (Patna) in Bihar and the first major literary publisher in Hindi. Ramdin Singh, whose career has been excellently documented by Dhirendranath Singh (1986), belonged to a well-to-do family of Kshat riya zamindārs of Ballia. While his own career as a writer was limited to authoring school textbooks, he was a lover of Hindi poetry and a great admirer of Bharatendu Harishchandra. In 1880 he gave up his humble job as a village schoolteacher and set up the Khadgavilas Press with the express purpose of promoting contemporary Hindi authors. In the tried fashion, the opening of his press was accompanied by the launch of a journal, Ksatriya Patrikā. Belying its name, this was a literary rather than caste journal. However, it appealed enough to community spirits to receive the support of some affluent local rulers such as the Maharaja of Udaipur. In his aim to propagate Hindi literature Ramdin Singh spared no expense. He gave considerable financial assistance to Harishchandra, who made him his exclusive publisher and extolled him as a true and dear friend who is as passionately devoted to the advancement of Hindi as myself and is prepared to sacrifice his health, wealth and time to the cause of Hindi' (cited in Madan Gopal 1972: 155). 
Although the Khadgavilas Press assumed prime importance in the early history of Hindi publishing, and despite the fact that Ramdin Singh made substantial profits which he invested in landed property (Gupt 
79 Their respective journals Hindi Pradip (est. 1877), Anandkadambini (est. 1881), Brāhman (est. 1883), and Bhāratmitra (est. 1878) engaged in the critique of British rule in a more or less trenchant manner. While providing a forum for nationalist concerns, they also discussed literary issues and became important in the development of a modern Hindi prose style. See Mishra 1985; Chandra 1992.

1994: 31), he can hardly be reckoned among the new class of North Indian ‘print capitalists'. As a Hindi literary publishing house, the pro duction of his press was rather confined in size and scope. He could not vie with those large general publishers who offered a widely diversified 
started to make huge profits. 
What then distinguished a print capitalist like Naval Kishore from his humbler fellow workers in the publishing trade? It will be argued here that, rather than social background or educational opportunities, the roots of success lay in his ability to combine on the one hand the traditional roles of the publisher as intellectual forerunner and connoisseur of elite and popular reading tastes, with on the other those of industrial entre preneur, businessman, and modern employer. In the increasingly competitive market economy of colonial India-as perhaps in all other times as well—successful entrepreneurship, while by no means precluding literary and scholarly concerns, demanded the instincts of a businessman. Success as a publisher invariably presupposed the ability to secure government patronage-perhaps the most crucial financial factor in the growth of Indian printing firms at the time. 
In this context, the success stories of Munshi Naval Kishore and Munshi Gulab Singh, founder-proprietor of the immensely successful Mufid-e Am Press at Lahore (est. 1877), offer some interesting parallels. Both men belonged to a traditional middle-class background. Neither had large monetary resources when embarking on a career in print. Gulab Singh had worked as a schoolteacher and established a small print ing shop to publish his own vernacular textbooks. Yet both publishers were from the outset on close terms with the colonial authorities. Starting off with educational printing and other contract work, their firms even tually flourished under official patronage. While Naval Kishore made his first large profit with a contract for printing the Urdu version of the Indian Penal Code in the 1860s, for Gulab Singh the commercial break through came with a large printing contract for Census work in the 1880s. He subsequently rose to the position of official Government Publisher and Bookseller in the Punjab and was put in charge of the Government Book Depot. 80 
However, to fully understand the factors accounting for the rise of the most successful among North Indian publishers, it is not enough to record the impact of official patronage. One also needs to investigate the extent

The Coming of the Book in Hindi and Urdu 
83 
and nature of a publisher's indigenous social and commercial networks. Naval Kishore's career, if extraordinary in many respects, exemplifies some of the typical dynamics in the making of an Indian print capitalist. Before turning to his life and career in the next chapter, it is necessary to take a closer look at the framework of colonial rule under which Ind ian printer-publishers operated. The legal measures and regulations introduced by the colonial state at various points in the nineteenth century affected not only the newspaper press but also the publishing and book

under Colonial Legislation 
joined by the first Indian-language papers in expressing their critique of colonial policy and attacking its representatives. It was this increasingly recalcitrant newspaper press that constituted the original focus of colonial legislation on the printing trade. Faced with the double imperative of closely monitoring and at the same time nurturing the nascent Indian press, the colonial state reacted with a succession of measures that en tailed alternating phases of liberal encouragement and strict censorship. While the implications of press laws and their adverse effects on the Indian-language press have been discussed at length elsewhere, a brief recapitulation of the salient legislation will be useful here to show the extent to which it impacted on the publishing and book trade. 81 
Even while receiving official encouragement, the 'native' press re mained under close surveillance throughout the century. With book publishing, the situation was markedly different, for the utility of Indian enterprise in the field was widely acknowledged by the colonial state. As long as its output consisted predominantly of educational and religious works—as also of popular tales, astrological handbooks, almanacs, and other such ephemera—the indigenous book trade gave little reason for concern or direct intervention. Priya Joshi has noted the colonial autho rities' 'remarkably sanguine' attitude towards print through much of the nineteenth century (Joshi 2002: 47). This attitude was partly based on the necessity of co-opting Indian publishers in the great utilitarian pro gramme of disseminating 'useful' knowledge and Western enlightenment 
81 E.g. Barns 1940; Natarajan 1954; S. Ghosh 1998. The following overview is largely based on these works.

in Indian regional languages. After 1854 the colonial state, in its engage ment with mass primary education, began to depend heavily on indigenous collaboration. In short, there were only two kinds of books that called for special scrutiny on the part of the authorities: seditious writings and, in creasingly, literature of an 'obscene' or 'immoral' nature. 
The first quarter of the nineteenth century was marked by controversies over censorship and freedom of the press that arose between the colonial authorities and the pioneers of the English language press in Calcutta. With the appearance of the first Indian-language papers after 1818, official attention shifted to the vernacular press, leading to the first confrontations with Raja Rammohan Roy and other champions of early Indian journ alism. During that period book printers were able to operate in relative liberty. This was to change with the promulgation of the Press Ordinance of 1823 under Governor General John Adam. The Adam regulations im posed for the first time rigid restrictions on the press, making the estab lishment of a printing press subject to licence and introducing strict criteria for both the grant of a licence and the publication of printed matter. The authorities were invested with the power to immediately withdraw licences whenever it was deemed expedient. Infringement against any part of the regulations was met with severe fines and could lead to imprisonment and confiscation of the press. Foreboding the notori ous Vernacular Press Act of 1878, the 1823 regulations directly targeted the increasingly vocal vernacular press and sought to introduce a dis tinction between Indian-owned papers and the English-language journals edited by Englishmen.82 These regulations were vehemently opposed by Rammohan Roy, India's most eloquent advocate of a free press. When his appeal against them was rejected, he discontinued his weekly Mirāt al-Akhbār in protest. 
The 1830s inaugured a new era of liberal policy under Governor General Lord William Cavendish Bentinck and subsequently Sir Charles Metcalfe. A firm believer in freedom of the press, Metcalfe perceived it as an integral part of the British civilizing mission and a prerequisite for legitimate government. In order to introduce a general law for the whole of India he had the 1823 ordinance repealed and replaced by Act XI of 1835. The liberal 1835 act came at a time when lithography was beginning to spread in North India. The combined effect was a surge in printing and publishing activity. While subject to heavy criticism, Metcalfe's liberalizing measures were endorsed by his successor, Lord Auckland.

The Coming of the Book in Hindi and Urdu 
Meanwhile, British involvement in Indian education had been ad Vanced by the appointment of a General Committee of Public Instruction in 1823 and the renewal of the East India Company's Charter in 1833. which entailed a rise in the educational grant. For the two next decades Anglicization, as laid out in Thomas Macaulay's Minute on Education (1835), remained the primary goal of colonial investment in education. It was only in the wake of the Education Despatch of 1854 that the colo nial state turned to the instruction of the Indian masses. While English remained the language of higher education, the new policy of imparting Primary and secondary education through the Indian languages entailed an unprecedented activity in official educational publishing. For the first Time Indian printer-publishers directly profited from the scheme, for it involved a large amount of contract work. 
The 'golden era inaugurated by Lord Bentinck was to last until 1857. when the uprising greatly disrupted social and commercial life in urban North India. To counteract the seditious potential of the press, Lord Canning hastily enacted the so-called 'Gagging Act' in June 1857, reintro ducing the licence system and renewing the strict censorship provisions of the Adam regulations of 1823. The government was given discretionary powers to grant and revoke licences at any time and to prohibit the publication of any newspaper, book, or printed pamphlet (S. Ghosh 1998: 123). Drastic as the new act was, it remained a temporary measure and was lifted after a year. While it led a number of Bengali publishers into trouble, it proved of little consequence in the NWP where the events of the uprising were disruptive enough in themselves to force most printing presses out of business. 
When, in November 1858, the British crown took over direct govern ment of India, a new and extended period of relative press freedom com menced under the reign of Queen Victoria. Whatever suspicions of the vernacular press the Rebellion had created, they were counterbalanced by pragmatic considerations, notably the pressing need to gain better insight into 'native opinion' and win over Indian publicists as allies in the tremendous task of restoring law and order as well as public con fidence. Under Lord Canning a more lenient policy was adopted, in which encouragement and censorship were cautiously weighed against each other. Support for the new policy came from educational officers. Henry Stuart Reid, first DPI in the NWP, voiced a common opinion when point ing to the benefits of a partial encouragement of the vernacular press: "The people must have newspapers of some kind or other', he asserted. “The more respectable aided by the patronage of the Government drive86 
An Empire of Books 
the seditiously disposed Editors out of the field.: 83 The same trust in competition and the self-regulatory forces of patronage was echoed by James Long in his 1859 report on the native press in Bengal. Long openly warned against the dire consequences of too rigid a censorship, whose effects on 'good Government and sound education could be nothing but 'suidical'. Instead, he advocated a more benevolent supervision: In the present position of India, the Native Press as the exponent of the Native mind ought to be attended to: if the sound part of the native press be en couraged by the Authorities, it will become the instrument of much good; if it be left in the hands of ill-designing ignorant men, it will be the source of much evil' (Long 1859: ii). 
The policy adopted by the government in the wake of 1857 gave print ers almost complete freedom. As a result, the domestic book trade flourished. Rather than resorting to the law, the colonial state increasingly relied on a new kind of mechanism to retain control over the activities of Indian publishers: government patronage became the single-most im portant means of rewarding "loyal' editors and publishers, particularly those who collaborated in the colonial scheme of disseminating 'useful' literature. Withdrawal of patronage, on the other hand, proved an equally effective means of control: exercised relentlessly, it could see a publisher out of business. Legislation during the period was largely supportive of the growth of regional-language printing and of a regulative rather than restrictive kind. This is clearly evident in the most important law of the period, the 'Regulation of Printing Press and Newspaper Act XXV' of 1867 (renamed 'Press and Registration of Books Act' after its amendment in 1890).84 Replacing the Metcalfe Act of 1835, it was primarily aimed at keeping the government informed about the activities and output of 
the registration of books and consolidating intellectual copyright, it also gave a new degree of legal security to Indian publishers. This deserves to be looked at more closely. 
Registration of Books and Copyright 
As in metropolitan Britain, book registration and copyright protection in colonial India derived from mechanisms originally developed to control

the press. Copyright legislation in India dates back to the Indian Copy right Act of 1847 (Act XX of 1847), which was to affirm the application to India of the law obtaining in the British dominions, notably the Copy right Act of 18-42 and the International Copyright Act of 1844. Aiming to afford greater encouragement to the Production of literary works of lasting benefit to the World', the 1842 act centred on the copyright in books which was vested with the author (Law 2000: 164-5). In keeping with it, the Indian Copyright Act fixed the term of copyright at forty-two years from the date of publication, or at the natural life of the author and seven years thereafter, whichever period was longer. The act also forbade the import of foreign reprints of British books into England or her colonies. Proprietorship of copyright was formally assigned by an entry in the registry book. Publishers could claim copyright as first publishers of a given book or as proprietors of an author's manuscript from which a book was published. The law. as Feather explains, was based on the clear assumption that copyright originated with the author, but that, be cause the author could only use the property thus created if it were shar ed with a publisher, the publisher was also afforded some protection (Feather 1994: 147-8). 
In Britain, as much as in her colonies, early copyright legislation proved unsatisfactory and was unable to keep pace with the changing relations between author, publisher, and bookseller in the rapidly modernizing world of print. Its deficiencies were most succinctly stated in the 1878 verdict of Queen Victoria's Copyright Commission: The law is wholly destitute of any sort of arrangement, incomplete, often obscure, and even when it is intelligible upon long study, it is in many parts so ill-expressed that no one who does not give such study to it can expect to understand it. *88 While issues of copyright and piracy in nineteenth-century India have not been much studied, it can be said with some certainty that the law lagged behind practice. Lack of information on the legal provisions, for one, must have inhibited strict adherence to the law. With some Indian publishers barely aware of the content of the Copyright Act and others choosing to circumvent it, piracy and unlicensed reprinting of books must have been rampant. What certainly encouraged piracy was the fact that for a long time registering copyright was more honoured in the breach than the observance. Unlicensed reprinting was

most conspicuous in the case of widely used vernacular textbooks. The 
difficulty or absence of state enforcement did not help matters. 
Copyright legislation also entailed some problems specific to the colonial situation. This is suggested by a petition addressed to the govern ment by the Aligarh Scientific Society and British Indian Association in 1867, asking for an amendment to the 1847 act. Since the act did not exempt translations from copyright, the petitioners argued, it formed an ‘insurmountable obstacle' to the society's objective of promoting inodern Western knowledge through translation. To have to obtain the original author's sanction and pay a large copyright fee made such projects ex tremely difficult (Muhammad 1978.1: 288-90). 
The significance of the 'Regulation of Printing Press and Newspaper Act XXV' of 1867 lies not only in its provision of an elaborate legal framework for the production and registration of books. For scholars of South Asian book history it has proved nothing short of a boon, for in its wake we find the first systematic attempt at a quantitative and qualitative registration of all literary and non-literary printed publications in Indian languages. Starting from 1868, the scheme initially took the form of Quarterly Publication Lists compiled separately for each province. These lists are a mine of invaluable data, providing details on a work's author or translator, its year and place of publication, subject, size, number of pages, edition, print run and sales price, on whether the book was typeset or lithographed, and on the proprietor of the copyright.89 From 1874 the quarterly reports were summarized in the Home Department's yearly Reports on Publications Issued and Registered in the Several Provinces of British India (RPIR). Implied in them was an attempt to classify India's literary output by language and by principal generic categories that followed British criteria of what constituted 'noteworthy' literature: Arts, Biography, Drama, Fiction, History, Language, Medicine, Miscellaneous, Poetry, Politics, Philosophy (including Mental and Moral Science), Reli gion and Science (Mathematical and Mechanical). Unfortunately, the data contained in the reports are often unreliable. Figures are frequently distorted owing to a number of inaccuracies, such as the inclusion of illegitimate materials (time-tables, class lists, catalogues, etc.) and the exclusion of legitimate titles. Another problematic aspect is the failure to maintain a clear-cut distinction between books and 'tracts', the latter being sometimes included in the total of printed books and sometimes

not. Within data for a single year the statistics were skewed because of the omission of reprints; in another year the alleged 'indifference of publishers' towards registration was to blame. Failure on the part of a large publisher to submit his titles in time could indeed result in a signi ficant alteration of statistics. When, between 1879 and 1880, the total of books registered in the NWP&Oudh dipped from 541 10409 titles, it was solely owing to the fact that Naval Kishore had not forwarded any books during the last quarter of 1880. To further complicate matters, publishers often failed to state whether a title was a first edition or a reprint in new format. These imperfections notwithstanding, the data contained in the colonial reports present the most detailed and comprehensive docu mentation of the textual production of British India. 
In stipulating that a copy of each registered title be deposited with the British Museum in London, the 1867 act also contributed significantly to the preservation of early printed books in South Asian languages. Most of the books have since gone into the British Library's Oriental and India Office Collections (OIOC), where they are accessible to scholars and researchers. 
Finally, in formalizing registration, the 1867 act introduced some im portant changes in the physical appearance of nineteenth-century books. It stipulated that the name of the printer or publisher and the date and place of publication be printed legibly on the title page, allowing for a clear identification of the provenance of a given book or tract. This was a significant change from past practice, where books frequently bore no publication date or, as in the case of early printed Sanskrit books, lacked a title page-a legacy of the age of manuscripts. Another new feature on the title page was the copyright notice. The practice of official registration of books allowed for a public declaration of copyright by a simple state ment of the 'name and residence of the proprietor of the copyright or of any portion of such copyright 93 Registration of copyright involved the payment of a fairly high fee of Rs 2 per title. 
So alien, however, was the Western notion of protecting literary pro perty to north Indian authors that they failed to respond to the new regu lation. Authors in the Bengal region seem to have been far ahead of their compatriots in exercising their legal rights. As Long had noted in the 1850s, new Bengali works were generally rather highly priced when

copy-wright, 'as various natives now find the composing of Bengali books profitable, and some authors draw a regular income from them' (Long 1859: 12). By contrast, almost a quarter of a century later, an NWP&Oudh report deplored that “The advantages to be gained by the registration of copyrights are still but little known, or are imperfectly appreciated by native authors. Only 17 copyrights were registered last year, and all of these were copyrights owned by the Educational Depart ment."94 With a mere two copyrights registered in Avadh in 1874, DPI John C. Nesfield resorted to special measures: in order to make the pub lic acquainted with the advantages of having copyrights registered, he not only had a notice published in the Educational Gazette, but also, on receiving a book for registration, sent a note to the proprietor of the copyright advising him to have a copyright notice printed on the title page. Nesfield's information campaign resulted in a temporary improvement, with ten copyrights registered during the course of the following year. In the long run, however, it proved of little consequence: a decade later the percentage of registered copyrights, though considered to have considerably increased', still did not exceed a meagre six per cent of all registered titles. 97 
Suppressing 'Obscene' Literature The colonial state exercised not only political but also moral surveillance. With the rise of Victorianism in the second half of the century, colonial concerns over 'immoral' and 'obscene' literature had specific impli cations for Indian publishers. Complaints about the alleged immoral character of specific genres of oriental literature both 'high' and 'low' were nothing new, but had been raised by Orientalists and British officials for some time. 98 Such perceptions drew on wider stereotypical notions of the 'lascivity' and ‘unbridled sensuality of an essentially decadent' East; underlying these were various colonial motives that ranged from moral indignation and puritanism to differing aesthetic sensibilities. However, it was not until the 1850s, when commercial print culture first began to allow the mass production and widespread distribution of popular

forms of indigenous literature, that the colonial state felt compelled to react to the perceived obscenity threat with legal measures. 
By this time puritanical tendencies had gained momentum in Victorian England and were fast making their impact on colonial society. With shifting perceptions, Erotic' became a new classificatory category for Indian printed literature, as first evident in the series of reports on the Bengal book trade compiled by James Long for the government in the 1850s (Roy 1996). Significantly legislation on obscenity in India ap peared almost simultaneously with the 1857 Obscene Publications Acts in Britain, an act resulting from the crusading zeal of the early Methodist anti-vice societies." While the British act was designed with a view to curbing the flourishing London underworld trade in pornographic books 
European literature), obscenity laws in India initially did not target any specific literary genre. 
The earliest Indian obscenity law was the Obscene Books and Pictures Act (Act I of 1856), which imposed a fine or imprisonment for the sale of obscene books or pictures. 100 Noting the case of one most hideously obscene book with its 20 most filthy pictures', of which over 30,000 copies had been sold within one year, Long was explicit in his satisfaction with the introduction of legal measures. The terror of the law against obscene publications is effecting what a regard to morality could not (Long 1859: XXV), he asserted confidently. Following the 1856 act, legis lation relating to obscenity was consolidated in the Indian Penal Code of 1860. Sections 292, 293, and 294 of the penal code prohibited the sale, distribution, import or printing of any 'obscene' book, pamphlet, picture, etc., as also the possession of the same for the purpose of sale or exhi bition. Infringement of the law could result in imprisonment of up to three months or a fine, or both. 
It is significant that the Penal Code did not define obscenity. Hence, extremely divergent material and literary genres could be classified as obscene (Gupta 2000: 89). Also, there was no attempt to distinguish 
99 Craig 1963: 40-53; Travis 2000: 4-9. 
100 The Act contained the following clause: Whoever, within the territories in the possession of the East India Company, of any shop, bazar, street, thoroughfare, highroad, or any place of public resort, distributes, sells or offers or exposes for sale or willfully exposes to public view, any obscene song, ballad, or works to the annoy ance of others; shall, upon conviction, ... be liable to a fine not exceeding hundred rupees, or to imprisonment with or without hard labour, for a period not exceeding three months, or to both' (cited in Roy 1996: 61).

between 'erotic' and 'obscene'. Rather, these terms were used inter changeably as evident from Long's terse statement: By Erotic is meant books abounding in obscene passages' (Long 1859: XXV). It was in no way required that a book deal as explicitly with sexual intercourse as the Lazzat al-nisā (Pleasure of Women)—a Persian version of the Sanskrit erotic classic Kokaśāstra--for it to be proscribed by government for its alleged indecency. Any kind of work of an erotic or sensual nature prone to injuring Victorian sensibilities could theoretically be dismissed as 'obscene' or 'immoral'. As a result, the stigma of obscenity was fre quently applied to works representing the most widely cherished of Indian literary genres, namely Urdu love lyrics and Hindi bhakti poetry. To F.B. Outram, Officiating Under Secretary to the NWP Government in 1858, this literature was a mere reflection of the general depravity' of Indian life and social conditions: ... it would be difficult to concoct books, more immoral in their tendency than the legends, traditions, and doctrines, which are instilled into the mind of every Hindoo by his spiritual guides, or the sensual aspirations which Mahomedanism delights in cherishing', he wrote. 'It is to be confessed too with sorrow, that Native Indian social life, even after 100 years of British efforts to establish decency, is about as prolific in wantonly degrading every-day circumstances, as the most prurient imagination could put in print.' 102 
Prior to the enactment of the Indian Penal Code, the NWP provincial authorities had limited themselves to excluding objectionable books from the educational curriculum, while largely refraining from exercising 'moral' censorship of a more pervasive kind. It was only when Matthew Kempson assumed the post of DPI in 1861 that publishers came under closer surveillance. An uncovenanted servant who had worked his way up the education service from private schoolmaster, Kempson has been portrayed as a much disliked and controversial figure (Powell 1999). He was clearly not overly sympathetic to indigenous enterprise in the book trade and generally confined his recognition to educational publishing, while remaining deeply distrustful of Indian publishers, whom he accused of withholding books ‘of impure tendency' from registration.103 No sooner had Kempson been assigned the post of DPI than he set out on a crusade 
"The Kokaśāstra, also known as Ratirahasya, was a famed thirteenth-century sexual manual by Kokkoka. Its Persian version was published at least twice (Bombay 1869; Delhi 1873).

to curb the spread of licentious literature in his province. Over time he advocated various measures to combat obscenity, the first and most enient being increased patronage. In 1865 he urged that a larger share " textbook printing be given to Indian printer-publishers, who could lereby be turned into 'useful agents in education. In the absence of such employment they were prone to fall back upon the issue of any rubbish they can find a market for.104 
Of rubbish Kempson saw plenty. Whole genres were subject to his Wholesale condemnation: Whenever the term Wasokht occurs in the Title ... the subject matter is always of salacious tendency.'105 He was particularly alarmed by the increasing number of Hindi translations of Persian and Urdu amatory poetry, a genre he unhesitatingly decried as 
Trash'. The publication in 1863 of a Hindi version of Mir Hasan's im mensely popular Masnavi from the Agra-based Ahmadi Press prompted him to urge government to establish an 'inder expurgatorius'. 106 The measure, he maintained. would be readily supported by all natives of respectability. 107 Kempson's proposal met with little sympathy on the part of the government, which tried to restrain its overzealous servant, pointing to the impracticability of the suggested measure and the suf ficiency of existing legal provisions. Since supply was stimulated by demand, the sober argument went, one could only hope for a general improvement in morality and literary taste'. It may not have escaped the authorities that Kempson's denigration of Mahomedan poetry' was not just a routine expression of the utilitarian contempt for poetry, but was nurtured by a more general prejudice against Muslim and Urdu culture. Indeed, in his report Kempson had explicitly stated that 
The increase in the number of persons able to read their own vernacular has created a demand for books which illiterate and unprincipled printers meet with trash of this description, and it is a melancholy reflection that the vernacular, which we take to much pains in utilizing as an organ of education in the masses, should thus become a vehicle of immorality.

Government with the rule of his Mahommedan conquerors, should learn his own language with the aid and encouragement of the former and apply it to a revival of the latter. 108 
In the following year two small presses of Agra by the name of Moham madi Press and Latafat Press came to his notice for issuing in large 
(Divert Your Mind). While invoking the morally corrupting effects of the book, in his report to government Kempson was more outspoken than before in his condemnation of the two Muslim publishers. Their offence called for draconian measures: 
The Dilbahlao ... is bazar trash in the shape of ribald verses, some of them grossly indecent. It is stuff of this kind which arms native opposition to fe male education with its most powerful objections, and which poisons the minds of the youth in large towns. For one who reads, there are 100s who hear the libidinous suggestions and allusions. The publishers are low Mahomedans, who eke out the profits of their presses by keeping up a supply of nastiness within the means of the poorest of their Hindoo fellow subjects. The practice should be checked, and as the tracts bear the names of the presses, I hope his Honor will order revocation of licence in each case. 109 (emphasis added) 
The government did not share Kempson's vision of the morally corrupt and corrupting ‘Mahomedan' and in reply made it clear that there was no legal power to effect the withdrawal of licence of the Agra publishers. However, the offence was said to be punishable under the obscenity sections of the Indian Penal Code. 
Kempson's strong anti-Muslim prejudice is further underscored by the fact that, in the same report, he let the well-known Hindu proprietor of the Mufid-e Khala'iq Press, Munshi Shivnarayan, get away with a re buke for an identical offence. True, he noted with ‘much regret' that a man of Shivnarayan's position and education had 'disgraced his press through several objectionable publications, hereby 'lending [it] equally with the low Mahomedan publishers of Agra to pander to the vicious tendencies of his fellow townsmen by giving currency to this unwhole some trash.'110 Yet he refrained from advocating special measures against

Shivnarayan. The episode is important in that it exposes the practice of censorship as highly selective and illustrates British officials' arbi trariness in dealing with Indian publishers who had offended the law. Communal bias, as in Kempson, was not the only form of discrimination: while small-scale publishers could be prosecuted and fined on account of a single publication, those of high repute and influence generally had little to fear. Naval Kishore, 100, repeatedly got away with an admonition. When in 1872 he was rebuked by the Avadh DPI for not maintaining 'sufficient supervision over the class of books he published, he readily complied, promising 'to be very particular in future and to accept no book of an immoral tendency for publication.'!!! With this, the matter was settled. In another instance, regarding a popular collection of Urdu love tales called Nauratan (The Nine Gems), he equally gave in to official censorship. The fourth edition of 1882 contained an editorial notice to the effect that the text had been purged of all obscene expressions'con tained in previous editions. 112 
1873 proved an especially difficult year for North Indian publishers and booksellers. Following the appointment of a committee in Calcutta that was to look into the matter of obscene' books, a list of objectionable works and their respective publishers was issued to the provincial governments. As a result several publishers and booksellers in the NWP and the Punjab were fined without prior notification. Not surprisingly, the books at stake were widely read works of poetry and romances such as Mir Hasan's above cited Masnavi or the famed Persian classic Bahār e dānish (Spring of Knowledge). While the matter created enough of a stir to be taken up by the Urdu press, the reaction of Indian commentators was rather subdued in nature. Some pointed to differing aesthetic concepts and moral sensibilities. Yet there was no general outcry at the notion that large parts of oriental literature were 'immoral'. Devoting an editorial to the question, the NKP's Avadh Akhbār was typical in offering an apolo getic statement to the effect that just as exaggeration was regarded a merit rather than a defect in oriental literature, in the same way obscenity couched in a fine language' was considered quite an art among the eastern writers'. 113

This apologetic defence was in accord with a wider attitude among the new educated Indian middle class whose notions largely coincided with Victorian sensibilities when it came to questions of sexual represent ation in literature and art. Recent research has provided valuable insights into how educated Indians internalized the debate on obscenity. 114 As Charu Gupta has argued, the ‘moral panic' that linked sections of the Indian middle class with their British counterpart worked in a reciprocal way. 'Such indigenous concern was not just a borrowing of Victorian morality', she contends. 'Indeed, British sensibilities were often shaped by indigenous perceptions' (Gupta 2001: 32). Indians responded to the 'obscenity threat' in a number of ways which had a bearing on both lite rary and wider cultural practices. Aiming to discipline the world of the printed text from within' (Roy 1996: 54), the middle classes embarked on a project to shape a new canon of respectable literature through a 
practices. In the process, forms of syncretic popular culture, especially women's cultural practices, were marginalized. Bengal witnessed a collective attempt of the educated bhadralok to suppress songs, rites, and other obscene' forms of women's popular culture (Banerjee 1989). In the Hindi region, Bharatendu Harishchandra excluded conventional Brajbhasha verse from his women's magazine Bālābodhini, considering it too erotic for a female readership (Dalmia 1997:247). Such an attitude was part of a gradual shift from the sensual to the virtuous' (Gupta 2002:40)—later reinforced by Hindu nationalist notions of morality and propriety—that came to characterize much of canonized 'high' Hindi literature. 
The debate on obscenity became closely intertwined with the language controversy over Hindi and Urdu. In decrying Urdu as a language of moral depravity, Hindi partisans drew on the same arguments as deployed by colonial officials like Kempson.115 Raja Shiva Prasad's testimony before the Education Commission of 1882 provides a classic instance of how the 'purity' of Hindi religious literature was contrasted with the 'immorality' of Urdu amatory poetry. Emphasizing the high degree of learning among upper-class Hindu and Jain women, Shiva Prasad juxta posed women who piously studied works such as the Rāmāyan, Sūrsāgar, and Brajvilās with those wayward females who took to 'amorous and

Vicious books, such as Mir Hasan ki Masnavi, Indarsabha, &c., to the Very disgust of their parents and husbands, who find a good excuse thereby for discouraging female education.'110 He also used the occasion to rail against Bahar-e danish and other Persian classics used in schools, which, 'worse than anything--most amorous-spoil the character of the boys for their whole life, and lead them to the grossest sensuality." Ironically and in a further illustration of how much moral panic had taken hold of the middle class imagination - Shiva Prasad's own compilation of Hindi selections Gurkā (1867) came under attack from other witnesses appearing before the Education Commission. Pandit Dindayal Tivari, Deputy Inspector of Schools, and Babu Tota Ram, pleader at the Aligarh High Court, concurred in finding portions of Gurkā, and above all Padmāran, 'objectionable on moral grounds and bound to nave 'a demoralising effect on the minds of the students." 
That the alleged licentiousness of Urdu literature should remain a lavourite topic among supporters of Hindi is not surprising. A much more striking exemplification of the profound change in attitude taking place under colonial influence was the new denigration of Urdu poetry expressed by leading Urdu literati themselves. The novelist Nazir Ahmad (1831-1912) and the poet and critic Altaf Husain Hali (1837-191+), both associated with the reformist Aligarh movement, concurred in their emphatic condemnation of classical Urdu and Persian poetry as depraved, linking its ‘obscenity' to the cultural degradation of Indian Muslims. The spectacular scene introduced by Nazir Ahmad in his edifying master piece Taubat an-Nasūh (The Repentence of Nasuh, 1874), in which his hero, Nasuh, in a deeply symbolic act burns his son's collection of clas sical poetry, has received some important scholarly comment. NOU surprisingly, Taubat an-Nasūh was much liked by DPI Kempson, who personally translated it into English. Like Nazir Ahmad, Hall, m is influential Musaddas (1879), resorted to drastic language to decry the evil effects of degenerate Urdu poetry by calling it a filthy archive of poetry and odes, more foul than a cesspool in its putridity, by which the earth is convulsed as if by an earthquake, and which makes the angels blush in heaven...'

To what extent did these vibrant indigenous debates on obscenity affect Indian publishers and booksellers? It would seem that, to profes sionals in the book trade, the cultural and ideological implications of the obscenity debate were not a prime concern. What more immediately affected and vexed them was the absence of a clear policy on the part of the colonial authorities, which left it to their own discretion to publish or sell certain works at the risk of being prosecuted and fined. The booksellers of Lahore repeatedly addressed petitions to the government. asking for a clear definition of what was meant by 'obscene' books. While readily conceding that the Persian Gulistan, Būstān, Bahār-e dānish, and so forth, contained indelicate' passages, they put up a half hearted defence in arguing that these works were not only the commonest form of oriental literature' but 'a vehicle of all kinds of instruction, which had always been used in schools. 20 The discrepancy between 'the estimation of the people and the government was also noted in the Agra Akhbār, which endorsed the petition of the Lahore booksellers in urging the authorities to publish a list of books considered obscene. 121 Naval Kishore's loyal Avadh Akhbār even went one step further in pro posing that government purchase and destroy all copies of books pronounced immoral.122 Yet several months later the paper adopted an entirely different stance, evoking the negative impact of government censorship on the marketplace. Allegedly, only almanacs and 'low treatises' were now to be found in booksellers' shops in the towns and cities. The publication of literary and scientific works was said to have 
a fair degree of hyperbole here, for even if the repercussions on the book trade were strongly felt by the publishers concerned, official publication statistics do not support the paper's claim. Nonetheless the Avadh Akh bār's critique of government policy is significant in that it conveyed Indian resentment of the hegemonic intervention by a committee 'based in far-away Calcutta and consisting chiefly of Europeans' who decided over the fate of literary works. For the first time a claim was made for greater indigenous autonomy in judging literary and aesthetic matters. Unless able men from the north-western cities were invited to sit on the committee, the paper argued, there could be 'no hope of any good' coming

from it.124 Rather than adopting an authoritative stance, the government should hand over the task of revising Indian-language books to local associations. 
The case of the 1873 controversy illustrates the contradictions of Bri tish policy in trying to suppress 'obscene' literature and the element of arbitrariness inherent in shifung official perceptions. The same books that were found objectionable in 1873 had been published under the British Registration Act for years. Assuming that these books were indeed obscene, the Aradh Akhbar sneered, it was strange that during the long period of 100 years, for which European civilization has been in progress in India, Government should have permitted their publication ....125 
In the absence of a list of proscribed works for the period under re view, it is difficult to determine the precise extent of moral and literary censorship exercised by the colonial state. Nor can it be said how much individual Hindi and Urdu publishers were really affected by the restrictions it placed upon them. In this context it is interesting to note that heightened moral sensibilities did not prevent a revival of Orientalist interest in Indian erotics, which led to the discovery and translation of a number of important classical texts in Sanskrit.!20 This, however, was of little consequence to commercial publishers, for the texts were clearly not meant for general distribution among Indian audiences. The first English translation of the Kāmasútra, printed in 1883 for the Hindu Kama Shastra Society of Benares, as well as its editio princeps, issued from Bombay's Nirnay Sagar Press in 1891, was designed for private circu lation only'.127 It is equally revealing that very few contemporary trans lations of erotic classics into Hindi and Urdu were consigned to print.128 The wider cultural and social implications of literary censorship would warrant further study, especially with regard to the question of how, under the hegemonic impact of Western civilization, North India's educated elites participated in the stigmatization and marginalization of

127 The Hindu Kama Shastra Society was a branch of the Kama Shastra Society founded in London in 1882 by Sir Richard Burton and F.F. Arbuthnot.

specific genres of their classical and modern literary traditions. Frances Pritchett has raised an important issue in highlighting 'the powerful, drastic act of cultural destruction' (Pritchett 1994: 187) implied in Nazir Ahmad's book-burning scene.129 
As shown in the preceding section, restrictions imposed by the colonial state on the Indian book trade, through its licence system and acts of press censorship, affected the indigenous book publishing industry much less than it did the newspaper press. By and large, North Indian publishers suffered the negative consequences of colonial legislation only insofar as they were simultaneously involved in the newspaper trade. If publishers were at times adversely affected by colonial legislation, especially acts of moral censorship, the framework of state regulation imparted a high and lasting degree of legal security to the rapidly expanding and highly competitive print market. It consolidated proprietorial rights of both authors and publishers. It will be argued here that the advantages implied in colonial legislation outweighed its disadvantages. Bayly's observation that working within a colonial state 'both set limits to the development of local capitalists and provided them with access to new legal forms and commercial security' (Bayly 1992: 370) certainly holds good for the book trade. For many Hindi and Urdu publishers the security afforded by the legal framework and, in addition, the enormous possibilities arising from government patronage, were crucial in maintaining businesses and encouraging investments. The NKP, as will be shown in the next chapters. is a case in point. 
Writers, Readers, Literacy: Colonial Perceptions 
Even while British utilitarianism welcomed the advance of print in the modern languages as an essential vehicle of Indian modernization, colonial assessments of literary activity in Hindi and Urdu and the quality of contemporary authorship remained prejudiced through much of the nineteenth century. Attitudes were often patronizing, if not downright condescending. Noting the literate public in India to be not more than an

Azad, who called for a new Urdu poetry and poetics modelled on English poetry, seems more equivocal in his condemnation of obscenity' than his contemporaries Nazir Ahmad and Hali.

'infinitesimal fraction of the total population, F.B. Outram, Officiating Under Secretary to the NWP Government in 1858, set the tone for much future debate when he asserted that 'The attempt of Literature, good or bad, which finds its way into the Indian market, is to modern European 
ideas absurdly insignificant.'10) 
To remedy the dearth of literature and encourage contemporary author ship, in 1868 the NWP government issued its momentous call for useful books in the 'vernaculars, offering a reward to authors of 'meritorious' works, especially those suitable for a female readership. The profound impact of the Allahabad Government Gazette Notification on Urdu literature has been much commented on, particularly with regard to the highly influential series of didactic novels composed in response to it by Nazir Ahmad.131 By contrast, the response among Hindi writers was rather subdued. Of the total of 1164 works submitted by 1874. only 208 were in Hindi. Half of the manuscripts were authored by Indian employees in the Education Department; only ten per cent were awarded a prize. 132 DPI Kempson could not but declare the notification a success and claim its popularity with the public. In actual fact, he remained deeply sceptical of the self-rejuvenating force of contemporary literature. The degree of general culture to him was 'low and certainly not conducive to erudition and authorship. There is little or no attempt at authorship except what is called forth by the hope of reward', he suggested." 
To depict contemporary literary culture as lacking innovation and unable to produce 'useful' knowledge was, of course, one of the strategies routinely employed to underpin the legitimacy of the British civilizing mission. The Allahabad Government Notification not only illustrates the utilitarian trajectory of official encouragement of literature, but also reflects a perennial colonial preoccupation with taste' and 'refinement', in which the 'vernaculars' seemed sadly lacking. 13+ In establishing a standard of criticism ... in matters of style, sentiment, and taste', the Notification was expected to have a canonizing effect.135 This goal, in British eyes, was hardly ever met.

form of government patronage was abandoned after only a few years. What remained was a lingering scepticism towards the potential of the modern languages to produce the kind of useful' and 'refined' literature that could form an effective tool of social and educational progress. Throughout the period 1868-95, the Home Department's yearly Publi cation Reports abound in statements to the effect that few new composi tions were deserving of notice. The 1883 report, in a typical formulation, found ‘no marked improvement either in literary activity or the quality of the works received'. At the same time, there was little or no appreciation for popular forms of indigenous narrative tradition. As long as British literature—eulogized by Macaulay as 'the brightest, the purest, the most durable of all the glories of our country, ... so rich in precious truth and precious fiction, ... which has exercised an influence wider than that of our commerce and mightier than that of our arms' (Macaulay 1880: 398)provided the standard against which all other textual production was measured, disparaging attitudes towards much of the Indian folk literature persisted among colonial administrators. The assessment made by the Curator of the Lahore Government Book Depôt is by no means unusual: 
It is to be regretted that so very small a number of original works of general interest or translations of popular English books should be published. I am persuaded that this state of things will not improve until there is a greater desire for reading. Such a desire will not be excited as long as education is sought for solely on account of the return in rupees which it is expected to yield. The creation of a literature is not the work of one year or of ten years. No doubt that, as education increases among the masses, many books will be written, but, till there is a steadily growing demand for books of a stamp different from 'Sasi and Punnu', and the like, which are favourite reading of nine-tenth of those who are able to read, the Panjab will, I am afraid, con tinue without a literature. 136 
Others, if less condemnatory, were still resigned: 'One is glad to think that there is some demand for reading, however light', wrote one British observer in 1875. 
As is evident from these statements, continuous dissatisfaction with the state of literary production in the modern languages was intimately linked to two other colonial perceptions: the first was the pessimism that had arisen from frustrated efforts in the field of education. In the 1880s, when printed books in Hindi and Urdu were flooding the marketplace

and an unprecedented number of writers, translators, and publishers were engaged in producing texts for public consumption, educational officers still painted a dismal picture, for neither colonial primary educa tion nor the wide availability of cheap reading matter had resulted in a substantial rise in literacy rates outside the big urban centres. The second was the perceived absence of a reading culture in India. Critics have pointed to the central importance that representatives of the colonial state placed on reading. In the colonial imagination, writes Naregal, 'education proposed a system of learning centred on print and individual reading practices' (Naregal 2001: 145). Her view is endorsed by Joshi, who poignantly suggests that in the British imagination Indians in the British empire 'never really seemed to read at all (Joshi 2002: 35). One of the most striking expressions of the notion that intellectual culture meant, per se, book culture and presupposed regular reading, can be 
found in J.C. Nesfield's educational report of 1883: 
In Indian shops there is nothing readable, thatever meets the eye: the shop keeper's name and his prices can only be learnt by asking. There are very few house-holders in India who can afford to buy a newspaper: in towns 1...) the number is less than 5 per cent; and in villages nothing like a news paper is ever seen. But even if the number of readers were a good deallar ger than it is, it is admitted on all hands that the cheap Vernacular press of upper India is for the most part of questionable utility, and that the less the people allow themselves to be guided by it, the better. Surely it is somewhat premature to propose elaborate schemes for educating the masses of this country, until it has been ascertained that there is something for them to read. Such is the dearth of readers in this part of India, that even the best Vernacular newspapers, like the Oudh Akhbär (Urdu) or the Kashi Patrikā (Nagari) do not pay their own way, but are subsidized by Government. In point of fact the only readable matter, that meets the villager's eye, is an occasional court notice pasted on the trunk of a tree respecting some auction sale, or distraint of property for arrears of rent. 1.37 
In the absence of a culture of reading, rural India to Nesfield appeared to be an intellectual wasteland in which education was proving a futile enterprise. At the root of the dismal situation he not only saw the abject poverty of the rural population but also the failure of the colonial education project: linking literacy, the slow progress of public instruction, and the 'dismal' state of indigenous literature, he maintained, in a somewhat

convoluted argument, that the absence of a readership was due to the dearth of wholesome reading matter and vice versa. The cynical con clusion of the man who was soon to assume the post of DPI in the NWP&Oudh provides a superb example of colonial arrogance: 
The art of reading is at best only the instrument of knowledge, not knowledge itself; and if there is nothing for a man to read (as is the case with almost all the students from our primary schools), it is useless to put such an instrument into his hands. In a country like India, where a heap of refuse, a stagnant tank, a bullock cart or plough, a mud wall, a herd of lean pigs and lean cat tle, are almost the only objects which a villager can see outside the precincts of his own hut, the want of books is not compensated, as it was in Athens, by the instructive or mind-expanding character of the scenes and events by which he is surrounded. His daily life consists of a narrow round of small but grinding vicissitudes,' which leave no margin for intellectual culture. or even for the conception of what such culture means. 1.38 
Such colonial attitudes, however disparaging, did not fail to leave their mark on the minds of Indian reformers. Often cited, Sayyid Ahmad Khan's reaction to his observation of the reading habits of the British working class during his 1869 visit to England provides a classic instance of the new Indian concern with mass literacy. *The drivers of the various back Vehicles here constantly carry books or newspapers laid beneath their seats for their perusal while waiting for a fare', he wrote home. 'These men hold the same position in society here as do the Ekka drivers of Benares.' The lesson to be learnt was one of national importance: unless even the lowest classes were able to read and write tolerably, the great Muslim reformer contended, no nation could become civilized and enlightened, or rise to distinction'(cited in Muhammad 1978.1: 178 
9). 
The important question of the extent to which the printed book in Hindi and Urdu penetrated the rural market and impacted on non-urban society remains too complex an issue to be explored here. 139 Colonial attitudes, at all events, stand in marked contrast to indigenous perceptions,

139 The countryside was not altogether devoid of reading facilities. In Avadh, a scheme of village libraries was implemented in 1869. As a result, even a small place like Hardoi boasted its own teachers' library, which was supported by an annual government grant and furnished with over 1100 books and tracts. See Fihrist-e kutub maujūda kutubkhāna mudarrisin ... muntasaqa surrishta-e talim zila Hardoi suba Avadh (Lucknow 1874, preserved in the OIOC).

which tended to view the impact of the printed book with much greater enthusiasm and optimism. We have already noted how traditionalists and modernists, religious reformers and the orthodox, all turned to the medium of print to spread their message in tracts and pamphlets and en gage in new forms of printed communication. In urban and small-town North India, the growth of the Hindi and Urdu readerships and their ex panding tastes generated an increasing demand for books on religion, poetry, and romance, but also on history, law, biography, geography, the sciences, and modern prose genres. The attraction of print knowledge can be witnessed in the sustained activities of literary and reform clubs in translating and disseminating scientific and learned works; in the emergence of public libraries and reading rooms; in the first private book collections among bibliophiles; and finally, towards the end of the century, in the appetite for entertaining fiction and the concomitant rise of the professional author". 1:0 
Managed by the city's first literary and reform society Jalsah-e Tahzib, the Lucknow public library provides a good example of the kind of popu larity that the products of print culture enjoyed among urban readers. Two years after its opening in 1868, the library was in a flourishing con dition, boasting a collection of nearly 2000 volumes. 1011 books were lent out during the year, of which 100 were historical works, 106 fiction, 50 poetry, 125 moral treatises, 200 law books, and 330 miscellaneous publications. 141 When in 1874 the public library became the deposit lib rary for the province of Avadh, its holdings grew to a total of over 4000 volumes. Its reading room was furnished with a large number of news papers and periodicals in English and Urdu which, in emulation of the circulating library, were circulated among the society's members to be read and read out at home. As the Jalsah's secretary reported enthu siastically: 
Newspapers have been circulated amongst 5709 readers, against 4705 last year, and though the circulation has increased, yet the most prominent fea ture of the year has been, the incessant and pressing requests from members for Newspapers. There is no doubt that the Jalsah has accomplished one important task, that of creating a healthy taste for Newspaper reading, and of fostering an interest in what is going on in the world. 142

A good way to challenge and qualify the bleak picture that colonial ob servers painted of Indian consumption is by investigating the vibrant growth of the indigenous publishing industry and by examining the continuously expanding range of books in the classical and modern langu ages through which Indian commercial publishers responded to, and stimulated, market demand. It is time, then, to turn to a publisher who, with his business talent and cultural vision, exercised a decisive influence on the diffusion of the printed word in Hindi and Urdu. The following chapters will narrate his story and that of a publishing house which left its mark on the literary field of nineteenth-century India like no other institution of its kind.
