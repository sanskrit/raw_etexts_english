After long we spoke to Sharada. She mentioned reading our note on
lolimbarAja. She described her own little walk through medieval Hindu
history in relationship to the development of medicine. She mentioned
that her father had a couple of medical manuscripts, one of which was
attributed to the TAkarAja madanapAla. It was called the madanavinoda.
It is apparently a typical Hindu nighaNTu that contains synonyms and
properties of different oShadhi-s and other medicinal substances.
Sharada brought up the fascinating historical puzzle of the TAkarAja-s.
They were apparently great patrons of brAhmaNa-s and Hindu learning, who
by their own records ruled a small principality in kAShTA on the banks
of the yamunA \[to the north of Delhi\]. The last verse of the
madanavinoda states that it was completed on the date corresponding to
Monday 8th Jan 1375 CE. Sharada was puzzled by the fact how could a
patron of brAhmaNa-s and a Hindu state exist in this place at this date?

Investigations in this direction are first confounded by the puzzle of
where exactly is kAShTa. Apparently some people thought it might
kAShTamaNDapa (Kathmandu) in Nepal given that it was a safe Hindu haven
in this period even as the turuShka-s were raging in and around Delhi.
But this seems unlikely because the TAkaraja-s mention being on the bank
of the yamunA and nobody has ever mentioned a yamunA near Kathmandu (to
the best of my knowledge). The other candidate, the one preferred by
Sharada, is modern Kathgodam. Her own family had some connections with
this region in the distant past. There is also ample evidence that it
was a fertile Hindu haven and the local kings were able to fend off
Islamic takeover well until the Mogol period. This is supported by the
survival of several Hindu temples to date in this region. One of the
TAkarAja-s who composed a Sanskrit-Prakrit poem mentions that their
family worshiped kedAra—this is consistent with their location in a
mountain station like Kathgodam. This sub-Himalayan or Panjab hill
location is also consistent with the mention of the TAka-s in connection
to Kashmirian history by kalhaNa in the rAjataramgiNi. The only catch
with this hypothesis is that Kathgodam is not on the yamunA. It is
instead on a river called gaula that does not joint the yamunA either.
Thus, while an attractive candidate we are left with the same problem as
Kathmandu. This finally leaves us with two obscure villages in the
vicinity of Mirat (Meerut), namely Kathauli and perhaps Kithaur
–geographically more apt, but somewhat unlikely for being the seat of
the TAkarAja-s given other textual connections to the Himalayan regions.
One point of note in this regard is the fact that the record of the
invasion of Timur-i-leng mentions a strong Hindu resistance in this
region. This is consistent with the presence of a Hindu stronghold in
the mountains quite close to the heart of the Delhi Sultanate that could
fend of their depredations.  
The literary activity in the TAkarAja court that we were able to
gather:  
madanapArijAta: A work on dharma based on mAnava dharma shAstra by
brAhmaNa guNAkara vishveshvara bhaTTa.  
Ata\~NkadarpaNa: A medical work based on mAdhavanidAna by vAchaspati,
father of vishveshvara.  
tithinirNayasAra: A calenderical work of vishveshvara bhaTTa.  
smR^iti-kaumudI: A general dharma-shAstra work by vishveshvara.  
madanavinoda: The medical nighaNTu work composed by king madanapAla with
assistance from vishveshvara.  
vAsanArNava: A work of king madanapAla on construction of gnomons, some
trigonometry, and Hindu cosmography and calender.  
Yantra-prakAsha: A work by madanapAla on construction of time-keeping
devices, astrolabes, and devices to measure planetary longitudes.  
mahArNava: Apparently a medical treatise composed by vishveshvara
jointly with mAndhAtar, the younger son of madanapAla.  
shishurakShAratna: A pediatric treatise composed by pR^ithivimalla, the
elder son of madanapAla.  
rasaratnapradIpa: A rasAyana text composed by rAmarAja, a descendent of
madanapAla.  
bhAvashataka: A Sanskrit-Prakrit puzzle poem by nAgarAja, an ancestor of
madanapAla.

So the obscure TAkarAja-s appear to have been rather active in upholding
Hindu learning in North India right in the midst of the turuShka incubus
over quite a reasonable stretch of time in medieval India. We observe
that madanapAla took on the title abhinava-bhoja, just like another more
famous and mighty ruler from southern India, kR^iShNa-deva-rAya of
vijayanagara. Thus, the inspiration of the great bhojadeva paramAra did
seem to linger on amongst great and small kings keeping alive the Hindu
spark even in the declining years.
