+++
We described earlier how one installs the yantra of mahAdeva pertaining
to the pa\~nchAkSharI vidyA and performs worship of it. Now we shall
describe that meditation of and the mantra emanation from it.  

- As one starts the meditation of the pa\~nchAkSharI one sees the
maNDala of eight kalA goddesses appearing in the eight directions:  
vAmA- brilliant white complexion, (E); jyeShThA -blood red, (SE);
raudri- white again, (S); kAlI- bright yellow, (SW) ; kalavikariNI-
purple, (W); balavikariNI- shining gold, (NW); balapramathanI-black, (N)
sarvabhUtadamanI-light red, (NE). manonmanI appear in the middle of the
maNDala with complexion of a bright blowing light. One then realizes
manonmanI within one self and the entire maNDala of the kalA goddesses
surround you.

- Then one sees the supreme akulavIra filling everything. He has the
complex of a pure quartz crystal. He has 4 arms with halAyudha and
trishUla and the other two showing the abhaya and varada mudra-s. He has
five heads with 3 eyes each and fills the chakras from the anAhata to
the mUlAdhAra including the minor li\~Nga chakra (between maNipUra and
anAhata) and mahApadma chakra(between svAdiShTAna and mUlAdhAra). From
each face emanates the pa\~nchabrahma deity:  
tatpuruSha emanates with a single head and two arms in the east, with
white complexion and 3 eyes holding a trident and skull.  
aghora in the south with black complexion, holding trident, bow, arrow,
thunderbolt, mace, axe, khaTvA\~Nga and sword.  
sadyojAta in the west with yellow complexion, 4 hands and 4 heads,
holding a bow, arrow and abhaya and varada.  
vAmadeva in the north of light red complexion with 4 hands and 4 heads
embracing and dallying with the 9 kalA goddesses.  
IshAna at zenith, with white complexion 5 faces and 10 hands holding
trident, bow, arrow, axe, thunderbolt, sword, khaTvA\~Nga, mace, skull,
rosary

- After realizing the pa\~nchabrahma emanations he sees the following
mantra emanate from the pa\~nchAkSharI:
