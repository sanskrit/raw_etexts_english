(*Translated from [Bengali](b6041e7007.pdf)* )

GHAZIPUR,  
*15th March, 1890*.

DEAR ATUL BABU (Atul Chandra Ghosh.),

I am extremely sorry to hear that you are passing through mental
afflictions. Please do only what is agreeable to you.

यावज्जननं तावन्मरणं  
तावज्जननीजठरे शयनम्।  
इति संसारे स्फुटतरदोषः  
कथमिह मानव तव सन्तोषः॥

— "While there is birth there is death, and again entering the mother's
womb. This is the manifest evil of transmigration. How, O man, dost thou
want satisfaction in such a world!"

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. I am leaving this place tomorrow. Let me see which way destiny
leads!
