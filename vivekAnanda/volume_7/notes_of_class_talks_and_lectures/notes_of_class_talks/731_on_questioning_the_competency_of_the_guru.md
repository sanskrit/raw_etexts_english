## ON QUESTIONING THE COMPETENCY OF THE GURU

In the course of a conversation Swamiji spiritedly remarked, "Leave off
your commercial calculating ideas. If you can get rid of your attachment
to a single thing, you are on the way to liberation. Do not see a public
woman, or sinner, or Sâdhu. That vile woman also is the Divine Mother. A
Sannyâsin says once, twice, that she is Mother; then he gets deluded
again and says, 'Hence, O vile, unchaste woman!' At a moment all your
ignorance may vanish. It is foolish talk that ignorance disperses
gradually. There are disciples who have been devoted to the Guru even
when he has fallen from the ideal. I have seen in Rajputana one whose
spiritual teacher had turned a Christian, but who nevertheless went on
giving him his regular dues. Give up your Western ideas. Once you have
pledged your faith to a particular teacher, stick to him with all force.
It is children who say that there is no morality in the Vedanta. Yes,
they are right. Vedanta is above morality. Talk of high things, as you
have become Sannyasins."
