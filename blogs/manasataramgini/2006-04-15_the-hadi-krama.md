title = "The hAdi krama"

+++
In South India outside of the chera country the knowledge of hAdi vidyA
has largely declined. I recall a gentleman telling me that hAdi vidyA is
only used for abhichAra purposes. Of course this is an erroneous view. I
was going through Râ€™s manual used for the hAdi krama- pretty distinctive
in terms of its vArAhI and mAta\~NgI formulae. But the hAdi pa\~ncha
krama involves the worship of AdyA-kAlI in the morning, tArA at the
mid-day ritual, ChinnamastA at the sunset rite, bagalAmukhI at the
nocturnal rite and hAdI-vidyA at the mid-night rite. The worship of tArA
at the mid-day ritual is shared by the hAdi-mata with the sAdi-mata.

Interestingly the hAdi followers also accept the formula which is
believed to be associated with the shAnkhAyana tradition of the
R^igveda:

kAmo yoniH kamalA vajrapANir guhA hasA mAtarishvAbhraM indraH |  
punar guhA sakalA mAyA cha puruchyeShA vishvamAtA .a.adi-vidyA ||

Interestingly it is also at the heart of the mahAchInAchAra tantra, the
kAlachakra.
