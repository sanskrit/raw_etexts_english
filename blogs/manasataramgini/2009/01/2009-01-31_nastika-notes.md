R1’s father was not the kind like the prudish modern Hindu who was shy
of laying out the realities of sAdhana and the subject matter of certain
shAstra-s to me. Yet he was not exactly thrilled with the prospect of
discussing nAstika tantra-s with me even in the privacy of his study. He
had considerable practical knowledge about them [having faced them in
action during his life in
Nepal](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/10/05/the-encounter-with-the-pashanda-s-of-the-nastika-mata/).
But still he feared in those days that it might have a “corrupting”
influence on a youngster like me :-) and perhaps he felt it was socially
unacceptable and seen as irresponsible. Still he had an inkling that I
was even then sort of beyond such dualities, at least in the realm of
study. He had a collection of nAstika tantra-s he had amassed with a
friend of his from the va\~Nga country, but generally kept it secret.
Nevertheless, after giving me a basic introduction, he said studying
them was up to me and it was best never discussed in public. I studied
them to a degree laboring with their bhAShA — I could have benefited
much from his erudition in saMskR^ita and its vulgar derivatives \[e.g.
the use of bhonti or bhoti for bhavanti or bhavati – a clear vulgarity
of language associated with the prAchya-s initially puzzled my unerudite
mind\]. Nor could I discuss the issues with two learned tAntrika-s,
scholars of the devabhAShA, about this matter because these tantra-s
were like ordure to them. Nevertheless, R1’s father did perceptively
give me assistance in matters of saMskR^ita in course of the process
without ever explicitly discussing the material in these nAstika
tantra-s. As I mentioned before, in my study I was learning of the vast
web of lateral transfer between the nAstika and sectarian Astika sources
and had a thought of putting it down more systematically. I learned at
that point of the scholarly efforts of white scholars e.g. Sanderson and
Dyczkowski along some similar lines and wondered if it was worth doing
it at all, especially given the enormous magnitude of the task, and the
insufficiency of our education. In any case I make a few notes even if
the conceived synthetic overview is no where near.

In the chaNDamahAroShaNa tantra (CMT), a nAstika yoginI tantra, the
mantra for invocation of the devatA into the maNDala is thus:  
OM shrI-chaNDamahAroShaNa sarvaparivAra-sahita-AgachCha 2 jaH huM vaM
hoH atra maNDale adhiShTAnaM kuru hUM phaT svAhA ||  
Then the CMT adds: anenAkR^iShya praveshya baddhvA vashikR^itya puyajet
||  
The sAdhaka here is actually conceives the mantra as attracting, causing
to enter, binding and controlling the deity in the maNDala. The bIja-s
jaH=AkR^iShya:a\~Nkusha; hUM=pravesha:pAsha; vaM=baddhvA:tAla; hoH=
vashikR^itya:vajra. This action of actually capturing the deity into the
maNDala is something which seems to have rubbed on to the praxis of the
Astika tAntrika-s in Nepal and to a degree even in the chera country,
where they conceive the deities as being captured and held in maNDala-s
(see note on gajapati, the Nepali tantrika). There is even an apocryphal
myth in the hagiographies of advaitAcharya sha\~Nkara who is imagined to
have captured shAradA in Kashmir and installed her in a maNDala in
shri\~Ngagiri. However, this conception is generally absent in regular
Astika maNDala sthApana (there is only entry of the deity).

The CMT also has a specific procedure of dIkSha or abhiSheka for a
female student:  
strINAM tu makuTAbhiShekaM tyaktvA sindhUrAbhiShekaM dadyAt |  
paTTa-mahAdevI-rUpAM shiShyAM Alambya |

evaM striyaH kR^iShNAdi-varNa-bhedenena pa\~nchayoginInAM
nAmnAbhiShi\~nchet |

Here the tAntrika should lead the female aspirant dressed like a queen
by his hand and invoke the bhagavatI into her heart (the consort of
chaNDamahAroShaNa). Then he makes her hold a chopper in her right hand
utters the mantra to cut the flesh of all the mAra-s. Then he gives a
human skull and ritual ladle in her left hand and utters the mantra to
hold the blood of all the enemies in the skull. Then he makes her bear
the signs (pose) of the bhagavatI and holding her hand in hand he
invokes one of the five yoginI-s into her according to her complexion
and bestows on her the name of that yoginI.  
dveShavajri- black; mohavajri- white; pishunavajri- yellow;
rAgavajri-red; IrShyAvajri- grey.

The CMT also gives a long list of female entities who should be
worshiped as the forms of the bhagavati:

This long list of “professions” is of some historical interest. It is
dubious if women had all these professions – some might are simply
feminines of standard professions. This is probably true of some names
like kAyastrI and karauttinI (female scribes or tax-collectors?
unlikely. Females of scribes and tax-collectors). My discreet discussion
with the paNDita suggested an emendation of kulatriNI to kulatthriNI: a
maker or vendor of collyrium or an eye-shade. The hatrinI could be taken
to be a murderess but more likely it is a form for hastriNI or an
elephant-tender. The kapAlinI is reminiscent of the kApAlikA-s
encountered in saMskR^ita plays.

This represents a clear attempt of the nAstika to digest the Astika
deities into his scheme by the process of “vajrification”. The
bodhisattva states that all the Astika deities headed by maheshvara
along with their wives gaurI, lakShmI, shachI, rati etc (notice the
vulgar bauddha bhAshA: “devatIM” among other vulgarities of the bhAShA)
have become at the very instance of practicing the chaNDamahAroShaNa
teachings one with that deity. Then they moved about in the earthly
sphere as vajrasha\~Nkara, vajranArAyaNa, vajrapANi, vajrAn\~Nga etc.
Then the tantra adds that even though these deities are manifestations
of mAyA they have become perfected beings by the practice of these
teachings (jinAh). It then uses the analogy of the lotus: Even though
the lotus is born from filth, it is not soiled by that filth. Likewise
these deities and those who practice the teaching of chaNDamahAroShaNa,
even though it is full of filthy and contra-normative sexual practices
are not smeared by the faults from such practice.

The mAlA-mantra-s of chaNDamahAroShaNa are very common place mantra-s of
this type and follow the general form such mantra-s in the Astika
tradition. However, there are few elements that might be found in Astika
saura-mantra-s and to a lesser degree in kaumAra mantra-s (CM is often
described as a kumAra or bAla). These points are of great importance in
the evolutionary sense.  
mUla mantra-s:  
OM chaNDa-mahAroShaNa hUM phaT ||  
OM achala hUM phaT ||  
OM huM phaT ||  
mAlA mantra-s:  
OM hrAM hrIM hrauM chaNDa-rUPe chaTa 2 prachaTa 2 kaTTa 2 prasphura 2
prasphAraya 2 hana 2 grasa 2 bandha 2 jambhaya 2 stambhaya 2 mohaya 2
sarvashatrUnAM mukhabhandhaNaM kuru 2 sarva-DakinInAM
graha-bhUta-pishAcha-vyAdi-yakShANAM trAsaya 2 mara 2 mAraya 2
ruru-chaNDa-ruk rakSha 2 \[devadattaM\] chaNDamahAsenaH sarvam
Aj\~Napayati | OM chaNDa-mahAroShaNa huM phaT ||  
The points of importance that emerge from this mAlA mantra are: 1) the
bIja-s used at the beginning (i.e. hrAM hrIM hrauM) are the bIja-s that
mark the beginning of the saura mantra-s in Astika saura practice or its
incorporation into shaiva, vaiShNava and smArta practice. 2) The name of
the primary deity of this tantra and the one invoked in this mAlA mantra
is chaNDa-mahAroShaNa which is a homolog of the name of the saura deity
used in the primary saura tAntrika practice: tejash-chANDa (chaNDa-ruk
is a homonym). The same tejash-chaNDa has also been incorporated into
shaiva practice as the equivalent of chaNDeshvara when shiva is invoked
as shivasUrya (e.g. in the works of the saiddhAntika scholars
somashambhu and aghorashiva). In the vaiShNava realm the worship of
tejashchaNDa is seen in the saura kANDa of the hayashIrSha saMhitA of
pA\~ncharAtra. The mUla mantra of CM also resembles one of
tejash-chaNDa: OM tejash-chaNDAya huM phaT || Further, a name of CM,
ruru-chaNDa-ruk or chaNDa-ruk (in sAdhana-mAlA 85 of prabhAkara-kIrti)
resembles names of sUrya (chaNDa-rochis). In the as yet unpublished
chapter 13 of the CMT he is described as tIvratara again reminiscent of
a name of sUrya: tIvrabhAnu.

Finally, generic connections suggestive of a saura origin for
chaNDa-mahAroShaNa are suggested by the sAdhana-s of the sAdhana-mAla.
For example in SM-86 CM is invoked in a huMkAra emerging from the sun
and in performing the japa of the first mUla-mantra his dhyana is given
is as: “sUrya-prabhA-mAlinam-AtmAnaM…” SM-87 and 88 similarly give an
invocation of the deity from within the sUrya-maNDala. e.g.: antarikShe
padmopari sUrya-maNDalasthaM huMkAra-sambhavaM…” or “tasyApi hR^idaye
padma-sUryasthaM humkAra…”).

Thus, the ultimate origins of the deity chaNDa-mahAroShaNa perhaps lay
in the saura realm of the Astika – a lateral transfer of tejash-chaNDa.
However, in the nAstika context, at least by the time of the CMT, the
deity was incorporated into the system of the bauddha yoginI tantra-s
that appear to have been an exaggerated evolute of the non-dual
practices of the shaiva-s. In fact the name used for the deity in the
CMT, ekalavIra, is reminiscent of shiva as akulavIra in the homologous
shaiva sphere. The presence of tejash-chaNDa is Astika texts predating
(at least as per my reckoning) the nAstika CMT suggest that the lateral
transfer was indeed from the Astika realm.

\[kalashajA raised two distinct issues: Could it be mere convergence?
After all chaNDa and the bIja-s are common in tAntrika parlance and
solar motifs are even more common. He is a neomorphic deity in any case
and not a transparent absorption an Astika prototype, though he acquires
the typical bhairava characteristics by his incorporation into the
yoginI-tantra, the CMT. Of course, I am willing to accept a better
hypothesis that falsifies this one. I should point out that CM might
have began his career as an attendant deity as suggested by the
mahAkaruNa-garbhodbhava-maNDala, which is not inconsistent with the
tejash-chaNDa angle. The second issue is whether originally CM began in
the west with a direct influence of the Iranian limb of the saura
influence i.e. a conflation of Iranian roshana with saMskR^ita roShaNa.
An interesting thought … The name chaNDaruk and makes one wonder\]
