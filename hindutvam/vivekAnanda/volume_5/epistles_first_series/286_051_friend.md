HOTEL CONTINENTAL,  
3 RUE CASTIGLIONE, PARIS,  
*26th August, 1895*.

*Aum tat sat*

DEAR FRIEND, (Mr. E. T. Sturdy)

I arrived here day before yesterday. I came over to this country as the
guest of an American friend who is going to be married here next week.

I shall have to stop here with him till that time; and after that I
shall be free to come to London.

Eagerly anticipating the joy of meeting you,

Ever yours in Sat,

VIVEKANANDA.
