Long ago in our earliest youth, we were fascinated to no end by the
evolution of anthropoid primates and spent endless hours considering the
merits of the Orang, the chimpanzees and the gorilla as our closest
cousins. When I was 10 years old I read a paper by Schwartz in the well
known British scientific tabloid on the possiblity of a sister-group
relationship between the red ape of the far East, Pongo and humans. I
was skeptical then, though I admit my knowledge of mammalian anatomy
then was hardly close to its pinnacle. However, since then the molecular
evidence swept away the possibility of any connection with the Orang and
firmly placed as the 3rd species of chimpanzees. However, recently in a
respectable but dying journal The Anatomical Record, a new article by
Grehan was published that tries to revive Schwartzâ€™s theory that the red
ape and humans are more closely related.

I would like to simply state this is WRONG. We are chimpanzees PERIOD.

However, several of the observations of the Schwartz camp in terms of
morphological and behavioral similarities between Pongo and Homo are of
considerable interest in terms of the primitive and derived conditions
in apes. I will merely restrict myself to a few gross anatomical and
behavior points of interest that have been claimed for the red ape:  
1\) The red ape is apparently very able at solving mechanical problems-
they escape the cages by opening locks and have been documented to be
sophisticated tool makers.  
2\) Houses with roofs- Orangs in the wild consistently make roofs with
foliage for their nests. While all great apes make beds at night to
sleep, the orang habitually also makes itself a roof and walls for their
nests.  
3\) Orangs have been recorded by Birute Galdikas as imitating human
activties such as using axes, saws etc, and washing clothes, lighting
fire, cooking and canoeing.  
4\) Orangs apparently to tend to mate often in the ventro-ventral
posture, as against the dorso-ventral posture seen more commonly in
other apes. This posture of mating is apparently much higher than even
the bonobo and definitely higher than the chimp or the gorilla.  
5\) Apparent orangs, like humans have much longer male-female consort
pairings than the chimpanzee.  
6\) Specifically male orangs also have beards and mustaches like in
Homo, and have hair oriented forward on the head.  
7\) Orangs live much longer than chimps and gorillas even in the wild.
While a chimp over 30 is positively old, orangs typical reach old age at
50 years.  
8\) Pongo and Homo have thick enamels on their permanent teeth.

The several common features seen in Homo and Pongo have considerable
implications for the ancestral ape. One may reconstruct the ancestral
great ape from which all the modern forms emerged thus: It was a large
bodied ape with hair oriented forward on the head, with males having
beards and moustaches and the hairline was receded from the eye brows.
The distance between the nipples was wide, mating had a noticeable
incidence of ventro-ventral coitus, typically private, and the females
did not show prominent swelling or color change of the genitalia during
ovulation. The ape tended to form relatively long term consortships,
females devoted extended durations for parenting, and they might have
lived over 40 years of natural lifespan. The ape used tools, made beds
for sleeping, had a tendency to use branches and twigs for decoration,
sexual self stimulation, and as probes, and had a proto-language. The
enamel tended to be thick and the ape most probably processed plant food
by crushing it to extract the content of cells rather than grind it into
a mush.

In terms of fossils the apes like Sivapithecus, Lufengpithecus and
Gigantopithecus appear to be members of the Orang clade.
