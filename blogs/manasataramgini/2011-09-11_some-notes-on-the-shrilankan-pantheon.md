title = "Some notes on the Shrilankanxa0pantheon"

+++
In 1588 CE Christian terrorists from Portugal launched a surprise attack
on the Shrilankan temple town of Devinuvara. Their intention was to
destroy the temple of viShNu and impose the horrors of the Catholic
version of the religion of love on the heathens of Lanka. One of their
chief vandals de Couto describes the event with much glee:  
“The temple itself was vast in size, all the roofs being domed and
richly carved; round it were several handsome chapels and over the
principal gateway was a tall tower entirely roofed with copper, gilt in
various parts. Within was a large square with verandahs and terraces
with a handsome gate on each side, while all around were planted
sweet-smelling flowers which were used during the processions. We burst
in the gates and proceeded to destroy the idols of which there were more
more than a thousand of different figures of clay and wood and copper,
mostly gilded. We destroyed the domes and colonnades and sacked the
stores where we found a vast accumulation of ivory, fine cloths, coffee,
pepper, sandalwood, jewels, precious stones and all the fittings of the
temple, which we plundered as we desired and set the rest on fire. As
the greatest affront that could be offered to the place we slaughtered
within some cows, this being a strain which could not be purified
without the most elaborate ceremonies. We also burnt a magnificent
wooden car built like a tower of seven stories and beautifully painted
and gilt – a magnificent vehicle in which they were accustomed to convey
the chief idol around the city.” Translated from Portuguese by Powell.

This act of cultural genocide ranks along with those of their cousins in
the New World in erasing the native civilizations of those continents.
These and related events have created a deep void in our understanding
of the actual form the dharma in the southern island. This was
compounded by the revivalist form sthaviravAda that has sort to expunge
or conceal the natural form of the dharma on the island. Our knowledge
of the islanders’ system comes in no small part due to the efforts of
Paranavitana and Gananath Obeyesekere. The latter in particular was a
remarkable student of the Shrilankan pantheon – his work is rich in
important original data, but it is sadly marred by his fascination to
create western style pseudo-theories often based based on western
dogmatic doctrines such as Freudism. These theories combined by his
sub-current bauddha bias have made the interpretive aspects of work
unsound, but they do not detract from the core value of his textual
collections and ethnological observations \[We must point out that GO
himself accepts that fact his work is a product of western
conditioning\].

The Lankan pantheon accommodates 6 deities in a primary position. These
include:  
Two characters from rAmAyaNa- 1) the rAkShasa vibhIShaNa. 2) saman: who
is a complex syncretic evolute of the very early nAstika samantabhadra
(i.e. prior to his full-fledged emergence in the mahAyAna form) and the
rAmAyaNa’s lakShmaNa further identified with a solar deity. He is the
deity of samantakUTa and ratnapura.  
Two deities who were simultaneous enormously popular in the early Tamil
and Andhra countries: 3) viShNu – the deity of Devinuvara. 4) skanda –
the deity of kataragAma.  
A future buddha: 5) maitreya – he is commonly known as nAtha in the
Lankan tradition.  
6\) An enigmatic goddess known from the old Tamil country and humanized
in the Tamil epic of the shilapadhikAraM – patnI. She is the kaNNakI of
the Tamil epic who is presented in it as being posthumously deified as
pattinI amman.

These deities occur alongside those inherited from the common pantheon
of the followers of dharma and some others of uncertain provenance.
However, most of these other deities barring indra, have considerably
reduced in their roles in Lanka, though some might occupy local
prominence. From the main six, different sets of tetrads have been
drawn, and are widely worshiped as the four guardians of Lanka (the
satara deviyo) and the saugata-mata practice on the island. The tetrads
appear to be modeled upon the older bauddha tetrad of the 4 deities laid
out in the ATAnATIya sutta \[Footnote 1\]. Of these the cult of
vibhIShaNa was specially associated with the Lankan capital, as he was
seen as the legendary ruler of Lanka having inherited the throne from
rAvaNa by siding with the invading force of rAma. His great rAkShasAlaya
was in kalyANI near modern Colombo. Unfortunately, his temple too was
destroyed in the Portuguese cultural genocide. Though the shrine was
rebuilt later, the textual traditions pertaining to his worship have
been largely lost during the Portuguese occupation and the modern
resurgence of sthaviravAda has resulted in a further decline in his
cult. Also occasionally associated with these big six is gaNapati, who
is worshiped as gaNa deviyo. A siMhala mantra text to this deity
recorded by Gananath Obeyesekere has been translated thus:

“O gaNa deviyo, godly king, divine listener, lord of the ruhuNa country,
bringer of all knowledge and intelligence, we seek blessings in your
name.”

While not enumerated among the big six his presence is seen in their
rituals in more than one place. gaNapati also appears in several
combined invocations alongside some other deities, including members
from the big six and other deities of the classical Indo-Aryan pantheon.
For example at the beginning of certain ceremonies one might encounter a
recitation such as:  
In this blessed isle of lankA laden with plenty  
we give various offerings and gifts  
to the beautiful and powerful  
prince skanda, the god  
O lord skanda  
O lord gaNa devi\~ndu  
O devI sarasvatI  
O goddess mahikAntA (i.e. pR^ithivi)  
We utter this invocation today  
Give us blessings and kindness.

Or the invocation for boons:  
You who bring victory to all beings  
gaNesha and all ye other gods;  
prince skanda who is the guru of all the world  
Protect us and give us well-being, O god skanda.

In the sky above the sun and moon hold sway,  
On the earth below the earth goddess holds sway,  
for the whole world prince skanda holds sway,  
for us here the seven patnI-s hold sway.

patnI full of merit and chaste\!  
O prince skanda, guru of the three worlds\!  
We sing songs of the a\~Nkeliya \[Footnote 2\],  
And sing how diseases subside.

Footnote 1: The tAthAgata-s have a confused several ancient Aryan
deities in making up this tetrad. They include: 1) kubera, the lord of
the yakSha-s; 2) dhR^itarAShTra – he is a nAga lord in classical
tradition but the tAthAgata-s have confused him as being the gandharva
lord. 3) virUpAkSha – he is traditionally a rakSha lord, but the
bauddha-s have confused him as being the nAga lord. 4) virUDhaka, the
lord of the kumbhANDa-s.

Footnote 2: A vulgar shrIlankan game of jostling and pulling with hooked
sticks. It might occur in the month of vishAkhA or close to the autumnal
equinox. It was once widespread among both the Tamil and siMhala peoples
but has now become largely obsolete. It is supposed to have been
instituted by gaNapati to bring about a truce between patnI (kaNNaki)
and gopAla (kovalan) who were its initial players. Its origins might
have even been in the Tamil country, but it is entirely extinct there.
