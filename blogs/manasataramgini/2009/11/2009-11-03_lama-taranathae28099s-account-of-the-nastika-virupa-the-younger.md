+++
In the kaccha country in the west lived a king named vibharaTTa during
whose reign lived the siddha virUpA. He had a daughter who became the
queen of devapAla. vibharaTTa had a temple that enshrined both bauddha
and Astika images. The rAjan was a bauddha but his ministers were
tIrthika-s. While building the temple the rAjan placed human-sized
images of both tIrthika and bauddha deities in the same shrine. The
bauddha-s asked him to build separate temples instead. The tIrthika-s
wanted them together in the same shrine and the ministers agreed to
this. The king asked virUpA to do pratiShTha of the images. He did no
ritual but simply said in a Bengali form of apabhramsha “Aisha Aisha”.
All the idols came out and assembled in the corridor of the temple. He
then asked the deities to sit down and they all sat down on the floor of
the corridor. He then took a pot of water and sprinkled it on the heads
of the deities. The deities of the bauddha-s got up and walked into the
shrine laughing aloud. The deities of the tIrthika-s remained seated
outside with their heads hung low. This temple named amR^itakumbha still
exists.
