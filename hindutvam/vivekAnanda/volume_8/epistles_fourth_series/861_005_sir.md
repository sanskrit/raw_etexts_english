BAGHBAZAR,  
CALCUTTA,  
*4th June, 1890*.

RESPECTED SIR, (Shri Pramadadas Mitra)

I got your letter. There is no doubt that your advice is very wise. It
is quite true that the Lord's Will will prevail. We also are spreading
out here and there in small groups of two or three. I also got two
letters from brother Gangadhar. He is at present in the house of Gagan
Babu suffering from an attack of influenza. Gagan Babu is taking special
care of him. He will come here as soon as he recovers. Our respectful
salutations to you. 

Your servant,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. Abhedananda and others are all doing well. 

V.
