THE ORIGIN OF THE CITY. 




Chapter I 


THE HOYSALA THEORY 

Section 1 : — An enquiry into the origin of Vijaya- 
nagara is essential for a correct understanding of the 
history of South India during the 14th century. The 
problem may be divided into two parts, viz., the 
origin of the city, and the foundation of the kingdom. 

Who founded the city of Vijayanagara ? It is not 
possible to offer a simple answer to the question, as 
i^, involves the discussion of a variety of topics which 
have apparently no connection with it. Several 
scholars hold that the city was founded by the Hoy- 
sala king, Ballaja III. One of them describes the origin 
of the city thus : “ Various stories are related of the 
foundation of Vijayanagar. The fortification of the city 
that afterwards became Vijayanagar must, however, be 
regarded as the* deliberate act of the great Hoysala 
ruler, Vlra Ballaja III. It was founded soon after 
the destruction of Kampili by the army of Muham- 
mad, and immediatley following the. invasion of the 
Hoysala capital ,Dwarasamudra. u * In the opinion of 
another, the ' city was founded * by a king who had 
been imprisoned , by Delhi Mussalmans, taken as a 
prisoner jto their northern capital, and then sent 
back to his country in the south.’ ‘ Ballala III was 
taken prisoner to Delhi, and afterwards was released 
by the Sultan. Hence Vlra Ballaja IH seems to be . . . 
the founder of the city/ f 

These statements are based on very Blender evi- 
dence. The only source from which Ballala Hi’s con- 
nection with Vijayanagara is learnt, is a passage in*the

Bise of the Muhammadan Power by Fcrisbta wlvore the 
foundation of the city is attributed to that monarch. 

“ This year," (A.D. 1344), says he, “ Kvishn Naig, son 
of Luddar Dew, who lived near Waning ole, went pri- 
vately to Bilal Dew, Raja of Carnatic, and told that he 
had heard the Muhammadans, who were now very 
numerous in the Deccan, had formed the design of ex- 
tirpating all the Hindus and that it was therefore advi- 
sable to combine against them. Bilal Dew convened a 
meeting of his kinsmen, and resolved first to secure the 
forts of his country, and then to remove the seat of hia 
government among the mountains. Krislin Naig 
promised, on his part also, when their plans were ripe, 
to raise all the Ttindus of Wurungole and Tulin gana, 
and put himBelf at their head. * Bilal Dew, accordingly 
built a strong city upon the frontiers of his dominions, 
and called it after his son Beeja to which tho word 
nuggar or cily was added, so that it is now known by 
the name of Beejannggar.” * 

The evidence of Ferishta, however, is not trust- 
worthy, and it should not be taken into consideration ; 
for, 

(1) Ferishta records only a tradition written or 
oral which he obtained from some unknown source, 
when the city of Vijayanagara had already become 
a memory. Moreover, the story of the foundation, 
as it is narrated by Ferishta, contradicts the reliable 
evidence of contemporary documents. 

(2) According to Ferishta, Krishn Naig’s meeting 
with Bilal Dew took place in A.D. 1344. It is very 
much to be doubted whether there was any Ballala 
alive on that date ; for, the death of Ballala III took 
place on Sept. 8, 1342 ; f and though his son, Ballala IV

ORIGIN OF THE CITY 


ascended tlie throne on Aug. It, 1343>' 1, he did not rule 
long. Some believe that he ruled until 1346. f The 
belief is based on an epigraph dated in that year which 
is supposed to contain, a reference to him. It records 
that in the year Vyaya a certain Jahlcanna Nayaka 
gave, to a Siddayaji Vodeyar, Kattu-Nay aka’s Jadda- 
pura during the time of Ballalaraya + 

Since the !§aka year is not given it cannot be de- 
finitely asserted that Ballalaraya of the inscription is 
B allala IV. There occurs a Vyaya in the reign of Bal- 
lala II, and it is just possible that the Ballaja of the ins- 
cription may have to be identified with him. Secondly, 
the. gift of Ja.dda.pura, appears, to have been made some 
time bofore the gi’ant was engraved upon stone, for 
the writer of the inscription alludes to the gift as 
having been made during the time of Ballalaraya. As- 
suming that Ballala IV was alive in, A.D. 1346 it is just 
possible that he received Krishn Naig and promised to 
help him in overthrowing the power of the Muham- 
madans. In order, however, that he should be the 
founder of Vijayanagara, he should have had a son of 
the name of Vijaya or Beeja. There is absolutely no 
evidence to show that Ballala IV had any children. 

For the reasons mentioned above, it cannot be 
maintained, on the strength of Ferishta’s evidence that 
Ballala III was the founder of the city of Vijayanagara. 
A recent writer, in order probably to get over the 
difficulty, shifts the time of Krishn Naig's meeting 
with Bilal Dew to A. D. 1328. 1 This date, ' he 

declares, *Beems to coincide with the conquest of 
IVarrangal by the Mussalmans, and the meeting of 
Kvfjna Nayaka with Ballala III referred to by Ferisltfa.

It was, therefore most likely at Tiruvanuamalai that 
the assembly of Ballala III with his kinsmen in order 
to defend the empire against the Muhammadans was 
held.” * To prove the correctness of the suggested 
date he cites an inscription : “ One of the inscriptions 
that was most unfortunately overlooked ... is one that 
comes from Chitaldrug Taluka dated in the same year 
1328. ” It records that ‘ when the Hoysana strong- 
armed Vlra Ballala Deva, together with the champion 
at his side, the strong-armed Bluma Raya, the prince 
Kathorahara, the prince YTra Simha Ragliunatha, the 
prince Kalamegha, the Prinee Vlra Santa, Baiceya 
Dannayaka Cainupa who was the punisher of the 
famous Madhava Raya of Udevara, the great minis- 
ter Ballapa Dannayaka, the great minister Singeya 
Dannayaka were in the residence of the city of Uni.ia- 
male ruling the kingdom in peace and wisdom. *' “ All 

this seems to point to the meeting of kinsmen conve- 
ned by Ballala III, as Fcrishta mentions. It is inte- 
resting to notice- that the place and the date of 
meeting are respectively Unnamale i. e., Tiruvanna- 
malai and 1328. Such are precisely the place and 
date of Ballala 's meeting with his kinsmen suggested 
in the above lecture. ” 

The date of meeting suggested by the writer, it 
must be remembered, is not the same as that of 
Ferishta. He does not give any reason in support of 
the proposed change, except that his date, 1328 
A.D. coincides with the conquest of Warratfgal by 
Muhammadans, $ But that is not true, for the con- 
quest of Warrangal was completed in A, D. 1328.

ORIGIN OF THE CITY 

Lliigh Khan “ entered the country of Tilang, took 
the fort of Bidar, and made its chief prisoner. From 
thence he proceeded to Arangal for the second time. 
He invested the mud fort, and after plying it for a 
few days with arrowB from the naioaka, and stones 
from the mughribis, he captured the whole place, 
Rai Laddar Deo, with all his rais and imihacldims, 
their wives and children, elephants and horses, fell 
into the hands of the victors ... The prince sent Lad- 
dar Deo Rai, of Arangal, with his elephants and 
treasures, relations and dependents to the Sultan 
under the charge of Malik Bedar, who had been 
created Kadar Khan and Kh wiija Haji, naib of 
* ariz-i-mamulik. The name Arangal was changed to 
- Snltanpur and all the country of Tilang was conquer- 
ed. Officers were appointed to manage the country, 
and one year’s tribute was taken. The prince then 
marched towards Jajanagar, and there took forty 
elephants with which he returned to Tilang. These 
he Bent to his father. * ” 

There is reason to believe that Prataparudra 
was subsequently released and sent back to his country. 
He appears to have exercised some sort of control 
over a portion of his former kingdom until A.D. 1830. f 

It is evident that the * conquest of Warrangal ’ 
by Muhammadans took place not in A.D. 1828, as the 
writer under consideration would have us believe, but 
in 1323 A. D,, five years earlier than the date of the 
alleged meeting of Ballala III and his kinsmen. There- 
fore, there could not have been any connection bet- 
ween 1 the conquest of Warrangal,' and the Tiruvapna- 
malax meeting. There iB no indication that there was

a revolt and reconquest of the country between 
1323 and 1336. In 1327 Muhammad bin Tuglilak 
transferred his capital to Devagivi. Thence he sent 
an expedition against the Raya of Kampili who offer- 
ed shelter to Baha-ud-Din Gtuslitasp, the rebellious 
cousin of the Sultan. The Raya was killed and * the 
town was taken, its inhabitants were made prisoners/ 
Then the Saltan’s army next proceeded against Bilal 
Dew under whom Baha-ud-Din had now taken shelter 
and laid siege to his capital Dwarasamudra. Bilal Dew, 
however, submitted to the Sultan and surrendered the 
fugitive. These events took place late in 1327* or 
early in 1328. So long as tho Sultan’s armies were 
active in the South, there was no scope for the Hindus 
of Warrangal fo rise up in rebellion. Tilang remained 
submissive for at least half a dozen years more ; for, 
no revolts broke out, and the Sultan could march to 
Warrangal and remain there without any trouble for 
some months in 1336 A. D. * According to Ferishta 
the meeting of Kr§na Nayalc with Ballala III was 
followed more or less immediately by the expulsion 
of Muhammadans and the declaration of independence 
by Kysna Nityak ; but all our authorities, contempo- 
rary as well as later, state that the expulsion of the 
Muhammadans from Tilang took place about A.D. 1345. 
It would not have been possible for the reasons 
mentioned for ICyana Nayak to confer with Balla]a III 
in 1328 for the purpose of overthrowing the autho- 
rity of the Mussulmans . 

Now, the inscription in which Ballala Ill’s meeting 
with his kinsmen is said to have been recorded, is very 
\j,adly damaged, and some of the words cannot be made 
out. Mr. Rice, tlie editor of tbe inscription, remarks 


* Banri ; MD t iiU p» 234.

that “ several of these names (occurring in it) are 
very doubtful owing to the inscription being indis- 
tinct. ” * Moreover, there is much difference between

able to take the first as a birnda than as a proper name. 
Nos. 2, 8 of the text are not found in the translitera-

appear to be fictitious, and they need not be taken into, 
consideration. The only names which we can be certain 
of are those of Ylra £anta - Raya - Kuvara, Baicaya 
Daijyayaka, Mahapradhana Ballappa Dannayaka, and 
Singeya Dannayaka. There is no reason to believe, 
in the light of the evidence before us, that these were 
the kinsmen of the king. The last two should not be 
confused with their famous namesakes, the sons of 
Dadi Someya Daynayaka, for the name of their father

his officers were present in the camp with him. This 
had no connection either with the capture of Warran- 
gal by the Muhammadans, or Krsna Niiyaka's visit to 
Ballala III. 

(3) lire members of the Hindu confederacy 
which expelled the Muhammadans from the South are 
said to be, according to Ferishta, Krishn Naig of 
Warrangal, Bilal Dew the ruler of Carnatic, tho Rayas 
of Dwarasamudra, and M‘abar. 

Ballala III managed to hold his dominions intact 
nfltil his death in 1342 ; and it is assumed that his son 
ruled for a short time without suffering any loss 
of territory. The capital of Ballala IV was also 
probably Dwarasamudra, for the only inscription of 
his reign is found in the Cikmagalur taluka, in the 
neighbourhood of that city. * As Ferishta makes a 
clear distinction between Bilal Dew and the Raya of 
Dwarasamudra, his iuformatiou should be regarded as 
inaccurate, f Since at the time of the meeting it was 
the fourth Ballala who had no children that was ruling, 
it is inconceivable how he could have named a city 
which he is said to have built after his son Beeja. 
The evidence of Ferishta should be regarded as in- / 
correct and consequently untrustworthy. 

It is asserted that Ballala III was taken as a pri- 
soner to Delhi in A.D. 1310, and was subsequently 
released somewhere about the commencement of A.D. 
1313. X This statement is not based on evidence.

VIJ AY AN AGAR A 


Though the Muhammadan historians are not agreed 
among themselves regarding Ballala’s capture, they 
are unanimous in omitting to mention any prisoner of 
war. Amir Khusrau who probably accompanied the 
army describes graphically the various incidents con- 
nected with the campaign, and he does not even 
remotely suggest the capture of Balliila. On the con- 
trary, a perusal of T&rikli-i-Alai leaves on the mind 
the impression that he was allowed to remain free. 
Barn! who was an younger contemporary of Khusrau 
states definitely that he fell into the hands of the 
Muhammadans ; and Ferishta copies Barm. 


r« i 



Jpiusrau 

‘ The fire-worshipping Rai (Bilal Deo), when he learnt that 
his idol temple was likely to be converted into a mosque/ 
despatched Klsii Mai to ascertain the strength and the circum- 
stances of the Musulmans, and he returned with such alarming 
accounts that the Rai next morning despatched Balak Deo 
Naik to the royal canopy to represent that your slave ‘ Bilal Deo 
is ready to swear allegiance to the mighty emperor like Laddar 
Deo and Ram Deo and whatever the Sulaimlin of the time 
may order, I am ready to obey. If you desire horses like 
demons, elephants like afrits , and valuables like those of Deoglr, 
they are all present. If you wish to destroy the four walls of 
this fort, they are as they stand no obstacle to your advance. 
The fort is the fort of the king ; take it.’ * The commander 
replied that he was Bent with the object of converting him to 
Muhammadanism, or of making him a Zimml and subject to 
pay tax, or of slaying him, if neither of these terms were assented 
to. When the Rai received this reply, he said he was ready to 
give up all he possessed, except his sacred thread/ ‘On Friday 
the 6th of Shawwal, the Rai sent Balak Deo Naik, Narain Deo, 
and Jit Mai with some other baslths to bow before the royal 
canopy and they were accompanied by six elephants. Next day 
Borne horses followed. On Sunday * Billal Deo, the sun-worship- 
per, seeing the splendour of Islam over his head, bowing down 
his head, descended from his fortress, and came before the 
shadow of the shadow of God; and trembling and heartless, 
prostrated himself on the earth and rubbed the forehead of 
subjection on the ground. He then returned to fetch his 
treasures and was engaged all night in talcing them out, and 
next day brought them before the royal canopy, and made them 
over to the king’s treasurer.” 

“ The commander remained twelve days in that city, ‘ which 
is four month's distance from Delhi/ and sent the, captured 
elephants and horses to that capital.” 


B. D. HI. p. 89, 




ORIGIN OF THE CITY 

Though Barn! arid Ferishta agree with each other 
regarding Ballala Ill's capture, Khusran does not even 
suggest its probability. As Ballala III surrendered to 
the Muhammadans his wealth, kingdom and person as 
soon as they laid siege to his capital, there is no reason 
why he should have been made a prisoner. The source 
from which Barnl obtained his information is not known. 
However, his evidence cannot be lightly set aside as he 
was also a contemporaiy of Khnsran. Though it may 
be admitted for the sake of argument that Ballala III 
was made a prisoner, there is no ground for the belief 
tlAt he was taken to Delhi. On this point, all the three 
Muhammadan writers are in complete agreement. 
When Malik Kafur returned to Delhi in 1311 A. D., he 
is said to have presented to the Sultan the spoils of his 
southern campaigns. According to Khn sran, they con- 
sisted of elephants and gems : “ The ground was 
covered by the large bodies of the elephants, and fault- 
less gems.” * Barnl describes the booty in greater de- 
tail : Malik Kafur presented to the Sultan * six hundred 
and twelve elephants, ninety-six thousand mans of gold, 
several boxes of jewels and pearls, and twenty 
thousand horses.' f Ferishta reduces the number of 
elephants to three hundred and twelve, but with regard 
to the other items he repeats Barm’s account. £ None 
of these writers, however, mentions any prisoner of 
war. It is improbable that, had Ballala III been taken 
to Delhi as prisoner and presented to the Sultan, this 
fact should have passed on unnoticed. 

An examination of the inscriptions of the period 
(1310 to 1313) shows that. Ballala III was within his 
kingdom. He was ruling the earth together with

Madigadeva Dannayaka and Aliya Maceya Da^ija- 
yaka from Dorasamudva in A. D. 1310 * In the next 
year, he granted lands of Belhalli to Havihava- 
bhattopadhyaya, son of the rUjaguru Visiiubhatta. f 
The insoriptions registering the gifts of some of his 
snbordinates dated A. D. 1312 declare that Ballula was 
ruling the earth in happiness. % Therefore, it is not 
likely that Ballula could have been absent from his 
kingdom. The inscription which is said to refer to his 
return from Delhi deserves to be examined in this 
connection. The person who returned from Delhi 
was not Ballula III, but his son prince Ballala Rafa, 
the future Ballala IV. A perusal of the text of the 
inscription makes this point clear.

The inscription registers a grant of taxes to god 
Ritinanadka Deva of Kudali by Hoysana Sri Vtra 
Ballala Devarasa in honour of the arrival of his son 
Vlra Ballaja Raya from Delhi on 6th May 1313, after 
the Turuka war. The ruling Hoysala monarch in 1313 
was Ballala III ; therefore, the Vlra Ballala Devarasaru 
of the present inscription who made the gift, should be 
identified with him. It follows from this that he did 
not return from Delhi, but was in his capital. If Vlra 
Ballal.a Raya who returned from Delhi is identified 
With Ballala III, then according to the inscription under

consideration, his father's name should be Ballala 
Devarasa. But the name of Balla]a Ill’s father is 
Narasimha and not Ballaja. Therefore, the identifica- 
tion should be considered incorrect. If, on the other 
hand, Ballala Raya is identified with Prince Virupakisa 
Ballala, the son of Ballala III, this identification agrees 
with all the facts of the Hoysala pedigree and chrono- 
logy. On the evidence of the present inscription, it 
cannot be asserted that Ballaja III was taken to Delhi 
as a prisoner by the Muhammadans and subsequently 
released. If imprisonment at Delhi and subsequent 
release should be taken as reasons for attributing to 
Ballala III the foundation of Vijayanagara, it must be 
said that he had no connection with the building of 
that city. 

The other grounds for believing that Ballala III 
built the city of Vijayanagara are far less strong. No 
direct evidence, contemporary or later of any kind is 
available to maintain this view. It is based upon a 
series of indirect deductions drawn from half under- 
stood statements contained in a few inscriptions of the 
early Vijayanagara period, and may be stated in the 
following manner : 

“ There 1 b an inscription in the temple at Ilampi 
(known also as Viriipaksam) referring itself to the 
Iloysalas, indicating thereby that Hampi was in the 
territory of the Hoysalas.' 1 Ballala III “ laid the founda- 
tions of the city generally called Ilosappattaija or 
VirupakHapattana.’' “ There is further an inscription 
of A.D. 1654 (not at Hampe) which states that Bukka 
was ruling Hosapattana.” ** In the next year, he is 
said to be in VidySnagari, his capital.’' * 


* S. Iyengar i Saiit/r India and htr Muhammadan Invader^ pr 170* 



VIJAYANAGARA 


“This series of facts would put it beyond doubt 
that Hosapattana and Vidyanagara are the same as 
V imp aksap attan a or Hampi and that this had been 
fortified against eventualities ... by the Hoysala king 
VTra Ballala III.” * 

This view deserves to be examined closely. It is 
true that there is a Hoysala inscription at Hampe. In 
order to lend support to the statement that Ballala III 
founded Vijayanagara, it should show that the region 
round Hampe was included in his dominions. The 
inscription, however, belongs to the reign of Vara 
SomeSwara, and is dated in A. D. 1236, f exactly a 
century before the traditional date of founding the 
city of Vijayanagara. It does not help us to learn 
whether Hampe was included in the territories of 
Ballala III. An analysis of the inscriptions during the 
period in the Bellary district may give us an idea of the 
people who held sway over it.

VUAYANAGAKA 


The inscriptions of "Ball a] a II are found in 
Bellary, Hospet, HarpanahaHi and Iladagalli talukas 
as well as in the Sandur state. His authority should 
have extended over these talukas, and probably also 
over Kudligi, as it was surrounded by his other 
possessions. The two eastern talukas, Sdoni and 
Slur, were governed by the Yadava king Singhana. 
As Singh ana's inscriptions are also found in the Goofy 
and the Dharmavaram talukas of the Anantapur dis- 
trict, * it is not unreasonable to believe that Kayadurg 
taliika which lies between Aliir and the Anantapur 
district should have also come under his sway. 

The successors of Ballala II seem to have 
gradually lost their hold upon their territory m the 
Bellary district. The inscriptions of Narasimha II arc 
found only in the three western talukas viz., Harp ana - 
halli, Hadagalli, and Kudligi. His authority seems to 
have been confined only to this area SomSbvara is 
represented by a single inscription dated 1236 A. D., 
almost at the very commencement of his reign. lie 
seems to have lost his hold on this region subsequent 
to this date. There is reason to believe that he 
was ejected from this district by Singhana. One of 
SomeSvara’s generals claims to have scattered the army 
of Krsnakandhara ; f and in an inscription dated 
A. D. 1237, “ he is represented as first fighting against 
Krsnakandhara. " t As Kandhara did not ascend the 
throne until A. D. 1247 , the events mentioned above 
should have taken place during Singhana' s reign. 
On the occasion of his war with Krsnakandhara, 
Somesvara seems to have penetrated as far north as 
Bholapur, for an inscription of Somesvara dated 1236 is

found at PundharpUr. * Whatever be the cause of this 
campaign, Somes vara never made any attempt to win 
bach his possessions in the Bellary district subsequent 
to this date. Ramanatha made au effort about 
A.D. 1275-76 to reconquer a portion of this region ; but 
ho does not appear to have been successful, nis Kogali 
inscriptions stand alone, and they remain the last 
indications of the Hoysala power in the district. It 
is interesting to note that neither Narasimha HI, nor 
his son Ballala in is represented by a single inscription 
anywhere in this region, though the rule of the latter 
was recognised in Kalyanaduvg, Dharmavaram, Penu- 
gonda and Hindiipur taliiltas of the Ananlapur district 
in the neighbourhood. Therefore, it may be said that 
the Hoysala power in the Bellary district became 
practically extinct after the death of Naiasiinlia II 
and that the Yadavas firmly established themselves in 
the place of their rivals. 

Simultaneously with the disappearance of the 
Hoysalas, the Yadavas rose to prominence. They 
seem to have acquired not only the whole of the 
present Beljary district, but also Davanagere taluka 
of Citaldrug district. Krsnakandhara's rule over 
Aluv, narpanahalli as well as Davaiiagere is proved by 
hiB inscriptions in these respective areas, f Mahadeva's 
records are found in Hadagalli and Davaiiagere. J 
Mahadeva was an aggressive monarch ; he seems to 
have allied himself with the Cola chief Irungola Deva II, 
and carried fire and sword to the very gates of 
Dorasamudra. § The sway of Ramaehandra extended

over Sdoni, AlfLv, Harpanalialli and Davanagere ; and 
his authority seems to have been recognised in the 
other parts of this district. * The Yadava rule lasted in 
this region until probably the death of Ramaohandra 
in 1310 A. D. Power then passed into the hands of 
Vtra Kampila Deva who ruled gloriously for a period 
of seventeen years, f In 1327, he was slain in a war 
with the Sultan of Delhi who annexed his dominions 
to the empire. This aspect of the question, however, 
will be fully dealt with in. another context. 

t 

The inscriptions — if their evidence could be relied 
on — speak unequivocally that neither Narasimha III, 
nor his son, Ballala III had anything to do with the 
Bellary district. It is therefore impossible that Hampe 
should have been included in the Hoysala dominions, 
during the reigns of Narasimha III and his son. 

Section 2 : — Hosapattana. — Did Ballala III build a 
city called Hosapattana? Several scholars assort 
emphatically that he did. What are the grounds on 
which thiB assertion has been made ? None. A careful 
search of the inscriptions of Ballala III reveals the fact 
that they do not even remotely allude to Hosapattana. 
It makes its appearance for the first time in the inscrip- 
tions of Bukka I, and nothing is known about it 
subsequent to the time of Harihara II. Though no 
evidence is available to attribute its construction to 
Ballala HI, it is necessary to locate the place in order to 
clear several misconceptions. Where was Hosapattana ? 
In an inscription of Citaldrug, dated A.D. 1355, it is 
stated that Bukka I was ruling from “Hosapattana, 
the capital of Nijagalikataka Raya in the Hoysana 
country.” $ Two points must be noticed in this

context : (1) That Hosapattana was the capital of a 
chief called Nijagalikataka Raya, and (2) that it was 
included in the Iloysaiia country. 

For the convenience of the present discussion the 
second point may be considered first. Where was the 
Hoysana country ? Sir Walter Elliot first identified 
Hosapattana with the city of Vijayanagava. * nis 
grounds for this identification are not known. As, 
according to tradition, Vijayanagara was newly built in 
A.D. 1336, and as Hosapattana means e new town’, lie 
pifabably considered that they were identical. Re his 
reasons what they may, his identification did not 
satisfy Mr. Lewis Rice, for Vijayanagava which is said 
to be identical with Hosapattana “ would not be in the 
Hoysana country.” j* His objection, though legitimate, 
did not commend itself to later writers, one of whom 
brushes it aside with little ceremony. “ It is beyond 
doubt.,” says he, “ that the southern banks of the 
Tungabhadra formed part of the Hoysala Empire. One 
of the early Hoysala Emperors, Vinayaditya J is called 
* the ornamental head of the Kuntala dominion on the 
earth. It is therefore clear that the Kuntala country 
was within the Hoysala Empire from the early years of 
the dynasty. Now in the year 1430 an inscription of 
Deva Raya IE testifies that the cily of Vijayanagara is 
situated in the Kuntala country. Another inscription 
of Achyuta Raya dated in 1B38, similarly states that the 
city of Vidayanagara (sic) * belonged to the government 
of Kuntala dega.’ The same is said in another inscrip- 
tion of Sadasiva of the year 1555. Hence Vijayanagara

was also included in the Hoysala Empire, and could 
therefore be said to form part of the Hoysana country. 
Consequently Hosapattana may be the same as Vi jay a - 
nagara.” * 

Considerable ambiguity lies hidden under the 
vague assertion that 1 the southern banks of the 
Tungabhadra formed part of the Hoysala Empire/ 
It is true that the Tungabhadra was the northern 
boundary of the Hoysala kingdom in certain localities 
at times. The question, however, is whether it formed 
the northern boundary in the Bellary district duriftg 
the reign of Ballala III. The Hoysala power came to 
an end in this part of the country in A. D. 1276-76, 
when Vlra Ramanatha probably made an attempt to 
recover what was lost by his father and half-brother. 
It is pretty certain that the country corresponding to 
the Bellary district was never included in Ballaja Ill's 
dominions. Consequently he could not have built, 
Hosapattana there. 

The Hoy sal as ruled over an extensive kingdom, 
but no evidence is available to show that all the 
territories over which they ruled were ever together 
known as the Hoysana desa. It has been said that 
during tire time of Vinayaditya, Kuntala formed part 
of the Hoysana country. This is not true. On the 
contrary, the Hoysala inscriptions declare that the 
Hoysana country was inoluded in Kuntala. An ins- 
cription of the time of Narasimha II dated 1223 A. D., 
thus describes the position of the Hoysala country : 
“ In the earth surrounded by the ocean is the Jambu- 
dvlpa, in the middle of which is the Mem, south of 
which is the pleasant Bharatavar§a. In it is the

ORIGIN OF THE CITY 


Kuntaladesa, in which by nature a cow of plenty 
is the HoyBala na$.” * 



From this, it is clear that the Hoysana country was 
but a part of Huntala, and not the reverse. More- 
over, the Hoysala hinge need to distinguish the 
Hoysana country from their other dominions, which 
they acquired by conquest : Narasimha IH refers to 
his own capital Dorasamudra where “he had 
established all the wealth of his own (svalclya) 
Hoysala mandala.” f He is said to have been residing 
in A. D. 1261, * in his own Hoysala masala, in his 
proper capital Dorasamudra.” J Ballala III was 
“residing in his capital Dorasamudra, in whioh his 
father had with affection stored the riches of a great 
kingdom.” The capital is said to be included in * his 
own Hoysala mandala’ (svahiya Hoysala niandale). § 
He was ruling in 1306 A. D. over “ Hoysana nad, 
Konga nad, and 18 other districts.” 5f It is obvious 
from these that the Hoysala monarchs applied the 
name Hoysana nad or masala to denote a particular 
part of their dominions which they specially regarded 
aB their own. The Rayas of Yijayanagara applied the 
names Hoysala nad or Hoysala maiidala to the same

region. As the Hoysala maridala was made a separate 
province of the new Vijayanagara kingdom, it was 
very often spoken of as Hoysala rajya also. 

Where was this Hoysana nad or mandala? In 
answering this question, inscriptions alone have to be 
taken as our guide. These fall into two classes. Some 
of them for instance CD. 2, and 3 refer to Hosapattana 
in the Hoysana country ; however, they are not helpful 
either in identifying Hosapattana or in locating the 
Hoysala country ; but a few of them indicate places 
where we should not look for them. The so called 
* Ramaniijaohari edict' * mentions several places where 
the Jainas were to be found in large numbers during 
the reign of Bukka I. It refers to a petition of ‘ the 
Jainas of all the nads within Anegondi, Hosapattana, 
Penugonde, and Kalyaha ' to the Raya. No useful 
purpose is served by proposing to identify Anegondi 
with Hosapattana, f for they are spoken of as two 
different places in the inscription. It may, however, be 
contended that Hosapattana was Vijayanagara itself. 
Such an interpretation is not tenable for two reasons : 
(1) each of the four cities referred to in the inscription, 
appears to have had a few nad.us under its jurisdiction. 
Anegondi and Vijayanagara were included in the same 
snb-division of Hampe-Hastinavati and were regarded 
aB a single city. Therefore, Hosapattana which was at 
the head of a few naduB could not have been the same 
city as Vijayanagara. (2) Anegondi is referred to in 
the inscription as a centre of the Jainas. Strangely 
enough not a single vestige of Jainism is to be found 
in the place ; but on the southern bank of the 
Tungabhadra i. e., at Vijayanagara several Jaina

temples and inscriptions are still to be seen. In spite 
of the construction of Vijayanagara, Anegondi or 
Hastinavati was still spoken of in the inscriptions of 
the time of Harihara I and Bnkka I as their capital. * 
Anegondi of the present inscription should be taken 
to mean Anegondi including the new town, Vijaya- 
n agar a, which could not have been very large at this 
time. Therefore, Hosapattana and together with it 
Hoysana desa should be looked for elsewhere. 

Several inscriptions of the Hoysalas, the Rayas 
o4 Vijayanagara as well as the Vodeyars of Mysore 
register gifts of tax-free villages in the Hoysana 
country to the gods and the Brahmanas. They mention 
villages, nadus, and simes which can be located without, 
much difficulty ; and consequently they help us in 
identifying Hoysala nad or mandala. The table that is 
given below is bound to be useful in the enquiry.

VIJAYANAGABA 


The thirty one inscriptions examined in this 
connection belong to five dynasties (the Hoysala, the 
Sangama, the Tu]uva, the Aravidu and the Mysore) 
ranging from A. D. 1223 to 1667. During this long 
period of nearly 450 years, the name Hoysala nad, 
mandala, desa, or rajya was made use of to denote a 
tract of territory included in the present Mysore state. 
Al l the villages or the districts to which they belonged 
are found in Mysore, Hassan, and Kadur districts. 
In the east, the Hoysala nad appears to have extended 
to the borders of the Bangalore district and in tho south, 
it included the Koljegal tuluka of the Coimbat&re 
district. Therefore, the Hoysana nad, mandala, desa, 
or rajya denoted a tract of country, well within the 
boundaries of the present Mysore state. A search 
should be made in this region for Hosapattana, a city 
which rose to prominence during the days of the 
early Sangamas. The two inscriptions from Citaldrug 
(Cd. 2, 3) slate that Bukka I was ruling from Tlosa- 
pattana in the Hoysanadesa. In another inscription 
he is represented as ruling from Penugoude and Hosa- 
pattana. * And in an undated epigraph of his reign 
found at Sakrcpattana in the Kadur district, Hosa- 
pattana is described, as “ the face of the goddess of the 
Hoysala kingdom, and a mirror of the goddess of the 
kingdom of Vira Bukka.” f It appears from this that 
Hosapattana was the capital of the Hoysala country 
during the reign of Bukka I. 

Where was Hosapattana situated in the Hoysala 
conn try ? While looking for the place, the following 
points may nsefully be remembered : 

(1) It Bbould be in the Hoysala country.

(2) It should be situated in a region where the 
Jainas and the Vaisnavas could have come into 
conflict. 

(3) It should be in the neighbourhood of the fort 
of Nijagali whose lord it could have served as a capital 
at one time. 

(4) These are essential; and if, in addition to 
these, it has the name of Hosapattana, the problem 
may be considered as solved finally. 

Commenting , on the Sakrepattana epigraph, 
Dr. Sama &astri observes, “ The present record would 
tend to show that Hosapattana was either the village 
of Sakrepattana, where the present inscription stone is 
found or some village in the neighbourhood." * Speak- 
ing of another inscription at Hosavur he declares, 
“Hosavur may probably be the same as Hosa- 
pattana." f This identification satisfies almost all the 
conditions laid down above, though neither of the 
places suggested by Dr. Sama Sastri bears the name 
of Hosapattana. Hosapattana is neither Sakrepattana 
nor Hosavur, but it stands at some distance from them 
on an island in the Hemavati river in the Krgijaraja- 
pete taluka of the Mysore district. At present, * an 
anient in two sections ’ is built * abutting on the island 
of Hosapattana where there is an old deserted fort.’ $ 
Having thus spotted Hosapattana, it is necessary to 
find out whether this place satisfies the above men- 
tioned conditions. 

(1) Its name is Hosapattana. 

(2) It stands in the neighbourhood of ^ravarja- 
Belgola in the CannariXyapattaua taluka of the

Hassan district (16 miles), a Jaina centre, and of 
Mclukote (17 miles) in the Krsnarajapete talfilca of 
the Mysore district, a Vaisnava centre. It is known 
that the Jainas and the Vaisnavas would come, on 
occasions, into conflict. 

(3) It is in the very heart of the Iloysala country. 
The village of Bheriya which, according to an inscrip- 
tion of 1666 (Yd. 64), was included in the Hoysala 
country, stands in the immediate neighbourhood of 
Hosapattana. 

(4) Nijagali kataka raya or the chief of the fort of 
Nijagali is mentioned in one of the Western Granga 
records. He was a Calulcyan prince, and his daughter 
Jakamba was given in marriage to the Ganga king, 
Ereganga-Deva-Nitimarga. * It is evident from this 
that the lord of the fort of Nijagali lived a few centuries 
before the foundation of the city of Vijayanagara. 
Since Hosapattana was his capital, it should have been 
in existence from his time. The village of Nijagali, 
which gave the chief his name, can also be located. 
Nijagali is in the Hoysala country. It is situated in 
the Nelamangala taluk a of the Bangalore district 
where it touches the frontiers of Tumkur. 

Therefore, the identity of Hosapattana may be 
taken to have been finally established.

inscriptions as one of his nelevlclus is identified with 
Ilampe, and consequently with Vijayanagara. It is 
stated that “ Vlra Ballala III was the real founder 
of the city of Vlra - Vijaya - Virupaksapura, which 
eventually became Vijayanagar not long after.” * 
“ &rl - Vlra - Vijaya - Virupaksapura was the city of 
Vijayanagara.” “ It was called first Vijaya. But 
besides, the city bore the name of Sii-Vlra-Virupalcga, 
that is exactly the name of Vlra Balla]a Ill’s son.” f 
“ The full name of Vlra Ballaja Ill’s son was most 
likely iSri-Vira-Vijaya-Virupaksa.” $ 

The following propositions emerge from these 
statements. 

(i) Ballala III had a son called Vira-Vijaya- 
Virupaksa Ballala. 

(ii) He built a city called Vira-Vijaya-Virupalcsa- 
pura, evidently naming it after his son. 

(iii) Vira-V ij aya-Virupaksapura was also known 
as Hampe which formed a single city with Vijaya- 
nagara. Therefore, Vlra - Vijaya - Virupaksapura is 
identical with Vijayanagara. 

(i) There is no contemporary evidence to show 
that the word “ Vijaya ” formed part of the name of 
Virupaksa Ballala. No doubt, it occurs in the name, 
{§rt- Vijaya - Virupaksapura j but there is nothing to 
connect the name of the village with that of the prince. 
The term ‘ Vijaya * seems to be prefixed sometimes to 
the names of certain villages in the inscriptions ; e. g. t 
the village of Araseyakere was known as Vlra-Vijaya-

Ballalapura. * In oases such as these ‘ Vijaya * should 
be taken as an honorific epithet qualifying the name of 
the village, and not as a proper name denoting a 
person. 

(ii) Again, there is no indication in his numerous 
inscriptions that Ballala III had ever built any town or 
fort. The Hoysala monarchs seem to take some 
pleasure in mentioning the places which they built or 
improved. Someswara is said to have built Vikrama- 
pura •f and Vijayarajendrapattana. $ Narasimha III 
improved the condition of Dorasamudra * by storing r in 
it’ all the wealth of his own Hoysala kingdom. § 
Ballala III had rebuilt the capital after it had been 
destroyed by the attack of the Muhammadans in 
1310 A. D. Some of his officers made Cancli- 
nayalcanalialli into a pattana in A. D. 1319. || It is 
strange that no mention of the construction of a town 
called Vira- Vijaya- Virupakgapura by Ballala III is 
made in his inscriptions. 

(iii) Hampe was occasionally spoken of as Viru- 
paksam ; ** and so far as I am aware, this name was 
specially associated with the Adwaita matha in the 
place. It had never been used to denote the town or 
the village surrounding the temple. Granting that the

is no evidence to show that Narasimha H had the name of Vijaya. The word 
♦Vijaya’ in cases such as these, should be interpreted as an epithet qualifying 
tho name which it precedes. Vijaya-VirELpak^apura belongs to the same class of 
names as Vijaya-Vaijayanti, Vijaya-V engipu ra, Vijaya-Dasanapura etc.

name denoted the town also, no evidence is forth- 
coming to connect Ballala Ill’s name with it. It has 
already been shown that the Bellary district in wliioh 
Hampe is situ ated w as-never_in eluded in the dominions 
of Ballala III or that of his father. This region passed 
in 1328 A. D. into the hands of the Sultan of Delhi 
who attacked Ballala, and forced him. to pay tribute. 
Under these circumstances, it is not possible that 
Ballala could have founded a town in a place which 
was included in the dominions of his enemy, the 
Sultan of Delhi. Therefore, a search should be made 
for Virupakfapura within the dominions of Ballala III. 

Three places bearing the name Virupliksap nra 
are found within the kingdom of Ballala III. One of 
them is mentioned in an inscription of Mulbagal dated 
1431 A.D. * Another is found in the Cannapattana 
taluka of the Bangalore district ■ and a third is referred 
to in an inscription of Paduvari, in the CJoondapoor 
taluka of the South Canai*a district, dated A. D. 1360. *f 
Ballala III might have been residing in any one of these 
places. However, none of these should be identified 
with Virupak§apura mentioned in his inscriptions. 
There is a place in the Magdi taluka of the Bangalore 
district called Virupapura, where we find several ins- 
criptions of Ballala HI and his subordinates. $ Now, 
Virupapura, is obviously an abbreviated form of 
Virupaksapttra. It appears to have been a resort 
frequently visited by Ballala, owing probably to the 
presence in the place of a renowned £§aivite teacher 
called Gurucittadeva. S It is reasonable to think that 
Virupapura is identical with the Virupab§apura or 
pattana of Ballala Ill’s inscriptions, and that it has no 
connection whatever with Hampe-Virupaksam.

VIJAYANAGARA 


Section 4 : — Hosa-IIampeya Pattana. — This place, 
which is said lo be mentioned in one of the inscrip- 
tions of Harihara I dated A. D. 1340, is identified with 
Vijayanagara. “ In the time of Harihara,’' says a 
recent writer, “ Yijayanagara was popularly known 
as Hosa-IIampeya Pattana." * 

The inscription from which the above information 
is derived comes from Kmidurpi in the Kalyanadurg 
taiuka of the Anantapur district, f It has absolutely 
no connection with Harihara I ; his name or the name 
of anyone else who is connected with him is not even 
remotely alluded to in it- . It is a record, as the 
epigraphist correctly observes, 1 of the Hoysala king 
Ylra Ballala, the son of Vlra Narasinga, who had his 
headquarters in Dorasamudra.’ * It mentions a Maha- 
samanta of the king by name Bommeya Nayaka, son 
of Gaugeya Nayaka who was governing the Nidugal 
rajya, and mentions Hosa-Hampeya Pattana.’ From 
this, it is evident that Harihara I had nothing to do 
with the present inscription. 

The identification of Hosa-Hampeya Pattana with 
Hampe is not tenable. Hosa-Hampeya Pattana means 
the town of New nampe, and it should have been so 
named for distinguishing it from Old Hampe. Just as 
New york and New Jersey cannot be the same towns 
as York and Jersey, so New Hampe cannot be identical 
with the old town of Hampe. Hosa-Hampeya Pattana 
seems to have been included in the Nidugal rajya 
which MahaBamanta Bommeya Nayaka, a subordinate 
of Ballala HI was ruling in 1340 A. D. It must be

ORIGIN OF THE CITY 


And not one of them is to be found anywhere in 
Bellary. Ilosa - Hampeya Pattana, therefore, should 
be looked for within Ballala’s dominions and not 
without. In the Anantapur taluk a, there is a village 
called Hampapuram with which Hosa - Ilampeya 
Pattana may provisionally be identified. The authority 
of Bommeya Nayaka, could not have extended to 
Hampe in 1340, for Harihara I was already ruling 
from that place at that time. It cannot be said that 
Ilarihara was a subordinate of Bommeya Nayaka ; 
for, what little evidence we have at our command 
goes against the supposition. At the present state of 
our knowledge, we are justified only in holding that 
Jhere was a place in BallaWs dominions called Ilosa" 
Hampeya Pattana whose identity cannot yet be fully 
established. 



Chapter II. 

THE FOUNDERS OF VIJAYANAGARA 


Section 1 . — Who founded Vijayanagara ? A few 
inscriptions of the early kings of Vijayanagara 
describe the manner in which the city was founded. 
Two copper-plate grants both dated in 1336 A. D., 
attribute the foundation of the city to Ilarihara I. 

It is said in the Kapalur grant that on one occasion 
king Haribara who was ruling at Kuiijarakona, on 
the Tungabliadra, after crossing that river went out 
hunting in the forest on the southern bank. There he 
was astonished to see a hound being bitten by a hare. 
“ He went to the hermit Vidyaranya, the incarnation 
of spii'itual knowledge, whose austerity was honoured 
and who was like another Mahedana (^iva), who 
(resided) near his (Virupaksa’s) temple. Having saluted 

in his vicinity with reverence he related this 

incident whose explanation was wonderful.” Vidya- 
ranya, the best of the ascetics said : “ 0 king, the 
country deserves to be the residence of a family of 
great kings, and the sole source of great power ! Oh 
Lord, found a city named Yidya.” “Having accord- 
ingly obeyed his command, occupying the seat of 
kings (throne), conspicuous with an excellent white 
umbrella, having indeed performed gifts which were 
even greater than the sixteen gifts, he, king Harihara 
shone in the extensive town named Vidya. ” * 

The same story is narrated in another grant of the 
same date. King Harihara who ruled at Kuiijarakona, 

* Vol. 1. Cp. Ko. 16. 

[ 48 ] 



ORIGIN OF THE CITY 


on one occasion “ crossed the Tungabhadra with the 
intention of hunting, and coining forth with his army, 
saw the forest to the South. And in that forest, that 
moon to the ocean of SaogamSsa was surprised to 
see a fierce dog with long teeth, only chewing what 
had been bitten, and a hare. And seeing the God 
Virupaksa along with the Goddess Pampa, he did 
obeisance to them, and drawing near the yati in that 
temple, informed him of the above curious circum- 
stance. n Yidyaranya said, * O king, this place is 
worthy to be the residence of a family of great kings } 
this is a specially strong site. Make here a city 
named Vidya . 1 2 3 Thereupon Ilariharesvara, doing ac- 
cording to his direction,^ was seated on the throne, 
and adorned with the white umbrella, made the 
sixteen great gifts resplendent in the nagara called 
Vidya of vast dimensions. ” * 

The two inscriptions are word for word the same, 
with the exception of the portions dealing with the 
boundaries of the villages granted. With reference 
to the foundation of the city, the following points 
may be noted : , 

(1) Harihara went out hunting in the forest on the 
southern bank of the Tungabhadra, where he saw a 
hound and a hare together, in spite of their natural 
enmity. 

(2) On narrating this incident to Yidyaranya who 
was practising asceticism in the temple of Virupaksa, 
he advised Harihara to found a city on the spot 
called Vidyanagara. 

(3) Harihara accordingly built the city from which 
he began to rule his kingdom. 

* MC, x, Bg, 90. 

[« 3 



VIJAiAWAuAKA 


According to these two inscriptions, Harihara I 
built the city of Vidyanagara on the advice of 
Vidyaranya. However, their evidence cannot bo relied 
upon ; for both of them are condemned as spurious ; 
the original of the Yaragudi grant (Bg. 70) is not 
available, it “ being printed from a hand copy supplied 
by the people. ” * The Kapalur grant is declared a 
forgery by the editor : 

“ The character is Nandinagari but the formation 
of the letters is quite modern, and in certain letters, 
it is very similar to Devanagari. This fact shows that 
the document is a fabrication. ” j* . — —i 

People who are more competent to pronounce 
an opinion on the subject have nothing to find fault 
with the formation of the letters. $ Therefore, the 
genuineness of the inscription cannot be questioned 
on this ground alone. The strongest objection is 
based upon the legendary material incorporated in it. 
No doubt legendary material is found in several 
inscriptions which are accepted as genuino. _ Bur 
there is a difference. Harihara is said to have 
witnessed something of an abnormal character, which 
it is not possible for other human beings to see. 
That appears to be the most important reason for 
rejecting the inscription as spurious. 

Nevertheless, it is not improbable that Harihara I 
should have built a capital for himself on the advice 
of Vidyaranya ; nor is it unlikely that the city of 
"Vidyanagara or Vijayanagara should have been built 
about 1336 ; for, according to some inscriptions, 
Harihara I was ruling from Vidyanagara in 1348 A.D. §

OEiara OF THE CITY 


But tlie testimony of the Kapalur and the Yaragudi 
grants cannot be taken as a proof for the construction 
of the city by Ilarihara I in 1336 A. D. Therefore, 
Harihara’s share in the construction of the city must 
remain doubtful, until some evidence of a more trust- ( 
worthy character turns up. 

Section 3 . — Did Vidyaranya build a city ? Tradition 
embodied in works like the Rajakalanirnaya and Raya- 
vacaka attribute the construction of Vidyanagara to 
the sage Vidyaranya. But tradition cannot be trusted, 
and its evidence should not be considered, unless it is 
corroborated by other reliable sources of information. 
A few inscriptions of the Tuhiva period, though they 
do not attribute the building of the city to Vidyaranya, * 
declare that it was built by king Harihara I and named 
Vidyanagara in the name of Vidyaranya Srlpada. 

It is said in an inscription dated 1638 A. D., that 
Vidyanagara was built by Harihara Raya, and was 
“ set up in the name of Vidyaranya Srlpada/’ * In 
another, dated 1569 A.D., Harihara Raya is said to 
have built Vidyanagara in the name of Vidyaranya.” f 

Since these inscriptions belong to the 16th century, 
their evidence should also be classed as traditional. 
There is, however, one important point which should 
be noticed. The inscriptions do not make Vidyaranya 
the builder of Vidyanagara. It was Harihara I who 
built it, and named it after his spiritual advisor 
Vidyaranya. This is not improbable. 

Although tradition appears to be untrustworthy, 
there seems to lurk an element of truth in it. Vidya- 
ranya seems to have had some undefined connection 
with the foundation of the city. The name Vidyanagara 

# EC, xx CcL 43* 1 Cd, 64*

VI JAY AN AGAR A 


frequently occurs in the inscriptions of the time of 
Harihara I and Buklta I. It is true that some of them 
are forgeries, and that the dates of some others are 
irregular. There are, however, a few which must be 
taken as genuine. According to A. 16 of 1925-26 
Vlrapratapa Bukkaraya Maharaya was ruling from 
Vidyanagara in S. 1273 or A.D. 1351. Two inscriptions 
of Harihara I refer to bis capital Vidyanagara. In one 
inscription dated 1348 A. D , Harihara is said to be 
ruling from Vidyanagara. * In another dated 1363^ 
A. D., the city is called Kuruksetra-Vidyanagari. f * 


If these records are genuine — I believe they are 
— Vijayanagara had its other name Vidyanagara almost 
from the very beginning. The same fact is revealed 
by the literature of the Sangama period. Kallanatha 
who waB a contemporary of Devaraya II and Malli- 
karjuna refers to the capital of his patrons as Vidya- 
nagara. $ If the name Vidyanagara was really derived 
from Vidyaranya, as the Tuluva inscriptions would 
have us believe, it cannot be denied that he had some 
share direct or indirect in building the city. 


There is yet another inscription dated 1378 A. D., 
which attributes the foundation of the city of Vijaya- 
nagara to Bukka I.

ORIGIN OF THE CITY 


“ Having received from him (Harihara I), the 
wealth of the empire, Bulika raja, in valour and glory 
eclipsed all past and future kings. Having conquered 
all the world, he built a splendid city called the city 
of Victory.'’ “ Its fort walls were like arms stretching 
out to embrace Hemakuta. The points of its battle- 
ments like its filaments, the suburbs like its blossom, 
the elephants like bees, the hills reflected like stems 
in the water of the moat, the whole city resembled the 
lotus on which Laksmi is ever seated. There with 
Tungabhadra as his foot-stool, and Hemakuta as his 
throne, he (Bukka) was seated like Virupaksa, for the 
protection of the people of the earth." * 

The city which, according to the present insci*ip- 
tion, Bukka I built cannot be the one whose ruins 
extend from Hospet to Snegondi. It should have 
been much smaller. The fort was built around the 
hill of Hemakuta on which the royal palace itself ^ 
probably stood. 

When did Bukka I build this city ? A study of the 
inscriptions of the time may provide us with the 
necessary answer, as Vijayanagara is mentioned as the 
capital of the empire from 1347 A. D., onwards.

VIJAYANAGARA 


It is obvious that the city of Vijayanagara was 
the capital of the kingdom from at least 1347 A. D., i.e. 
almost from the time, when Harihara I, his brothers, 
and officers met in Syngeri to celebrate a festival in 
commemoration of their conquest of the earth from 
the Eastern to the Western ocean. Since Harihara I 
reigned until 1356 A. D., he should have been alive at 
the time when Bultfca I built the capital. No doubt, 
Bukka I should have been more personally associated 
with the building of the city than Harihara, Never- 
theless, he could not have undertaken the task 
without the consent and the active co-operation of 
his elder brother and sovereign. It must, therefore, 
be admitted that Harihara I should have played some 
part in the construction of his capital. The truth 
of the Yaragudi, and the Kapalur grants, so far as 
the construction of the capital is concerned, is prdved 
indirectly by the inscriptions of the period. It remains 
to be seen whether Vidyaranya Srlpada had anything 
to do with it. 

It has become a pastime with a few writers in 
recent years to treat Vidyaranya as a nobody. An 
unprejudiced investigation of the inscriptions esta- 
blishes the fact that the 'early kings of Vijayanagara 
shaped the course of their conduct on his advice. 
Vidyaranya is mentioned in several inscriptions of 
Bukka I and Harihara II. He was the spiritual advisor 
of the latter, “ By the grace of Vidyaranya muni, 
he acquired the empire of knowledge unattainable by 
other kings.” * The influence of the gurus over 
their disciples is well-known. It is not unreasonable 
to think that Harihara H would have consulted hir n on 
important noattters of policy. The relations between 
Bukka I and Vidyaranya appear to have been more

intimate. He was in the habit of accompanying the 
sage when the latter visited Srngeri to meet his 
guru. * He seems to have felt, at least on occasions, 
that the presence of Vidyaranya at Vijayanagara was 
indispensable. About 1356 A. D., Vidyaranya paid a 
visit to Benares where he stayed for sometime. 
Bukka I, who must have succeeded Harihara I during 
that year, desired for some reason that Vidyaranya 
should return to Vijayanagara. He knew that his 
request to the sage would not induce the latter to leave 
Benares. He therefore obtained a srlmukha from the 
Senior &ripada of Srngeri, commanding Vidyaranya 
to return to Vidyanagara, and despatched it to him 
coupled with his own request. It is said that he obeyed 
the order gladly, “ as he had great respect for his 
guru ” j* Two points should be noticed here. (1) Bukka 
felt for some reason that the presence at Vijayanagara 
of Vidyaranya was necessary. (2) To secure this end, 
he was convinced that he should obtain the help of 
the Senior >§rlpada of Srngeri. 

What made Bukka think that Vidyaranya would 
not return to Vijayanagara at his own request ? 
Because he knew that the sage who retired to Benares 
to spend hiB time in contemplation would not return 
to Vijayanagara, as it would involve him once again 
in the affairs of the world. Vidyaranya as Madliava- 
carya before he became a san yusin was a minister 
of Bukka. It is said in the Parasara Madhavlya that 
Madhavacarya was the Iculaguru as well as the 
minister of Bukka. “ Like Angirasa to Indra, Sumati 
to Nala, Medhatithi to i§aibya, Dhanuja to Rama, 
Madhava was the kulaguru as well as the minister to 
king Bukka.” $ Probably Bukka wanted Vidyaranya

at Vijayauagara, so that he might have the benefit of 
the counsel of the sage as of old. It is customary even 
at the present day among the Hindus to consult men of 
learning and piety when they desire to build a house, i 
foTthe purpose of discovering the most auspicious time 
for commencing operations. Would not Karihara I and 
Bukka I have consulted somebody when they resolved 
to build a new capital ? Who was there more compe- j 
tent to advise them on Buoh a matter than Vidyaranya ? 
Ilarihara II, and-probably also Bukka I held him in high 
estimation. His feats are said to be ‘more wonderful 
than those of Brahma,' for he could * make the most 
eloquent dumb and the dumb, most eloquent/ * The 
following passage culled from an inscription of 
TTarihara II describes how great Vidyaranya looked in 
the eyeB of his contemporaries : — 

“ May the wonderful glances -of Vidyaranya 
which resemble showers of camphor dust, garlands of 
Jcalhara flower, rays of the moon, sandal paste, and 
waves of milk ocean, and which shower the nectar of 
compassion, bring you happiness. Can he be Brahma ? r 
We do not Bee four faces. Can he be Visnu ? He has j 
not got four arms. Can he be &iva ? No oddness of the 
eye is observed. Having thus argued for a long time, 
the learned have come to the conclusion that Vidya- 
ranya is the supreme light incarnate/’ *{* 1 

Would not Harihara I and Buklca I have consulted 
this ‘supreme light incarnate ? ’ It is not unlikely 
that they sought his advice, and began to construct 
the city after he blessed their enterprise. When the 
construction of the city was completed they gave it 
the name of Vidyanagara in honour of the guru whom 
they adored. This conclusion is corroborated, as 
we had already noticed, by inscriptions containing 
references to Vidyanagara as early as 1348 A. D.

Chapter T 

BALLlLA III AND THE SONS OF SANGAMA 

Section 1 : — The circumstances under whioh the 
kingdom of Vijayanagara was founded still remain in 
obscurity, in spite of the efforts of several scholars 
during the last three decades. It has been said 
that the five brothers who founded the kingdom of 
Vijayanagara, were originally in the service of the 
Hoysala king Vlra Ballala III, who employed them to 
defend his northern frontier and “ to stem the new 
flood of the Bahmani invasions.” * The places which 
were entrusted to the care of the five brothers are 
also described, “ In the early wars of Ala-ud-Din 
Bahmani, when he marched south from Daulatabad 
after the death of Muhammad bin Tughlak, there 
figures on the southern frontier, and therefore the 
more uncertain frontier of his, a Hindu chieftain of 
the name of Harib in the region of the Konkan coast 
up to Jamlchandi. A little further to the east of it 
between Bijapur and Gulburga figures another Hindu 
chief by name Kapras ; and further east another 
Hindu chieftain still of the name of Kampraz. .... 
These three Hindu chieftains are obviously no other 
than Hariappa (Harib), Bulckappa Razu (Kapras), and 
Kampa Razu (Kampana, Kampraz), the three elder 
of the five brothers to whom the inscriptions of the 
time ascribe the foundation of the empire of Vijaya- 
nagara.” f The tract of territory over whioh Kampa 
Razu bore sway has also been definitely described, 
“ The government of the Nellore district, with the 
fortified hill of Udayagiri within its jurisdiction, was a

very important post as regards strategy in Southern 

India The importance of the post was specially 

relevant when the Mussalmans of Delhi had shortly 
before captured the city of Warangal, the capital of 
the Kakatlya Dynasty just to the north of Udayagiri. ” 
“ Kampa was therefore placed in that responsible 
post by the same Yira Ballala (III)/' * 

Opinion, however, is divided regarding the manner 
in which the independent kingdom of Vijayanagai'a 
came into being. Some hold that after the death 
of Ballala III, the five brothers having asserted their 
independence established a new state with the city of 
Vijayanagara as its capital ; j* whereas others believe 
that Ballala ‘ countenanced Harihara’s (the eldest of 
the five brothers) establishing himself further north 
as a great lord, and supported him by allowing him 
to rule locally in the very heart of the Hoysala 
kingdom/ $ It is even asserted that * Harihara I 
was enthroned at Vijayanagara by the old Hoysala 
monarch (Ballala III) as his own Mahamandale^vara 
in the north/ § 

It follows from this that, 

(1) the five brothers who established the kingdom 
of Vijayanagara were the subordinates of Vira 
Ballala III. 

(2) the Hoysala dominions, the defence of which 
was entrusted to the care of the five brothers extended

from the Arabian Sea in the west to the Bay of Be ng al 
in the east, including along its northern frontier the 
territory corresponding to the modem districts of 
North Canara, Dharwar, Bijapur and Nellore. 

(3) the Hoysala kingdom was exposed to the 
attacks of the Bahmani Sultan Ala-ud-Din I, whom the 
five brothers were expected to check. 

(4) Ballala III enthroned Harihara I at Vijaya- 
nagara, probably to induce him to take a personal 
interest in the protection of the realm. 

Unless these propositions are closely examined, it is 
not possible to discover how far they are true. 

Section 2 : — (1) No evidence in support of this 
proposition is forthcoming. Nearly three hundred and 
fifty inscriptions of Ballala III have been brought to 
light so far. It is strange that, if the five brothers who 
founded the kingdom of Vijayanagara were really 
Ballala's subordinates, they should not have been 
mentioned in any of them. It is believed that a certain 
prince called Kathora-Hara is mentioned in a Citaldrug 
inscription dated A. D. 1328. * An attempt has been 
made to identify this Kathora-Hara with ‘ Harihara I of 
Vijayanagara who in all probability was one of those 
kinsmen summoned to the meeting of Tiruvanna- 
malai.' f It is pointed out that * on many occasions 
Harihara’s name is cut short and only the first part is 
given, thus Hariyappa. Perhaps on this occasion the 
first part is omitted so that the epithet Kathora (fierce) 
should be properly applied to Hara or !§iva. In fact 
Kathora is the thirty-Beventh name of !§iva. This 

* EC. Xi. Cd. 4.

would be a welcome piece of flattery for Harihara.’ * 
The explanation is no doubt ingenious, but it is 
uncalled for ; for the name ICathora-Hara does not at 
all occur in tlie text of the inscription, f It is, there- 
fore, evident that among the officers and dependents 
of Ballala III, there was no person bearing the name of 
Kathora-Hara. Consequently the question of his 
identification does not arise. Again the numerous 
inscriptions of Harihara I and his brothers do not even 
allude to their connection with Ballala III. On the 
contrary, they make it clear that the founders of 
Vijayanagara were independent rulers from the very 
beginning. In the absence of evidence of any kind, it 
iB not reasonable to suppose that Harihara I and his / 
brothers were at first subordinates of Vira Ballala III. » 

Section 3 : — (2) What was the extent of the 
Hoysala dominions during the reign of Balla]a III '? 
The kingdom whioh he came to rule after the demise 
of his father Narasimha III in 1292 A. D., was very 
limited in extent. It corresponded roughly to the 
present Mysore state excluding Kolar, and portions of 
Bangalore, Tumkur, Citaldrug and Slrnoga districts. 
Even this small kingdom, he was not suffered to rule 
in peace. He had to face the attacks of his uncle 
RSmanatha, who wanted to deprive hi-m of his king- 
dom, and throne. Ramanatha was a half-brother of 
Narasimha HI; and their father Someswara divided 
his kingdom equally between his two sons, giving the 
Tamil districts to the former, and the Canarese districts 
which formed the Hoysala kingdom properly so called 
to the latter. The reign of Someswara, however, 
ended in a disaster. He was killed about 1262 A. D., 
in. a battle with Jatavarman Sundara Pandyad eva

ORIGIN OF THE EMPIRE 


(A. D. 1250-1273) *, the king of Madura, and his capital 
Kannanxir was captured, f It was probably at this 
time that VTra-Pandya invaded Kongu which he 
annexed to the Pandyan dominions. $ Ramanatha was 
thus threatened with the loss of his patrimony ; but 
he seems to have managed somehow to recapture 
Kannanur from which he ruled his territory in the Co]a 
country until 1280 A. D., when he was finally driven 
out of it by the Pandyas. Having thus lost most of 
what his father had given him, he wanted to compen- 
sate for his loss at the expense of his half-brother. 
This led to the outbreak of a war between the two 
brothers which dragged on for nearly thirty years. 


The struggle seems to have commenced even 
before Ramanatha's final expulsion from the Cola 
country. It is alluded to in an undated inscription of 
the Hassan district which Rice assigns to about 
1260 A. D. § This date is too early for the outbreak 
of the war. In the first place, Some^wara was still 
alive, and it is extremely unlikely that he would have

$ Kongu remained under the Pandyas probably until 1320 A. D. Sevetal 
inscriptions of Vira-Pandya refer to his conquest of Kongu (a. g . 31 of 1923) ; 
and the existence of a few of his inscriptions in the Coimbatore district prove 
the truth of the assertion. An epigraph from. SSrmldevi attributes the conquest 
of the two Kongus to Maravarman KulaSSkham, Although Kulasekhara T s records 
are not found in the Kongu country, we find some of his co-regent Japvarman 
Sundara Pandya in that region. The Pandyan occupation of Kongu Is confirmed 
by the total absence of the Iloysala inscriptions. No inscription of Narasimha TH 
nor of Ramanatha is found in the Coimbatore district ; and the eailiest dated 
inscription of Bcdlala HI belongs to the year 1323 A.D. (588 of 1904),

Ramanatha coaid not have found it safe to despatch 
an army against his brother. 

However, there is reason to believe that his first 
attack was delivered sometime before A. D. 1270 5 
for an inscription dated in that year coming from 
the Cannarayapattana taluka of the Hassan district 
mentions Ramanatha as the reigning sovereign. * As 
he is Baid to have been still ruling from Kannanur, he 
could not have concentrated all his attention upon 
the conquest of Narasimha’s dominions. A more 
serious expedition seems to have been undertaken in 
A. D. 1278, when he is said to have raised the 
villages of Mannanakogil and fought and killed a 
certain Singeya Dannayalta who was probably one of 
Narasimha's officers, f On this occasion Ramanatha 
seemB to have united his forces with those of * . . . arasa 
Gajapati,’ and offered battle to his brother at Solelur. $ 
It was probably in this battle that Lala Maeeya, one of 
Narasimha’s subordinates was killed. § An epigraph 
dated 1282 A. D. records the death of another officer 
of Narasimha called Kondu Nayaka in a battle with 
Ramanatha. 5[ Whether Korjtda Nayaka's death is 
connected with this war or some other cannot be 
ascertained at present. The war seems to have ended 
in a compromise, the terms of which, however, are 
not recorded. In the meanwhile Ramanatha seems 
to have lost his hold on the Cola country completely. 
None of his inscriptions belonging to a date subse- 
quent to his 25th year corresponding to 1279 A. D., is

found in the south. He was still ruling from his 
capital Kannanur in 1278 ; * but he was soon driven 
out of it by the great Pandyan monarch Maravarman 
Kula£ekhara. It is stated in an inscription dated in 
KulaiSelchara’s 15th year (1283) that he was ‘in his 
camp at Kannanur/ f Consequently Ramanatha was 
obliged to abandon the Cola country, and shift his 
capital to Hesar-Kundani in the Salem district from 
which he was ruling what was left of his old king- 
dom in 1287. X 

The loss of most of his kingdom, coupled with 
a desire to provide for hiB son, probably induced 
Ramanatha to violate the terms of the compromise with 
Narasimha III, and embark once again on a policy 
of aggressive conquest. He seems to have devoted 
the last Beven years of his life in waging war with 
his brother and nephew. The campaign opened with 
the siege of the fort of Bettadakote in the Gun<Jlupeta 
taluka of the Mysore district where there appears to 
have been some severe fighting. § Probably the place 
was taken, and Ramanatha next seems to have marched 
upon his brother's capital, Dorasamudra. A battle was 
fought in which some of the officers of Narasimha III 
were killed. Since Ballala III was residing in 1291 
in Dorasamudra, II where he was anointed in the next 
year, ** it is reasonable to believe that Ramanatha’s 
attempt to capture Dorasamudra was not successful. 
Nevertheless, he seems to have annexed a good slice 
of Narasimha's territory in the east, comprising the

eastern talukas of the present Bangalore and Tumkur 
districts. While the war was still going on, Nara- 
simha III died, * and he was succeeded by his son 
Ylra Ballala III who was anointed, as already noticed, 
in 1292. Ballala thus found himself in the midst of a 
war at the very beginning of his reign. Ramanatha 
seems to have turned his attention to Slgal nadu 
which he overran during the same year, "f In the next 
year he laid siege to the fortress of Kunigal, where 
he seems to have met with stubborn resistance. The 
defenders fought with the besiegers ‘ like wrestlers,' 
though the town was ultimakely taken. Some of them 
are said to have penetrated into the ranks of the 
enemy, and perished on their swords as they were un- 
willing to be taken prisoners. J The capture of Kunigal 
appears to be the last episode of the war. No informa- 
tion is available regarding the events which happened 
subsequent to the fall of this fort. The illness from 
which Ramanatha seems to have been suffering during 
the last three years of his reign § may possibly have 
resulted in the cessation of hostilities and the conclu- 
sion of peace. Ramanatha breathed his last in 1296, 
and was succeeded by his son Viswanatha who ruled 
for a short period of three or four years, though 
nothing is known about the events that happened in 
his reign. With his death, the Tamil branch of the 
HoyBala family became extinct, and consequently the 
Hoysala dominions were re-united under Ballala III. 

The death of Yifiwanatha freed Ballaja HI from an 
enemy who might beoome dangerous at any time ; and

of his cousin's territory increased his resources, and 
strengthened his position. ^He was now ready to turn 
his attention to external conquest. He seems to have 
come into conflict with the Pandyas about 1297, for, 
he is styled * the conqueror of the Pandya ’ in an 
epigraph of Hedatale in the Nanjangud taluha. * The 
Pandya whom he conquered about this time should 
have been one of the numerous Alupa chiefs that were 
ruling on the west coast ; but his attention should have 
been drawn to the north rather than the west; for, 
the extensive Yadava dominions lay almost unprotect- , 
ed owing to the invasion of Ala-ud-Din Khilji. Some 
of the Semj.a feudataries had thrown off the yoke of 
Devagiri, and were busy in carving out kingdoms 
for themselves. The time, therefore, should have 
appeared very opportune for launching an attack on 
the territories belonging to the Seunas who were the 
hereditary enemies of Ballala’s family. 

The feud between the Hoysalas and the Sennas 
was rooted in the past. It had its origin during the last 
quarter of the twelfth century when the country was 
seething with confusion and political unrest. In 1176, 
Sankama Deva of the Kalacurya dynasty ascended 
the throne which his. father had usurped from the 
Calukyas ; f but from the day of his accession he 
had to face several troubles. Sometfwara IV, the last of 
the Calukyas was striving hard to regain the kingdom 
which his father had lost. About A. D. 1182, his 
general Brahma, wrested from the Kalacuryas a large 
part of the kingdom. $ The supremacy had thus 
passed once again from the Kalacuryas to the 
Calukyas. As Someswara IV was not a strong ruler,

many feudatories of his family taking advantage of his 
incapacity asserted their independence. The Seunas 
appropriated the northern districts ; the Hoysalas 
established themselves in the south ; and the TCakatTyas 
made themselves masters of the east. In addition to 
these, there arose througout the kingdom, several petty 
principalities which showed no inclination to submit to 
anyone. Moreover, the ambitious policies pursued by 
the rulers of the three kingdoms, brought them often 
into conflict with one another which resulted in the 
outbreak of bloody and protracted wars. 

* 

Someswara had to maintain bis authority over 
these turbulent feudatories. Although he succeeded in 
exercising some power for a few years, he had at last to 
succumb to the inevitable. His general, Brahma was 
defeated by the Hoysala Vira Ballala II * , and what- 
ever power he might have exercised before this, 
completely vanished with the disaster. The disappear- 
ance of Someswara IV from the political arena left 
his nominal feudatories free to grab as much of 
his territory as they could seize. The land-hunger 
naturally engendered war and very soon the peaceful 
countryside became disturbed by the marches of the 
contending armies f. The bone of contention was 
the doab between the Kr§na and the Tungabhadra. 
At the commencement of the period, a large portion 
of this area passed into the hands of the Seuija chief, 
BhiUama, who consequently assumed the title of “ the 
beloved of the goddess of the sovereignty of Karnata 
country, " $ His sway, however, did not- extend 
over the whole of Kanjata, as the Hoysalas of Dora- 
samudra, the Pandyas of Ucchangi, and the ICadambas

of Goa and Hanangal among others did not acknow- 
ledge his supremacy. He was not even allowed to rule 
peacefully that bit of Karnata which he had won ; for 
his right to rule Karnata was soon questioned, and he 
was ousted from his place by a successful rival, VTra 
Balliija II, the king of the Hoysalas. 

Ballala II ascended the throne in A. D. 1173 * . 
During the first ten years of his reign he was busy 
consolidating his position by effecting the conquest 
of some petty principalities in his neighbourhood. 
The Cengalvas were conquered in 1173 ; f and the 
Pandyan fort of Ucchangi in the Nolambavadi was 
subjugated in 1177. $ About 1179, he fought with the 
Kalacurya king, Sankama Deva whom he defeated. § 
It was probably during these years that he acquired the 
tract of country corresponding to the western half of 
the present Bellary district. Having thus strengthened" 
his position, he commenced the struggle with the 
Calukyas and the Seunas for establishing his supremacy 
over Northern Karnata. His victory over Brahma, the 
general of Someswara, has already been noticed. He 
penetrated into the Dharwar oountry, and attacked 
Bhillama. A decisive battle was fought at Soratur in 
the Gadag taluka in A. D. 1191-2, and Ballala won a 
glorious victory. TJ It was probably on this occasion 
that he slew Jaitrasimha, the trusted minister and 
general of Bhillama. Most of Northern Kanjata conse- 
quently passed into the hands of the Hoysala king. 
The extent of hiB territory excluding the Gangavadi, 
Ninety-six Thousand country is described in an inscrip- 
tion of Hirehad&gaili* It embraced Nolambavadi 32000,

Banavase 12000, Huligere 300, the two Beluvolas, 
and Masavadi right up to Heddore. * A portion 
of Sindavadi 1000 seems to have been included in it; 
for Ballala IPs inscriptions are found as far north-east 
as Kurugodu in the Bellary district, f Although 
Ballala IPs authority extended over portions of North 
C'anara, Dharwar, Raicur, and Bellary districts, it was 
never recognised on the northern banks of the Krtma 
and the Malaprabha. The northern boundary of the 
“ Hoysala kingdom, ” it is said, “ was evidently the 
Malaprabha river, and the Krsna from the point where 
the Malaprabha joins it.” + All the inscriptions of 
Ballala II are found only to the south of these rivers, 
none being fonnd on the north. 

Ballala II ruled the conquered country undisturbed 
for nearly twenty years. His authority was then 
challenged by the Seuna king, Singhana, a grandson 
of his old enemy, Bhillama. Though it is generally 
believed that Singhana ascended the throne in 
A. D. 1210, available epigraphic evidence seems to 
indicate that the event should have taken place, at 
least seven years earlier. An inscription of Devarabetta 
in the Xdoni taluka dated in A. D. 1210 is said to 
correspond to his 6th regnal year. § Another inscrip- 
tion from Peddakottalika in the same taluka is dated 
in A. D. 1203 ; *([ a third epigraph from Gorantla in the 
Kurnool taluka is dated in A. D. 1205. II It is obvious 
that Singhana was governing the kingdom from 
A. D. 1203 to 1210, though his activities during this 
period are yet unknown. His struggle with Ballala II 
did not commence until 1210. It is stated in an

inscription dated in the cyclic year Vyaya correspond- 
ing to A. D. 1226 that it was sixteen years since 
Singhana entered the Dharwar country * . Therefore, 
the Seuna reconquest of Dharwar should have begun 
in A. D. 1210. Ballala II seems to have held his own 
for at least two years ; for the latest date of his inscrip- 
tions in Dharwar is 1212, f after which no Hoysala 
record is found in any part of the district. He was 
then forced to retire into his own country which 
became the objective of a series of Seuna invasions 
during the succeeding years. Two inscriptions from the 
Sorab taluka dated respectively in 1211 and 1212 allude 
to an invasion of Singhanadeva. J Another undated 
epigraph from M&llapura refers to an expedition which 
Ballula II had despatched under the command of 
Maliadeva Dannnyaka against Singhanadeva. § These 
records indicate that there was severe fighting in the 
north-western Mysore between the Hoysalas and the 
Seunas in which the latter seemi to have gained the 
upperhand. A study of the inscriptions reveals the 
fact that the Seunas displaced the Hoysalas in parts of 
the Simoga and Citaldrug districts either during the 
reign of Ballala II or in that of his successor. The 
Hoysala power was put an end to in the Sorab taluka 
in 1212 ; and although Some^wara seems to have made 
a few sporadic efforts to regain what was lost by his 
grandfather, the Seunas managed to maintain their 
rule probably until 1310. A. D. Though the last Seuna 
inscription is dated in 1300, the earliest of Ballala III 
is assigned to 1314. It is not unlikely that Rama- 
candra, in spite of his several misfortunes, was able to

keep a semblance of bis authority until his death. 
The Hoysala rule lasted in Sagar until 1226. Singhana 
seems to have conquered it during the reign of 
Narasimha II or that of his son. It was not until 1299 
that the Iloysalas could secure a footing in the region 
once again. In Sikarpur, the rule of Ballala II was 
brought to an end in A. D. 1215, and the Seunas held 
undisputed sway over the taluka until 1294-5. Ilonnali 
taluka passed into the hands of the Seunas in 1215 ; 
and in spite of the attacks of Narasimha III, it remained 
in their possession until 1294. Since the earliest of 
Ballala Ill's inscriptions is assigned to A. D. 1814, the 
Seuna rule may be supposed to have continued until the 
end. The exact date of the conquest of the Cannagiri 
taluka cannot be ascertained. The last Hoysala inscrip- 
tion is dated in 1233, the last year of the reign of 
Narasimha II. Neither Some£wara, nor Narasimha IH 
is represented even by a single record. It is obvious 
that the Hoysalas had lost their hold on the region 
subsequent to the death of Narasimha II ; but the 
earliest SSuija grant belongs to 1265. It is not known 
when between 1283 and 1265 tbis area passed from 
the Hoysalas to the Seunas. Davanagere was the only 
taluka of the Citaldrug district, conquered by tbe 
Seunas. The conquest seems to have been effected 
during the last days of Singhana. Notwithstanding 
the feeble attempts of Narasimha IH to dislodge tbe 
Seunas, they remained in this part of the country till 
at least 1308, The Hoysala authority in the Bellary 
district came to an end, as already noticed, during 
the reign of Some£wara. Kamanatha, no doubt, led an 
expedition as far as Kogli in 1275-6, * but his rule did 
not take root in the soil. It may be said that the 
Seuijas not only succeeded in driving the Hoysalas out

of North Karnata but established themselves perma- 
nently in a strip of Hoysala territory to the south of 
the Tungabhadra extending from Bellary in the east to 
the Western Ghats. The territory lost by the Hoysalas 
between 1212 and 1292 roughly corresponded in extent 
to Banavase, Nolambavadi, the Belvolas, Masavadi, 
and Sindavadi. 

Ballala III set his mind on the recovery of the 
territory lost by his predecessors. His war with the 
Sennas seems to have begun in 1299. lie made an 
attack upon Koti Nayaka, the ruler of Santalige 
Thousand, and laid siege to his capital Hosagunda which 
he captured*. He took Koti Nayaka prisoner, and 
carried off his elephant, f Erupeya Dannayaka, one of 
his own officers, was appointed the ruler of the district. J 
It has been suggested that Koti Nayaka was one of the 
refractory chiefs, who rose up in revolt against 
Ballala III ; § but Santalige Thousand was conquered 
by the Senna general Parasuvamadeva in 1293 ; and 
therefore, at the time of Ballala’s invasion it should have 
been a Seuna dependency, or what is more likely an 
independent principality having thrown off the Seuna 
yoke subsequent to Ala-ud-Din’s attack upon Devagiri 
in 1295. Be that as it may. Ballala Ill’s appetite for 
conquest became keener by his initial success ; he 
invaded the province of Banavase in 1S00, and lay 
encamped in the neighbourhood of the village of 
Sinsi. [| The presence of Ballala in their country seem 
to have united all the chiefs of the district under the 
leadership of Gangeya Sahini, the great minister of

the Kadamba prince, Kavadeva. In the battle that was 
fought on the occasion, Ballala III was defeated 
and driven back. This reverse, however, did not deter 
him from his purpose, and he repeated his attack on 
Ban a vase three years later, and pitched his tents once 
again at Sirisi where he was formerly defeated, * 
Gangeya Sahini having mustered his troops offered him 
battle but the result of the engagement is not known. 
The progress of the invasion should have been greatly 
checked owing to a diversion caused by the Seuna 
attack on the north-eastern frontier of the Hoysala 
dominions. At the oommand of king Ramadeva, his 
general Kampiladeva advanced upon Holiilkere and 
took it. t He then entered the principality of Bemma- 
tanakallu, and indicted a defeat upon its ruler, 
Someya Nayaka. $ This BeemB to have produced the 
desired effect ; and Ballala III was obliged to keep his 
plans of conquest in abeyance at least for one year. 
However, he invaded the Seuna kingdom in 1804, and 
laid siege to Nakkigundi, which he captured after 
winning a victory over the enemy. § Ramadeva, 
who seems to have been greatly angered by the 
persistent attacks upon his kingdom, took personally the 
command of the army in order to push back the invader. 
Both the armies met somewhere in the Banavase 
country and a sanguinary battle took place. While 
issuing the order for battle, Ramadeva commanded 
his officers saying “ you must take the king of 
Kar^atakas, and seize and give me that tiger's cub " 
On this, his soldiers rushed upon the enemy, and 
1 making no hesitation ’ * performed various exploits.' 
It is not known how the battle ended. Probably

grasped. With this battle the struggle between the 
Saunas and the Hoysalas may be said to have come to 
an end, for no encounter is recorded during the 
subsequent years. 

Ballala devoted his attention during the next two 
years to the reduction of the fort of Nidugal in the 
Anantapur district. Nidugal was the capital of a small 
but powerful Cola principality the rulers of which 
had been hostile to the Hoysalas Bince the middle of 
the thirteenth century. Irungoladeva II, accompanied 
by his friend Guleya Nayaka, led an attack upon the 
fort of Snebidderisi in the Turnkur taluka in 1269, * 
He also participated in the attack of the Seuna 
general, Saluva Tikkama on Dorasamudra in 1276. f 
It was only natural that Hoysala Narasiraha III should 
have retaliated. He marched upon the fort in 1286, 
and after a siege of a few months captured it ; $ but 
it was retaken by Baica GamUpati , the minister of 
Ganeswaradeva, a grandson of Irungola n, § and it 
remained in the possession of the Colas ever since. 
The reduction of Nidugal is not mentioned in any of 
Ballala HPb records. He was fighting with somebody 
in 1307, for a grant was made during that year for the 
victory of his sword and arm. He is mentioned for 
the first time as the ruler of Nidugal in an inscription 
dated A. D. 1308. || It is reasonable to suppose that 
the conquest had taken place before that date. As he 
was busy from 1292 to 1305 fighting either with his 
uncle, Ramana tha or with the Seuijas, it iB unlikely that 
he could have found time to undertake this conquest 
during those years. Therefore, the subjugation of

Ni&ngal should have taken place either in 1306 or in 
the succeeding year. Ballala appointed Aliya Maceya 
Daijnayaka as the governor of the conquered terri- 
tory; but the people did not remain docile; and on 
occasions they caused much trouble to Aliya Maceya 
and his sons. * In spite of the disturbances which broke 
the peace now and then, the Hoysala power was never 
seriously impaired and the district remained in the 
possession of Aliya Maoeya’s family until 1340. f 

The HoyBala connection with the south ceased, 
as noticed already, about 1280 A. D., when Ramanatha 
had to abandon Cola mandala , and retire to a new 
capital at Hesar-Kundani. The country which for two 
generations the Hoysalas ruled was occupied by the 
Pandyan monarch, Maravarman Kulasekhara. The 
Paij.dyan rule remained undisturbed for nearly thirty 
years ; but towards the close of the first decade of 
the fourteenth century, a civil war broke out in the 
Paiidyan kingdom owing to the rivalry between Vlra 
PamjLya and Sundara Pandya, the two sons of Kula- 
sekhara. This was an opportunity which Ballala III 
could not allow to pass unnoticed. Therefore, he 
marched on the territory of the Pandyan brothers 
“ for the purpose of sacking their two empty cities 
and plundering the merchants/' $ He was, however, 
balked of his prey by the intrusion of an enemy of 
whose advance he seems to have been totally unaware. 

| Ala-ud-Din Khilji who ascended the throne of 
Delhi in 1296, had despatched an expedition under the 
command of Malik Kafur against the Hindu kingdoms 
of Deccan and South India in 1810. The expedition 
reached Devagiri, and was welcomed by Ramadeva who

remained loyal to his sovereign since 1295. He 
provided the Mu.SBalm.an army with the necessary 
supplies, and commanded his dalavay , Parasuramadeva 
to act as its guide on the inarch to Dorasamudra, 
the capital of Ballala III. * On hearing of the advance 
of the Muhammadan army, Ballala was obliged to 
return to his country for the purpose of organising its 
defence. The Muhammadan historians make it appear 
that he surrendered without any resistance. The truth 
seems to be quite the opposite. It is said in two ins- 
criptions assigned to 1310, that one of Ballala’s officers 
called Baica Nayaka perished in a battle with the 
Muhammadans, t And an epigraph dated 1316 refers 
to the rebuilding of his residence at Dorasamudra. J 
It is evident from these, that Ballala fought at least 
one or two battles with the Mussalmans before he 
allowed them to approach his capital, which they 
ultimately besieged and partly destroyed. Having 
realised the futility of further resistance, he sued for 
and obtained peace by surrendering all his wealth. 

The Muhammadan invasion exhausted Ballala's 
resources and paralysed his strength. He remained 
thoroughly inactive during the next few years engag- 
ing himself in repairing the damage done to his 
capital and kingdom by the invaders. He appears to 
have been so far successful in recovering his strength, 
that in 1317 he launched forth an expedition of 
conquest against Tulu nad. An army under the 
command of Sahkiya Sahini, a brother-in-law of 
Ballala Hi’s senior house minister, Baceya Dannayaka 
marched against Basavadeva of Gandavur below the

against a place called Mutt , where a battle was 

fought in which the Tuluva army is said to have been 
destroyed. The small principality of Setu was proba- 
bly subdued at this time, as the chief of the place had 
become a subordinate of Ballala III sometime before 
1320. * The conquest of Tulu nad extending as far as 
Barakur and Mangalore was completed sometime 
before 1333 A. D. As a mark of his victory over the 
Alupas, Ballala seems to have assumed the Alupa 
title, Pandya Cakravartin. f 

While the campaign in Tulu nad was still in 
progress, Ballala III had to intervene in the affairs of 
the Pan^yan kingdom. The Muhammadan invasion 
seems to have Bcaroely affected the course of the civil 
war. Vira Pandya, the eldest son of Kulasekhara was 
governing the northern districts of the kingdom from 
his capital Kannanur. He was attacked by his son 
Samudra Paiidya whom Parakrama Pandya, another 
chief of the family had joined. Vira Pandya whose 
position was not probably strong seems to have invited 
Ballala HI to go to his assistance, and the latter 
appears to have readily accepted the invitation. $ 
Ballala marched at the head of an army and reached 
in 1318 Arunasamudra § which he made his head- 
quarters for the time being. Qe is said to have been 
marching in 1318 from Kannanur to some unknown 
destination, when he was attacked by the enemy, 
The result of the aotion is not recorded, but it is not 
unlikely that he sustained a defeat. The progress of his 
campaign was checked suddenly by the appearance 
of the Muhammadans on hiB northern frontier. Mubarak

ORIGIN OF THE EMPIRE 

Shah Kh ilji who ascended the throne of Delhi in A. D. 
1317, marched personally at the head of his army 
to snbdue Harapaladeva of Devagiri who rose up in 
revolt. He captured Harapala, and flayed him alive. On 
this occasion, the Sultan remained at Devagiri for some 
months when he subjugated the whole of Maharastra 
and divided it among his officers. At the same time 
he is said to have appointed military governors to 
Gulburga, Saghar, and Dwarasamudra. It has been 
asserted that “ the HoyBala (Ballala HI) does not figure 
in the organisation of the Mahratta country by 
Mubarak, and the placing of the garrisons in the 
various forts along the Hoysala frontier, or in the 
subsequent invasion of Ma’bar by Khusru Kh an.” * 
The evidence of Ferishta is against this contention. 
* The Sultan * says Ferishta, “ stayed in that place 
(Devagiri), owing to the intervention of the rainy 
season. Having introduced changes in the country of 
Maharastra, he built a mosque in the city of Devagiri 
which still remains. He placed military garrisons at 
Gulburga, Saghar, Dwarasamudra and other places.” f 
The appointment of a Mussalman governor to his capi- 
tal compelled Ballala ni to hasten to Dwarasamudra, 
in order to repel the intruder. He was fortunate enough 
to defeat the enemy, and drive him away from his 
country. Two inscriptions dated in A. D. 1320, and 
1321 respectively mention a minister of Ballala called 
Mahavlranayakacari Katari Saluva Raseya Nayaka

who destroyed the Turuka army. * As Ballala III or 
his officers won no victories over the armies of Ala-ud- 
Din, and as the Tughlaks did not come into conflict 
with him until A. D. 1328, the victory of Raseya 
Nay aka should have been won over the officer whom 
MubSrak Khilji had posted to Dwarasamudra. 

Ballala seems to have remained in the north until 
1320, when he led an army against the raja of 
Kampili, but secured no substantial advantage. He 
returned to the Cola country in the same year to 
direct the operations against the Pandyas in person, and 
took up his residence at Tiruvannamalai. But his ally 
Vlra Pan^ya whom his army was assisting could 
not cope with the enemy. Samudra Pandya and his 
friend Parakrama marched upon Kannanur and laid 
siege to it. There was some severe fighting on the 
occasion, when Singeya Dannayaka, son of Maiduna 
Someya Daimayaka, a brother-in-law of Ballala III 
was slain and the fort was ultimately captured, j* 
Though the Pandyan victory blooked the progress of 
Ballala’s conquests in the Cola country, it did not 
prevent him form re-establishing the Hoysala authority 
in Kongu. $ The campaign having come to an end, 
Ballala broke up his camp at Tiru vannam al ai, and 
returned to Dorasamudra in 1322, only to contemplate 
fresh schemes of conquest. 

The small kingdom of Doravadi § on his north- 
eastern frontier had been the cause of considerable 
annoyance to Ballala HI ever since he ascended the 
throne. It waB founded by Mummadi Singeya Nay aka

who rose to prominence in the service of king Rama- 
deva of Devagiri during the last quarter of the 13th 
century. Doravadi which Ram ad a va seems to have 
granted to him for his maintenance was included in the 
Ballakunde Three Hundred, * a district which was 
governed by a branch of the Sindas in the past. 
Mummadi Singeya was ambitious and restless, and he 
soon picked up a quarrel with his neighbour Cavunda- 
rasa who was probably the Seuna governor of the 
Nolambavadi province. Cavunda placing himself at 
the head of his forces was proceeding against 
Doravadi, when he was opposed and killed by 
Mummadi Singeya in a battle, f This victory not only 
enhanced his reputation, but secured his freedom from 
the interference of provincial officers. It also gave 
him an opportunity to increase the extent of his 
kingdom. In the first place, he seized the territory of 
Cavunda extending as far as Harihara in the Dava- 
nagere taluka in the west ; secondly, he appropriated 
the estates of the petty chieftains who were in his 
neighbourhood. He raised an army and attacked * . . . 
mmalurkallu ' in the HiriyQr taluka in 1281 ; £ and 
he also fought during the same year with Sangaiya 
Nayaka of Vetaiidakal and defeated him. § As a conse- 
quence of these victories* he became a powerful baron 
on the southern marohes of the Seun.a kingdom. 

Mummadi Singeya appears to have died sometime 
before 1300, and was succeeded by his son Khandeya- 
raya - Kampiladeva. One of the earliest acts of 
Kampiladeva was the restoration of the agrahftrct of 
Harihara, which king Krepakandhara granted to Brah- 
manB some two generations earlier. 51 He invaded,

as mentioned already, the Hoysala kingdom in 
1303, at the command of his sovereign Ramadeva, 
and forced Ballala III to retire from Banavase. * 
Nothing more is known of his activity until 1309, 
when he built a temple in honour of Prasanna Viru- 
paksa at Hampe. f The first stage in the reign of 
Kampiladeva may be said to have come to an end with 
this year. 

During the next ten years, the principality of 
Doravadi had undergone important changes. The 
death of Ramadeva and the subsequent disruption of 
the Senna kingdom offered an excellent opportunity 
for Kampiladeva not only to assert his independence, 
but to acquire fresh territory by seizing as much of 
the crumbling Seuna kingdom as he could grasp. It 
waB probably during these years that he pushed 
forward the eastern boundary of his state as far as 
Siruguppa in the Bellary taluka. It is also possible 
that he conquered the districts on the northern bank of 
the Tungabhadra ; J but no epigraphic evidence is 
available in support of this view. The rapidity with 
which his power had grown, seems to have alarmed

his neighbours, especially Ballala III who could not 
countenance the birth of a powerful kingdom in his 
neighbourhood. 

According to an inscription of Nagar dated 1320, 
Ballala III u with all the troops of the armed force 
marohed upon Kapiladeva.” * The cause of this 
invasion is nowhere recorded. It is just possible that 
Ballala had embarked upon this campaign with the 
object of rooting out an enemy while he had not yet 
become very formidable. Coupled with this, he might 
have also been actuated by a desire to annex the 
region which formed an integral part of the Hoysala 
dominions in the past. Whatever might be his motive, 
he managed to lead his army to the very heart of the 
enemy’B kingdom, and lay encamped in the vicinity 
of his capital. Kampila, thereupon, came marching 
* with all his armed force/ * and both armies were 
drawn up facing each other.’ In the battle that 
followed, some of the Hoysala officers were killed, and 
Balla]a was defeated, f An undated epigraph from 
Kudii in the Slmoga district refers to another encounter 
between the two chiefs. It is said that Ballala who 
Wanted to destroy the pride of Kampila, “ went with 
speed on Siraguppe, and encamped there.” * Kampila 
went out to meet the enemy/ and ‘ fought with his army 
so as to win the praise of all the world ! ’ J The result 
of this battle was not very different from that of the 
last. Ballala III and Kampila appear to have met on 
the battle-field for the last time in 1325. § As the 
inscription recording the event is in a damaged condi- 
tion, it cannot be definitely ascertained how the battle 
ended. Rice’s translation would have us believe that

Kampila was slain ; but there are strong reasons for 
doubting the accuracy of his translation. Owing to 
the peeling off of the stone, several letters between the 
words Kampila and * modala nirudu kondu * have 
disappeared. The translation, therefore, cannot be 
depended on. Again, according to the Muhammadan 
historians, Kampila was alive until 1827, when he was 
slain by Khwaja Jahan who invaded his kingdom. * If 
it be true that Kampila died at the hands of the 
Mussalmans, his death could not have taken place in a 
battle two years earlier. Therefore, it may be stated 
that the last campaign of Ballala III also ended as 
undecisively as its predecessors. 


While the struggle between Ballala III and 
Kampila was still undeoided, the Muhammadan invaders 
from the north made their appearance once again. 
The Tughlak SultanB proved more dangerous to the 
stability of the South Indian Hindu kingdoms than 
their predecessors. The kingdom of Warrangal was 
overthrown in 1323, and Telingana became a province 
of Delhi ; at the same time Orissa was attacked, and 
the authority of the Sultan was established in Ma’bar. 
GhiaB-ud-Din, the first ruler of the Tughlak dynasty 
died in 1325, and was succeeded by his son, 
Muhammad bin Tughlak. f It was during the early 
yearB of the reign of this monarch that an expedition 
was sent against the kingdom of Kampila. The 
invasion was not caused by the desire of the Sultan to 
conquer more territory. He had a cousin called Baha- 
nd-Din Gurshasp, $ who rose up in rebellion against

him in 1327. Having been defeated in battle by the 
army of the Sultan, he fled from Deccan, and sought 
the protection of Kampiladeva, who gave him shelter, 
and treated him with consideration becoming his rank. 
The Sultan himself arrived at Devagiri, and despatched 
an army under Khwaja Jahan to bring back the 
fugitive. They marched upon Kampila's capital and 
laid siege to it. He held out for a while ; but soon 
realising that the fort would have to be surrendered 
owing to the shortage of the supplies, he made up his 
mind to do everything in his power to save Baha-ud-Din 
from the wrath of the Sultan. He sent him with an 
escort to the court of Ballala III, hoping probably that 
it would not be possible for the Sultan to capture him 
easily. Kampila did not entertain any thought of 
surrender. He issued a command to all the women of 
the palace to burn themselves alive ; when that was 
done, he had the gates of the fort thrown open and 
sallied forth to meet the Sultan’s army. He and his 
followers fought with the besiegers bravely, until they 
fell dead. The town was captured, and several 
inhabitants including the eleven sons of Kampila were 
made prisoners. The sons of Kampila embraced Islam, 
on acoount of which the Sultan made them amirs, 
and treated them courteously. The kingdom of 
» Kampila was annexed to the empire of Delhi. * 

Khwaja Jahan next proceeded against Ballala III 
who was then sheltering Baha-ud-Din. Ballala, how- 
ever, had no desire to court trouble for considerations 
of chivalry. As soon as he heard that the Muhammadan 
army was advancing upon his capital, he seized Baha- 
ud-Din, and sent him bound to Khwaja Jahan, 
acknowledging at the same time the supremacy of the

Sultan. Ballala III, by following a prudent policy, 
averted a disaster which otherwise would have 
destroyed his kingdom. 

The kingdom of Kampila which was annexed by 
the Sultan did not remain as a province of his empire 
for long. Although information is totally lacking 
regarding its affairs during the succeeding years, it is 
definitely known, on the authoiity of the contemporary 
writers, that sometime before 1343, the Sultan appoint- 
ed a relation of Kanya Nayak of Warrangal, who 
embraced Islam, as the governor of the province ; but 
the governor soon apostatised from Islam and asserted 
his independence. * 

The foregoing description of the events of the 
reign of Ballala III makes it clear that the northern 
frontier of his kingdom corresponded roughly to the 
northern boundary of the present Mysore state. The 
region corresponding to the distriots of North Canara, 
Dharwav, Bijapur, Gulburga and Nellore was never 
included in Ballala' 8 kingdom. Therefore, he could 
not have appointed officers to defend the territory 
which lay outside his dominions. 

Was the Hoysala kingdom exposed to the attacks 
of the Bahm&ni Sultans ? and were the founders 
of Vijayanagara employed by Ballala III 1 to stem the 
new flood of Bahmani invasion ? ’ It is true that 
Harihara I and his brother Bukka are referred to in 
the BurhUn-i-ma’asir as the rulers of the country 
beyond the southern boundary of the kingdom which 
Ala-ud-Din Hasan Bahmani had established, f The 
evidence of BurhSn-i-ma f asir is confirmed by Ibn 
Battuta, and the inscriptions. According to Battuta, 

* MD+ lii. p» t xxviu p, 148. 

r se i 



ORIGIN OF THE EMPIRE 

Sultan J amal-ad-Din of Honawar was * under the 
suzerainty of an infidel Sultan named Haryab ’ ; * and 
Haryab has been correctly identified with Hariappa 
or Qarihara I, whose sway, as shown by an epigraph 
dated 1339 A. D. at Badami, ■f extended over the 
Bijapur district. Since the reign of Harihara I lasted 
until 1356, it is quite likely that he should have 
come into conflict with AlS-ud-Din Hasan; but it is 
absolutely certain that Ballala III had nothing to do 
with this conflict ; for, in the first place, the founders 
of Vijayanagara, as shown already, had no connec- 
tion whatever with Ballala III; and secondly, the 
Bahmani kingdom did not come into existence during 
the life-time of Ballala. Ala-ud-Din Hasan founded 
the Bahmani kingdom in 1347, whereas Ballala III 
died in the middle of 1342. J How could the Hoysala 
dominions have become exposed to the invasions of 
the Bahmani Sultans, some twenty years before the 
birth of the Bahmani kingdom. ? It is highly impro- 
bable that Ballala III could have provided in 1328 
against a danger which was still in the womb of the 
future. Therefore, the statement that Ballala III 
posted the founders of Vijayanagara at important 
places along his northern frontier to stem the 
tide of the Bahmani invasions need not be taken 
seriously. 

Section 4 : — The belief that Ballala III enthroned 
Harihara I at Vijayanagara is not based on evidence. 
It is stated that in the later years of his reign, 
Ballala III “ had not a fixed residence as his predeces- 
sors, but he frequently changed his capital according 
to the needs of the empire, and in order to secure

ORIGIN OF THE EMPIRE 


Vijayanagara where he remained until 1340. During 
the middle of this period, Ballala enthroned Ilarihara 
as his ma ham an daleSvara in the north ”. This is said to 
be proved by the mutual understanding that existed 
between “ the emperor and his mahamctndale&vctra ”, 
as shown by the following : —

It is true that Ballala III frequently changed his 
residence during the later years of his reign in accor- 
dance with the administrative needs of his kingdom. 
That, however, should not be taken as an 
indication of the change of the oapital. Dorasamudra 
remained the capital of Ball ala’s kingdom until the 
very last. * The various nelevldus mentioned in his 
inscriptions should be regarded as temporary camps, 
where he happened to be staying for some reason or 
other. It is not true that Ballaja transferred his 
residence to Tiruvanpamalai for the first time in 1328 ; 
for, he was there already for two years during 
1321-22. f His visit to the place in 1328 must have 
been due to the outbreak of war on his southern 
frontier. He returned to the north in 1380, and 
remained for a short time at Virupaksapattana 
(Virupapura) in the Magdi taluka, not Vijayanagara, 
He did not stay here until 1340, but went to Hosabetta 
in 1333 and Dorasamudra in 1335, returning to 
Virupakgapura in 1339. He was at Dorasamudra once

again in 1840, * where he performed the abhi<eka of 
his son, before departing to the south for conducting 
his iiual campaign against the Sultan of Madura. 
There is absolutely no evidence in support of the 
statement that he enthroned Qarihara in 1336, or at 
any other time. Therefore, it should be dismissed as 
a speculation completely emancipated from the whole- 
some control of facts. The unity that is supposed to 
have existed between the idealB and plans of Ballala III 
and Harihara must also he regarded as imaginary. 
There is no evidence to show that Ilarihara I ever built 
a fort at Barakuru in 1336 ; and Ballala' s visit to that 
place in 1338, was due to a desire to encourage his 
troops stationed in the place to defend it against 
Harihara’s attacks. As Ballala III had nothing to do 
with the affairs of the kingdom of Yijayanagara, he 
could have had no connection direct or indirect with 
the construction of the fort of Badami in 1338.

Chapter II. 

THE EARLY HISTORY OF TnE 
SANGAMA FAMILY. 

Section 1 : — The true origin of the kingdom of 
Vijayanagara is revealed by an investigation of the 
contemporary records, Hindu as well as Muhammadan. 
The kingdom of Vijayanagara seems to have sprung up 
from the principality of Doravadi or Kamblla, as it was 
known to the Muhammadan historians, which Sultan 
Muhammad destroyed in 1327. * The destruction of 
this state is vividly described by Ibn Battuta who came 
to India in 1888. As he became intimately acquainted 
with the sons of Kampiladeva who embraced Islam 
subsequent to the death of their father, he would have 
gathered all hiB information regarding the circum- 
stances under which Kampiladeva died from eye- 
witnesses who participated in the fight. Therefore, 
his account of the siege and capture of Kampiladeva’s 
capital is of special importance. 

“ Sultan Tughalik,” says he, “ had a nephew, 
son of his sister, named Baha-ud-Din Gushtasp whom 
he made governor of a province . . . And when his uncle 
was dead he refused to give his oath to the late

Sultan’s son and successor. The Sultan sent a force 
against him, , . . there was a fierce battle, . . . and the 
Sultan’s troops gained victory. Baha-ud-Din fled to 

one of the Hindu princes, the rai of Kambfla 

This prince had territories situated among inaccessible 
mountains, and was one of the chief princes of the 
infidels. 

“ When Baha-ud-Din made his escape to this 
prince, he was pursued by the soldiers of the Sultan of 
India, who surrounded the rai's territories. The 
infidel saw his danger, for his stores of grain were 
exhausted and his great fear was that the enemy would 
carry off his person by force ; so he said to Baha-ud-Din, 
1 Thou seest how we are situated. I am resolved to 
die with my family, and with all who will imitate me, 
Glo to such and such a prince (naming a Hindu prince), 
and stay with him ; he will defend thee.’ He sent 
some one to conduct him thither. Then he com- 
manded a great fire to be prepared and lighted. Then 
he burned his furniture and said to his wives and 
daughters, *1 am going to die, and such of you as 
prefer it, do the same.’ Then it was seen that each one 
of these women washed herself, rubbed her body 
with sandal-wood, kissed the ground before the rai of 
Kambila, and threw herself upon the pile. All 
perished. The wives of his nobles, ministers, and 
chief men imitated them, and other women also did 
the same. 

11 The rai, in his turn, washed, rubbed himself 
with sandal, and took his arms, hut did not put on his 
breastplate. Those of his men who resolved to die 
with him, followed his example. They sallied forth 
to meet the troops of the Sultan and fought till every- 
one of them fell dead. The town was taken, its 

res]

inhabitants were made prisoners, and eleven sons of 
the rai were made prisoners and carried to the Sultan 
who made them all Mussalinans.” * 

What happened in the kingdom of Kamblla, imme- 
diately after the death of the rai is nowhere related. 
The historian Zia-ud-Din BarnT, one of the companions 
of Sultan Muhammad mentions Kamblla as one of the 
provinces included in the empire of Delhi. lie casually 
states that the government of the province was 
entrusted to the care of a Hindu who embraced 
Muhammadanism. While narrating the events connect- 
ed with the rebellion at Sannam and Samana which 
broke out in 1344, BarnI observes: 

“While this was going on, a revolt broke out 
among the Hindus at Arangal. Kanya Nayak had 
gathered strength in the country. Malik Makbul, the 
nalb-wazlr , fled to Delhi, and the Hindus took posses- 
sion of Arangal, whioh was thus entirely lost. About 
the same time, one of the relations of Kanya Nayak 
whom the Sultan had sent to Kambala, apostatised 
from Islam and stix*red up a revolt. The laud of 
Kambala also was thus lost, and fell into the hands of 
the Hindus." f 

It is evident from these two extracts that the 
government of the kingdom of Kamblla, which was 
destroyed in 1327, was entrusted by the Sultan to a

The name of the relation of Kanya Nayak who 
successfully headed the rebellion of Kambila against 
the Sultan is nowhere disclosed. It is, however, 
possible to discover his name by an investigation of 
the inscriptions belonging to this period. Judging 
from the position of Kambila as described by the 
Mussulman historians, it should have extended from 
the Southern frontier of the province of Dcvagiri to 
Kampili on the Tungabhadra from which its name is 
evidently derived. * Who was the prince or king that 
was ruling this region from 1327 to 1344 ? It is stated 
in the Kapalur plates dated 1385 that Harihara, son of 
Sangama, a descendant of Yadu, was ruling this part of 
the country from his capital Kunjarakona on the 
Tungabhadra. f The same information is conveyed by 
another grant dated in the same year coming from the 
Bagepalli taluka of the Kolar district. $ As these grants 
are declared spurious, the value of their evidence has 
become vitiated, and they cannot be of much use in the 
present discussion. There are other genuine records 
which should be considered in this context. It is stated 
in an epigraph of Atakalagunda in the Kurnool district 
that Harihara I was ruling this part of the country 
in 1839 from his nelev/ldu at Gutti. § According to an 
inscription dated 1340, the country round Badami in 
■ the BijSpur district was governed by king Harihara. 
He bore the titles ma kamant}a le§ vara , arirfiyavibhala, 
bhashageiaypum - rayara - gatida, and purvapaSoima samu- 
drUdhipati. It is stated in an unpublished inscription 
of the same date coming from the Kurnool district that 
Harihara was ruling the country in the neighbourhood

of the ^rllaila mountain. * This is confirmed by a 
third inscription dated 1344, according to which 
Harihara’s brother Bukka was ruling from Vidya- 
nagara. f By 1342, the authority of Harihara was 
recognised on the coast of Konkan. Ibn Battuta who 
visited Konkan in 1342, states that Jamal-ad-Din, the 
Sultan of Honawar, was the subordinate of a Hindu 
king called Haryab, £ who has been identified with 
Hariyappa or Harihara I of Vijayanagara. 

The evidence of the inscriptions and Battuta make 
it clear that at least from 1339 H a ri h ara I was govern- 
ing the country over which Kampiladeva ruled before 
1327. It should be borne in mind that this country I 
was included, according to BarnI, in the dominions ' 
of the Sultan of Delhi until 1344, when, owing to/ 
the successful rebellion of its governor, it became 
independent. It follows from this that Harihara I of 
Vijayanagara and the Sultan of Delhi were holding 
Bway over this region simultaneously between 1339 
and 1344. This could not have happened if both of 
them were independent monarohs. It could have been 
only possible, if one of them chanced to be a 
subordinate of the other. Of the two, the Sultan of 
Delhi could not have been a subordinate of Harihara. 
Therefore, Harihara should have been a subordinate 
of the Sultan. As he was ruling the territories of the 
old kingdom of Kambila about 1340, as a subordinate 
of the Sultan of Delhi, he should have been that 
relation of Kanya Nayak whom the Sultan appointed 
as the governor of Kambila sometime before 1344, 
but who stirred up in that year a rebellion against his

master, and asserted Ms independence. Harihara 
appears to have been a follower of Islam at the time of 
his appointment to the governorship; but he soon 
abandoned it, and reverted to the faith of his fathers. r 
Ilis reconversion to Hinduism which was the first 
act of his rebellion might have been actuated by 
considerations not purely religious. Probably the 
rebellion which was in essence a Hindu protest 
against the aggressive onslaughts of Islam could not 
have been as successful as it was but for Harihara’s 
reconversion. 

Section 2 \ — Who was this Harihara ? Very little 
is known of the origin and the early history of his 
family. Though the information on the subject is 
very scanty, some attempts have already beon made 
to reconstruct the story of his ancestors. It is said 
that Harihara’s family was connected with the 
Kadambas of Banavase. f A passage from Nikitin is 
cited in support of this statement : “ The Hindu Sultan, 
Kadam,” says he, “is a very powerful prince. He 
possesses a numerous army, and resides on a mountain 
at Biclieneghar.” $ The word ‘Kadam’ in this passage 
is the name of the Vijayanagara king, and not 
of his family. Therefore, there is no reason to 
suppose that the ancestors of Harihara had any 

* It is interesting to note that Bukka I, the younger brother of Harihara had 
a Muhammadan son. An imperfectly dated inscription from Szmoga (Ci, 65,) , 
mentions Gengu Sal3r, son of Bukkana Vmjeyar, The date of the inscription as | 
engraved is sahasrada Vtkrama var$ada* The expression sahasrada \ 

means, * one thousand and * , and it is evident that the engraver had omitted j 
something after t and*, Bl, 3, dated about 139?, refers to the rebuilding of the f 
gdpurn at BEITJjr which Gangs Salar, the Turuka of Kallubarage had come any 
burnt. The Gftnga Salat mentioned in Bl. 3, appears to be the same as thfe 
Ganga Satftr of Cu 66, for the names of these two persons agree , and they hvefl 
about the sometime. It is nof unlikely that Bukkaita Vofleyar had a son who 
was a Muhammadan.

connection with the Kadambas of Banavase or any 
other place. Again, it is suggested that ‘ the ancestors 
of the first dynasty of Vijayanagara were the mem- 
bers of the famous family of Ke^avadandanatha, ’ * 
who was one of the officers of Ballala II. Three 
arguments are brought forward in support of this 
contention : — 

(1) Keiavadandanatha’s family is ‘ the only 
Yadava family found in the inscriptions besides the 
ruling family of the Hoysalas \ And Harihara and his 
brothers trace their descent from the same family. 
(2) Ke&avadandanatba’s family, * just as the family of 
Sangama ’, is called a * Karijata family.’ (3) Several 
names of the members of one family resemble those of 
the other, f 

None of these arguments can establish the connect- 
ion of the family of Harihara^with that of KetSavadanda- 
natha. In the first place, /Kesava’s family was not 
the only one besides the Hoysalas to claim descent from 
the mythical hero, Yadu. The Seunas of Devagiri, 
the Yadavarayas of Candragiri, J and the Pa:g4y&s of 
Ucchangi claimed a similar descent. Therefore, the 
ancestors of Harihara may be said to have been connect- 
ed with any one of them. Secondly, there is no justi- 
fication for calling Harihara’s family a * Karriata 
family.’ It is, no doubt, true that in one inscription, 
Sangama, the father of Harihara is said to have enabled 
the Lalcgmi of Kamata desa to wear her ear-rings ; §

but this cannot be taken to mean that Sangama and 
therefore his son belonged to a family called the 
* Karnata family.' What all we can say with reason 
is that Sangama ruled somewhere in the Kaniata 
country ; but that is a different proposition. The mere 
fact that the families of Kesavadandanatha and Hari- 
liara ruled in Karnata, does not unite them, making 
them thereby a single family. Lastly, similarity of 
names cannot be taken as a serious argument, since 
such similarity may be discovered between the names 
of several other families of the time. Therefore the 
suggested connection between the families of Kesava- 
dandanatha and Harihara should be considered 
improbable \ and if it is necessary to discover the origin 
of the family of Harihara, an attempt should be made to 
explore Bources other than those mentioned above. 

The inscriptions of Harihara I and his successors 
yield some information, though scanty, about his father 
and grandfather. The name of his father was Sangama, 
and he is said to have been a powerful chief, though 
nothing definite is known about his achievements. * 
The father of Sangama was a chief called Bukka who 
is occasionally mentioned in the records of his descen- 
dants. f An epigraph dated 1314 A. D. coming from 

* However, in a copper-plate grant attributed to King Harihara II, {MAR* 
191S, p 50) some of his exploits aie enumerated* “He performed the sixteen 
great gifts in RamEsvaram and other holy places. Quickly damming the Kaveri 
when in full flood, he crossed over, and seizing the enemy alive, took possession 
of his Tailca kingdom (Tanjora) and the city of ^rirangapa^tana. He conquered 
Cera* C3Ja, and Kn<Jya and together with the lord of Mddura Manabhflsa, the 
Turu^ka, and the Gajapati king.' ’ The inscription in which this passage occurs 
is a forgery of the 16th century \ for, (1) the passage is bodily taken from the 
firaSasti of the Tujuya kings describing the campaigns of Narasa NSyaka ; and 
(0) it does not occur in the jprastzsH of the. First Dynasty in any inscription 
excepting the present. Therefore, Sangama may be said to have become 
famous, only on account of his sons ; hut for them his name would not have 
come down to posterity.

Therefore, the present grant makes it quite clear that 
Bukka, the grandfather of Hanhara I, was holding 
sway about A. D. 1314 over a portion of the Nellore 
district. It is a matter of common knowledge that this 
region formed part of the Kakatlya kingdom which 
Muhammad bm Tughlak had overthrown in 1323 A. D. 
Prataparudra II, who had been liberated from his 
imprisonment by some of his officers, exercised some 
sort of authority over this part of his kingdom until 
1330. Bukkaraya Vodayalu of the Grozalavldu inscrip- 
tion should have been a subordinate of Prataparudra II. 

/ The information gleaned from the inscriptions 
and the contemporary writers about the ancestors of 
Harihara I may be summarised in a few sentences. His 
grandfather, Bukkaraya Vodayalu was holding sway 
over a portion of the Nellore district as a subordinate 
of Prataparudra II about 1314 A.D. Nothing, however, 
is known about his father Sangama except that he 
begot five sons who established the kingdom of

at any rate, he could not have been indebted to the text of the inscription which 
is quite clear on the point. Another writer attempts to identify Bukkaraya 
Vodayalu of the inscription with Bukka I. The fact of Bukka Ts patronage to 
a Telugu poet or even of his haying under him a Telugu governor — I^umakanti 
Gangi Rei}4 1 Garu in Saka 1314* (Butterworth, Nellore Inscriptions 11 , p. 643) does 
not necessarily mean that Bukka was of Telugu origin.’ * {Jr, Bom , HtsU Soc, 
Vol. u p. 117). The identification is wrong , for, in the first place, the date of the 
inscription is Saka 1336, and not £aka 1314. Secondly, Bukka I died about 
J§aka 1300 , therefore,, he could not be reigning in £aka 1314, some fourteen 
years after his death. If the inscription did really belong to a subordinate 
of Bukka I, then it establishes that he was of Telugu origin, since, ruling 
as he did in£akal236, in Nellore, he should have been a subordinate of the 
KSkatlyn king, Prataparudra XL

Vijayanagara. (j3arihara I, the eldest of Sangama's 
sons, was related *to Kanya Nayak who began to rule 
at Warrangal in 1344. He embraced Islam some years 
before that date, and was consequently appointed by 
Muhammad bin Tughlak as the governor of the king- 
dom of Kampila which he overthrew in 1327. He 
ruled his province at first from Kunjarakona, and 
subsequently from Vijayanagara. He reverted to 
Hinduism sometime before 1344, and stirring up a 
revolt against the Sultan, became independent.

Chapter III. 

THE KlKATlYAS AND THE FOUNDERS 
OF VI JAY AN AGAR A 

Section 1 : — The connection of the founders of 
Vijayanagara with the Kakatiyas suggested in the 
previous chapter, is also shown though indirectly by 
the crest of the kings of Vijayanagara as well as 
some features of their administrative system. 

The Crest. — It is well-known that • varaha ’ or the 
boar was the crest of the four dynasties that ruled over 
V ij ay an ag ar a 1 What was the source from which they 
obtained it? The boar crest was at first made use of by 
the CalukyaB of BadSmi ; and it was inherited from 
them by all the branches of the family, who adopted 
it, with a few modifications^ The Calukyas of Kalyani 
who established a wide-sp/ead empire in the Deccan 
made the boar creBt the symbol of their imperial power. 
The feudatory families which recognised their overlord- 
ship were profoundly influenced by the manners of 
their oourt and methods of administration. All of 
them copied the ways of their sovereigns ; they even 
modelled their praSastis on that of the royal family. 
The Kakatiyas seem to have gone a step further ; they 
adopted also the royal crest. 

After the fall of the Calukyas^ the three monar- 
chies which stepped into their plaqle fostered the old 
administrative institutions with a few changes here and 
there. But the \old -royal crest disappeared everywhere 
except in TelingSpad The Seunas made use of the 
Qaru$a crest, and the Hoysalas, the tiger. i^The 
Kakatiyas alone had shown respect to the Calukyan

boar. It is mentioned for the first time in the inscrip- 
tions of Prola II. He is said to have marked the breast 
of his enemy, Gunda of Mantraknta “ with the sign 
of a boar.” * The image of the Kakatlya boar is also 
found engraved on the seals of the copper-plates of 
Ganapati ; f and it is also engraved at the top of some 
of the stone inscriptions of Prataparudra II. % 

The founders of Vijayanagara should, therefore, 
have borrowed their crest only from the Kakatlyas, 
for no other royal house made use of it at the time 
of the birth of the new kingdom^ One peculiarity 
which is common to the Kakatlya and Vijayanagara 
crests establishes, in our view, the connection between 
them more firmly. On the seals attached to the 
inscriptions of Ganapati and Prataparudra II, the figure 
of a dagger is engraved in front of the boar ; the 
dagger is also carved on the Vijayanagara seals, but 
in a slightly different manner. Whereas the dagger in 
the Kakatlya seals is made to stand on its hilt, its 
position is reversed in the Vijayanagara seals, where 
it is made to stand on the point. Notwithstanding 
this small difference, it may be confidently asserted 
that the founders of Vijayanagara were indebted to 
the KakatlyaB for their crest. 

Section 2 : — The Administrative Features: — The 
founders of Vijayanagara seem to have modelled their 
administrative machinery to some extent on that of the 
Kakatlyas. (a) The administrative divisions that were 
in vogue in the Vijayanagara kingdom were either 
copied or evolved from those obtaining in the dominions 
of the Kakatlyas. The village served as the foundation

on which the whole fabric rested. A few villages were 
grouped together to form what was known as sthala. 
A few sihalas constituted a tiadu ; a few nadus formed a 
slma ; and a few slmas became a raj ya. This system of 
grouping the divisions of administration was not 
entirely created by Harihara I or his successors. What 
they had done was only to bring the scattered elements 
which they found existing under a system. The sthala 
and the r&jya * are occasionally met with in the 
Hoysala and the Seuna inscriptions ; but they do not 
seem to connote artificial sub-divisions of territory 
created for the sake of administrative convenience. 
There is reason to believe that the Kakatlya monarchs, 
especially Rudramba and Prataparudra, made a con- 
scious effort to overhaul the administrative machinery 
of their kingdom. An examination of the lithic records 
of their time reveals the existence of administrative 
divisions that bear a close kinship to those obtaining 
under Vijayanagara. The sthala may be taken up for 
consideration at first : —

The next sub-division, slma appears but rarely in

belonging to Ud ay agin in our kingdom,’ and speaks of 
4 the villages of the Kandukuri stma It is evident that 
the highest district was durga ; and stma, nadu and 
sthalci came after it. This is not improbable ; for the 
Reddi inscription already mentioned brings to our notice 
a similar organisation ; it refers to the village of Rama- 
tlrtham in the Ammanavabroli stma, in the &risaila 
bhumi. * The internal organisation of the Kakatiya 
kingdom is thus seen to be similar to that of Vijaya- 
nagara. This similarity could not have been the result 
of accidental development ; for the same kind of 
organisation was also obtaining in the kingdom of 
Kon&avldu, which was established by one of the 
officers of Prataparudra II, in a part of the Kakatiya 
dominions. The existence of the same administrative 
divisions arranged more or less in a similar fashion 
points to some intimate connection between the king- 
doms of Warrangal and Vijayanagara which has not 
yet been recognised. Probably the founders of 
Vijayanagara, like Prolaya Verna Reddi, were also 
in the service of the Kakaiayas. 

One interesting point should be noticed in this 
connection. Sthala and rUjya , as pointed out already, 
are occasionally met with in the Hoysala, the Seuna 
and the Oalukya inscriptions ; but the term stma is 
conspicuous by its absence. It makes its appearance 
for the first time during the last days of the K&katTyas, 
and came into universal use under the Reddis and the 
Rayas of Vijayanagara. As it was unknown outside 
the Telugu country in the pre- Vijayanagara days, its 
presence in the inscriptions of the Oauarese districts 
during the time of the Rayas shows that it was intro- 
duced by them when they established their mastery

over the Karnata country. Sima, therefore, indicates 
that the organisation of administrative divisions of 
which it was a part originally came into vogue on the 
east coast, and it gradually spread westwards with 
the expansion of the kingdom of Vijayanagara. 

Section 8 : — (Jj) The Nayakara System: — The word 
na ya.lca.ra or nayankara is familiar to all students of 
Vijayanagara institutions. It was the name given to 
the tenure under which the nayakas or the amara- 
nayakas, as they were sometimes called, held land of 
the Rayas. The features of this tenure are made 
familiar to us by Nuniz who seems to have studied it 
with some care. 

“ All the land belongs to the king, and from his 
hand the captains hold it." * “ These nobles are like 

renters who hold all the land from the king.” “ They 
are obliged to maintain six lakhs of soldiers, that is 
six hundred thousand men and twenty six thousand 
horses.” “ They are obliged to maintain " several 
elephants. In addition to these, “ they also pay to him 
every year sixty lakhs of rents as royal dues." f 

The Raya distributed land among his nayakas so 
that they might maintain troops for his service. They 
had to provide him with foot soldiers, horses, and 
elephants ; moreover, they were obliged to pay a tax on 
their holdings. If they failed to fulfil any one of these 
conditions, they were severely dealt with, and their 
estates were confiscated by the government. $ 

This method of distributing land among the 
nUyakas was in practice since the early days of the

First Dynasty. An inscription dated 1339 mentions a 
certain Poddilapalli Singama Nayaka who held the 
village of Dliennvakonda as his naykara. * According 
to another dated 1352, the son of the Maliasamnta- 
dhifati Balavankada Anki Nayaka was holding Anjadu- 
naclu as his nayakara. f Another dated 1392 refers 
probably to the nayakara of Tirumalanatha, the 
grandson of Teppada Naganna. J Another dated 
1412 alludes to Somagandanahalli of Hirasu naclu 
‘belonging to the office of nayaka * of Hiriya Mudiya 
Nayaka. § Another dated 1418 refers to Ilammlra 
naclu 1 belonging to the office of nayalca ' of Jaka 
Mudde Nayaka. ^f 

The Nayakara System has been hitherto regarded 
as an institution peculiar to the kingdom of Vijaya- 
nagara. No trace of nayakara can be discovered in 
the numerous records of the Hoysalas, the Seunas and 
the Calukyas. A study of the inscriptions of the 
Kakatlyas brings to light the source from which the 
Rayas of Vijayanagara got this system of land tenure. 
It is stated in an inscription of 1279 that Rudramba 
granted some place (name effaced) as nayankara to 
Bolli Nayaka who was her body-guard. IE According to 
a Ganapavaram epigraph dated 1292, Px*atapakumara

from Mellaceruvu dated 1311 mentions the nayankara 
which Prataparudradeva Maharaja granted to a 
certain Cami Yerrapreggeda. * Another inscription 
of the same date coming from Damagallu in the 
Kumool district mentions two villages which Pratapa- 
rudra granted to a certain Videmu Kommaraju as 
his nayakara. f A Granapesvavam grant of 1313 alludes 
to * Velanati nayaka-sthala vrlti ’ which the Kakatiya 
king gave to his angaraksas Polaya Nayadu and Kali 
Nayadu. $ Lastly, a Penumalli epigraph of 1314 
records the grant of twenty-two villages which 
Prataparudradeva Maharaja made to his servant 
Erreya, ‘ the gate-keeper of the royal palace,’ for his 
ncLyankara. § 

The instances mentioned above make it clear that 
nayankara was an institution which was in existence 
during the time of the last two Kakatiya rulers. In 
fact, tradition attributes the introduction of this system 
to Prataparudra II. According to the Pratlipacaritra, 
Prataparudra entrusted the defence of his capital to 
77 Velama nayakas , and having divided his kingdom 
into seventy-seven districts, he distributed them <[f 
among the nayakas, so that they might efficiently 
perform their task. This tradition appears to be based 
on fact; for the Kaluvaceru grant of Anitalli dated 
1423 informs us that Kapaya Nayaka, who, subsequent 
to the death of Prataparudra, having expelled 
Muhammadans, became the king of Telingana was 
served by seventy-five nciyakas. || The real author of 
the reform was probably the queen Rudramba herself. 
Tradition might have wrongly attributed its origin to

her grandson under whom the Nayakara System came 
into force. 

Whatever might be the manner in which the 
Nayankara System had arisen, there is no doubt that it 
came into practice for the first time during the reigns 
of the last two Kakatiya monarchs. Since the system 
was unknown in every part of South India and Deccan 
except in Telingana, the Rayas of Vijayanagara, must 
have inherited it from the rulers of that country.

Chapter IV 

THE EARLY VIJAYANAGARA KINGS 
AND THE TELUGU COUNTRY 

Section 1 : — The foregoing study makes it abun- 
dantly clear that the founders of the Vijayanagara 
kingdom came from the Telugu country included in 
the erstwhile Kakatlya kingdom. But an objection is 
urged against the * Telugu origin on the ground that 
both Buklca I and Harihara II are said to have defeated 
the Andhras and the Kalingas. Since no victory over 
the Andhras is mentioned in the inscriptions of 
Harihara I, it has been suggested that after the death 
of Harihara, * the Andhra country apparently rebelled 
against Bukka 1/ This was the first of a series of re- 
bellions which did not terminate before 1401. M These 
rebellions of the Telugu country against early Vijaya- 
nagara rulers prove that the latter were not acknow- 
ledged by the Telugus, a thing which can hardly be 
believed, if the family of Sangama is supposed to be a 
Telugu family.’' * 

To meet the objection in a satisfactory manner, it 
is necessary to discuss the history of the Telugu 
country after the fall of Warrangal in 1323. Barn! 
states that the kingdom of Tilang was annexed to the 
empire of Delhi. “ The name of Arangal/’ he says, 
“ was changed into Sultanpur, and all the country of 
Tilang was conquered.” Prataparudra H was taken

prisoner, and despatched to Delhi under the charge of 
Malik Bedar who had been created Kadar Kh an, and 
Khwaja Haji, nail of arizi mamalik ’ ; * but according 
to Shams-i-Siraj Afif, Prataparudra, ‘ the raja of 
Telingana ' * died on the road ' to Delhi, f It would 
seem, therefore, that the Telugu country was subju- 
gated, and the last of the Kakatlyas died, while being 
marched to Delhi as a prisoner in 1323. As a matter 
of fact, however, Prataparudra seems to have lived 
probably until 1330 ; $ and the kingdom of the 
Kakatlyas not only did not perish with the fall of 
Warrangal, but survived a few years longer, when it 
appears to have succumbed to the forces of disinte- 
gration which usually attacked Indian kingdoms after 
some great disaster. 

The political condition of the Telugu country after 
the fall of the Kakatlyas is described in an inscription 
dated 1423 A. D., i.e., exactly a century after the 
capture of Warrangal by the Mussulmans. Though 
the information, contained in the record should be 
considered tradition, its correctness is vouchsafed by 
contemporary documents. “After Prataparudra (II) 
died in freedom, his kingdom was occupied by the 
Mussalmans. Then Prolaya Nay aka rescued the earth 
from the Muhammadans, just as Varaha rescued it 
from the waters of the ocean. When Prolaya became 
the guest of the swarga (i.e., died), Kapaya Nayaka, 
whose valour resembled that of the Sun, assumed 
control over hiB kingdom by the command of Visves- 
vara. Then king Kapaya whose lotus feet were served 
by seventy-five nclyahds protected the earth by the 
mercy of Vitfvesvara. King Kapaya not only restored 
to Brahmans, the agraharas which were seized by the 
Muhammadans, bat granted them several afresh. When

Kapaya went to heaven to serve the feet of Visvesvara 
whom he had already Berved in various ways on earth, 
the nayalcas retired to their respective places where 
they began to rule independently.” * 

The first point that deserves attention in the above 
passage is the condition of Prataparudra at the time 
of his death. It is said that he died * in freedom % 
although the evidence of the Muhammadan historians 
would have us believe that the event took place while 
he was in captivity. Surprising as the statement is, it 
does not seem to be altogether void of truth. Accord- 
ing to an inscription of Santamagalu.ru, Prataparudra 
was ruling in 1326. f Another inscription dated 
1330 registers the grant of land to the temple of 
Bhramaramesvara of Arumurugulla by the king 
himself. £ These inscriptions make it clear that 
Prataparudra was not only alive after 1323, but 
was ruling his kingdom. How is it possible to 
reconcile this inference with the explicit statement of 
Shams-i-Siraj Afif that Prataparudra died in captivity 
on his way to Delhi ? There seems to be but one 
way out of the difficulty. If it be supposed that an 
attempt was made by the subjects of the captive king 
to liberate him from the custody of the officers to 
whom his safe conduct was entrusted, and that this 
attempt resulted in a promiscuous fight, during the 
course of which the prisoner had disappeared, the 
officers might assume that he died in the fight, and 
report accordingly to the Sultan. And the historian, 
Siraj Afif who obtained his information from the 
court, might have incorporated it in his work believing 
that it was accurate. It is not improbable that what 
actually had taken place was similar to what has been

suggested. According to an old tradition, Prataparudra 
who was imprisoned by the Mussalmans, was subse- 
quently released. * Singama of the Recarla family, 
one of the officers of Prataparudra bore the title, 
rayabandivimocaka or the liberator of the king from 
captivity, f Since this title is mentioned in the ins- 
criptions of the Recarla family as early as 1369 it is 
not unlikely that Singama must have performed some 
action to deserve it. $ As Prataparudra was made 
captive only once, it is probable that Singama should 
have earned the title, by securing his release on the 
occasion. 

Of the successors of Prataparudra mentioned in 
the inscription of 1423, not much is known. No doubt 
the names of Prolaya and Kapaya are mentioned in a 
few epigraphs of the time; § but nothing of import- 
ance is recorded about their doings. The period of 
their rule appears to have been very short, as several 
independent kingdoms came into being by 1335, or a 
little later. The most important of them were the king- 
doms of (1) Warrangal, (2) Racakon.da, (3) Kondavldu, 
and (4) Korukonda. As all these states excepting the 
last came into intimate contact with the kingdom, of 
Vijayanagara, a brief account of each of them may 
not be out of place. 

Section 2 ; — (1) Warrangal. — Warrangal, and 
together with it, the province of Telingana properly 
so called remained in the hands of the Mussalmans 
until 1344. Sultan Muhammad who visited the place 
in 1386 made fresh arrangements for the government 
of the province. He divided Telingana into two 
districts and appointed separate officers to govern

them. * According to the new arrangement, Nusrat 
Kh an became the ruler of the western district with his 
capital at BTdar ; and Malik Makbul or Kabul took 
charge of the eastern district, having his headquarters 
at Warrangal. Sultan Muhammad seems to have shown 
much wisdom in the choice of the new governors, 
especially the latter. Malik Makbul waB an Andhra by 
birth, and he was known as Kattu before he became a 
follower of the Prophet. It is said that he was ‘ a man 
of high position in his tribe, and he had attracted the 
favour of the rai of that country.’ He was one of those 
who were taken prisoners to Delhi after the capture of 
Warrangal. When he reached the metropolis, he pre- 
sented himself to the Saltan, ‘ and made his profession 

of the Muhammadan faith The Sultan gave him 

the name of Makbul 7 on conversion, and perceiving ‘ in 
him many marks of sagacity and intelligence made 
him deputy- Wazir of Delhi. 7 f His appointment as 
the governor of Warrangal was probably due to the 
Sultan’s belief that Malik Makbul who was a son of the 
soil would be able to exercise the imperial authority 
in the conquered province more successfully than a 
complete Btranger. The hopes of the Sultan were not 
fulfilled ; for Makbul had to face the strong opposition 
of the Hindu chiefs. One of them whom the Muham- 
madan historians variously call, Kanya Kayak, Kanya 
Paik, Kaba Nayand and Kr§na Nayak * gathered 
strength in the country, 7 and stirring up a revolt, 
forced Makbul, the naib mazier to flee to Delhi in or 
about 1344. $

son of Prataparudra and headed a successful rebellion 
against the Sultan, and having expelled the governor 
from Telingana, as noticed already, he established 
himself at Warrangal. Later on he aided Zafar Kh an, 
to overthrow the Sultan's authority at Devagiri ; but 
when Zafar became the king of Gulburga under the 
name of Ala-ud-Din Hasan Gangu Bahmani, the old 
friendship was forgotten, and Krsna Nayak had 
to defend himself against Ala-ud-Din’s invasions. * 
Notwithstanding the surrender of Borne territory to 
Ala-ud-Din, Krsna Nayak was able to hold his own 
against the Mussalmans. Therefore, Krsna Nayak 
played an important part in the history of Telingana 
about the middle of the fourteenth century. In fact, 
he re-established the Hindu independence in the 
country, and maintained it successfully for nearly 
thirty years in spite of the persistent attacks of the 
Mussalmans. 

Kanya or Krsna Nayak could not have been the 
king of the Telingas whom Bukka I and Harihara II 
vanquished. In the first place, Kanya was a relation 
of their family. Secondly, they would not have been 
so unwise as to invite the hostility of the king of 
Telingana who, in virtue of his position in the flank of 
the Bahmani kingdom, could render to them valuable 
services, by thwarting Muslim designs upon their 
territories. As a matter of fact, there seems to have 
existed some sort of understanding between the royal 
houses of Warrangal and Vijayanagara. There is reason 
to believe that the rebellions of Warrangal and Kambila 
(the later Vijayanagara) against the Sultan of Delhi 
were interconnected. The friendship which sprang up 
at this time was kept up, and whenever the Muham- 
madans became aggressive, the kings of Warrangal and

Vijayanagara combined their forces to check them. 
Soon after the accession of Muhammad Shab 
Bahmani I, the Hindu bankers of his kingdom* 
instigated by the kings of Warrangal and Vijayanagara* 
melted down the gold coins which he had recently 
struck. This act so enraged Muhammad Shah that he 
put to death several of the offenders. Sometime after 
this, ‘ the rajas of Beejanuggur and Tulingaija 
demanded restitution of the territories wrested from 

them, ' by Ala-ud-Din Hasan Gungu. Muhammad Shah 
remained silent until he felt strong, and then des- 
patched ambassadors to both the Hindu capitals to 
demand tribute. “ The raja of Tulingtina upon this 
deputed his son Vinayak Dev with an army to recover 
Kaulas, while the rSja of Beejanuggur sent a con- 
siderable force to co-operate.” * These events which 
took place before 1362, show that at the time friendly 
relations obtained between Warrangal and Vijaya- 
nagara* and no war took place between them until 

then. 

Kanya Nayak suffered heavily in his wav with 
Muhammad Shah. He sustained defeats in several 
engagements, and had to surrender the district of 
, Golkonda in addition to large sums of money paid as 
war indemnity and tribute, f His troubles* however, 
were not at an end ; for, the Velamas of Racakoiida 
who seem to have entered into an alliance with the 
Muhammadans most unpatriotically invaded his king- 
dom at the same time. His affairs seem to have 
reached a crisis. He was completely exhausted owing 
to his war with the Mussalmans. His friend, the king 
of Vijayanagara was not in a position to send him 
assistance on account of the invasion of his kingdom 
fey the Bahmani Sultan. Therefore, he could offer little

or no resistance to the invaders. Anapota, the chief of 
Racakonda marched into his kingdom, and captured 
Warrangal, -Bhuvanagiri, and Singapura sometime be- 
fore 1369. * In a battle that was fought at Bhtmavaram 
he was killed by Mada, the brother of Anapota. t 

Section 3 : — (2) Racakonda The Velamas of 
the Recarla family who were in the service of the 
KakatTya kings for generations were in possession of 
the mountainous tract in the Nalgoiida district of the 
present Hyderabad state. Their capital Racakonda 
from which the kingdom later derived its name was 
surrounded by a ring of hills which made its position 
very nearly impregnable. The exact extent of the 
territory which was under their control is not yet 
ascertained. The first historical person of the family 
is Prasaditya who was a contemporary of Gaijapati 
and his daughter Rudramba. $ His sons Venna and 
Sabbi distinguished themselves as great warriors 
during the reigns of Rudramba, and her successor, 
Prataparudra. § Yarra Dacha, the son of Venn a, 
served in Prataparudra’s campaigns against the 
Pandyas. His eldest son Singama appears to have 
fought with the Muhammadans, and secured the liberty 
of Prataparudra whom they were carrying away as a 
prisoner to Delhi. Singama seems to have asserted his 
independence about 133B. Then began a period of 
bloody feuds and petty warfare among the various 
nobles of the country ; and they went on unchecked for 
several decades owing to the uninterrupted progress of 
anarchy. Singama who seems to have been an

aggressive restless sort of person was assassinated by 
the Kgatriyas at the fort of Jallipalli which he was 
besieging ; * and he was succeeded by Anapota, his 
eldest son. The date of Anapota's accession to the 
throne is not known. According to one writer the 
event took place in 1344. f This date should be 
cbnsidered too early ; for Singama, his father is said to 
have defeated king Kapaya whose earliest inscription 
is dated in 1346. J Therefore Anapota’s accession 
must have taken place a little later. 

Anapota adopted the aggressive polioy of his 
father. He is said to have subdued several forts, and 
extended the boundaries of his principality. Very 
soon he came into conflict with two states, Warrangal 
in the north-east and Kondavldu in the south. Although 
Mada the brother of Anapota is said to have defeated 
the Reddis of Kondavldu at Dannalakota, he does 
not seem to have secured any material advantage. § 
However, his war with Kanya Nayak of Warrangal was 
more successful. Anapota was probably in league with 
the Bahmani Sultan. He seems to have attacked Kanya 
while he was engaged in a war with Muhammad Shah 
Bahmani I,’ and succeeded sometime before 1369 in 
capturing Warrangal, Bhuvanagiri, and other places. 51 
It was probably on this occasion that Kanya Nayak 
met his death while fighting with Mada, as already 
mentioned. |l Therefore, Anapota’s dominions were 
considerably extended, aB a consequence of this yar. 

It is said that Anapota’s reign came to an end in 
1380 5 but he seems to have ruled for some more years;

for according to the history of the Velugoti family, 
he inflicted a defeat on the armies of the kina of 
Vijayanagara. * Now this event could have taken place 
only in 1384, when the Vijayanagara king invaded 
Telingana for the first time. An epigraph belonging to 
the reign of Harihara II of Vijayanagara dated in that 
year states that when Bukka II went with the army * to 
the Orugal country, the Turukas came and attacked 
him at Kottakonda.' f From the association of the 
Muhammadan attack on Kottakonda with the despatch 
of the expedition to "War ran gal, it may appear that 
Warrangal belonged to the Muhammadans ; but 
Warrangal and the surrounding country was not 
conquered by the Bahmani Sultans until 1424. J It 
should have been still in the possession of the Velamas 
who conquered it about 1369. If Anapota fought with 
the armies of Vijayanagara, he could have done so 
only after 1384. Therefore, his death should have 
taken place sometime later. The object of the 
expedition was probably to punish AnapSta for the 
conquest of the territories of Kanya Nayak, an ally of 
the Raya of Vijayanagara. Since the Muhammadans 
attempted to prevent the army from reaching 

"Warrangal, it is reasonable to believe that there existed 
at the time some sort of alliance between the 
Racakoijda chiefs and the Sultans of Ghilbnrga.

and another with the important fort of Devarakonda 
was governed by Mada, his younger brother, f Anapota 
was succeeded at Racakonda by his son Singama II 
who became famous as an author and patron of men 
of letters. $ Mada was succeeded by his son Pedda 
Vedagiri. § It was during the time of this prince 
that the Yijayanagara army invaded Telingana for the 
second time. The expedition was commanded by one 
of Harihara’s capable officers called Gunda or Gunda 
Dandunatha. It is stated in an epigraph of Yarragudi- 
dinne in the Kurnool district dated 1870 A. D. that 
Gunda was the son of a certain Salakaladeva, and 
that he was the lord of Alampura. According 
to another inscription in the Kesavaswami temple 
at Beliir, Gunda conquered Andhra in addition to 
several other countries enumerated therein. || In his 
Andhra campaigns, he seems to have been greatly 
helped by -a certain Gonka Raddi Nayaka ; and in 
recognition of his services Gmgda secured for Gonka 
the governorship of Mullanadu in Coorg. ** Although 
Guntja claims victory over the Andhras, Pedda 
Vedagiri seems to have defeated and driven him back. 
The date of this expedition is not ascertained yet. 
As the inscription of Gonka Raddi is dated in 1890, 
Guide’s expedition against the Andhras may be 
assigned to an earlier date.

ORIGIN OF THE EMPIRE 

The hostility between the rulers of Vijayanagara 
and Racalconda continued for another quarter of a 
century or more until Devaraya I by following a 
policy of conciliation won the permanent friendship 
of the Yelamaa. The history of the relations between 
Racakonda and Vijayanagara subsequent to the death 
of Harihara II does not concern us here as they fall 
outside the period of our enquiry. 

Section 4 : — (8) Kondavldu : Prolaya Vema, the 
founder of the Reddi kingdom of Kondavhju was an 
officer under Prataparudra II. On the death of his 
master, he attempted to seize the Telugu country south 
of the Krsna ; but was only partly successful, as he was 
able to establish his authority over a limited area only, 
extending from the river Kj^iia to Kandukur in the 
north of the Nellore district and from the Bay of 
Bengal to the Snsaila mountain in the Kurnool district. 
Large portions of Nellore, Kurnool, Anantapur, and 
Be]lary districts and the whole of Cuddapah over whieh 
Prataparudra ruled appear to have slipped out of his 
hands, on account of circumstances which have not yet 
come under our purview. If after the death of Pratapa- 
rudrh anarchy were prevailing here, as in the other 
parts of the kingdom, Prolaya Vema would not have 
found it difficult to subjugate this region also. His 
failure to bi’ing under his sway the whole of the 
southern Telugu country, especially Nellore which was 
the birth-place of his family, * points to the existence 
of some obstacle which he could not overcome. Some

ten years later, this area was included in the dominions 
of the Rftyas of Vijayanagara. It is not unreasonable 
to suppose that they were in possession of it from the 
time of Prataparudra. This, however, is a mere sug- 
gestion, and it may be taken for what it is worth. 

Whatever be the causes which prevented Prolaya 
Vema from imposing his yoke over the whole of the 
southern Telugu country, he managed to hold what he 
seized until 1350. According to one writer, he declared 
his independence at Vinukonda about 1328. * As he 
pushed his conquests eastwards, he appears to have 
found it to be unsuitable as his capital ; therefore, 
he shifted the head-quarters of his government to 
Addanki, at present a village in the Ongole taluk a 
of the Guntur district. 

Prolaya Vema could not have been very friendly 
with the RUyas of Vijayanagara. He wanted to acquire 
as much territory as he could conquer in the southern 
Telugu country ; and the Rayas seem to have felt an 
irresistible attraction towards the Ky§sna. Although 
no outbreak of war between the two states is recorded, 
Prolaya Vema seems to have sustained some loss of 
territory. The district of Vinukonda belonged, as 
already noticed, to him from the day on which he laid 
'the foundations of his new kingdom ; but it passed into 
the hands of Bukka I sometime before 1352. f This 
transference of territory could not have been effected 
by peaceful means.

ORIGIN OF THE EMPIRE 


Prolaya Verna was succeeded by his eldest son, 
Anapota. He ruled for a period of twelve years from 
1350 to 1362. His reign was on the whole prosperous, 
, notwithstanding his frequent wars with the Velamas of 
Racaltonda. For some reason, unknown at present, 
he was obliged to change the head-quarters of his 
government. The capital of the kingdom was at first 
Addanki in the Ongole taluka of the Guntur district. 
Anapota abandoned this city, and repaired to the wild 
hilly tract in the north-east of Palnad, where he built a 
fort on the top of a rock. * This was the famous fort 
of Kondavidu which was destined to play an important 
part in the history of the east-coast during the next 
two or three centuries. The change of the capital was 
probably due to the ever-increasing pressure of the 
governors of Udayagiri upon his southern frontier. 
Anapota died in 1862 and was succeeded by his 
younger brother Anavema. During his reign, there 
appears to have been some trouble in the northern 
districts of the kingdom. The country between the 
rivers ICrgna and Godavari was included in the Reddi 
kingdom sinoe the days of his father ; there seems to 
have been a rebellion in this region; for according to 
one of his inscriptions at &rl£ailam, Anavema destroyed 
Rajamahendrapura, Niravadyapura and other slhala- 
durgas , Having ruled for a period of nineteen years, 
Anavema died in A. D. 1381, and was succeeded by 
his nephew Kumaragiri. The decline of the Reddi 
kingdom began with the accession of Kumaragiri. He 
was a lover of ease and pleasure. In spite of the efforts 
of KStaya-Vema, his brother-in-law and minister, he

lost a good deal of territory within four or five years 
of his accession. Harihara II conquered the regions 
surrounding !§nsailam and Tripurantakam before 1386; 
and his son Devaraya who became the governor of 
Udayagiri about 1380, captured the old Reddi capital, 
and annexed the territory along the east-coast extend- 
ing as far as Motupalli before A. D. 1390. * As a 
consequence of these aggressions, Kumaragiri Reddi 
lost nearly one third of his dominions ; but he managed 
to keep his authority over the rest until 1403 A. D., 
when he seems to have died. 

The internal affairs of the kingdom of Vijaya- 
nagara soon offered an opportunity for the ruler of 
Kondavldu to recover what he had lost. During the 
last years of Harihara II, there seems to have been 
much uncertainty about the succession to the throne. 
Harihara II had several sons whom he employed as 
’ the governors of provinces. Three of them, princes 
Devaraya, Immadi Bukka, and Virupanna rose to 
prominence, and each of them entertained hopes of 
ascending the throne. Devaraya or Praudha Devaraya, 
as he is sometimes called, was the crown prince and he 
waB the governor of the important fortress of Udayagiri 
from 1382 onwards. Immadi Bukka was a famous 
warrior, and he was governing the province of Mulbagal 
about 1391. Virupanna was the governor of the 
Tamil country from 1380 onwards and he succeeded 
to the power and influence of Kampala II.

ORIGIN OF THE EMPIRE 

According to an old record, Harihara II seems 
to have fallen ill sometime before 1404. * On hearing 
the news of his illness, all his three sons mentioned 
above, hastened to Vijayanagara, so that they might 
watch their respective interests personally, t 
Harihara II died in 1404 ; $ and his death seems to 
have been followed by the outbreak of a civil war 
which disturbed the peace of the kingdom during 
the next two years. § 

The internal disturbances did not fail to attract the 
attention of the enemies of Vijayanagara. Feroz Shah, 
the Sultan of Gnlbuvga, invaded the Raicur doab 5T 
and the Reddis, taking advantage of the absence of the 
army from Udayagiri, invaded that province in 1406 
and occupied it for sometime. The Reddi forces which 
were commanded by Cenna Reddi- Anna Reddi-Malla 
Reddi subdued the districts of Pottapi and Pulugula 
nadu. H They thus had the satisfaction of turning 
the tables over their enemies. The expulsion of the 
Reddis and the reconquest of Udayagiri by Devaraya I 
are subjects that do not come under the scope of the 
present discussion. 

What has been said so far is enough to establish 
,the identity of the Andhra enemies of Bukka I and 
Harihara II, They were the Velamas of Racakon^a,

and the Rcddis of Kondavidu. The former, it should 
he noted, had the title of Andhra-de^adhU vara . * 
Bukka I and his son waged wars on them not to 
suppress any rebellion, but to destroy their inde- 
pendence by conquering their respective kingdoms. 
The Telugu people of the southern and the western 
districts never rose up in rebellion against them but 
remained submissive to them and their descendants. 
Therefore, the subjugation of the Andhras mentioned 
in the inscriptions of Bukka I and Harihara II cannot 
at all be said to be incompatible with their Telugu 
origin, as the conquered Telugu country belonged to 
the kingdoms of Racakonda and Kondavidn.

Chapter V. 

THE EXPANSION OF THE KINGDOM OF 
VIJAYANAGARA. 

Section 1 1 The tract of territory over which Vlra 

Kampiladeva ruled should be regarded as the nucleus 
around which the empire of Vijayanagara had grown 
up *, fox it was entrusted to Harihara I by Sultan 
Muhammad a few years after he had overthrown ' 
Kampila. The date on which Sultan Muhammad 
appointed Harihara as the governor of the conquered 
country is not known. In the light of the information 
supplied by the Muhammadan historians, it can only 
be said that Harihara was appointed sometime between 
1327 and 1341. However, a study of Harih ora’s 
inscriptions may enable us to ascertain the date more 
precisely. According to the Kapalur plates, he was 
reigning at Kunjarakona in 1336. * As this grant is 
declared spurious, the date it supplies may not be 
considered trustworthy ; but it is not improbable that 
Harihara should have been ruling the country then ; for 
according to the Atakalagunda f and the Badami X 
inscriptions dated 1339-40, he was the lord of extensive 
territories which he had conquered extending from the 
eastern to the western sea. It would have taken at 
least some two or three years to effect the conquest of 
the land lying between the Bay of Bengal and the 
Arabian Sea. In that case, he should have been ruling 
the kingdom of Kampila either from 1336 or the next 
year. That coincides roughly with the date supplied 
by the Kapalur and the Yeryagu^Li plates. § Therefore,

it may be assumed, at the present state of our know- 
ledge, that Ilarihara’s appointment should have taken 
place in A. D. 1336 or even a little earlier. 

The exact extent of territory which the Sultan 
entrusted to his care is not known ; but it may be 
safely assumed that it. included almost the whole of 
the present Bellary district, and a portion of the doab 
between the Tungabhadra and the Kp§na. A close 
scrutiny of Harihara’s inscriptions shows that he rapidly 
extended his dominions by conquering the lands of his 
neighbours, and that the process of conquest gradually 
spread from the east to the west. It is stated in an 
inscription at Ssrngeri * dated 1346 that Harihara had 
conquered * the earth from the eastern to the western 
ocean.’ Marapa * acquired a kingdom in the west ’ from 
Kallasa. f This conquest of ‘ the earth from the eastern 
to the western ocean ' should have been completed be- 
fore 1339-40 ; for in the Atakalagunda and the Badami 
inscriptions referred to above, Harihara assumes the 
significant title of ' P&rva-PaScima-SamudrQdhipati,' or 
‘ the lord of the eastern and the western ocean \ As 
the kings of Vijayanagara never maintained a fleet to 
control the seas, the expression should be taken to mean 
the sovereignty of the land bordering on both the seas. 
As a matter of fact, Harihara I was ruling on both the 
coasts about 1340. According to a Kodavaluru epigraph, 
Kampana I was ruling in the Nellore district in 1347. J 
Another epigraph near the Buggabhavi at Udayagiri 
dated 1348, records a gift of Kampala to a deity. § 
Therefore, Kampana’s rule over Udayagiri should 
have begun either in 1342 or a little earlier, Now, 
Bukka I had a son of the name of Virfipapjja.

ORIGIN OF THE EMPIRE 


The term ' Uddagiri ’ is frequently prefixed to his 
name in his inscriptions. ‘ Uddagiri * is the contracted 
form of Udayagiri. In order to acquire the epithet 
* Uddagiri,’ he must have been either bom in the place, 
or should have been its governor for sometime. If he 
was bora at Udayagiri, when could the event have 
happened? Virupanna was posted in 1844 to Penu- 
gonda * which Harihara I or his brother Bultka 
conquered from the HoysalaB between 1340 and 1344. 
They would not have placed a conquered district under 
the charge of an infant. If it be assumed thut 
Virupanna was at least ten years old at the time of his 
appointment as the commandant of the fortress of 
Penugonda, he should have been bora about 1334 ; and 
if his birth took place at Udayagiri, that fort should 
have been in the possession of his father at the time. 
If, on the other hand, the other alternative is accepted, 
VirSpanna should have been the governor of Udayagiri 
before 1343 ; for the family of Kampana I who began 
to rule the district in that year continued to hold it 
until 1380 or even later. In order that the name 
Udayagiri should become specially associated with 
Virupanna, he ought to have been connected with fhe 
administration of the province for a comparatively 
long period of time. In any case, the Nellore district 
in which Udayagiri is situated, seems to have ‘ formed 
a portion of the original Vijayanagara kingdom.' t 

Section 2 : — The conquest of the west coast was 
also effected more or less at the same time. It is 
evident from the statement of Ibn Battuta that Konkan 
acknowledged the supremacy of Vijayanagara in 
1342. $ The conquest of the country should have taken

place before that date. Harihara I iB said to have 
constructed a fort at Barakuru in 1336 A. D. * As this 
statement is based on tradition whose authenticity 
cannot be proved, it may be set aside as unreliable. 
There can be little doubt that Harihara invaded South 
Canara in 1338. A Hoysala epigraph dated in that year 
records a visit of Ballala III to his army stationed at 
Barakuru. j* He commanded Ankeya Nayaka, his 
general in charge of the army * to remain in Barakuru.' 
When Ankeya replied, “ I will stay, Jiya ” Ballala was 
so pleased with the answer that he granted him the 
village of Aladahalli. It is evident that Barakuru was 
attacked by some enemy in 1338, whom the Hoysala 
generals were not able to check. Their position 
appears to have become precarious and Ballala 
entertained serious doubts about the safety of Barakuru, 
the capital of the district. Therefore, he personally 
visited the plaoe to encourage his army. When the 
officer Ankeya said that he would stay at the post of 
duty, Ballala was so pleased that he rewarded him with 
the grant of a village. This probably indicates the 
desperate character of the work which the officer had 
undertaken to do in the face of danger. Who was 
the enemy that attacked the Hoysalas in this part of 
their kingdom ? It is asserted that the Alupas attacked 
the Hoysala generals at Barakuru and that Ballala 
went to the place to defend it. “ The rulers of Tuluva 
were the Alup&s, and their capital was Barakuru. It was 
to break the power of the Alupas that the Hoysala ruler 
visited the Tuluva centre,” X This, however, is not 
possible. Althongh the conquest of the Tuluva coun- 
try was undertaken by Ballala III as early as 1319, it 
could not h&ve been completed before 1333 j for, none

The authority of Ballala, as shown by this 
schedule, was recognised until 1341. There is no 
indication of an Alupa rebellion daring this period. 
On the contrary, the Alupas seem to have remained 
submissive under his rule. If, under the circumstances, 
Barakuru was threatened by an enemy, that enemy 
should have come from outside. The only foe who 
, could have attempted the conquest of this region was 
i Harihara ; therefore, it must have been his invasion of 
Barakuru which compelled Ballala III to go to the front. 
\ It is interesting to note that the queen Kikkayi Tayi, 
i mentioned in these inscriptions, played an important 
f part in the administration of the Tulu country during 
the reigns of both Ballala III and Harihara 1. Who 
was she ? and what was her place in the administrative 
machinery of the province ? It is suggested that she 
was the queen of BallSla IH. * This is not improbable.

rulers of Bavakuru. * Ballala III might have married 
her for political reasons on his conquest of the territory 
of the Slupas. It is interesting to note that this queen 
survived Ballala and became a subordinate of Hariharal. 
She was one of Harihara’s subordinates who attended 
in 1B46 the festival which he celebrated at Syngeri in 
honour of his conquest of the earth from * the eastern 
to the western ocean.’ On this occasion she granted 
to Bharat! Tlrtha !§rlpada the village of Hosavur m 
Santalige nadu for the maintenance of his servants. 
Kikkayi Tayi who was the queen of Ballala III 
would not have become a subordinate of the king of 
Vijayanagara without a struggle. It is obvious that 
the Tulu country was conquered by Harihara I, 
Although the Hoysalas ruled in parts of South Canara 
until 1341, it is not improbable that Harihara's invasion 
should have taken place three years earlier. 

Section 3 : — The conquest of the Hoysala King- 
dom. — In the opinion of some writers, the founders of 
Vijayanagara did not acquire the Hoysala dominions 
by conquest, but obtained them as a legacy from a 
grateful monarch for meritorious services rendered on 
the field of battle. J “ Even the feudatory petty kings 
who served under the Hoysalas at once transferred 
their allegiance to Harihara.” § This is far from the 
truth. Harihara I and his brothers had, in faot, to 
wage several wars with the Hoysala monarchs and 
their dependents before they could establish their 
authority over the Hoysala territoi’ies. 

When exactly the struggle between the Hoysalas 
and the founders of Vijayanagara began, it is not 
known. By 1338, as pointed out already, war had

broken out between them in Konkan. At the same 
time, hostilities seem to have commenced in the Kolar 
district on the eastern frontier of the Hoysala kingdom. 
Ballala IU seems to have entrusted its defence to 
Ballappa Danpayaka, the younger brother of Dati 
Singeya Dapnayaka. A few inscriptions bearing dates v 
from 13S7 to 1339 record the grants of some private y

ORIGIN OF THE EMPIRE 

took place in the Nigarili Solamandalam, a district 
included in the Colamandala. Therefore, these inscrip- 
tions are said to 1 refer to a war against the Muham- 
madans of the south.’ * Nigarili Solamandalam where 
the fighting was going on during these years, was not 
in Colamandala. It was the name by which the present 
Kolar district was known during the Hoysala timeB. 
The name was originally given to it by the Colas in the 
tenth or the early eleventh century, f and the Hoysala 
monarchs who succeeded them in this part of their 
empire preserved the Cola administrative system intact. 
Consequently the names which the Colas gave to the 
administrative divisions survived their empire and it 
was how the Kolar district came to be known us 
Nigarili !§ olamandalam during the rule of the Hoysala 
monarchs. It is inconceivable how the Muhammadans 
of the south i. e., of Madura could have come so far 
north as the Kolar district and offered battle to 
Ballappa Dannayaka. If Ballappa fought in Kolar 
against the Muhammadans of Madura in 1337, his 
adversary should have been Sheriff Jalal-ud-Din 
Ahsan Shah, the founder of the Madura sultanate. Ibn 
Battuta, a son-in-law of Jalal-ud-Din who paid a visit 
to Madura in 1343 gives an account of the history 
of the sultanate of Madura. 

“ Formerly, the country of Ma'bar had submitted 
to the authority of Sultan Muhammad of Dihly (Delhi). 
A revolt was stirred up amongst hia followers by my

time he set out to conquer the infidels ; he took a consi- 
derable amount of riches and ample spoils from them 
and returned to his own state. The following year he 
led a second expedition against the idolators and routed 
them and massacred a large number. The same day on 
which he inflicted this disaster upon them it happened 
that he took off his helmet in order to drink ; an arrow 
shot by an unknown hand struck him and he died 
on the field. His son-in-law, Kotbeddin (Qntb-ud-Din) 
Feroz was placed upon the throne ; but as his 
conduct was generally disapproved of, he waB killed 
at the end of forty days. The Sultan Ghiyatheddin 
(Ghiyas-ud-Din) was invested with authority, he 
married the daughter of the Sultan and Sheriff 
Djelaleddin. It is the sister of this same girl that 
I had married at Dihly (Delhi).” * 

The rebellion of Sheriff Jalal-ud-Din broke out in 
1335. f In order to suppress this rebellion, Snltan 
Muhammad marched at the head of an army to Ma'bar. 
When he reached Warrangal in 1336, he was stricken 
with disease, so that he had to abandon the idea of 
going to Ma’bar at the time. $ The troubles of the 
Sultan which prevented him in the succeeding years to 
resume the campaign could not have been known to 
Jalal-ud-Din in 1337. Therefore, he should have been 
expecting the arrival of the Delhi army at any lime. 
Moreover, Ibn Battuta does not refer to any campaign 
of his father-in-law against the infidels, although he 
takes particular care to record all the expeditions of 
Ala-ud-Din TJdauji and- GhiySs-ud-Din, It is unlikely 
that Sheriff Jalal-ud-Din should have undertaken an ex- 
pedition against the kingdom of Ballala III in the year

succeeding his rebellion. In fact the Muhammadans of 
the south did not come into conflict with Balliila until 
1340. By that time Jalal-ud-Din was assassinated 
and Ala-ud-Din Udauji ascended the throne. 

The enemy who attacked the eastern frontier of 
the Hoy galas in 1337 should have been the master 
of the adjacent Telugu country. The northern part 
of the Anantapur district passed into the hands of 
Harihara I before 1340. The fort of Gutti has been 
described in an undated epigraph as “ the navel to 
the wheel of sovereignty over the whole earth of 
the illustrious king Bukka.’' * It is also said that it 
increased his fortune. This refers to a period when 
Gutti was the centre of the territory over which 
Bukka I ruled. After 1 340, Bukka began his conquest 
of the Hoysala dominions from the east. Very soon 
he shifted the head-quarters of his government to 
Hosapattana in the Hoysala country. No doubt, he 
had an alternate capital in the Anantapur district, but 
that was no longer Gutti but Penugonda. f Therefore 
the Gutti inscription should be assigned to a date 
earlier than 1340. This is corroborated by the Atakala- 
guiida epigraph of Harihara I dated 1339 in which he 
is said to have been ruling the earth with Gutti as his 
nelevldu. $ It follows from this that he was the mas- 
ter of the Telugu country to the east of the Hoy- 
Bala kingdom. Ballappa Dann.ayaka should have been 
jfighting not against the Muhammadans of the south, 
? but against Bukka I, the most prominent of the five 
brothers who founded the kingdom of Vijayanagara. 

The conquest of the Hoysala kingdom properly so 
called may he said to have began in 1341. Ballala III 
was summoned to his southern frontier to defend it

against the inroads of Ala-ud-Din Udauji, the Sultan o£ 
Madura. Before he left his capital, Ballala IT! is said 
to have performed the abhi<elca of his son Vira Ballala 
Riiya * so that in the northern part of the kingdom, 
people might not feel the absence of their sovereign, 
and forget the obligations of loyalty. Probably, he had 
also some sort of presentiment of the disaster which 
was to overtake him ere long on the battle-field of 
Beribi or Trichinopoly. Having entrusted the king- 
dom to the care of a new monarch, and a faithful 
body of ministers, he took his departure from Dora- 
samudra never more to return. 

In the meanwhile, Sultan Udauji whose military 
activities summoned Ballala III to the south was 
assassinated by an unknown enemy ; and he was 
ultimately succeeded by Ghiyas-ud-Din who turned 
out to he more inhuman than his predecessor. It 
was against this ruler that Ballala III marohed at the 
head of Mb army which * exceeded hundred thousand 
men/ In addition to these, Ballala had in his service 
4 twenty thousand Mussalmans.’ No information is 
available regarding the operations during the first year 
of the war ; but it is certain that nothing serious happen- 
ed. At the beginning of the next year, a battle was 
fought at a place called Cobban, and the Muhamma- 
dans met with a crushing disaster. They fled in 
confusion to Madura, their capital, leaving the garrison 
at Cobban to defend itself as well as it could, j - The

defeat of the Muhammadan army left the path to 
the interior of the Madura kingdom open ; and Ballala 
marched triumphantly as far as Ramefivaram where he 
set up a pillar of victory. * Having thus demon- 
strated his strength, he returned to Cobban where he 
busied himself in attempting to take the plaoe. 

The handful of Muhammadans who defended 
Cobban against Ballala were hard pressed. Their 
supplies were very nearly exhausted. Ballala who 
had no desire to kill them offered them safe conduct, 
if they would abandon the fort and retire. They 
replied that they could not do anything without 
consulting their Sultan. Ballala thereupon declared a 
truce of fourteen days during which the Muham- 
madan soldiers were expected to communicate with 
their Sultan, and obtain his opinion. When the news 
of the sad condition of the garrison at Cobban reached 
Madura, the Sultan collected a body of 3,000 soldiers 
and approached Cobban by rapid marches. Ballala 
was off his guard, probably under the notion that the 
enemy would not attack him so long as the truce 
lasted; but the Mnhammadans who were at Cobban 
had no respect for conventions. They suddenly fell 
upon the Hindu host during the hour of siesta. Ghiyas- 
ud-Din with his troops appeared on the scene in time 
to complete the discomfiture of the Hindus. All was 
confusion and disorder in the Hindu camp and they 
were easily defeated. Ballala III himself fell into the 
hands of his enemies. At first, he was imprisoned and 
treated with consideration. When the Sultan extorted 
from him as much money as he could, he had him 
murdered in his prison, f

f South I, id. Mith, In. App, B. 839, Ballala was tilled, according to an 
inscription (EC, Iv. Kd, 78), on the battle field of Beribl on Sept. 8,1343; but 

[ 141 ]

Tho long absence of Ballala in the south, his 
subsequent defeat at the hands of the Mussulmans and 
ultimate death in prison seem to have let loose the 
forces of disintegration which soon undermined the 
foundations of the Hoysala kingdom. Ballala IV was 
solemnly crowned at Dorasamudra in 1343 ; * but he 
appeal's to have made no effort to restore the fast 
disappearing fortunes of his family. Under the cir- 
cumstances, the Hoysala kingdom should have appeared 
a very tempting morsel for invaders to grab at ; and 
they soon made their appearance on the scene. 

Harihara I and his brothers had already made 
themselves masters of bits of Hoysala territory here 
and there. They now proceeded to subjugate the 
whole kingdom in a systematic fashion. While 
Ballala IV was being crowned at Dorasamudra, their 


Jbn Batffita declare® that ho was taken, prisoner, Sultan GhiySs-ud-Din, having 
extorted from Ballala all his wealth, f had him killed and flayed ; his skin was 
stuffed with straw, and hung upon the wall of Moutra (Madura), where I saw 
it suspended.’ {South Ind. In . App* B, p. 239). Since Battuta saw the 

stuffed skin of Ballala hanging on the walls of Madura, it is clear that ha did 
not die on the battle field. This view is also indirectly supported by the 
evidence of the inscriptions. Ballaja III, as mentioned already, is said to have died 
on 8th Sept. X342. His son's coronation did not take place until June 28, 1343. 
There was thus an interval of nearly ten months between the supposed date 
of Ballala Ill’s death and the coronation of his son. The reason for this long 
interval is not dear, unless we suppose that Ballala was in the hands of the 
enemy who was holding out hopes of release until he extorted all his wealth from 
him. If ,Ghiyls~ud-Dm succeeded in squeezing his wealth from BallEla, he 
should have allowed the prisoner to communicate with his officers, so that 
they might furnish him the necessary ransom. In that case, the fact that he 
was alive after the battle would be known to his officers, and also to his son. 
So long as Ballala Was alive, there was no need for the celebration of his son’s 
coronation* When, however, the news of his murder reached Dorasamudra, 
the coronation was celebrated. The wrong date given in Kd. 76 can only be 
explained in one way. It is a v’iragal inscription set up in memory of a 
common soldier who died fighting at Beribi, by a relation living in a remote 
part of the country. Again the memorial stonB was set up 23 years after the 
death of the soldier. The author of the inragul inscription should have 
hUBoipornted the general belief in the country that BaUEJa HI died in the 
battle of Berfti which ttfas actually fought on September 8, 1342.

The earliest Vijayanagara inscription in the 
Hoysala kingdom comes from the Bangalore distinct. 
Nl. 19 which is dated in 1340 records the grant of a 
certain MahUsamantadhiga ti Mayileya Nay aka who was 
ruling Kukkalanad as a subordinate of Harihara I, 
This chief appears to be a descendant of Mayileya 
Nayaka-Cenneya Nayaka who was ruling in Kukkala- 
nad aB a subordinate of Ballala III in 1333. * It is 
evident that Mayileya NSyaka transferred his allegiance 
to the king of Vijayanagara Bometime before 1340. 
Mayileya the ruler of Kukkalanad would not have 
recognised Harihara I as his overlord, unless he was 
subjugated by force of arms. It would mean that 
Harihara invaded the Hoysala kingdom before 1340.

Probably Ballappa Daniiayaka who was guarding, as 
described already, the eastern frontier, was defeated, 
and the Vijayanagara forces overran the districts of the 
Hoysala kingdom in the neighbourhood of the 
frontier. Their success, however, seems to have been 
short-lived ; for a few of Ballala Ill’s inscriptions 
dated in the succeeding year are found in the Nela- 
mangala taluk a. 

The conquest of the Hoysala kingdom was 
seriously undertaken in 1343. Kolar in the east and 
Hassan in the west seems to have passed finally into the 
hands of Harihara I. The coronation of Ballala IV was 
celebrated on Friday, 5th day of the dark fortnight of 
of the month of fSravana in the year Svabhanu corres- 
ponding to &aka 1265. * The first inscription of 
Harihara is dated on Thursday 1st of the bright half 
of the month of KSirttika in the year &vcibhanu 
corresponding to 5§aka 1265. f Therefore, Harihara I 
wrested from Ballala IV the district of Hassan in which 
his capital Dorasamudra stood within three months 
after his coronation. Probably Dorasamudra itself fell 
into the hands of Harihara at the same time. The 
conquest of the other districts followed soon. Although 
1343 is the latest date found in the Hoysala inscrip- 
tions, the earliest of Vijayanagara inscriptions in all 
the districts do not belong to that year or the next. 
The earliest date of Vijayanagara grants in Penu- 
gojj-da, KSlar and Mysore is 1344 ; in Citaldrug it is 
1345 *, in Bangalore it is 1340 ; and in Kadfir it is 
1346. And no Vijayanagara record belonging to a date 
prior to 1354 is bo far discovered in Tumkur. It is 
clear that the conquerors did not find their task easy. 
They met ’faith resistance from the officers and depen- 
* dents of the departed Hoysala kings. Nevertheless

they were able to bring under their control most of the

Naganna, the president of Bubka's council, subjugated 
the Hoysana country. According to the inscription des- 
cribing this campaign, these officers were unwilling to 
give up Sosavur, the birth place of the Hoysalas. 
Evidently they were besieged in the place by some 
enemey who pressed them to surrender it ; however, 
as they were confident that they could withstand the 
besiegers, they expressed their unwillingness to give it 
up. The idea of surrender could not have arisen, 
except under circumstances as described above. Now, 
who could be the enemy that was interested in taking 
Sosavur ? It is said that the Hoysalas held this place 
in great veneration, owing to the fact that the family 
had its origin there. As Sosavur was not an important 
place, its possession could have been desired only on 
sentimental grounds. Therefore, it may reasonably be 
supposed that the people who pressed for the surrender 
of Sosavur were none other than the Hoysalas. It is 
probably to this campaign that Buklta I refers in 
one of his inscriptions. “ Having freed from enemies 
one hundred royal cities beginning from Dorasamudra, 
he ruled over a kingdom perfect in seven parts.” * 
He is also said to have made the Hoysala kingdom an 
ornament to his arm, that is, after conquering it. f 

The subjugation of nearly the whole of the 
Hoysala country should have been completed, as 
already mentioned, before 1346. A few places pro- 
bably still resisted the officers of Harihara \ but their 
conquest was considered inevitable. Harihara appears 
to have felt that he should celebrate the completion 
of the conquest of the country between the two seas in 
a suitable mauner. $ Therefore he summoned his 
brothers, relations, dependents, and officers to Srngeri

to attend a festival which he wanted to celebrate in 
honour of his victory ; and the festival was accord- 
ingly celebrated in 1346 A. D., when liberal gifts were 
distributed among the assembled Brahmans. Hence- 
forward, the authority of the Rayas was firmly esta- 
blished in the Hoysala country, in spite of the outbreak 
of a few rebellions here and there. * 


* There appears to have been some disturbance in the Canarese country at 
the beginning of the reign of Hariharft n. A rebellion broke out in Konkan in 
1380. “ Some base persons bom in the Konkan country, having risen against 

him, in the war (which followed), -Baieappa greatly distinguished himself, sent 
many of the Konknmgas to destruction, and gained the heavenly world." The 
rebellion seems to have spread to the Hoysala country also ; for in an inscription 
of 1384, {Jr. Sam. H4H. Soc i. p. 126) it is said that the Iloysalas were one of the 
people whom Hatihara II had conquered. " Having conquered his enemies, and 
the prominent countries of kings of Karntta, Kuntala, Konkaqa, Hoysala, Andhra, 
Faniya and Coja the great lord of the earth (i e., Hatihara 11) enjoys all 
glories." This seems to have been the last effort of the people of the Hoysana 
country to throw off the yoke of Vijayanagnra. Very soon, the authority of the 
REyas became firmly established and the Hoysana country remained under them 
as long as their power lasted.

tion. Refers to the

Ballala III invaded the

kingdom of Vlra- 
Kampiladeva, and 
lay encamped at 
Siruguppe. A battle 
was fought in 
which some of Bal- 
lala’s officers were 
killed. The inscrip- 
tion is only a frag- 
ment. 


(6) The extent of the kingdom — EO. VII 
Ci. 24 mentions Doravadi in Kurngodu nadu as the 
place of Mummadi Singeya Nay aka's residence ; his 
dominions extended in. the south as far as Holalkere in 
the CitaLdrug district, (EC XI, Hr. 106; MAR 1912, 






ORIGIN OF THE EMPIRE 

p. d5 5 MAR 1913; p. 60). It included Hariliara and 
probably also the whole of Davanagere taluka. (EC. XI. 
Eg. 26). In the east, it extended as far as Siiuguppe 
in the Bellary district (MAR. 1923 No. 121). So far as 
can be deduced from these inscriptions, the kingdom 
of Kampiladeva comprised large portions of the present 
Bellary and Citaldrng districts. 

(c) Doravadi : — Where was Doravadi situated V 
According 1 o EC. VII. Ci. 24 it was included in the 
Kura go du nadu. Where was Kurugodu nadu? The 
district was evidently named after its chief town Kura- 
godu, which is identical with the present Kurugodu in 
the Bellary taluka. Therefore, the town, Doravadi 
should be looked for in the Bellary taluka or somewhere 
in its neighbourhood. An inscription of a subordinate 
of the Sinda chief, Kalideva of Kurugodu, limits the 
field of our search further.

“ S/I. iv. 360. 

From this, it is seen that Doravadi nadu was in 
Ballakunde 300, of which the capital was the town of 
Kurugodu. What is more interesting still is that 
Hampe was included in the district of Doravadi. As 
Ballakunde was a smalL district, the town of Doravadi 
must have stood somewhere in the neighbourhood of 
Hampe. No place of the name seems to exist at present 
in the Hospet talulca in which Hampe is included, or 
anywhere else in the Bellary distriot aa to that matter. 


[167 ] 



VIJAYANAGARA 


There is, however, a place called Daroji in the neigh- 
bourhood of Hampe, and it is not unlikely that it 
represents the old town of Doravadi. This is not a 
wild guess. An inscription from Kurulcuppe very 
near Daroji (MER. 727 of 1922) refers 4 to a temple of 
Virupakga built at Kureya-kuppe an agrahara village 
in the Doravadi venbke of the Hastinavati valita. 
Therefore, Daroji may be taken as the modern name of 
the ancient Doravadi. 

If Daroji (Doravadi) were the place of residence 
of Kampiladeva, then Tlampe which is almost within a 
dozen miles of Daroji, Bhould have been included in 
his kingdom. This is proved by an epigraph of Vira 
Kampiladeva at Hampe recording the construction of 
the temple of Prasanna Virhpak§a in 1309. There- 
fore, Ballala III who was in a chronic state of war with 
Kampiladeva could not have secured a footing so very 
close to the latter's capital as Hampe ; nor could lie 
have built any fort or city in the place. After the 
death of Kampiladeva, his kingdom was annexed by 
the Sultan of Delhi who entrusted its government 
about 1336 to Harihava I of Vijayanagara. It is pretty 
certain that Ballala III had nothing to do with the 
construction of the city of Vijayanagara. 

(d) J Relations with the KMJcatiyas : — The position 
of the kingdom of Doravadi, situated as it was between 
the Hoysala and the Kakatiya dominions brought it 
often into hostile contact with its neighbours. The wars 
which Kampiladeva waged with. Ballaja III have been 
already described in the body of the present work. 
An attempt is here made to narrate briefly Kampila- 
deva's relations with the Kakatiya king. It is stated in 
the JBhimeamrapurdna of Jarinatha that Prolaya Anna, 
one of the generals of Prataparudra II destroyed the 

[ 168 ] 



ORIGIN OF THE EMPIRE 


pleasure gardens of Kuramata. + The battle, in which, 
the early Aravlh chief, Kotikanti Raghava defeated 
Kampiladeva, was probably fought in the course of this 
invasion. ■}* The cause of this struggle is not very 
difficult to find. Almost the whole of the western 
Telugu country was included in the Seuna dominions 
during the reigns of Singhana and Kannara. Their 
inscriptions are found as far south-east as Jammala- 
madugu in the Cuddapah district. The Seuna 
authority in the Telugu country was gradually over- 
thrown by the Kakatlyas. The country corresponding 
to the present districts of Cuddapah and Kurnool was 
conquered by Ganapati ; but a portion of the Telugu 
country was still left in the hands of the Seunas. 
During the early years of Prataparudra IT, a successful 
attempt was made to wrest the remaining Telugu 
districts from Ramadeva. Vitthala-bhunatha, one of the 
generals serving under Prataparudra marched probably

from Panugal at the head of his army, and “ captured 
the forts of Adavani, Tumbulara, Manuva and Haluva.” 
He entered the fort of Raicur in A. D. 1296, and 
constructed a * stone fort (in the place of a mud one) 
for the protection of all the kingdom and the people.’ * 
As a result of Vitthala’s conquests, the western 
boundary of the Kakatlya kingdom passed very near 
Kampili, the moat important city in Kampiladeva's 
dominions. The expansion of his kingdom towards 
the west should have brought Prataparudra II into 
violent contact with Kampila, who seems to r have 
suffered defeat in the struggle that followed. But the 
history of this struggle still remains obscure ; and it is 
not possible, at the present state of our knowledge, to 
describe fully all the events connected with it.

A NOTE ON KANYA NlYAK. + 

The name of *the Hindu leader who successfully 
headed the rebellion in Telingana against Sultan 
Muhammad in 1344 is given differently by the 
Muhammadan historians. Zia Barn! refers to him as 
Kanya Nayak ; Nizam-ud-Din Ahmad calls him Kanya- 
pailc ; and Ferishta speaks of him as Krsii Nayak. 
The name of the leader is made up of two words : 
( 1 ) Kanya or Kr§na ( 2 ) Nayak or paik. So far as the 
first, part of the name is concerned, it may be said 
that there is no real difference ; for, the word Kanya 
is but the Telugu form of the Prakrt Kanha which 
is derived from the Sanskrt Krsna. Therefore, the 
words Krsna and Kanya must be taken as identical. 
The same thing, however, cannot be said of the second 
part, the words ‘ nayak 3 and * pailc } being radically 
different in their origin and meaning. Kayak means a 
chief, or leader, and paik has no intelligible meaning 
either in Telugu or Sanskrt. 

Syed Ali Azlz-ul-la Tabataba, the author of 
Burhan-i-ma’asir spells the word differently, though it 
is not easy to discover how exactly he originally 
spelt it. In one manuscript, i. e., the one adopted 
by Major King as the text of his translation, the word 
is written as Kana-bayand 5 but in the manuscript 


* M, S. ‘Sarma, in. an interesting article contributed to the JA&S v. 
pp. 217-32, arrives at the same conclusion, though he approaches the problem 
from a different standpoint- 


[ 171 ]

preserved in the British Museum,, this name is written 
in one place as Kaba-nand, and in another place as 
Kana-nidah. Even in Maj.or King’s text the spelling 
of the word is not uniformly the same, for, it is 
written in one place without any dot to the second 
letter in order to indicate its phonetic value. + The 
Bwhan-i-ma'asir, therefore, gives four different forms 
of the name : — 



The last may be left out of account, as it is not 
possible to read it in the absence of the dot to indicate 
the phonetic value of the second letter. The 
remaining three forms are Kana-bayand, Kaba-nand, 
and Kana-nidah. The name here also contains two 
members (i) Kana or Kaba and (ii) bayand, nand, or 
nidah. Kana, no doubt, is the same word asKanyaj 
and nand or nidah appears to be a corruption of 
nayaclu , nayandtt, nldtt, all meaning a nayak or chief j 
but Kaba and bayand still remain, unexplained like the 
J paik of Nizam-ud-Din Ahmad. In fact, there seems to 
be something in common between. Syed Ali and Nizam- 
ud-Din. On© of the forms which the name assumes 
in Burhan-i-ma’ asir is Kana-bay&nd. Let us compare 
it with Kanya-paik. They are the same. The word 
bayand like pciik gives no sense. We know from Barm 
that the right word is ‘ n&yak ' 3 and not 4 paihj How 
did the 'p' displace the * n ’ in the text of Nizam-ud-Din ?

ORIGIN OF THE EMPIRE 


The word Kaba, suggests the clue. Suppose we inter- 
change the place of * n ' in 1 Kanya ’ with that of 
* p * in ‘ paik we get 4 Kapya-nayak ’ in the place 
of Kanya-paik. If we adopt the spelling of Burkan-i- 
ma’asir, we should write the name as ‘ Kapya-nayand, 1 
which closely resembles Kaba-nand, one of the forms 
of the name given in that book. We believe that the 
real name of the leader of Telingana who revolted 
against Sultan Muhammad is Kapya-nayand (Kapaya 
Nayandu), and not Kanya or Kr§na Nay aka. Our 
belief^ is based upon the following facts. 


Kanya Nayak according to the Mussalman his- 
torians rose up in rebellion at Warrangal in 1344 • and 
he ruled Telingana with Warrangal as his capital until 
at least 1365 A. D. He was an enemy of Sultan 
Ala-ud-Dm Bahmani I and of his son Muhammad Shah 
with whom he fought several battles. It is evident 
from .this that Kanya Nayak was a great leader of the 
Telingana Hindus ; and that he re-established the lost 
independence of Telingana, and maintained it success- 
fully for thirty years. He should have left some 
records behind him to perpetuate his name and fame. 
Have we got any of his records ? 

When we search the Hindu records of the time, 
viz., the inscriptions, we find that Warrangal and 
with it Telingana was really in the possession of a 
Hindu king between 1346 and 1360 ; his name, 
however, was not Kanya Nayak but Kapaya Nayalca. 
He was ruling Smdhradesa probably from Warrangal, 
and fought with the Sultan AJa-ud-Din I of Gulburga. 
He seems to have several things in common with 
Kanya Nayak.

136B. 

4. He was an enemy of 
the Sultans Ala-ud- 
Din I and Muhammad 
Shah ofG-ulburga 
with whom he fought 
several times. 


The facts stated in the foregoing table make it 
clear that Kapaya Nayaka and Kanya Nayak were 
holding sway over Telingapa at the same time, 
having probably the same city of Warrangal as their 
capital. Moreover, both of them fought against the 
same enemy, the Sultan Ala-ud-din I of G-ulburga. 
Therefore, Kapaya and Kanya appear to be the names 
of the same person. 

If the real name of the leader of the Telingana 
rebellion was Kapaya Nayadu, how did he come to be 
known as Kanya Nayak to the Mussalman historians ? 
It iB easily explained : as nayak , nayadu, and

nayandu are but different forms of the same word, 
they do not need an explanation. The real difficulty 
is about the term Kapaya. How did it assume the 
form Kanya ? The word Kaba of Burhan-i-md'asir must 
be taken into consideration in this context. Kapaya 
was at first transformed into Kabaya and then to Kaba. 
In the Persian language the letters and V are 
interchangeable. Very often the same word is spelt 
with a v or v according to the whim of the writer or 
caligraphist. A few examples are sufficient to illustrate 
the point. * Asp ’ I in Persian means a horse ; 
but the word is also written as '- r +* u ' ‘ ash ’ ; the term 
‘ padshah ’ is written both as * ^ and sUjLi . an( j 

Dipalpur (the name of a city in Hindustan) is spelt 
in two ways : and Examples can easily 

be multiplied ; but these are enough. The word 
Dipalpur is of special interest in this context. It is 
an Indian term, denoting the name of a city. In 
spite of it, its spelling had undergone a change in the 
hands of the Persian writers. Similarly the name of 
Kapaya was transformed into Kabaya or Kaba; and 
this form, as we have already noticed, is preserved in 
one of the manuscripts of the Burhan-i-ma’asir. The 
transformation of Kaba into Kana may be explained 
in two ways. A careless scribe might have placed 
the dot above the letter instead of below, then U-*' 
would become ^ ; or the change might be attributed 
to metathesis. Nizam-ud-Din Ahmad calls the leader 
of Telingana rebellion Kanya-paik instead of Kanya 
Nayak like other writers. This form of the name is 
also preserved in one of the manuscripts of Burhan-i- 
ma'astr. The text of Major King spells the name as 
Kana-bayand. Therefore, the name Kapaya Nayadu 
became Kanya Nayak, as a consequence of a double 
transformation at the hands of the Persian writers. 


[ 175 ] 



VIJAYANAGhARA 


Was this Kapaya or Kanya Nayak, a son of 
Prataparudra II of Warrangal ? The answer to this 
question is in the negative. The Hindu records 
mention a son of Prataparudra, but he was known as 
Vlrabhadra. * A certain Juttaya-tew&a Gronka Reddi is 
also spoken of by several writers as one of Pratapa- 
rudra’s sons ; but this is a mistake. Juttaya, as the 
term * lenka ’ indicates, was a servant and not the son of 
Prataparudra. Kapaya Nayaka whom we have identi- 
fied with Kanya Nayak had no connection whatever 
with Prataparudra. In fact, the statement of Ferishta 
that Krsna (Kanya) Nayak was a son of Prataparudra 
is not suppoi’ted by evidence. Neither BarnI nor 
Nizam-ud-Din mention that Kanya Nayak was Pratapa- 
rudra’s son. On the contrary,' they seem to indicate 
that he was one of the zamindars of Telingana. That 
is the truth. It is not possible to know the source from 
which Ferishta obtained his inaccurate information.

KARNATA AND ANDHRA. 

Some writers believe that the founders of Vijaya- 
nagara could not be the members of a Telugu family 
as Bukka I and Harihara II claim victories over the 
Andhras. But this view is due to the misconception 
that the terms Karnata and Andhra respectively denot- 
ed in those days the areas over which the Kannada and 
the Telugu languages are now spoken. This is far from 
the truth. During the fourteenth and the fifteenth 
centuries, nearly one third of the land inhabited by the 
Telugu speaking people was known as Kariiata. The 
Telugu poet &rlnatha who was a contemporary of 
Ilarihara II, Devaraya I, and Devaraya II, declares that 
the language of his poems is Karnata-bhasa. “ Sanskrit 
iB said to be most suited for dignified composition, and 
Andhra for witty expression. Whatever critics may 
say, I do not mind : certain it is that my poetry is 
written in the Karnata language.” * At first sight it 
may appear that the Karnata-bhasa in which ^rinatha 
claimB to have written his poems is the Kanarese 
language ; but all the works of ^linatha are written in 
Telugu, and there is no reason to believe that he knew 
Kanarese, for which he had little love, f 

What then is the meaning of $rlnatha’s statement ?

present age, his contemporaries could not have enter- 
tained any doubts. They knew that he wrote in the 
idiom of his native district, Pakanadu which was 
included in the Karnata country. It was only natural 
that a poet who proudly styled himself as “ the sun to 
the lotus garden viz., the cities of Karnata,” * should 
have chosen the language of that country as the 
medium to express his thoughts. It is evident from 
this that Nellore and the eastern part of Cuddapah 
which correspond to ancient Pakanadu were known 
as Karnata during the time of Srln&tha. This is 
confirmed by other writers. The poet Tripur antaka, 
the grandfather of Ayyalaraju Ramabhadra who lived 
in the court of Ki^adeva Raya, refers to the god 
Raghuvira of Ontiruitfa in the Cuddapah district as 
“ the lord of Karnata.” f The evidence of literature 
is corroborated by an inscription coming from 
the Ongole taluka of the Guntur district dated 
A.D. 144.1. Acoording to this record, the town of 
Udayagiri is said to be in the middle of Karnata : 
“ TJdayagiryakhya nagare kante Karnatakafalca madhya- 
sthe.” $ Udayagiri is included in the present Nellore 
district, and it formed part of ancient Pakanadu. It 
may, therefore, be concluded that during the time of 
the early Vijayanagara kings, the country comprising 
the present Nellore and Cuddapah districts was also 
known as Karnata. The tradition of the dispute

between !§riuatha and fixe pundits of Rujahmundry over 
the diction of his poems also supports the view that he 
employed a local dialect in his works, and called 
it Karnaia-bhasa * Consequently the Andhras whom 
Bukka I and Uarihara II conquered must be people 
living outside this area. 

Who were they ? A study of the inscriptions of 
the Reddis of Kondavi<Ju may throw some light upon 
their identity. In one of the inscriptions of Prolaya 
Verna f dated A. D. 1355 it is said that he was to “ the 
proud Andhras like the flood of a river washing away 
the trees v on the banks. This seems to indicate that 
Vema waged some wars against the Andhras. Accord- 
ing to an inscription dated 1415 A. D., Andhrehara 
was one of the servants of Tippa, a nephew of 
Peda-Komati Vema. $ Since these Reddis who were 
Tclugus by birth refer to Andhras as their enemies 
they should be regarded as the inhabitants of a 
particular part of the land where Telugu language 
is spoken. 


Now, Krsna or Kapaya Nayaka who was ruling in 
TeUngana with the city of Warrangal as his capital is 
referred to in his inscriptions as AndhradesadhU va ra 
and Andhra Suratr&na. Ab he was a friend of the 
kings of Vijayanagara, he could not be the Audhra

king whom they conquered. There ia no evidence to 
show that the Reddis of Kondavldu had any quarrel 
with him. However, the Velaraas of Racakonda, who 
killed Kapaya, not only occupied his dominions but 
appropriated his titles. Henceforward, they were 
known as Andhradesadhlivara and Andhra Surabrdna • 
It is well-known that the Velamas were engaged con- 
stantly in warfare with the Reddis on one side, and the 
kings of Vijayanagara on the other. It is not unlikely 
that they were the Audhras who were alluded to in tho 
early Vijayanagara and Reddi inscriptions.

Appendix E. 


V1DY iNAGAR A. 

In the opinion of some writers, the city of 
Vijayanagara, was not known by its other name 
Vidyanagara from the beginning. It is contended that 
the name was applied to it subsequent to the fall of 
the Sangama dynasty, on account of the extraordinary 
influence exercised by the pontiffs of SfQgeri Math a 
over the kings of Vijayanagara. The evidence of all 
the inscriptions of the first dynasty which mention 
Vidyanagara has been set aside, as these inscriptions 
are considered forgeries. Therefore, it lias become 
necessary to search the contemporary literature to 
find whether the city was roforrod to as Vidyanagara 
by any author of the time. So far only two authors 
are discovered who refer to Vidyanagara, and a careful 
examination of the books of the period may reveal 
more. One of the two writers who speak of Vidya- 
nagara is Kallanatlia whose evidence h&s already been 
considered in the btfdy of the present book. The 
other is Mallinatha, the famous commentator, who, at 
the instance of Praudha Deva Raya wrote a book called 
the Vai$yavam§a-sudharnavam, in order to define the 
term Vaisya. The following passage from that book 
is of interest :

VIJAYANAGARA 


It is evident from this that during the time of 
Praudha Deva Raya the city of Vijayanagara was also 
known as Vidyanagara. Who was this Praudha Deva 
Raya ? He is generally taken to be Devaraya II who 
ruled at Vijayanagara from 1423 to 1447-8. This, how- 
ever, is doubtful, as Devaraya I is also referred to by 
this name in some of his inscriptions. * Now, which of 
these two was the Praudha Deva Raya who commanded 
Mallinatha to write the Vai&yavamsa-sudharnavani ? 
This can be decided only by discovering the date of 
Mallinatha. Yenkatanarayana, one of his descendants, 
mentions in his commentary on Campiirdma yana 
some historical events in connection with the lives of 
his ancestors, which enable us to fix the date of 
Mallinatha with tolerable certainty. What he says in 
brief is this : In the Kolacalma family, was born 

Mallinatha the famous Satavadhani whom Vlra Rudra 
bathed in a shower of gold ; his son was Kapardin, 
the author of a harika on the Srauta sutras ; his eldest 
son was Mallinatha who was remarkable for his intelli- 
gence ; his younger brother was the great Peddibhatta 
who became famous as Mahojoadh yaya in all the 
countries. In a sacrifice performed by his uncle he 
was bathed in a Bhower of gold by Sarvajna ; he wrote 
commentaries on several works such as the Naisadha , 
Jyotisa, etc. His son was Kumarasvamin, the 
author of a commentary on the Prataparudra yasobhu- 
§aij,am. “f The genealogy that is given by Venkata- 
narayana seemB to be faulty in one respect. According 
to Kumarasvamin, Peddibhatta was not an younger 
brother of Mallinatha, but his son ; and Kumarasvamin 
was the younger brother of Peddibhatta who is said to 
have commented on all Gaatras. ^ The genealogy

given by Kumarasvsxmin should be accepted as move 
trustworthy, as he should have known who his father 
and elder brother were. 

If, subject to this correction, the information 
furnished by Yenkatanarayana be accepted as genuine, 
it must be admitted that Mallinatha II, the famous 
commentator, should have lived in the interval between 
Prataparudra II and Sarvajlia. As the age of Malli- 
natha II was nearer to Sarvajna than Prataparudra, 
the reign of Sarvajna may be taken as a starting point. 
Sarvajna was the title conferred upon Singama III, 
the king of Racakonda, by his contemporaries who 
admired his scholarship. And he appears to have 
ascended the throne about A. D. 1420. 

The Telugu poet Srlnatha paid a visit to the court 
of this king while he was still in the service of the 
Reddis of KomjlavTdu. On this oocasion he praised the 
greatneBB of Singama, thus in a verse : “ The name of 
Sarvajna can only be given with propriety to ^iva 
and king Ravu Singa, To call another Sarvajiia 
is to mistake a dog for an elephant.” When ^rlnatha 
returned to Kon^avldu, he was obliged to give an 
explanation for having praised Ravu Singa, who was 
an enemy of the Reddis of Kondavldu. ^rlnatha 
is said to have given complete satisfaction to his em- 
ployers by interpreting the verse in a different manner. 
“ The name Sarvajna can be applied only to J§iva j 
and Ravu Singa can have no claim to it. To call 
any one (excepting &iva) Sarvajna is to call a dog 
an elephant.” 

It is evident from this that at the time of &rl~ 
natha’s visit to Ravu Singa, the kingdom of Konda- 
vl$u which was overthrown about A. D, 1 420 was still 


[ 183 ] 



VIJAYANAGARA 


in existence. !§rlnatha's visit to Racak one! a should 
have taken place a little earlier; probably he visited 
Racakonda, when he was sent by Peda Komati Verna 
or his successor to Devarakonda to fetch the Reddi 
sword called Nandi-lcanta-pStu-raj u which had been 
carried away as a trophy by Maday a -Lin g a who 
defeated the Reddis. Therefore, Sarvajna Singa should 
have been ruling at Racakonda about 1420 A.D. 

Peddibhatta who was bathed in a shower of gold 
by Sarvajna should have been his contemporary? In 
that caBe, Mallinatha II who was the father of Peddi- 
bhatta, must have belonged to the generation before 
1420. The king who then ruled at Vijayanagara was 
Devaraya I, and not Devaraya II. Therefore it should 
have been at the instance of Devaraya I that Malli- 
natha composed his Vai&yavam§a-sudkSrnavam. 

It is evident from the above discussion that 
Vijayanagara was also known as Vidyanagara, some 
seventy years after the foundation of the city. 
Though we have yet no proof of it, the name might 
have been in vogue from the time of the foundation 
of the city.
