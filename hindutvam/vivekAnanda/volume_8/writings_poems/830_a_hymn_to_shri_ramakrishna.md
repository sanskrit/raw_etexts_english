## A HYMN TO SHRI RAMAKRISHNA

(*In Sanskrit*)

आचण्डालाप्रतिहतरयो यस्य प्रेमप्रवाहः  
लोकातीतोऽप्यहह न जहौ लोककल्याणमार्गम्।  
त्रैलोक्येऽप्यप्रतिममहिमा जानकीप्राणबन्धो  
भक्त्या ज्ञानं वृतबरवपुः सीतया यो हि रामः ॥१॥

1\. He who was Shri Rama, whose stream of love flowed with resistless
might even to the Chandâla (the outcaste); Oh, who ever was engaged in
doing good to the world though superhuman by nature, whose renown there
is none to equal in the three worlds, Sitâ's beloved, whose body of
Knowledge Supreme was covered by devotion sweet in the form of Sita.

स्तब्धीकृत्य प्रलयकलितं वाहवोत्थं महान्तं  
हित्वा रात्रिं प्रकृतिसहजामन्धतामिस्रमिश्राम्।  
गीतं शान्तं मधुरमपि यः सिंहनादं जगर्ज  
सोऽयं जातः प्रथितपुरुषो रामकृष्णस्त्विदानीम् ॥२॥

2\. He who quelled the noise, terrible like that at the time of
destruction, arising from the battle (of Kurukshetra), who destroyed the
terrible yet natural night of ignorance (of Arjuna) and who roared out
the Gita sweet and appeasing; That renowned soul is born now as Shri
Ramakrishna.

नरदेव देव     जय जय नरदेव।  
शक्तिसमुद्रसमुत्थतरङ्गं दर्शितप्रेमविजृम्भितरङ्गम्॥  
संशयराक्षसनाशमहास्त्रं यामि गुरुं शरणं भववैद्यम्।  
नरदेव देव     जय जय नरदेव ॥३॥

3\. Hail, O Lord of Men! Victory unto You! I surrender myself to my
Guru, the physician for the malady of Samsâra (relative existence) who
is, as it were, a wave rising in the ocean of Shakti (Power), who has
shown various sports of Love Divine, and who is the weapon to destroy
the demon of doubt.

Hail, O Lord of Men! Victory unto You!

नरदेव देव     जय जय नरदेव।  
अद्वयतत्त्वसमाहितचित्तं प्रोज्ज्वलभक्तिपटावृतवृत्तम्॥  
कर्मकलेवरमद्भुतचेष्टं यामि गुरुं शरणं भववैद्यम्।  
नरदेव देव     जय जय नरदेव ॥४॥

4\. Hail, O Lord of Men! Victory unto you! I surrender myself to my Guru
the Man-God, the physician for the malady of this Samsara (relative
existence), whose mind ever dwelt on the non-dualistic Truth, whose
personality was covered by the cloth of Supreme Devotion, who was ever
active (for the good of humanity) and whose actions were all superhuman.

Hail, O Lord of Men! Victory unto You!
