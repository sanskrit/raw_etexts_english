The  Census of Marine Life project has uncovered an interesting goby
fish in Guam that forms a symbiosis with a snapping shrimp. The shrimp
excavates a burrow, and the fish guards the borrow and uses it as a
dwelling. The level of coordination between the two is unclear, but
would definitely be of interest in terms of understanding
macro-symbiosis.

Scorpion fishes are a family of poisonous fishes. For more pictures of
these remarkable fishes see
[here.](http://www.hkdivephoto.com/stephenwong/lionfish/)

My all time favorite amongst these fishes is the awful venomous
[Rhinopias
eschmeyeri.](http://www.edge-of-reef.com/foto/gallery/SCO03.jpg) Not far
behind is the drab, but deadly [Uranoscopus
bicinctus](http://www.edge-of-reef.com/foto/gallery/URA01.jpg). The
scorpion fish family is Scorpaenidae which has many subdivisions:  
  
1\) Scorpaeninae: Scorpionfishes and Lionfishes. 2) Synanceinae:
Stonefishes 3) Choridactylinae: Stingfishes and Devilfishes and 4) The
Leaf fish (Taenianotus). They are characterized by their odd shapes and
spines with venom on their backs and fins.

Lionfishes have been observed to show cooperative hunting behavior,
something worth investigating further.
