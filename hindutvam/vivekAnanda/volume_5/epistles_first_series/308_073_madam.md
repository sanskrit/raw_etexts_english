## LXXIII

LONDON,  
*13th December, 1896*.

DEAR MADAM, (An American lady.)

We have only to grasp the idea of gradation of morality and everything
becomes clear.

Renunciation — non-resistance — non-destructiveness — are the ideals to
be attained through less and less worldliness, less and less resistance,
less and less destructiveness. Keep the ideal in view and work towards
it. None can live in the world without resistance, without destruction,
without desire. The world has not come to that state yet when the ideal
can be realised in society.

The progress of the world through all its evils making it fit for the
ideals, slowly but surely. The majority will have to go on with this
slow growth — the exceptional ones will have to get out to realise the
idea in the present state of things.

Doing the duty of the time is the best way, and if it is done only as a
duty, it does not make us attached.

Music is the highest art and, to those who understand is the highest
worship.

We must try our best to destroy ignorance and evil. Only we have to
learn that evil is destroyed by the growth of good.

Yours faithfully,

VIVEKANANDA.
