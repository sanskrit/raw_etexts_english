title = "The younger shatarudriya"

+++
A gentleman had asked if there might be a substitute for the
shatarudriya, that could recited by someone who was not initiated into
the path of the veda or eligible to receive the vedic rahasya. Me, the
muni and aurvasheyI wondered over what would be such a perfect
substitute for the shatrarudriya. Without any doubt we concluded that it
should be the hymn that might be termed the ‘younger shatarudriya’ -one
of the oldest shiva hymns of the early post-vedic period. This hymn is
remarkable in that it gives a glimpse into one of the earliest layers of
the post-atharvashiras shaiva stream and needs a detailed study. We hope
to do that in the near future as we get the chance.

Salutations to one who is the rattling wind, the impetous one and the
one who cooks all. Salutations to the foremost of all beings, one who is
the boon, and the giver of boons.
