## IX

U. S. A.,  
*20th May, 1894*.

MY DEAR SHARAT (SARADANANDA),

I am in receipt of your letter and am glad to learn that Shashi
(Ramakrishnananda) is all right. Now I tell you a curious fact. Whenever
anyone of you is sick, let him himself or anyone of you visualise him in
your mind, and mentally say and strongly imagine that he is all right.
That will cure him quickly. You can do it even without his knowledge,
and even with thousands of miles between you. Remember it and do not be
ill any more. You have received the money by this time. If you all like,
you can give to Gopal Rs. 300/- from the amount I sent for the Math. I
have no more to send now. I have to look after Madras now.

I cannot understand why Sanyal is so miserable on account of his
daughters' marriage. After all, he is going to drag his daughters
through the dirty Samsâra (world) which he himself wants to escape! I
can have but one opinion of that — condemnation! I hate the very name of
marriage, in regard to a boy or a girl. Do you mean to say that I have
to help in putting someone into bondage, you fool! If my brother Mohin
marries, I will throw him off. I am very decided about that. . . .

Yours in love,

VIVEKANANDA.
