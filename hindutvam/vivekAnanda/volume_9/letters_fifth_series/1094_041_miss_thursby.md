*To Miss Emma Thursby*

\[WASHINGTON, D.C.

*26 October 1894*\]

DEAR MISS THURSBY,[1](#fn1)

I received your kind note and the introductory letters. I will make it a
point to see the ladies and hope to be benefitted much by it.

I had a beautiful letter from Mr. Flagg.[2](#fn2) I am soon coming to
N.Y. where I hope to see you.

With my deepest love and gratitude,

I remain yours faithfully,  
VIVEKANANDA
