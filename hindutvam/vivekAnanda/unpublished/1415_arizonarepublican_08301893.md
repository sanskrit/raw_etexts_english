## Brahmin Monk in Framingham

### (*Arizona Rebublican* August 30, 1893)

SOUTH FRAMINGHAM, Aug. 20. – The Swami Virekananda of India, a Brahmin
monk who is on his way to the parliament of religions to be held at
Chicago in September, was a guest today at the reformatory prison for
women. Early this evening he addressed the inmates of the institution in
the chapel upon the manners, customs and mode of living in his country.

The gentleman, who is of rare intellectual ability and learning, was
much interested in the workings of the reformatory, and expressed
himself as highly pleased with what he saw. He returned this evening to
Metcalf, where he is the guest of Miss Kate Sanborn at her abandoned
farm.
