He does japa, homa and tarpaNa with the following ShaShThI mantra:  
praNava+bhuvaneshvari+ShaShThI-devyai+agni priyA ||

Thus meditating using the dhyAna, the worshipper should place a flower
on ones own head. Then again meditating and muttering the above mUla
mantra the votary offers pAdya, arghya and AchamanIya, and sandal-paste,
flowers, incense, lamp waving, naivedyam of food, delightful bhojya
roots and fruits with the pa\~NchopachAra formulae. The one should do
japa of the mUla mantra. Finally one should utter the below stotra of
kShatriya priyavrata connected with the kauthuma school of the sAmaveda
and offer devote worship. Then one may ritually dismiss the deity asking
her to be favorable, pleased and boon-giving.
