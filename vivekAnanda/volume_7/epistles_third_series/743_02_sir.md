*Glory to Ramakrishna!*

ALLAHABAD,  
*30th December, 1889*.

DEAR SIR (Shri Balaram Bose),

Gupta left a slip when coming and the next day a letter from Yogananda
gave me all the news and I immediately started for Allahabad which I
reached the day after, to find that Yogananda had completely recovered.
He had chicken-pox (with one or two smallpox rashes also). The doctor is
a noble soul, and they have got a brotherhood, who are all great pious
men and highly devoted to the service of Sâdhus. They are particularly
anxious that I pass the month of Mâgh here, but I am leaving for
Varanasi. . . . How are you? I pray to God for the welfare of yourself
and your family. Please convey my compliments to Tulasiram, Chuni Babu,
and the rest.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.
