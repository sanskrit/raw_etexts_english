## LXV

54 W. 33, NEW YORK,  
*7th May, 1895*.

DEAR MRS. BULL,

...I had a newspaper from India with a publication in it of Dr. Barrows'
short reply to the thanks sent over from India. Miss Thursby will send
it to you. Yesterday I received another letter from India from the
President of Madras meeting to thank the Americans and to send me an
Address.... This gentleman is the chief citizen of Madras and a Judge of
the Supreme Court, a very high position in India.

I am going to have two public lectures more in New York in the upper
hall of the Mott's Memorial Building. The first one will be on Monday
next, on the Science of Religion. The next, on the Rationale of Yoga....
Has Miss Hamlin sent you the book on the financial condition of India? I
wish your brother will read it and then find out for himself what the
English rule in India means.

Ever gratefully your son,

VIVEKANANDA.
