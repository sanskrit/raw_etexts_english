May we first invoke indra that he might drive away the obstructions to
the study:

vajraM yash chakre suhanAya dasyave hirImasho hirImAn |  
arutahanur adbhutaM na rajaH ||

The thunderbolt, which he of golden mane and golden frame bore down for
the sound smiting of the dasyu-s; \[he\] with a bold jaw is wondrous as
the \[entire\] heavens.

yash ChandasAm R^iShabho vishvarUpash Chandobhyash ChandA.gsy Avivesha

namo devebhyas svadhA pitR^ibhyo bhUr-bhuvas-suvash Chanda Om ||

That universe-encompassing bull among the veda-chants, who described by
the chants and pervades the chants, present before all, the first in
causal link, \[which is\] the teaching of the upaniShad, the great one,
indra \[taught the upaniShad\] for the perception of the R^iShi-s;
salutations to the gods, svadhA offerings to the ancestors, the three
primal vyAhR^iti-s and the metrical chant, OM.

A student of the shruti might ask what is meant by the upaniShat? Many
teachers are unable to give the meaning for this word even though they
might practice an aspect of its teachings, which they consider as being
the true vedAnta. If they happen to be adherents of the neo-advaita
school they might even ignore the relevance of the meaning of the
upaniShat and hold the view that they already have a solution to the
deepest problem explored by the upaniShat. The term upaniShat is
correctly rendered as “seating things beside each other”, i.e. it is
part of the mImAmsa process laid out in the brAhmaNa of discovering and
setting out saMbandha-s. [We stated this
before](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/06/16/the-broken-chain-and-the-chain-of-knowledge/)
and repeat this point again here because we shall seek to touch upon the
great problem explored by the upaniShat, which was a central mystery in
the ancient inquiries among the Indo-European heathens (primarily
Hindus, Iranians and the Hellenes). The saMbandha-s that concern the
preceding brAhmaNa portions primarily deal with the representational
connections between the shrauta ritual and the universe. For example, in
the standard sAmidheni recitation (i.e. 15 R^ik-s chanted in ekashruti +
the hiM bhUr-bhuvasvarO3M ) the saMbandha is established to the year
since the 15 gAyatrI-s (x 24) give the 360 with the hiM and the
vyAhR^iti-s representing the 5 additional days and the additional
fraction. Thus, the brAhmaNa abounds in saMbandha-s to all phenomena.
Then comes the upaniShad. Here the primary problem is the nature of the
saMbandha between the microcosm and the macrocosm.

One of the simplest expression of the saMbandha-s between the microcosm
and macrocosm is the principle of macranthropy. Let us turn elsewhere in
the IE world for an example. We might look at the macranthropic Zeus in
Orphic hymn, fragment 168, quoted by the great yavana sage Proclus;
Epiphanius suggests that it was hymn composed by Pythagoras:

*Zeus is the first. Zeus the thunderer, is the last.*  
*Zeus is the head. Zeus is the middle, and by Zeus all things were
fabricated.*  
*Zeus is male, Immortal Zeus is female.*  
*Zeus is the foundation of the earth and of the starry heaven.*  
*Zeus is the breath of all things. Zeus is the rushing of indefatigable
fire.*  
*Zeus is the root of the sea: He is the Sun and Moon.*  
*Zeus is the king; He is the author of universal life;*  
*One Power, one daemon, the mighty prince of all things:*  
*One kingly frame, in which this universe revolves,*  
*Fire and water, earth and ether, night and day,*  
*And Metis the primeval father, and all-delightful Eros.*  
*All these things are united in the vast body of Zeus.*  
*Would you behold his head and his fair face,*  
*It is the resplendent heaven, round which his golden locks*  
*Of glittering stars are beautifully exalted in the space.*  
*On each side are the two golden taurine horns,*  
*The risings and settings, the tracks of the celestial gods;*  
*His eyes the sun and the opposing moon;*  
*His unfailing mind the royal incorruptible ether.*

The veda can sometimes be pithy and presents a comparable concept
regarding indra thus (a mantra composed by gR^itsamada shunahotra):  
yasmAn na R^ite vijayante janAso yaM yudhyamAnA avase havante |  
yo vishvasya pratimAnam babhUva yo achyutachyut sa janAsa indraH || (RV
2.012.09)

The key phrase being: “yo vishvasya pratimAnam babhUva”; The universe
came to being as his form. In the vaidika incantation there are several
expressions for the universal or all-encompassing form of indra. For
example we encounter one such in the mantra:  
A rodasI apR^iNAd ota madhyam pa\~ncha devAM R^itushaH sapta-sapta |  
chatus-triMshatA purudhA vi chaShTe sarUpeNa jyotiShA vivratena || (RV
10.055.03)

In this highly cryptic hymn with astronomical allusions indra is
described as encompassing the entire universe with the gods, the
celestial motions and luminaries within. More indirect expressions might
be found in the incantations like the chamaka prashna where indra is
implied as coming to the ritualist bearing all the deva-s starting from
agni all the way to prajApati:

agnish cha ma indrash cha me somash cha ma indrash cha me savitA cha ma
indrash cha me sarasvatI cha ma indrash cha me pUShA cha ma indrash cha
me bR^ihaspatish cha ma indrash cha me mitrash cha ma indrash cha me

indrash cha me dyaush cha ma indrash cha me dishash cha ma indrashcha me
mUrdhA cha ma indrash cha me prajApatish cha ma indrash cha me ||

Expression of macranthropy explicitly similar to those seen above in the
Orphic hymn however start emerging in the somewhat later layers of
vaidika texts and can be encountered over a prolonged period in the
iterations such as the puruSha sUkta, the ashvamedha brAhmaNa with which
the bR^ihadAraNyaka opens, and the AtmasUkta of the vaikhAnasa-s. Of
these, an early macranthropic representation, seen right in the R^igveda
itself, is that of the personified mantra power: RV 10.125. Here,
interestingly, the macranthropic manifestation is represented as female
– vAk, and provides the prior for the depictions of the universal
forms of the trans-functional goddess in later Hindu tradition. The
puruSha sUkta is reiterated in some form in all the four veda-s and is
re-worked in a definitive account of the macranthropic motif in a late
atharvan recitation, that is also preserved within the body of the
composite and paradoxical text, the muNDakopaniShad \[Footnote 1\]:

yathA sudIptAt pAvakAd visphuli\~NgAH

As from a good blazing fire, thousands of sparks identical to it nature
are emitted, so also, O soma-ritualist, do diverse beings emerge from
the indestructible entity and again return to it.

divyo hy amUrtaH puruShaH sa bAhyAbhyantaro hy ajaH |  
aprANo hy amanAH shubhro hy akSharAt parataH paraH || 2||

The shining but verily formless purusha, is unoriginated and is both
within and without; he is not the metabolism of life, not the mind,
unsullied and beyond even the supreme indestructible entity \[mentioned
in the former verse\].

etasmAj jAyate praNo manaH sarvendriyANi cha |

From this are born metabolism, signaling, all sensory and motor organs,
space, gas, light, liquid and solid, which supports all.

The fire is his head, the sun and moon his eyes; the dimensions of space
his ears; his speech emitted the veda-s, the air is his breath; all
existence his heart. From his feet emerged the earth; he is verily the
inner consciousness of all beings.

\[non-literal translation as per commentarial tradition based on the
principle of the saMbandha of 5 fires as expounded in the narrative in
the ChandogyopaniShat 5.3.1 \] From him emerged in the celestial world
the fire with the sun as the fuel \[fire 1 seen as the sun\]; in the
celestial world the waters emerged from soma; the waters poured down on
earth as rain storms \[Fire 2 seen as the lightning \]; from the earth
emerged plants \[fire 3 seen as energy in plants\]; from the plants
arose the male seed \[Fire 4\] and the female \[fire 5\] into which it
is cast; thus, numerous organism emerged from the puruSha.

From him emerge the ritual verses, songs and prose incantations, the
ritual initiations, the fire rituals, the all rites and the ritual fees.
The year, the ritualist, and the worlds where the moon and the sun
shine, all emerge from him.

From him emerge the deva-s and the manifold sAdhya-s, men, beasts and
birds, with the metabolism of uptake and excretion and the plants
\[literally rice and barley\]; and also tapas, conviction, truth,
observance of celibate student life and ritual rule.

saptArchiShaH samidhaH sapta homAH |  
sapta ime lokA yeShu charanti prANA  
guhAshayA nihitAH sapta sapta || 8||

The seven metabolic processes, the seven flames of agni, the seven
fire-sticks, the seven homa-s, from him come into being; and also the
seven “worlds” in which the prANa moves \[i.e. the 7 vyAhR^iti-s of the
savitra prANAyama\] as they lay stationed within the cave seven by seven
emerged from him.

ataH samudrA girayash cha sarve .asmAt  
syandante sindhavaH sarva-rUpAH |  
atash cha sarvA oShadhayo rasash cha

From him spring all the oceans, mountains and flow forth the rivers of
all forms; from him emerge all plants and the life-fluids by which the
bodies exist with the inner consciousness embedded in the elements
\[i.e. of matter\].

As an aside, it might be noted that the above late AV macranthropic
expression is central to the later expositions of the vedAnta darshana
(e.g. in shaMkarAchArya’s commentary). However, it is possible to
interpret this text as also being consistent with sAMkhya. This emerges
from the apparent paradox in the first two R^ik-s. The first one talks
of all matter being evolutes of the indestructible “akShara” and the
second talks of the puruSha, who is not life, or mind, being formless
and transcending the akShara. Further, he is twice identified with the
consciousness. Thus, one can take the material akShara referred to at
first as being the prakR^iti and the consciousness as the puruSha. But
what about the paradox of all existing being evolutes of him in a
macranthropic sense (which is explicitly expounded)? The above R^ik-s
can be interpreted to mean that they are evolutes of him associated with
the akShara, which actually undergoes the transformations, while the
puruSha is the antarAtman.

The AtmasUkta tradition of the vaikhAnasa marked the trend of
transferring macranthropy to their primary deva viShNu. This trend was
followed shortly thereafter by the other vaiShNava tradition, that of
the pA\~ncharAtrika-s. It was from one such early pA\~ncharAtrika
expression that the vishvarUpa concept was probably incorporated into
the bhagavad gItA (e.g. BhG 11.22).Indeed, this expression of
macranthropy or macrotheria remains closely associated with viShNu and
reappears in the context of the aitihAsika and paurANika accounts of his
incarnations, such as hayagrIva ([which we had described
before](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/06/26/notes-on-hayagriva-siddhi-among-the-nastika-s/)),
varAha, nR^isiMha and trivikrama. In iconographic terms, the
macrotherian varAha appears to have been prevalent from the gupta period
onwards (e.g. the great Eran varAha set up by the maitrAyaNIya ritualist
dhanyaviShNu, the varAha of Khajuraho or the pratihAra varAha now at the
Nelson-Atkins Museum, Kansas City). Similarly, the iconography of viShNu
vishvarUpa is also widely attested throughout Indosphere.

The macrotherian varAha from Eran, installed by dhanyaviShNu

The macrotherian varAha is encountered early on in a dharma text of the
kaTha tradition, the viShNu smR^iti, and is further embellished and
expanded in the paurANika retellings of the yaj\~navarAha episode
\[Footnote 2\]. We provide this is full to appreciate the parallels with
other macranthropic accounts:

brahma-rAtryAM vyatItAyAM prabuddhe padma-saMbhave |  
viShNuH sisR^ikShur bhUtAni j\~nAtvA bhUmiM jalAnugAm ||

With the night of brahmA coming to an end, and the lotus-born one having
awoken, viShNu seeking to emit the beings, perceived the earth covered
with water.

He delighting in water sports, as at the beginning of each former kalpa,
assumed the shape of a boar, and raised up the earth.

His feet were the vedas, his tusks the sacrificial posts; his teeth the
ritual; his mouth the ritual altar; his tongue the fire, his hair the
strewn grass, the ritual incantations-s were his head, and he was of
great tapas.

Ajya-nAsaH sruva-tuNDaH sAma-ghoSha-svano mahAn ||

He, the divine one had the day and night for his eyes were, his ears
were decorated by the vedA\~Nga-s, his nose the goat butter; his snout
the sruva ladle, his grunts the sAman songs and he was of a great
\[form\].

prAyashchitta-mahAghoNaH pashu-jAnur mahAkR^itiH ||

He was imbued with dharma and satya, auspicious, his movements and
strides perfect, his great nostrils were the ritual expiations, his
knees the sacrificial animal and his form was gigantic.

udgAtrAntro homa-li\~Ngo bIjauShadhi-mahAphalaH |  
vedy-antarAtmA mantra-sphig- vikR^itaH soma-shoNitaH ||

In this form his entrails were the sAman singers, his phallus the homa
ritual; his great testicles were the seeds and plants, his consciousness
was the vedi altar, his butt the mantra-s and his blood the soma
\[juice\].

vedi-skandho havir gandho havya-kavyAdi-vegavAn |  
prAgvaMSha-kAyo dyutimAn nAnA-dIkShAbhir anvitaH ||

His shoulders were the second vedI (i.e. the soma ritual configuration),
his smell the oblations; he was of great speed like the fires that bear
the oblations to the gods, ancestors and the rest, his body eastern
ritual hall; he was resplendent and imbued with the ritual initiations.

dakShiNA-hR^idayo yoga mahAmantra-mayo mahAn |  
upAkarmoShTha-ruchiraH pravargyA-varta-bhUShaNaH ||

His heart was the fees paid to the ritualists, he was of great form
imbued with yoga and the great mantra-s; his well-formed lips were the
ritual of thread-wearing and his embellishments were the pravargya
pourings.

nAnAch-Chando-gati-patho guhyopaniShad AsanaH |  
ChAyA-patnI-sahAyo vai maNi-shR^i\~Nga ivoditaH ||

The metrical Vedic chants were his foraging path, the secret teaching of
the upaniShat his resting place; he was accompanied by his wife chAyA
and was huge as the jeweled mountain (the Himalayas).

The land surrounded by the oceans, with mountains, forests and groves
was submerged in the waters of the One ocean; into that One one ocean
dived the lord.

He raised up, with on his tusks, the earth seeking the good of the
worlds; the first of the deva-s, the great yogin remade the world thus.

evaM yaj\~na varAheNa bhUtvA bhUta-hitArthinA |  
uddhR^itA pR^ithivI devI rasAtala-gatA purA ||

Thus, the yaj\~na varAha for the sake of the good of the being beings
raised up the earth goddess who had formerly sunk to the nether region
of rasatAla.

uddhR^itya nishchale sthAne sthApayitvA tathA svake |

Thereafter, having raised the land, the slayer of madhu, stationed it
upon its own seat and distributed the waters upon it according to their
appropriate places.

He distributed water of the oceans into the oceans, the water of the
rivers into the rivers, the water of the pools into the pools, and the
water of the lakes into the lakes.

\[And also\] The protectors of places, the protectors of the worlds, the
rivers, mountains, trees, the seven R^ishis, who know the dharma, the
veda-s together with their a\~Nga-s, the sura-s and the asura-s.

\[And also\] the the piShacha-s, snakes, gandharva-s, yakSha-s,
rAkShasa-s, men, cattle, birds, mammals and others, the four-fold beings
of civilization, clouds, rainbows, lightnings and the like and various
rituals.

Now, these multiple expressions of macranthropy might be seen as
peculiar conceptions of the bronze age mind, which in heathen traditions
persisted through the iron age, and some Western scholars and their
imitators might even see it as being pathological. However, we hold that
these are the early expressions of a class of models of the world that
continue to be with us. In essence, the macranthropic models try to
illustrate two distinct, but sometime related ideas: 1) What is true at
small scales can be extrapolated to large scales 2) The same structures
seen at small scales re-emerging even at large scales. At the limit this
might be taken as the idea of the recursive structure of the world that
approximates a scale-free structure (expressed by the analogy of the
visphuli\~Nga in the AV chant; see above). This might also be
interpreted as a “holistic” view in which every fragment of the whole
recapitulates the whole in pieces. Comparable expressions in more recent
models of the world include, for example: Just as the electromagnetic
force holds electrons around the nucleus in the microscopic realm, the
gravitational force holds the planets around sun. Likewise, just as the
quarks are held together in the subatomic scales by the strong force, at
the massive scale two stars are held together in a system like beta
Lyrae. In descriptions of the structure of life too we see such
constructs. For example Jacques Monod quipped: “Anything found to be
true of *E. coli* must also be true of elephants.” It also finds
expression in the cellular structure compared to organismal structure.
In a ciliate like *Euplotes*, a single cell has a “mouth”, “legs” i.e.
cilia, and excretory organs, which might also be found in an
multicellular organism, like an animal, made of numerous cells. In the
same way, the chlorophyte *Acetabularia* has in single cell “roots”, a
“stem”, “leaves” and “seeds” which are all also seen in a land plant
made up of numerous cells. The recursiveness manifests itself in the
form of simple prokaryotic cells giving rise to the eukaryotic cell that
contains multiple prokaryotic cells and the multicellular eukaryote that
contains several such cells. Further, this might extend one level
further up where organisms might constitute a super-organism: In the
case of the cnidarian superorganism *Physalia* (the Portuguese Man o’
War) the super-organismal structure might resemble the structure of a
single organism literally – it mimics the general structure of a
jellyfish. Alternatively, the super-organism might merely figuratively
resemble a single organism as seen in the social organisms like
hymenopterans or isopterans. Indeed, the vaidika conception of human
society was similarly super-organismic – the macranthropic puruSha (RV
10.90).

Now the ancients saw the equivalences implied by their macranthropic
world view as being a pointer to a more fundamental underlying unity.
For example, this is expressed in the famous early pA\~ncharAtrika
praise of viShNu as the puruSha nArAyaNa attributed to bhIShma pitAmaha:

yasmin vishvAni bhUtAni tiShThanti cha vishanti cha |  
guNa-bhUtAni bhUteshe sUtre maNigaNA iva ||

All the worlds and all elements exist in you and merge into you \[upon
destruction\]. As the lord of the beings, you are the common thread
passing through the guNa-s (of sAMkhya) and beings  
like pearls strung together on a thread.

yasmin nitye tate tantau dR^iDhe srag iva tiShThati |  
sadasad grathitaM vishvaM vishvA\~Nge vishvakarmaNi ||

In your eternal all-pervading form, like lotuses held together by a
strong string, the manifest and unmanifest universe is bound together,
you whose body and whose actions comprise the universe.

hariM sahasra-shirasaM sahasra-charaNekShaNam |  
sahasra-bAhu-mukuTaM sahasra-vadanoj-jvalam |  
prAhur nArAyaNaM devaM yaM vishvasya parAyaNam ||

You are known as hari of a thousand heads, a thousand feet and eyes, a
thousand arms, a thousand crowns, and a thousand blazing faces. You are
called the deva nArAyaNa the station of the universe \[see above for
iconographic representation\].

aNIyasAm aNIyAMsaM sthaviShThaM cha sthavIyasAm |  
garIyasAM gariShThaM cha shreShThaM cha shreyasAm api || Mbh 12.47.12-15

You are the most atomic of all atoms, the most expansive of the
expansive, the heaviest of the heavy and the highest of the high.

While this expression of macranthropy is typical of the identification
of viShNu with the puruSha of the veda, it represents a use of the
macranthropic motif as unifying principle. The recursiveness of the
puruSha is made explicit by stating that the universe is set in him and
that he is simultaneously in the form of the smallest particle and also
the largest entity, i.e. the universe itself. Hence, he taken to be the
unifying principle by using the analogy of the string binding the
flowers or passing through the pearls – thus, he is the common thread of
all existence that has manifested and also that which remains as yet
unmanifest, with the guNa-s and the bhUta-s emerging and dissolving into
him.

In an analogous way, our modern visions of the universe have been
inspired by the intuitions regarding similarities in patterns observed
at the microscopic and macroscopic realms. Thus, for example in physics,
electrical force/magnetic force (dominant at microscopic realms) and
gravitational force(dominant at macroscopic realms; though both have
theoretically infinite ranges) have inverse square laws. This lead to
the intuition that they are just distinct manifestations of a unified
force. This intuition has sparked the most profound investigation in
physics, namely the grand unified theory. Similarly, in biology the
above statement of Monod represents an intuition of unity underlying all
of biology. The quest for the biological unification emerged from the
commonalities observed across life from the microscopic single-celled
form to the largest multicellular forms. This led to a partial
unification provided by the cell theory, which unified all cellular life
forms. This preliminary unification led to the observation that
essentially all of life shares a common information storage mechanism in
the form of nucleic acids and across life that information specifies
action mediated by both nucleic acids and proteins. Thus, a deep
unification emerged regarding life in the form of the Central Dogma of
molecular biology.

***The fissure in the unity of the micro- and macro-cosm***

While the intuitions regarding the micro- and macro-cosmic parallels
promised a vision of deep underlying unity, formally working out such
unifications has been all but easy. Instead, our excavations or flights
in the quest for the unity have revealed deep complexities that we do
not fully understand as yet – much as the shaiva-s would say regarding
the quest for the beginning and the end of their vision of unity – the
li\~Ngodbhava-mUrti. Indeed, in physics despite the gravitational and
electromagnetic forces having similar equations, electromagnetic could
be unified with the weak, and the unification of electroweak with the
strong forces seems within striking range. But, unification of the
gravitational force with the rest still remains a much more difficult
prospect for modern physics. This is a schism between the macrocosm,
which has a good theory in the form of relativity to explain it, and the
microcosm, which has a good theoretical framework in quantum mechanics,
despite the apparently sound intuition of a unity between them. Biology
too has its share of schisms between its microcosms and macrocosm. One
of these pertains to the conflicts between the interests of a single
cell and a community of cells, either in the context of a colony or a
multicellular organism. This also extends to the problem of the
interests of the individual organisms within a super-organismic set up.
After all selection is acting on the genes, which are so closely tied to
the unifying Central Dogma. So the interests of individual genes, the
interests of the individual cells or organisms do not necessarily align
with that of their respective conglomerates, but why are they then
altruistic in sacrificing their fitness for that of the conglomerate?
Thus, the transition from the microcosms to the macrocosms of biology is
not at all a smooth one. To explain such behaviors Haldane first
postulated the concept of included fitness and kin selection, which was
then extended by Hamilton. Wilson’s studies showed that indeed these
might explain the hymenopteran and isopteran eusociality. However, in
more recent times he has made an about-turn favoring a role for group
selection in addition to kin selection. There are other alternative
explanations emerging from game theoretical simulations by Nowak that
point to altruistic strategies such as the forgiving tit-for-tat
emerging as winners in iterated versions of games such as the prisoners’
dilemma. Thus, while there are multiple explanations for the why
cooperative organismal conglomerates might arise, it is not all clear at
this point if a unified explanation holds for all such cases.

Other schisms too emerge in biology – everything that is true for
*Escherichia coli* is not really true for an elephant – Their primary
DNA polymerases have had independent origins, most of their
transcription factors are hardly related even though both make mRNA and
their chromatin is packaged in unrelated ways and is profoundly
different in functional capabilities. Many of the similarities across
the levels of life are a result of interactions between the deep
homologies and the strong constrains of physics and chemistry acting as
the great enforcers of natural selection. Thus, we can have a wheel and
axle at the level of the molecular components of life resembling a wheel
made by an engineer. However, wheels with axles are absent at all the
other levels of organization life and even wheels without axles are at
best rare (e.g. a lizard or wheel spider – *Carparachne aureoflava*
\[Footnote 3\]). The reason for this is rather obvious because a living
wheel has to be kept alive and if made of dead tissue has to be repaired
via a connection to the rest of the living tissue and this by definition
precludes a biological wheel. Of course the axle-free wheels are equal
to the whole organism – like the wheel spider cartwheeling. On the other
hand biological spears exist at every level. We recently discovered a
class of bacterial toxins that are shaped and deployed as poisoned
spears; spears made of a single protein. Then we have the trichocysts of
ciliates like *Paramecium*, which are still microscopic spears but now
made up of numerous protein molecules. Then we have a detachable
biomineral spear in the form of the gastropod love darts with which land
snails stab each other during courtship to improve chances of
fertilization. Other spears are made of many cells but are part of the
body like the marlin’s snout. There are also spears made of many cells
in the form of the seeds of grasses, like *Stipa*. Finally, we have the
spears made and used by the great apes like *Pongo*, *Pan* and *Homo*
(hence the spear was probably an ancestral hunting weapon among the
great apes). Thus, the physical constraints prevent wheels in the
biological macrocosms but allow them at the lowest level of organization
in the biological microcosms. On the other hand, there are spears all
the way through. Thus, the deep unity in biology, in the form of the
homologies of nucleic acids and proteins, is not the primary basis for
the recursive similarities in forms across biological organization,
rather it is physico-chemical constraints that allow that similarities.
Thus, in a sense these constraints have already determined a relatively
small set of ideal categories into which natural selection can channel
the forms of biology. This is reminiscent of the eternal jAti-s of the
naiyAyika-s, which remain conserved, even though the individual vyakti-s
within it come and go. However, the physico-chemical constraints allow
vyakti-s of certain jati-s (e.g. the spear) to exist at all levels of
organization, whereas in other jati-s (e.g. the wheel) they allow them
to exist only at certain levels. Likewise, we might compare these forms
predetermined by the constraints to the the ratu-s of our Iranian
cousins or the Platonic ideals in in the yavana world (we may interpret
Plato’s vision of the circular motions being the property of the nous;
“peri noun kai phronesin”; as an early acknowledgment of the
constraints in the form of physical laws).

*The constraints of category: Biological systems can only evolve
microscopic wheels with axles but they need to be engineered at the
macroscopic level. The spear was invented and engineered many times in
biology*

*So did the ancients run into the issue of a potential schism between
the microcosm and the macrocosm when they formulated a macranthropic
universe?*

We are of the opinion that the answer is yes, and that the realization
of this schism gave rise to much discussion and theory among both the
Arya-s and yavana-s. We would present it thus:  
The individual animal, like a man, has a consciousness (Atman, i.e.
defined as the experiencer of the first person experience or qualia;
this is laid out in the aitareyopaniShad 3.2). When we construct a
macranthropic universe, what is the consciousness of that macranthropic
universe (brahman) and what its relationship to the consciousnesses of
the individual beings (their Atman) within that macranthropic frame?

It appears that in the Arya world some felt that the consciousness of
the macranthropic universe should be identified with various “cosmic”
entities. For example, there is the famous vaidika statement: “asau vA
Adityo brahmA” or “asav Adityo brahmA”, which suggests that some took
the yonder sun to be the consciousness of the universe. In the
ChAndogyopaniShat we are told of teaching of the kShatriya teacher
ashvapati the king of the kekaya-s (in what is today Afghanistan) to
several brAhmaNa-s. Indeed, there we encounter satyayaj\~na pauluShi
mention that the sun is the universal consciousness . Similarly, other
brAhmaNa-s like aupamanyava, indradyumna bhAllaveya, jana shArkarakShya,
buDila AshvatarAshvi and uddAlaka AruNi held views that the universal
consciousness might be the sky, the gaseous element, vacuum, the liquid
element and the solid element respectively. A parallel might be seen in
the yavana world might be found in the discourse of Hermogenes and
Socrates (Cratylus; I would like to acknowledge the work of the American
philospher and mathematician Stephen Menn in leading me to discovering
this parallel). There, Hermogenes mentions different views regarding
what might be the entity that is the yavana equivalent of the brahman
concept. He says that some hold that it is the sun, others that it is
the fire and yet others that it is the heat emnated by the fire. But he
then says that Anaxagoras dismisses all those and states that it is none
of those but the nous – this is similar to ashvapati kaikeya dismissing
the opinion of the brAhmaNa-s regarding the universal consciousness and
revealing his teaching of the true nature of brahman.

It appears to us that the preferred solution of many of the
aupaniShada-s is that contrary to the recursiveness or the scaling seen
in other “organs” of the “macranthrope” the consciousness does not
participate in the recursion or scaling. It remains undivided, constant
and the same between the universe and the individual conscious beings.
Thus, it is only one and undivided at all scales of organization. This,
of course is ashvapati’s preferred inference, which is also repeated by
yAj\~navalkya and several other ancient thinkers. It has been repeatedly
rationalized and rexplained since then by many a Hindu thinker. But we
may still ask the question if this conclusion is justified and and is
there any evidence that it might be the true one.

An alternative hypothesis was that of bhUta-chaitanya-vAda favored
primarily by the chArvAka-s. In its nihilistic form it involves the
denial of the consciousness as being anything but illusory. Its more
affirmative form posits consciousness as an emergent property that is
probably linked with biological or artificially intelligent systems. So
put bluntly, the macranthropic thinking has only lead to false ideas,
because its premises are flawed in the first place. There is no need to
think that a macro-cosmic assemblage of conscious being should have a
consciousness because it is a unique emergent property requiring a
particular form of sensory architecture and signaling connections. After
all, they might reason, that the cells have no consciousness, but the
“macranthropic” body, wholly comprised of cells does. When you have
emergent properties you are not limited by something being represented
at every level of the organization. Modern exponents like Crick went as
far as equating this emergent property with a particular form of neural
activity – e.g. coordinated signaling by neurons at frequencies of \~40
Hertz. The way they put it, it was certainly naïve, but one could argue
that it is an emergent property due to development of a certain type of
neural structures and activity. Now, can we formulate a program to
distinguish between these alternative hypothesis? We posit that if
consciousness \[Footnote 4\] can somehow be shown to have emerged due to
natural selection or as a Gouldian spandrel due to selection on some
other entity then bhuta-chaitanya-vAda is established. In our opinion
Crick and Koch have not demonstrated this. Now if it can be instead
shown that it has not emerged due to the action of natural selection,
but provides a selective advantage to the possessor then
bhuta-chaitanya-vAda has to be forsaken for alternative hypotheses. If
it can be shown that it provides no selective advantage and can be
separated from coherent evolutionary explanations for the sensory and
neural architecture then again bhUta-chaitanya-vAda is falsified. Our
own investigations into biology have shown that we can use evolutionary
principles to coherently explain the origin and elaboration of the
sensory and signaling architecture and there is no place for
consciousness in this robust theory. Thus, consciousness can be
separated from a coherent evolutionary theory for sensory-signaling
systems. What we cannot yet firmly demonstrate is that consciousness
really provides no selective advantage. So we are not in a position to
falsify bhUta-chaitanya-vAda yet.

Certain other lines of reasoning suggest that the idea of a unitary
consciousness or a conscious macranthropic entity mighty be approached
via biological phenomena. Intake of DMT, a compound naturally produced
by the pineal, results in experiences similar to brahmAnanda whereas
some have reported macranthropic visions with iboga and related
extracts. These observations suggest that such insights are actively
kept out of the regular experience by the neural machinery. Yet, it
appears that humans, like other animals, attempt to seek such states.
For example, iboga is used in the wild in Africa both by our close
cousin the gorilla and the more distant one the mandrill baboon, in
addition to its use by pigs, crested porcupines and elephants. The
Amanita mushroom is used by reindeer for experience of hallucinations in
Northern Eurasia, while in the North American Rockies and the deserts of
Libya sheep seek green-yellow lichens, probably of the genus Lecanora
for hallucinogens. Dogs have been reported to use toad hallucinogens.
Indeed, the use of such oShadhi-s by humans is likely to have been
learned from other animals. These sought after states being kept out of
the general consciousness stream raises the possibility that their
unregulated experience could be selectively disadvantageous organism.
This is supported by the fact that the sheep in the Rockies and the
Libyan desert are known to lose their teeth in scraping the lichen of
rocks, resulting the nullification of their fitness due to seeking the
special states of conscious experience. While certain forms of human
addiction can be posited as a similar situation, we may also point out
that certain seekers of the experience of unitary consciousness in Hindu
traditions nullify their fitness through the practice of premature
saMnyAsa. Indeed, in the more recent traditions individuals with
fitness-erasing proclivities in such direction have been heralded as
“brahman-realized” saints in the larger Hindu system. So this line of
reasoning suggests that the unregulated experience of unitary
consciousness is something that is selectively disadvantageous and
actually filtered out by the action of the neural apparatus.

Now someone might turn to us and ask: Are you not positing insights
described in this discussion as being pathological yourself, while
accusing the white indologists and their fellow travellers of the same?
I will conclude by pointing out that my own position is distinct in
relation to two points: 1) Just because the experience of unitary
consciousness might be kept out by the neural and sensory apparatus does
not mean that it is a pathological state. Indeed, it might even be a
very profound and perhaps correct insight. As an analogy we might point
out to the American biochemist Kary Mullis discovering PCR and some
cosmological analogy under the influence of lysergic acid diethylamide.
At least the former of these insights, even if developed in a privileged
state, which is normally disallowed by the neural and sensory apparatus,
results in a correct apprehension of reality. Similarly, the insights
regarding a pervasive consciousness or non-bhUtachaitanya explanation
could be potentially correct, even if only accessible in a privileged
state. 2) While potentially fitness-reducing in unregulated use,
controlled utilization of such privileged states and insight ensuing
therefrom could have the opposite effect. We suspect that the early
Hindus realized this and developed regulated mechanisms for accessing
these states and parsing the insights accrued therein. However, I
suspect that this rigor was lost in many traditions and replaced by
practices that did reduce fitness.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Footnote 1: The muNDakopaniShat is a composite text which has combined
older material of the AV tradition with new material coming from a
veda-virodhaka stream. It gives us a glimpse of what might have been the
case if the tathAgata had taken up the offer of the brAhmaNa-s to render
his veda-virodhaka teachings in Arya-vAk rather than sticking to the
vulgar Pali.

Footnote 2: The varAha myth of course predates these texts and goes back
to the veda. The taittirIya AraNyaka (10.1.8) speaks of a great black
boar lifting up the earth (“uddhR^itAsi varAheNa kR^iShNena
shatabAhunA”). This boar is also mentioned in the AV-vulgate 12.1.48
(“varAheNa pR^ithivI saMvidAnA sUkarAya vi jihIte mR^igAya”). In
several cases prajApati is described as the one incarnating as this
varAha: for example in the taittirIya saMhitA 7.1.5.1 prajApati is
mentioned as lifting out the earth from the water. But in this brAhmaNa
section already viShNu’s power is hinted, so he is close at hand to take
over this role. Similarly, in the shatapatha brAhmaNa (14.1.2.11),
prajApati is described as being the boar emUSha that lifted up the
earth. But here again viShNu is at hand because the earth is connected
to the head of viShNu or makha as the narrative occurs as part of the
instruction on the pravargya ritual. In both the taittirIya saMhitA and
the RV interestingly indra and viShNu are mentioned as killing emUSha a
boar on the side of the dAnava-s. In the same taittirIya saMhitA
7.1.5.1, the power of indra is also emphasized – interestingly, in the
avestan yaSht to verethraghna it is he who is described as incarnating
as the varAha. (Av: varAza). He is invoked as a mighty varAha in the
avestan manthra:  
verethraghnO ahuradhAtO hu kehrpa varAzahe  
paiti-erenO tizhi-dãstrahe arshnO tizhi-asUrahe  
hakeret-janO varAzahe anu-pOithwahe grañtahe ||  
The idea of the ritual-associated varAha goes back to at least the
Indo-Iranian period as in the avestan ritual the Iranians invoke a
mighty varAha known as dAmoish upamana (e.g. yasna 6.14: “ukhrem taxmem
dAmOish upamanem yazatem yazAmaide |” ) who embodies the ritual power
and is mentioned as accompanying mithra to the battle.

Footnote 3: Many years back taittirIya-guru asked aurvasheyI and me
whether we thought all biological form was simply a result of natural
selection. Our bodies are as complex as a car or a scooter could not
have emerged by chance. When did you last see a scooter grow up by
chance he thundered and continued: “that is why the world needs an
Ishvara”. kauNDiNyA retorted: “It is that very natural selection that
precludes cars and scooters from being born of life.” The
taittirIya-guru roared: “Why not? I have proved you wrong by
inconsistency.” She stumbled in answering him, so we stepped in
explained why wheels with axles are unlikely to emerge but many other
things can. He did not seem to understand, as his biology was
insufficient, and attributed our “ignorance” to our lack of
Ishvara-bhakti. Some years later kauNDiNyA brought it to my attention
that Richard Dawkins had made similar arguments to what I had done
regarding the non-existence of the biological wheel with an axle.

Footnote 4: Western or Western-influenced biologists in general and
neurobiologists in particular can exhibit a gross misunderstanding of
what consciousness means. They often conflate consciousness with neural
signaling and sensory reception. These two are purely biological issues
that only impinge on but not comprise consciousness.
