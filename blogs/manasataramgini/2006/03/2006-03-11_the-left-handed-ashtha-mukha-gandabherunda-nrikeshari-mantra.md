title = "The left-handed aShTha-mukha gaNDabheruNDa nR^ikeshari mantra"

+++
It is said that there are two emanations of the mantra of the most
terrible aShTha-mukha gaNDabheruNDa nR^isimha (AMGN)- a dakShiNa and
vAma form. The right-handed form is said to lie in the text termed the
bhIma-tantra which is a upa-tantra of the ananta-vijaya saMhitA of the
viShNu-yAmala tradition. The left-handed form is said to like in the
text termed vAmA-tantra which is also an upa-tantra of the ananta-vijaya
saMhitA. Not much is know of the full extant of these texts ( if they
survive in an degree at all they are obviously kept a close secret) but
fragments relevant to ritual performance have been transmitted to those
in the know. It is however clear that the left-handed vidya has
propagated considerably in various guises. 

AMGN is said to have 8 heads
of the leonine form with saber teeth, whereas two heads of the
dinosaurian form (which are apparently concealed as per the vAma
mantra). He has 16 hands with a garland of skulls and holds a chakra,
trident, gadA, sword, bow and arrow, in addition to various other
weapons. The mantra was narrated thus by mahAdeva to ishAnI when she
embraced him and kissed him:

This formula’s origin in the brahminical viShNu yAmala tradition is
supported by the use of the term “vedAnAM AdimaM” in describing the
praNava in the mantra. This allusion to the praNava, the leader of the
veda, has found its way into the chInAchArA tantras unaltered showing
the direct lateral transfer of this mantra from the AstIka Hindu
sources. The famed sadhaka of chInAchAra, matidhvaja shribhadra, became
a knower of these mantras after acquiring them from a brahmin savant
from Bihar. He journeyed to the court in Xanadu of the great Khan
Kublai, the grandson of Chingiz Kha’Khan. The Kha’Khan appointed him to
contruct a new script for the Mongol language. In course of this he
initiated the Kha’Khan into the mantras of vama-AMGN and he became its
practioner. From there it became popular in the secret realm of
chInAchAra.
