## CLIII

*To Mrs. Ole Bull*

180 W. 59,  
C/O E. GUERNSEY, M.D.,

*12 November 1899*

DEAR MRS. BULL —

I am laid up with a bad cold. The clothes are not ready — they will be
next week. I don't know what my next step will be. Dr. Guernsey is very
kind. Several Doctors have examined me and none could detect any organic
disease.

Even the kidney complications for the present have disappeared.

Well, the whole thing is then dyspepsia. I want ever so much to try
Battle Creek food. There is a restaurant which cooks only Battle Creek
food. Do you think it should be best for me to try it just now? If so, I
go to Detroit. In that case, send me my terracotta, thick cashmere coat.

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA

Had three treatments already from Helmer.[1](#fn1) Going to take some
next week. None can do anything for this "wind". That is why dieting
should be tried at any cost.

V.
