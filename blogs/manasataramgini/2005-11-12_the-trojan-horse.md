title = "The Trojan horse?"

+++
With the fall of general Wright, the Hindu armies employed a new trainer
in the form of the roguish chief from Southern Saxony, Chappell. we have
long known Chappell to be an abrasive character, who has always had his
own quirks. He quickly got into a conflict with the prince of Vanga and
the brave Andhra grenadier from Vangipura. We believe that the
Anglo-Saxon is a Trojan horse sent by the king of the Southern Whites to
ruin the Hindu armies. We suspect that he might be a plant to spoil the
Hindu performance by his policies of targeted disruption and deletion.
