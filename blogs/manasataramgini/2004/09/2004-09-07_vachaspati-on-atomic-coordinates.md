title = "vachaspati on atomic coordinates"

+++
The great brAhmaNa vAchaspati mishra, who was described as “sarva 
tantra svatantra” provides a model that is equivalent to the 3D 
cartesian system in his work nyAya vartika tAtparya TIkA (4.2.25) to 
describe molecular/atomic contacts. The 3 axes were termed 
pUrva-pashchima, uttara-dakShiNa and urdhva-adhara. The position of 
any point is given by measuring the the distance along these 
direction. The position of contacts between atoms can then be given as 
numerical series of these coordinates.
