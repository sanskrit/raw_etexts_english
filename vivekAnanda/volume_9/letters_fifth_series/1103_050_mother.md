*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

54 W. 33RD ST., NEW YORK

*11 March 1895*

DEAR MOTHER,

Many thanks for your kind letter. I will be only too glad to have an
orange coat, provided it be light as summer is approaching.

I do not remember whether the Cook's letters of credit I have are
limited as to their time or not. It is high time we look into them. If
they are limited, don't you think it is better to put them in some bank?
I have about a thousand dollars in the Boston bank and a few hundred in
the New York — they all go to India by this week or next. So it is
better that I look into the Cook's letters, and it will be foolish to
get into trouble by having them past the date.

There are a few more Sanskrit books which have not been sent — one
pretty thick and broad, the other two very thin. Kindly send them as
soon as you can.

Mrs. \[Milward\] Adams, Mrs. \[Ole\] Bull, and Miss Emma Thursby are
gone to Chicago today.

With eternal love to the babies and to you and Father Pope.

I remain ever your affectionate Son,  
VIVEKANANDA
