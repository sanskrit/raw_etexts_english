## CLXVI

THE MATH, BELUR, HOWRAH,  
*19th Dec., 1900.*

DEAR NIVEDITA,

Just a voice across the continents to say, how do you do? Are you not
surprised? Verily I am a bird of passage. Gay and busy Paris, grim old
Constantinople, sparkling little Athens, and pyramidal Cairo are left
behind, and here I am writing in my room on the Ganga, in the Math. It
is so quiet and still! The broad river is dancing in the bright
sunshine, only now and then an occasional cargo boat breaking the
silence with the splashing of the oars. It is the cold season here, but
the middle of the day is warm and bright every day. But it is the winter
of Southern California. Everything is green and gold, and the grass is
like velvet; yet the air is cold and crisp and delightful. 

Yours etc.,

VIVEKANANDA.
