After the great war at kurukṣetra and the conquest of hastināpura,
yudhiṣṭhira went through a phase of deep despondency. Given his
pacific nature, he was immensely troubled by the violence he had
inflicted by killing his kinsmen, relatives, teachers and other great
heroes. This came in the way of this ability to rule effectively and he
apparently had thoughts of renouncing the world and leading the life of
an ascetic. At this juncture he was shored up by some brilliant advice
from his brothers and wife. To cap their advice, the sage vyāsa
kṛṣṇa-dvaipāyana himself arrived at his court, confirmed the views
of draupadī and the other pāṇḍava-s, and taught yudhiṣṭhira the right
path. In course of this teaching, he narrated to him a small, ancient
legend of a king known as hayagrīva (mahābhārata “Critical edition”
12.25.22-12.25.33 \[Footnote 1\]). Most of the narrative is in the
triṣṭubh meter, an ancient Sanskrit meter with 11 syllables in each
of its 4 units. The first two, the introductory ones, are in anuṣṭubh, a
meter with 8 syllables in each of its 4 units (the most common meter
used in both the itihāsa-s).

atra te rāja-śārdūla vartayiṣye kathām imām |  
yad vṛttaṃ pūrva rājarṣer hayagrīvasya pārthiva ||  
I shall narrate to you, tiger among kings, this legend of what happened
in the past in regard to the royal sage hayagrīva.

śatrūn hatvā hatasya+ājau śūrasya+akliṣṭa-karmaṇaḥ |  
asahāyasya dhīrasya nirjitasya yudhiṣṭhira ||  
\[The is the story of him\] O yudhiṣṭhira, who was heroic, intelligent,
of unfailing acts, who after slaughtering his foes without assistance,
was overcome himself and slain in the midst of battle (ājau= in battle
is a distinct epic usage).

yat karma vai nigrahe śātravāṇāṃ; yogaś ca+agryaḥ pālane mānavānām |  
kṛtvā karma prāpya kīrtiṃ suyuddhe; vājigrīvo modate devaloke ||  
Indeed, having performed those deeds for the suppression of enemies,
adopting the foremost measures for the protection of people, having
performed his duties in battle hayagrīva attained glory, and is
rejoicing in the deva-world.

saṃtyakta+ātmā samareṣv ātatāyī; śastraiś chinno dasyubhir ardyamānaḥ

Having sacrificed his life in the midst of battle with bow drawn,
slashed by weapons while attacked by evil-doers, firm in his actions,
the great soul, having attained his objectives, is rejoicing in the
deva-world.

|  
ratho vedī kāmago yuddham agniś; cāturhotraṃ caturo vājimukhyāḥ ||  
\[At this sacrifice\] his bow was the sacrificial stake, his bowstring
was the rope \[for tying the animal victim\], his arrows the offering
ladle, his sword the scooping ladle, and the blood \[spilled in it\] the
ghee. His chariot was the altar, his unrestrained movement in battle the
\[ritual\] fire, and his four foremost horses his four Vedic ritualists.

prāṇān hutvā cāvabhṛthe raṇe sa; vājigrīvo modate devaloke ||  
Having offered on that ritual fire his foes as oblations, free from sins
that energetic lion among kings, finally offered his own life-breaths as
though it was the offering at the bath at the termination of the Vedic
ritual; hayagrīva now rejoices in the deva-world.

sarvāṃl lokān vyāpya kīrtyā manasvī; vājigrīvo modate devaloke ||  
Protecting his nation intelligently and with good policy, the great
soul, firm in Vedic rituals sacrificed his life. All realms have been
encompassed by the fame of this intelligent king hayagrīva, who rejoices

vṛttaṃ yasya ślāghanīyaṃ manuṣyāḥ; santo vidvāṃsaś cārhayanty arhaṇīyāḥ
|  
svargaṃ jitvā vīralokāṃś ca gatvā; siddhiṃ prāptaḥ puṇyakīrtir mahātmā
||  
His conduct was laudable, learned and good men deservedly praise his
worthy behavior. Having won heaven, and having gone to the realm of
heroes, the great soul of pure fame attained perfect success.

**Commentary**  
This short narrative, at the face of it, might seem unremarkable in body
of the great epic bristling with all kinds of interesting legends.
However, it embodies within it a succinct collection of notable ideals
held by the ancient Hindus. The persistent motif in it is the ascent of
king hayagrīva to the deva-world upon his death in battle. This motif is
an ancient one which is seen in other sister cultures of the
Indo-European world: It is rather pronounced in the Germanic world where
the slain warriors go to rejoice in the divine realm of Valhalla. In the
Greek world there is a memory of a realm called Elysium, which was
attained by great heroes upon their death. While this theme is made
obvious by the phrase modate devaloke (rejoices in the deva-world), it
is also clear that vyāsa uses it as didactic platform. He wishes to
instruct yudhiṣṭhira regarding the duties of an ideal ruler, including
when he needs to commit violence and sacrifice his own life if needed.

The key points that are emphasized by the narrative are:  
● It is necessary for a king to commit violence when he is confronted by
evil-doers (dasyu-s) and slay them in battle. In particular, if this is
committed to protect the nation (rāṣṭra) and his people (prajā) then it
is meritorious deed.  
● Death in such a battle is implied to be the gateway to the realm of
the deva-s, where the ruler, who has died thus, is said to rejoice. The
narrative also implies that the king should make fighting such a battle,
even if outnumbered, his primary duty.  
● Indeed, the performance of this act is hence equated to a Vedic
ritual. In generating this equivalence the narrative establishes many
saṃbandha-s(connections) between the Vedic ritual and the battle
fought against the evil-doers. Specifically, it is compared to the Vedic
animal sacrifice (e.g. nīrūḍha-paśubandha), along with the use of
technical terms from ritual literature: the sacrificial stake (yūpa),
the rope for tying the animal victim (raśana), the offering ladle
(sruk), the scooping ladle (sruva), ghee offered in the fire, the altar
(vedi), the ritual fire and four Vedic ritual specialists, namely the
hotṛ belonging to the ṛgveda, the adhvaryu belonging to the yajurveda,
the udgātṛ belonging to the sāmaveda and the brahman usually assigned to
the atharvaveda. The final sacrifice of the king in such a battle is
equated to the bath which takes places at the end of the Vedic ritual
(the avabhṛtha). In Hindu tradition the performance of a ritual (karman)
is said to yield a result (karmaphala), which, among other things, might
be a place in the deva-realm. By equating the battle for the protection
of the nation and people to a Vedic ritual the narrative offers a
justification of the fruit attained by the king via his sacrifice.
Through this equivalence vyāsa brings home to yudhiṣṭhira that such a
battle is not a sinful act but a meritorious and holy act, just like the
cognate Vedic ritual.

● The narrative also touches upon the duties of such a king with respect
to his state. He is described as being intelligent and cultivating
scholasticism through the study of texts and patronage to brāhmaṇa-s,
who were generators of knowledge. He is described as being diligent in
applying law to bring justice among his people (daṇḍa or the rod of
chastisement) and upholding the stability of society. He is said to
apply his intelligence and sound policy for the defense of his nation
(rāṣṭraṃ rakṣan buddhi-pūrvaṃ nayena). He is also particular about the
performance of Vedic rituals, such as the great soma rituals. Thus,
vyāsa within a short narrative conveys to yudhiṣṭhira the essentials of
the Hindu ideal of a ruler. He emphasizes that the upholder of dharma,
who commits violence or perishes in the defense of his nation and
people, is performing a holy act. Hence, there one should not be
afflicted by doubt or grief over such actions.

When we look at pre-modern India, we find several rulers who lived up to
this ideal, but one name which fits the bill in its entirety is the
great paramāra ruler bhojadeva. He lived the life of a scholar, stood as
a wall against the Islamic invasions of the Ghaznavids in the 1020s and
again in 1043 CE, finally dying in battle defending his kingdom. This
ideal widely permeated the collective kṣatriya mind and was kept alive
by the overtures of the brāhmaṇa-s. A good example of this seen in
course of the invasion of Northwestern India by Macedonian Alexander. He
met some of the fiercest resistance in his entire career from the
kṣatriya-s of those regions because they were inspired by the ideal of
dying in the defense of their nation by brāhmaṇa-s \[Footnote 2\].
Alexander then targeted the brāhmaṇa-s who also sacrificed themselves
following a similar ideal \[Footnote 3\]. When Alexander was about to
hang a brāhmaṇa he asked him what had made him instigate the kṣatriya-s
to attack the Macedonians. The brāhmaṇa bluntly replied: “I wish to live
with honor or die with honor”. In essence, he was going by the ideal
taught by the example of the ancient king hayagrīva. The consequence of
these sacrifices was that the Macedonian forces were completely
eliminated in Northwestern India within 10 years of Alexander’s retreat
from India. In the medieval period it was the same ideal, which inspired
the local warriors of whom the only memories are vīra-kal-s dotting
peninsular India. Again, it was the same ideal which inspired the
medieval and early modern Hindu warriors in the struggle against their
mortal enemies in the form of the Mohammedan and Christian invaders.

In conclusion, one may note in passing that the Hindu self-sacrifice in
a dharma-yuddha is a very distinct concept from that of martyrdom shared
by Abrahamistic religions. Whereas the former is for the protection of
dharma, the latter is for the imposition of a delusion that has come
upon a mentally diseased “prophet” on an otherwise normal population.

not the primary duty of a brāhmaṇa, when the need arises he too needs to
engage actively in combat to slay evil-doers and, if need be, die in the
process.
