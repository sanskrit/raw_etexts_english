## CCV

*To Sister Christine*

THE MATH, BELUR,  
DIST. HOWRAH, BENGAL,

*8th October 1901.*

DEAR CHRISTINA,

Yours of September 9 came to hand yesterday. I congratulate you on your
successful visit to the Huron Lake; a few more of them (according to
your letter) will force you to sympathize with our condition — oh, the
gasping and the melting and the puffing and all the rest of them!

However, nothing in the world like a plump, ripe fruit.

I had to give up my trip to Japan: firstly, because I am not in a
working trim yet; secondly, \[I\] don't much care to make such a long
voyage (one month) alone; thirdly, what am I to talk to them, I wonder.

Our heat too has been fierce and is continuing unusually long this year.
I am blacker than a Negro by this time.

The California work is progressing famously. They want one or two men
more. I would send, if I could, but I have not any more spare men. Poor
Turiyananda is suffering from malaria yet, and is awfully overworked.

Do you know whether they published my *Jnana-Yoga* or not? I got a copy
of a second edition of *Karma-Yoga* only.

I am bobbing up and down in the current of life. Today it is rather
down, so I finish the letter here.

Yours with all love and blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA.
