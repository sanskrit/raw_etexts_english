title = "The kingdom in danger"

+++
For the first time in our reign did we find the kingdom in such an
existential crisis emerging from our earlier conquest of khANDavaprasta.
We checked all past events- it looked as though most of our mantras had
worked. But the enemies were very numerous and all it took was a small
chink in the armour to break through. We have exactly 8 days to grind
out one of our main adversaries and the kR^ityA is raining hell all the
while.
