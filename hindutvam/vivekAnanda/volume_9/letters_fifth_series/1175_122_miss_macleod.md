## CXXII

*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

DARJEELING

*19th April '98*

MY DEAR MISS MACLEOD,

Miss Müller is very glad to learn that you intend inviting Miss Noble to
join our party to Kashmir.

It has her hearty approval. On her way back, Miss Müller will start
something for her in Calcutta. She need not come to Darjeeling at all.

Hope you are enjoying the baking quite a bit. I start this week most
probably.

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA
