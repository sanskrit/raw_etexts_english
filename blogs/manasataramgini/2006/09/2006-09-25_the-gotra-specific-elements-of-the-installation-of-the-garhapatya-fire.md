title = "The gotra-specific elements of the installation of the gArhapatya fire"

+++
- The udgAtA starts singing the rathanthara and ya\~jna-yaj\~nIya
sAman-s \[The jaiminIyas recite their samans in a low inaudible voice on
the occassion of this rite\].  
- The adhvaryu starts installing the gArhapatya from the fire he has
just kindled with the araNi-s on the saMbhAra-s that he has laid down at
the site of the gArhapatya altar. The saMbhAra-s comprise of the
following dravya-s- the pArthiva set: 1) sand, 2) soil that is rich in
salt, 3) soil from a rodent-excavated tunnel, 4) soil from a termite
mound 5) soil dug by boars 6) sediment from the bed of a perennial lake
7) smooth pebbles 8) gold. The dru set: wooden pieces of 1) ashvattha 2)
udumbara 3) palAsha 4) shami 5) vika\~NkaTa 6) fulgurites or a tree
struck by lighting and 7) lotus leaves. He may at least get 5 of each of
these.

- As he installs the fire he recites formulae depending on the
yajamAna’s origin  
If he is a bhArgava he chants:  
bhR^iguNAM tvA vratapate vratena dadhAmi |  
If he is an A\~Ngiras he chants:  
a\~NgirasAM tvA vratapate vratena dadhAmi |  
If he is of any other gotra he chants:  
AdityAnAM tvA devAnAM vratapate vratena dadhAmi |  
If he is a royal sacrificer he chants:  
varuNasya tvA rAj\~no vratapate vratena dadhAmi |  
If he is an ordinary kShatriya he chants:  
indrasya tvedriyeNa vratapate vratena dadhAmi |  
If he is a vaishya he chants:  
manostva grAmaNyo vratapate vratena dadhAmi |  
If he is a version of the 4th varNa with vedic adhikAra (like rathakAra
or niShAda stapathi) he uses:  
R^ibhuNaM tvA devAnAM vratena dadhAmi |

- Then the adhvaryu chants as he is making the fire burn the formulae
beginning with yAste shivAstanuvo…  
- Then the yajamAna worships the fire with the incantation sugArhapatyo
(TB 1.2.1) and repeats the gharmashiras incantations with the
adhvaryu.  
- then the adhvaryu barhiSh around the gArhapatya fire.
