title = "The substrate in Old Indo-Aryan"

+++
Over the past century Western as well as Hindu investigators have noted
the substrate in Indo-Aryan. However, identifying its origin has been
largely left to the speculative whims of the worker. Dravidian and
Austro-Asiatic have been the pet choices, but there are serious problems
with each of these. A proper objective reconstruction of native
proto-Dravidian has not been carried out to discern true transfers from
Dravidian to IA. There is a heavy weighting favor of Tamil- but then
Tamil is not proto-Dravidian and Tamil was influenced prior to its
earliest attestation by IA. In contrast, the oldest IA shows now signs
of Dravidian. So the directionality, except for the obvious cases is
hardly clear. Of the two Austro-Asiatic branches, Munda (the Munda
branch) is distributed more widely within the modern IA spread (though
with an Eastern epicenter), and Khasi belonging to the other subfamily
(Mon-Khmer) is in the far east of India at the border of the current IA
dominant zone. Both genetics (the O3e Y-chromosomal marker) and skeletal
anatomy suggest that the Austro-Asiatic spread was limited to an Eastern
population, though historical it may have stretched as far as the
Narmada valley north of Maharashtra. Secondly, it is found mainly in
tribal populations that are relatively disjoint from each other. In
light of this claims for Austro-Asiatic in Vedic and Sanskrit should be
considered more carefully. One well known class of words that has caught
everyone’s attention as a major substrate in Sanskrit (OIA) are the
words with the prefix ka-, ki-, kI-, ku-, ke-, followed usually by an
element that does not have an obvious IA (IE) etymology. These words
have been considered definitive cases of Austro-Asiatic lateral
transfers, especially by pointing to the presence of articles in Khasi
like feminine ka- and plural ki. While in principle this theory is
plausible it has problems: Proper, objective Austro-Asiatic etymologies
have not yet been furnished for the majority of such words in IA.
Secondly, Khasi is a very Eastern branch of AA and these words are seen
from the early layers of IA. This is not consistent with the genetics of
Austro-Asiatic populations or their distribution. Again even learned
scholars like Masica have differently etymologized words of this
striking structure, sometimes calling them AA and other times Dr. Thus,
there appears to be lack of clarity regarding their origin. Whatever the
case we believe that the case for them being AA is far from certain, but
they were definitely derived from the major language spoken in India
before the advent of IA. The famous word karpAsa in Sanskrit is believed
to be derived from this substrate and follows the very typical structure
of such words. Given that it was attested in Mesopotamia as an Indic
word, the general consensus is that words with the ka-,ki-,kI-, ku-
structure were present in the Indus language, irrespective of whether it
was Austro-Asiatic or an unknown family. Let examine some of these words
that are particularly over-represented in names of plants usually
peculiar to India:

karpAsa (Hindi kApas, Marathi kApus): cotton  
karkandhu: Zizyphus jujube  
karkaTi (Hindi/Marathi kAkaDi): Cucumber Cucumis utilissimus  
karkasha: Tragia involucrate (plant)  
kamala: lotus  
kadalI: banana  
kadamba: Nauclea cadamba (tree)  
kAkambira: a tree  
kAkaka\~Ngu: a grass  
kAkamAchi: Solanum nigrum  
kAkashimbi: Xanthochymus pictorius(Plant)  
kAkaNtika: Abrus precatorius  
kIlAla: sugarcane juice  
kukudru: Blumea lacera  
kukuNDaka: a fruit  
kuchA\~Ngeri: Rumex vesicarius (a sorrel plant)  
kustumburu (Hindi: kotmIr; Tamil kotamali, but note Iranian \* kishniz):
Coriandrum sativum kushAlmali: tree (Andersonia ?)  
kushimbi: Plant  
kukuTa: a small plant (Marsilea quadrifolia ?)  
kukundani: Cardiospermum halicacabum  
kukura: a plant  
kukUTi: Salmalia malabarica  
kukola: a fruit/berry  
kuvalaya: A water-lily  
kumuda: a red lotus  
kusuma: a flower  
kulaka: A gourd  
kula\~Nja: Alpinia galanga (A plant)

So it would appear that there was lot of cackle in old India.
