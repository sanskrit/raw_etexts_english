<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मन जाने सब बात, जान बूझ अवगुण करे।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">क्यों चाहत कुसलात, कर दीपक कूएँ पड़े॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Nothing is hidden to mind. Mind knows everything and knowingly resorts to evils. Then, expects his welfare, it is like this that with an earthen lamp in hand he falls into a well not noticing it.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At present, such heinous and dreadful sins are being committed that make our hair stand on end, eyes are overflowed with tears, heart pities to hear them. Oh! Ram, Ram-Ram, what a great injustice, what severe crimes you are committing! But you have no thought towards it! The human species has been described as the rarest—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">दुर्लभो मानुषो देहो देहिनां क्षणभङ्गुर:।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Shrimadbha. 11/2/29)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The human body is a rare boon to embodied souls and that too is very transient.’</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘Having after many births in this world acquired the rare human body, however frail, which is still the means of attaining the object of life, a wise man should speedily strive to attain Liberation, before it gets destroyed body.’</p>

<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सुर दुर्लभ सब ग्रंथन्हि गावा॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Manas 7/42/7)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘It is by good fortune that you have secured a human body, which, as declared by all the scriptures, is difficult even for the gods to attain.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What a severe crime, what a great sin, what a great injustice it is with the beings to end in the beginning of this rare human body or to cut it! My mind is afire, I am much afflicted, but what to do? This is the climax of sin to destroy it or not to let this human body be born, which is capable to attain the Supreme Lord. Man has girded up his loins that a living being may not get the rare human body, one may not attain the highest good, one may not emancipate oneself so one may not even develop of foetus, it is to be destroyed by taking medicine earlier, it is to be aborted, it is to be destroyed by cutting it, it is to be destroyed by miscarriage, it is to be destroyed by forced abortion, it is to be destroyed by foeticide; it may incur great sin, we may go to hell but we cannot give opportunity to any one to redeem oneself—man is bent upon to do so. Now, what should I do? To whom should I speak? And who is to listen to me? None pays attention.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For the saints like us, it has been ordained in the Shastras not to wander about in the four months of rainy season. We stay at one place for two months; a few stay for three months and a few stay for four months at a place and they don’t move about. There is reason behind it is that it rains in the four months,  every seed sprouts. After sprouting it becomes plant and then it becomes a big tree. By the movement, the germinated seeds are crushed with our feet and they are ruined. So we stop our movements in the rainy season, so that violence may not be caused to anyone. It is said in the Bhagawat—‘If violence is to be avoided, the movement of the body should be minimised.’—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘हिंसा कायाद्यनीहया’</span> (7/15/23). If there is so much consideration of even the immoveable creatures that the movement in the rainy season has been forbidden, then what is to talk of the mobile beings? But today the people are making efforts to destroy the human body, even superior to gods, what will be their fate?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is not my sense of pride that I say but it is what I have heard or what I have understood which I say that as much effort the Indian culture has made for the emancipation of the living beings, so much has not been made by any other culture. Has any religious sect—Christianity, Islam, Yahudi, Buddhism, Parasi etc., made so much effort for the welfare of living beings? What is that particular religious sect whose foundation is only for the redemption of living beings? You, yourself may analyse. They make efforts to increase their number and to preach their faith undoubtedly, but they never make any effort for the highest good of the living beings. The culture which is meant only for the salvation of the living beings, not allow any being to come on the earth, check the soul from the birth or to destroy it, how horrible sin it is? It is a matter of wonder that this vice is being considered as a feature of modern civilization in the society. It means clearly to go to the hell as soon as possible, to suffer in the most terrible hell and if there is any impediment in going to hell this way then, it will be a tyranny.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just think over, is it good to check the progress of anyone? Will you not let any one to become rich if he wants to become rich, if any one wants to become righteous, will you not let him to be so, if one wants to redeem oneself, would you not allow him to redeem, will you check anyone to be physically strong, stout and robust, is it a virtue? What a great injustice and tyranny for our petty comforts it is to destroy the other souls who might follow the path of God-realization and not to let them take the birth! Don’t commit sin knowingly, O the bread-giver! Be kind to the least. I belong to you, I have been brought up by you and still I depend on you for my livelihood. You are my mother and father! Be kind enough not to commit such a heinous crime. There is a reference in Parasharasmriti—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">यत्पापं ब्रह्महत्याया द्विगुणं गर्भपातने।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">प्रायश्चित्तं न तस्यास्ति तस्यास्त्यागो विधीयते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(4/20)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Sin of committing abortion is double to the murder of a Brahmana. There is no atonement of this great sin of doing abortion, there is the moral rule to abandon such a woman and not to accept her as his wife.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If you are interested in birth control, observe celibacy. I recommend it to you. You will not be the victim of sin if you follow the rule of celibacy, rather your physique will be healthy, free from any disease and strong. But to ruin the body and not to bear the child is a matter of shame. How shameful and sad it is!—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">श्रूयतां धर्मसर्वस्वं श्रुत्वा चैवावधार्यताम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">आत्मन: प्रतिकूलानि परेषां न समाचरेत्॥<span class="char-style-override-8"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Listen essence of the religions and follow it. The conduct and behaviours that do not suit your conscience, should not be behaved with others. Will it be evil or virtue if anybody creates hindrance in your progress, checks your birth, checks your flourish, checks your study, checks your divine adoration or check you to achieve your goal? Just consider! A being is coming to the form of a human birth and to become the hurdle of the way and not to let it be born, what a great sin it is! Alright, if you practise celibacy, your body will remain healthy, neither you will be sinner nor will you be condemned and contrary to it you will enjoy a sound physique also. But you don’t want to give up worldly enjoyments, you will indulge into sense-enjoyments and decay your health and body but not to let the issue be born—it is a matter of great downfall.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">You don’t hesitate to kill the small creatures. They cannot oppose you; but is there no justice in the court of the Lord? What a great evil it is to destroy the weak and helpless? Hear and read the fable of Mahabharat. In the war period the enemy is made to be alert and to be cautious before the arrow is shot at. It is a great torture and injustice to destroy or harm such small creatures or insects who are too poor and helpless to do anything, they cannot even escape themselves and they cannot harm you even. Gentlemen! Pay heed to my words, just think. You don’t want your ill then what right have you got to do ill to others? Don’t disturb anybody’s happiness, don’t be hurdle in any body’s prosperity, don’t create problem in anybody’s birth, let it be good of others, don’t disturb. Don’t want to do such behaviour with others what does not suit to you, yourself. This is the first morality.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The creatures that are incapable to oppose, should not be tortured, to torture them is not tolerable even to the Lord. For those who are powerful to ruin others, the Gita has mentioned them ‘demons’—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘प्रभवन्त्युग्रकर्माण: क्षयाय जगतोऽहिता:’</span> (16/9). Knowingly, you commit the murder of helpless and dumb creatures and want your welfare; how is it possible? How will be your the highest good? I want whole-heartedly that you should not meet the evil fate, you should get deliverance! But what should I do?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What is another culture that teaches the way of spiritual advancement so much as Indian culture? The Christians, the Muslims work to enhence their majority that the number of the adherents of their religious sect may be large, they may earn repute. But who has got the keen desire to work for the highest good the entire living beings, who is there to work for their emancipation, to get them rid of the misery, hell, birth and death and to make them able to get the Supreme bliss forever? Who performs the Yagyas etc., for the universal peace and redemption? I saw a pamphlet in Delhi. It was written in the pamphlet to kill him who is found doing idol-worship. What injustice is done by them who believe in idol-worship? What sin do they commit? Whom do they assail any harm? What disturbance do they create for you by their idol-worship? Now, it is you to judge and speak which religious sect is there that talks of the redemption of beings?</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">उमा संत कइ इहइ बड़ाई।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मंद करत जो करइ भलाई॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Manas, 5/40/7)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Said Shiva, “Uma, here lies the greatness of a saint, who returns good for evil.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What a great tyranny is there in that culture where there is restriction of a soul to be born and for this purpose there is the provision of vasectomy in the very begining, abortion and the surgical operation? If any being is about to become a man and that is restrained, that being will be born as heretic who doesn’t have faith in the Hindu culture and he will ruin the Hindus. If the number of heretics increase, what will they do? Which is that religious sect where the effort of the welfare of the entire living beings is made? It is only the Gita where lies the sermon that even the fierce war may bring you the highest good! Even the war of Mahabharat was fought on the holy land of ‘Kurukshetra’ because the death there leads to salvation. The war, too, should be fought on that place where the death may result in deliverance. Thus, if the culture that talks always of the highest good in all the circumstances is banned for the birth of the mankind, what a great crime it is! I am not talking in vanity but it is an expression of pride, so I ask for pardon. This is the assembly of spiritual- seekers, it has been organised for nine days regular and complete recitation of ‘Ramcharitmanas’—is there any such ceremonial assembly organised among the Christians, Muslims, Jews or Parasies for the welfare of all the living beings? If it so happens, tell me, what is the motive behind this ‘Assembly’ and the reciting of the Ramayan? What is the objective of all this, whether it is to increase our followers, or to collect money or to get fame and glory, or for the honour and name or to get worldly enjoyments or for the progress of the world, what is the purpose?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ramji did not do any harm even to his enemy—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘अरिहुक अनभल कीन्ह न रामा’</span> (Manas 2/183/6). When He sent Angad to Ravan, he said to him also as may advance my cause and serve his welfare at the same time—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘काजु हमार तासु हित होई’</span> (6/17/8). He sends the messenger to him also, who has kidnapped Sitaji and he is ready to kill him or himself to be killed. With a view that his purpose may be served, he may get back his wife but Ravan’s welfare might be served, which is that culture where such an instance may be quoted? What a great injustice it is to restrain a being to be born in such a culture? You are committing that great sin very rapidily which you know and which has been declared a great sin by the Shastras and yet you want redemption, how is it possible?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There were two Jats. The both had cows, buffaloes, sheep, goats etc., in abundance thus, the both were very rich. Their farming was also much luxuriant. The woman of one family was hostile to the other family. She used to burn his grass going to his field, damaged his crops, but in spite of her evildoing, her sons, grandsons, cows and buffaloes were prospering leaps and bounds. The husband of that woman used to say—‘There is great injustice in the God’s court.’ She does ill of others but prospers well. Many years she kept evil doing passed. Now, the young sons of that woman began to die, her wealth was lost, her farming also came to an end. Then, he said—‘There is no injustice in the Lord’s court but there is delay.’ Really, there is no delay also. By the dispensation of the Almighty, whatever should be done, is being done at the appropriate time. Man’s apprehension is defective so it looks to him that it is delayed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Most of the people doubt that righteous people are suffering and those who commit vices are prospering, living comfortably and enjoying pleasure. But it is a mystery, the result will make it clear. Then, there will be nothing except lamenting.</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सो परत्र दुख पावइ सिर धुनि धुनि पछिताइ।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कालहि कर्महि ईस्वरहि मिथ्या दोस लगाइ॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Manas, 7/43)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He suffers torture in the other world and beats his head in remorse, wrongly attributing the blame on time, fate and God.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So, it is better to be cautious earlier. At least, knowingly don’t do great sin and act of tyranny.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the Pandavas lived in the forest, Draupadi asked a question to Yudhisthir—‘Maharaj! You don’t move even a single step against morality, you never hurt anyone, you never assail any harm to anyone, but even then, you are wandering about in the forest, you have nothing edible with you, you depend on the wild fruits and roots to live your life. But, Duryodhan who is always unjust and immoral, is ruling and enjoying the life. Then, does righteousness and moral conduct pay or not? Does the Lord do justice or not?’ Yudhisthir said—Devi! How did this idea crop in your mind? The person who follows morality for his own joy and comforts, does not know the quintensence of religion. Actually, he alone knows the essence of religion who does not give up morality despite his adversities. The comforts and enjoyments have no value, righteousness is valuable. The importance of worldly comforts is there in the animals also. I don’t follow morality to get the worldly pleasures. Now, consider that if even the morality is not followed for the comforts and enjoyment, then what will be the condition of those who are committing the crime of abortion for the sake of their own joys and comforts? What will be more severe sin that they kill the girls particularily lying in the pregnency by the abortion?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">I have seen written on the board—‘Test to know whether there is son or daughter in the womb.’ It means that if it is girl, abort it. The men have been given more importance than the women in the world. But the glory of the Matrishakti is much more than the glory of father. The position of the mother has been accepted thousand times higher than that of the father.</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सहस्रं तु पितॄन्माता गौरवेणातिरिच्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Manu, 2/145)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">First, mother’s name is taken and then after comes father’s name. For example—Radheshyam, Sitaram, Lakshminarayan, Gaurishanker etc. The abortion of the female child is the great insult of Matrishakti. All these brothers and sisters sitting here have come from the mothers lap and not from father’s lap. All have been brought up by mothers and not by fathers. All have been suckled by mothers and not by fathers. When the calf drinks milk, the cow fondles him by licking, she looks towards him that makes him hale and hearty. If he is made to drink the milk of an other cow he will not be so healthy. The reason behind is that the child is brought up by the love and affection of the mother and it is not only her milk. The mother has the extraordinary significance. For the sake of your own joys and comforts you ruin the Matrishakti. If you effect abortion in the womb itself and don’t allow to be born, then how will you be born? It is a great sin to effect the abortion of a female child. There can be no more insult of the Matrishakti than this. The girl who is in the womb is the Matrishakti, if you effect abortion of the female child, whose milk will you drink? Where will you get the lap? How will you get the affection and love of a mother? Who will embrace you to her breast?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The scholar of Kashi Madanmohanji Maharaj used to say that once, he had gone to attend someone’s marriage-party. The sisters and mothers had come there well dressed up with valuable and decent garments and ornaments. One sister had a child in her lap. That child happened to pass stool. The sisters sitting near her said to her that her child was passing stool. Just hearing, she said—‘O, keep quiet, don’t make a noise, my child’s passing of stool will be hindered.’ Tell me, where is such an emotional feeling except a mother? Her fine silken sari is being spoiled but she has no care for it but she has the care of her child that if he is not able to pass his stool, he may fall ill. What a remarkable emotional feeling it is! Such an insult and disgrace of that Matrishakti that her pregnancy is destroyed through abortion! Who will bear us in womb? Nowadays, the discussion about the equality and similarity of the men’s and women’s right is going on, then, men should also be pregnant like women. Actually, the women have no equal right to the men but contrary to it, they have more right than men and they are superior to men because they are mothers verily mothers. The saints have many houses but they are not called homes. The homes are designated because of women only. That is why the Shastras dictate—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">न गृहं गृहमित्याहुर्ग्रहिणी गृहमुच्यते।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Maha. Shanti. 144/6)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘It means, the house is not a home, a woman is called home.’ A man buys a nose-ring and a Petticoat in the market, if he is asked whether he wears the nose-ring, he will say ‘No’, it is needed at the home. It is the ‘Grih-Lakshmi’ that is real home. When the daughter-in-law comes, the sisters and mothers say that the daughter-in-law has come, now, it is her home. The people boast that the women have been insulted too much, now, they are being honoured by us. But in reality, as much the womankind are being insulted now, so much have they never been insulted in the past. Only to protect the dignity of woman, the Mahabharat war was fought. Ramchandra fought war against Ravan for the protection of womankind. For the protection of womankind only, Bhishmji gave up his life, but did not shoot arrow at Shikhandi (who was first a woman not in the present). But today, the Matrishakti is being crushed (by family planning) and she is being used as an object of enjoyment. The girl who has come in the womb is being miscarried by family planning. Is it the honour of womankind? It is a great insult of the womankind.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If the female child is effected abortion in the pregnancy period, what will be condition later on in future? Where would you marry? How will your family flourish? You will have to pay money for the girls. My childhood is still in my mind. Those days, when the girls were born in the Vaishya family, they used to say that they had got the bag of money. But today it is said that the stone has come. Both these things are of my own experience. They used to say the bag of money to the girls because the money would be got in their marriage. Now, the same condition will come in future.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It creates a great wonder to hear that if the population increases, how will the food material be available to the people? This theory is applicable there, where the food-stock is limited and there is no possibility of more production. In such a condition it can be said—‘Brother! The food material is so scanty and the population is growing, then, how can it be shared? If the population is increasing, the production is also increasing in ratio. Where there are trees in abundance, it rains there more; If the population increases, will the production not increase? But why does dearth occur nowadays? It is because men have started eating the animals. So, there is no need of grain for the men and the grass is not needed for the animals, then, what is the need of rain? In the modern time, in the farming the living beings are killed, the locusts are killed, the mice are killed, the birds are killed, small creatures are killed so that the production may increase. But what is the cost of food grain nowadays? Previously, the creatures were not killed. Then, what was the price rate of the grain and what is the price rate of grain today? The result of violence is very horrible. If today you kill the weakers, they will also kill you to become strong. So, gentlemen! Be kind. Don’t effect abortion, don’t miscarry.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is the rule of law that the man who disrespects the good objects, does not get the good objects again. The man who despises grain, wastes it uselessly, leaves the remainings of food, will have to starve in want of food either in this very birth or in the next birth. One who wastes the water without any proper use, will have to die of thirst for want of water. The servent who abandons the good and noble master, insults him, does not discharge his duty properly, will never get a good master. The master who disdains good servant, will never get a good servent. If fortunately you get a saint or hermit, but you neglect him, disrespect him, don’t follow his advice, you will never get good saints and hermits because you have disrespected him. If you waste this human life and don’t use it in noble deeds, you will not get the human life again. In the same way, if you abort, despise the human body, you will have to weep for the issue in the next birth. Somebody asked a saint—‘This woman is issueless, what is the reason?’ He said—‘She has committed the murder of a child in the previous birth, that is why she is issueless and she will remain issueless later on also.’ That woman remained issueless throughout her life—‘I know this, this is true, but I will not disclose her name. If anyone asserts that he who affects abortion, bears issue, then it is the fruitful result of his virtues done in the previous birth. It is sure that he will have to suffer the consequences of the great sin of affecting abortion of this birth, in the next birth. You eat the production of the last year farming, but if you don’t make effort this year for the good production, what will you eat the next year? You will have to reap what you have sowed. So, escape yourself from the sins, don’t commit severe acts of sin.’*</p>
<p class="Footnotes-English">* To understand this subject well, the book <span class="char-style-override-3">‘Mahapaap Se Bacho’</span> should be read.</p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">Disadvantage of Dowry-System</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Somebody asked—‘Unknowingly, I got vasectomy done, then what is it atonement?’ In this context a doctor of Jodhpur had said that the vasectomy can be opened back again, it can be set right also. Those, who have done so, have produced the child also. So, the vasectomy should be set right again by a good doctor. Its repentence is never to get it done again and never to advise others to get it done—determine so. The true repentence removes the ill-affect; it means the mistake was done by me and I will never commit such mistake in future—‘saying so, ask for pardon from the Lord and never to repeat the mistake removes the blame of sin.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To get deliverance after reaping the fruits of all actions is impossible. If there is deliverance ever, that is by the grace of the Lord. When He pardons, we get deliverance only then. What is impossible if the God is graceful? If the repentence is with sincere heart, the Lord pardons.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The next important matter has come before, is that some people effect abortion because of the problem of dowry as if more daughters are produced, where to get dowry from to give. If the rich men show their grace by refusing to accept dowry, this great sin (abortion) can be wiped out. It is the rich men who are hungry of dowry. Injustice is also mostly done by those who have a good deal of money. So, at least be kind enough to accept my this piece of advice, don’t desire to take what belongs to others. Although we partake of meals provided by others, we put on clothes given by others, we read the books of others, we dwell in other’s house, we make journey by the fare paid by others, yet it depends on the will of the giver. We don’t desire to get from others.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">I have heard from the saints. Out of five kinds of begging (Bhiksha), the ‘Madhukari Vritti’ is the best one. Why it is the best? It is because there is the pleasure of the giver. That object which is given willingly is considered to be the most pious. The object received with the desire of the receiver is not pious. Somebody asked a question to a saint before me what food is good. The saint answered—‘The food that gives more pleasure to the feeder than to him who eats, is a good meal. Where the both—one who feeds and one who eats—are joyous, such meals is of medium quality and the meal which gives pleasure only to him who eats and not to him who feeds, is the worst type of meal. If the lion eats the cow by killing, will the cow be happy? It is a heinous murder.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If anything is obtained given willingly that is like milk but if it is obtained after demanding, it is like water, if it is obtained by pulling and hauling, it is like blood. This is what the saints say—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सहज मिले सो दूध सम, माँग लिया सो पानि।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">खैंचातानी रक्त सम, यह सन्तों की बानि॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It means that ‘where there is pulling and hauling that I will take such amount of money, it is just like to drink the blood of anyone. Such money will never do good to anyone. It may seem to be good for sometime but its result is very dreadful.’</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अन्यायोपार्जितं द्रव्यं दशवर्षाणि तिष्ठति।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">प्राप्ते चैकादशे वर्षे समूलं तद्विनश्यति॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The wealth grabbed by the unjust means, stays only for ten years. If there is some just means also along with the unjust means, it may remain a little longer, but after the end of the certain period the principal amount as well as the earned amount as a whole is wasted away. It is just like, the overflow of the pond, if there is any narrow passage to pass on the overflow of the water, the pond remains full with water, if the passage is not there, the flow of the water will split out and the pond will be empty. In the same way, any  person who amasses the money but does not spend in charity, is sure to become destitute, none can save him. On account of the virtuous deeds of the previous birth in excess, he may pull on well for some day, but in the last, his misery is inevitable—there is not the least doubt in it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To hurt the heart of anyone is a great sin. <span class="char-style-override-7">‘दिल किसीका मत दुखा, दिल खुदाका नूर है!’</span> The heart is the abode of God; so it is not right to hurt the feelings of any being. Cow is our mother. When we drink her milk, we, first, filter it with cloth so that any soft hair may not come into it. If a single soft hair is uprooted, the cow feels pained. What is got by us pleasantly, is called milk and what is taken with displeasure of the giver is blood. So, to demand dowry is a great sin.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There was a boy. When he grew up and became well educated, several persons approached him for his engagement but he did not accept any. Ultimately, he married to such a girl of his clan who was blind. His friends forbade him to do so, then, he said to them that he wanted to wed her, whom he might serve. He does not want to wed to take her service, but he wanted to give her service. He himself used to cook the food and wash the clothes. The issue was also born to her. Thus, his married life passed very happily. Such an occurrence is possible only in the mankind and not in the animals. The dogs play with great fondness but just the moment, the piece of bread comes before them, the quarrel starts among them. But in the same way if men start quarrelling for grabbing something for themselves, that is conducive to their downfall.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is a remarkable matter that you cannot spend all what you earn. the entire amassed wealth will not be utilized by you; but the evils what you have done, for amassing it, will go with you; not even a small portion will be left after. If we call him wise who carries the bundle of sins for wealth amassed and left here, then who will be called block-headed? Now you feel happy but the result will be miserable. <span class="char-style-override-7">‘पड़ेगा काम दूतों से, धरेंगे मार जूतों से’</span>! When you have to face the Yama’s messengers, they will thrash you with shoes.’ So, kindly, consider over that what happened in the past, already happened but I will not do so again, I will never take anything by force from anyone. To take money from anyone by pressure is so great a sin as to commit robbery or theft. When will you shun such sin? What will be that day, when you will eschew sin?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The bridegroom people demand dowry that they will take so much. The bride-side cannot speak directly. He conveys through other one that she is his daughter, it is better that bridegroom side should accept her. The bridegroom side asks what money will be given to him in dowry? He says—‘Ten thousand.’ Then, he says that the other one offered giving thirty thousand, but he did not accept. Now, the boy is being put to auction. Now, the price rose to fifty thousand. Who pays fifty thousand, will secure engagement of his girl with that boy. Is it humanitarian attitude to put the son to auction? Think over a bit. You are putting your son to auction, that he who gives more, will get your son. Now, the question is for the bride side, wherefrom to get so much money. What should the poor do? Who has created this trouble? They are the rich men to create this problem. Who are the hungry mostly? The answer is—rich men. The poors are not so much hungry. <span class="char-style-override-7">‘को वा दरिद्रो हि विशालतृष्ण:’</span> Who is more thirsty? He who can drink more water is more thirsty. In the same way, who is bigger destitute? The more rich is the more destitute he is, because his hunger is beyond limit. The rich men suffer the loss also in lakhs but the poors have never suffered loss of one lakh of rupees even in many generations. The rich men say what to do, nowadays, there is not a good profit. About ten thousands come from rent, this amount comes from interest, this much comes from business; nowadays there is not so much income. Then, what a great poor they are that so much income is invisible to them! Low profit is not considered income and if they go in loss, that loss never goes less than one lac. They cannot donate so much in charity also as much a poor donates. If they donated ten to twenty thousand or even one lac but what a big amount is left over! On the other side, a man has only five rupees. If there comes the need to give for the hungry cows, he will give one rupee very easily from his five rupees. Will the owner of one hundred rupees give twenty rupees so easily and hapily? Will the owner of one thousand rupees donate two hundred rupees or will the owner of one lac donate twenty thousand? He will not give at all even after harassment, where is the question of happily donation? If the owner of five rupees gives one rupee in donation, his livlihood will be affected; but if the owner of one lac of rupees donates twenty thousand rupees there will be no shortage for him in his livlihood; because eighty thousand rupees are still remaining with him. So, the charity of a rich man cannot be equal to that of a poor man. In the court of the God there is no consideration of the quantity of the money.</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सत्त सारु दत्त बाँटिये, ‘नापो’ कहत नरां।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">निपट नकारो न दीजिये, उणत देख घरां॥*</p>
<p class="Footnotes-English">* The poet, Napo says—‘O the mankind! Donate in charity according to your capacity. Don’t say ‘No’ to anyone to see the want in our family, reverse to it give something.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The charity should be made according to one’s capacity, then, do the rich men donate according to their capacity? The people note the amount as who gave more. Actually anyone who gave more money in charity is not a charity donator. Really, he is the chariteer who donates even in his poor condition. He has only one loaf of bread but donates half of it, he is the real chariteer. You have a lot of and donated one lac or two lacs, then what did you give? The donation of the big persons is not equal to that of a smaller ones. Injustice is also done by the big persons. They create dearness in the entire market. They corner the goods having purchased it and then sell it at high rate. They monopolize in goods, now, they are free to manage according to their own interest. They do such absurds. They! I don’t say this with the motive to cause you pain, reverse to it, my motive is to make you happy forever, to save you from the torture of hells. If you don’t earn by dishonesty, if you don’t hurt the others, you will be happy forever.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Why is this foeticide effected? These rich persons are the main reason because they demand more dowry. The sisters need abundant sweets, fruits etc., and brothers need more money. This hunger is very bad. Anyhow wipe out this hunger. If the bride brings sweet in short quantity, the mother-in-law says—‘You have brought so a little, my family is big, how should I distribute it?’ Thus, she condemns the daughter-in-law and her mother. If today is in the favour of mother-in-law, there will be a favourable day for the daughter-in-law also, then, you will see the show! Then, you will complain that the daughter-in-law does not obey you. What respect was given by you to the daughter-in-law? How much contempt to her was made by you in the greed that she should bring more sweet? If the sweet is not sufficient, don’t speak it to others. Hide it, let not anyone listen to it and get the same type of sweet be prepared at the home. Then, distribute the sweet adding to it that this sweet has been sent from the daughter-in-law’s paternal house. You will say—‘Babaji! It is easy to say; money is required to do so.’ I say it is the matter of only forty, fifty or one hundred rupees, but the daughter-in-law was purchased only for one hundred rupees, she became yours. What a great impression will be on the daughter-in-law that the mother-in-law distributed the sweets having prepared it at her own house to show my mother’s generosity. If a person is purchased for one hundred rupees only, it is, I think, cheaper, what is there to be costly? But it is possible only when the attitude of greed is given up. Greed is the gateway of hells (Gita 16/21), Give up it. There is a great sin in greed. A greedy man becomes blind, he cannot see.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Due to greed, it is a great insult of womanhood to effect abortion to avoid dowry. When a female is born, the old mothers say—‘Bhato (stone) has been produced, Bhato! Now ask them when they were born, was it diamond that had come? You, too, were the bhato (stone). Now you have become grand mother, and then you disdain the daughters. The girl is given away, the ceremonies are organised. On that day, the mother and father keep fast and they take food after the ceremony of the daughter, being given in gift is over. The gifting away of the daughter is not a common act of charity. The foundation of the dynasty of another family to flourish has been laid down so that the family may continue to go ahead, such a dear daughter like Lakshmi is given away to the bridegroom like Vishnu—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘विष्णुरूपाय वराय सालंकारां सवस्त्रां लक्ष्मीरूपिणीं कन्यां सम्प्रददे’</span>. To effect abortion in the very pregnancy period is a great dreadful sin. It is my earnest prayer to all of you not to effect abortion whether it is male or female in the pregnancy, don’t kill him or her. Listen to one thing more very attentively. If the daughter is born, she has her own fate with her, She will not depend on your fate. There are such occurrences. I was told by someone that once, a good deal of profit was abruptly there in his business. When he performed the marriage ceremony of the daughter he spent the entire money in the marriage function. So, don’t be perturbed, the daughter’s fate will produce automatically sufficient money for the purpose. First it seems to be an uphill task, but in the due course of time the marriage function is performed in a nice manner.If you effect the abortion, where will you marry your sons? The marriages of the Brahmans, in the <span class="char-style-override-9">b</span>rahman caste, the Kshatriyas in the Kshatriya caste have been continuing to be performed since the time unknown and the boys and girls both have been remaining to be born. If the daughters are not born, the growth of the family will be discontinued. Among the Rajputs when the dowry system began to increase, they started killing the daughters. As a result their families became extinct. In the Bhagavat as many numbers of the Rajputs families are found in the fables, so many Rajputs are not found today apparently. Just think a little, the murder of daughters will create a great disaster. To stop the birth of a daughter, the abortion is effected but on the next side, the widow-marriages are being encouraged. If the widows are ready, how will the bridegrooms be available for the daughters? First on one side the bridegrooms for the daughters are not easily available and on the otherside, the widows have been added to increase the number. The widow-marriage is prohibited according to the rules of the Shastras also. This is the duty of the sons to be free from the fathers debt by producing the child. This responsibility does not lie on the women. Even if the man marries again after the death of his wife for his own enjoyments, he commits a sin. Anyone who cannot give up the worldly enjoyments without marriage, the scriptures allow him to marry. It is  not a noble deed to marry. The glory of renunciation is so much more that the glory of sense-enjoyment can never be equal to it has never been equal to it, was never equal so it and never it is possible to be equal to it. Even then, you say that the widow-marriages should be solemnized. A marriage ceremony of a widow can never be held in the real sense of the term. The word ‘Vivah’ (marriage) means the ‘giving away’ of the daughter in donation. Now, who could give away (Kanyadan) the widow in donation? Infact, the widow marriage is not a marriage. This is simply to establish a relationship which is found between a dog and bitch and male donkey and female donkey also. It is not a matter of honour and ideal at all. But today the people say that the widow-marriages should be implemented. In the same way the Sadhus will also say that they should also be married; then, what will be the condition? At least, restrain is essential for sane persons. Please, adopt the right path.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-3">Question—</span>Is it a sin to take dowry?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-3">Answer—</span>Yes, it is a sin.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-3">Question—</span>If dowry is sin, then, why is there the provision of dowry in the Shastras?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-3">Answer—</span>There is the rule in the Shastras only to give dowry, there is no provision to take dowry. The dowry should not be taken and neither there is any significance of taking the dowry. The reason is that to give dowry is the sweet will of the giver but to take dowry is not under one’s will.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Desire is of two types—(1) The object what belongs to me, should be available to me and it is justice also; but this desire even is an obstacle in the attainment of God-realization. (2) The objects belonging to others should be got to me, will take you to the hell. It depends on your fate whether you get less dowry or more dowry or you don’t get at all, but the desire to take the riches of others by unjust means is to lead you to the hell. What a great downfall it is to go to the terrible hells even after getting human body! So, the man should, at least, give up the desire to get the others riches which leads to the terrible hells.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Really, the wealth is got according to the fate and not by desire only. If the wealth could be got as per your desire, then today, none would be poor. The desire of wealth has never been fulfilled, it is also certain that this desire will never be fulfilled and even impossible to be fulfilled. It must be given up. If the wealth is about to come, it may come very easily but if desired, it is got with great difficulty or by unjust means or by sin. Arjun asked in Gita. Impelled by what does a man commit sin even unvoluntarily? Shri Krishna answered—It is the desire only the main root cause of all the sins. In the ancient time, the riches got in dowry from the in-law’s house of the son was used to be distributed outside, it was not kept inside the house and “The daughter of other one has been accepted in charity”—they used to perform Yagya, charity, donation, and feeding the Brahmans in the atonement. It is so because, to take the daughter of any other one is a great debt. But in the condition of a householder, the girl is to be taken in charity; so there is the feeling that if a daughter is born to him, he will also give away his daughter in charity.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahmans who accept the cow etc., in charity in a prescribed way, they also perform Yagya and ‘Gayatri Jap’ as atonement—what I have seen. If to take others wealth is also sin, then to take dowry is certainly a sin. If it becomes necessary to take dowry, it should be accepted only to fulfil the donor’s will or for his pleasure. There should not be the least desire in the mind to take it and only a little should be accepted for the sake of giver’s pleasure; then, that acceptance is just like to give away.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">The god presiding over the ocean clasped the Lord’s feet in dismay—‘Forgive my lord, all my faults. Either air, fire, water and earth—all these my Lord, are dull by nature. It is Maya (Cosmic Nature) which brought them forth for the purpose of creation under an impulse from you: so declare all the scriptures. One would attain happiness in life only by remaining where he has been placed by the Lord. My Lord has done well in giving me a lesson but You have fixed certain proprieties for everyone. A drum, a rustic, a Shudra, a beast and a woman—all these deserve instructions.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">—This is what the ocean is saying. The ocean presents himself before the Lord Rama in the guise of a man and seeks forgiveness. He says that ‘space, air fire, water and earth—all these five are inert. Because of being water I am also inert. For creation, it is You to create them. By remaining there under limit where he has been placed by the Lord; he feels happiness. The Lord has done well in giving me a lesson, but this propriety for everyone has also been fixed by the Lord. A drum, a rustic, a Shudra, a beast and a women—all these deserve instructions.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The ocean says—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘मरजादा पुनि तुम्हरी कीन्ही’</span> It means to say that the limit under which I remain, has been fixed by you; so where lies my fault? This blame goes to You. Then said—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘ढोल गवाँर सूद्र पसु नारी। सकल ताड़ना के अधिकारी॥’</span> Now the word—‘Tarana’ stands for the consideration what it means really. The ocean said—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘प्रभु भल कीन्ह मोहि सिख दीन्ही’</span> It means that the Lord did well in giving him the lesson. This reference makes it clear that the true meaning of the word ‘Tarana’ means lesson or instruction. In the ‘Chanakya Niti’ there is a reference—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">लालयेत् पञ्च वर्षाणि दश वर्षाणि ताडयेत्।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">प्राप्ते तु षोडशे वर्षे पुत्रे मित्रवदाचरेत्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If a child starts to be tortured from the fifth year of his life, the poor one will die before the tenth year of his age is completed. So, The word ‘Taran’ does not mean ‘torture’ rather it means to impart lesson.’ There is one vital point here that if a drum, rustic, Shudra, beast and women—all these deserve instruction; so, if they are not imparted proper education, they are not to be blamed but on the otherside, he who imparts them education is to be blamed. If there is not a good sound of the drum, it is the fault of that one who is playing on it. If the rustic is not right then, it is not his fault but the teacher with whom he has lived is at fault. If the Shudra is not right, it is the fault of Brahman, Kshatriyas and Vaisyas. If the beast is not up to the mark, it is the fault of that one who imparts him lesson. While training the bullock, horse, camel etc., if any defect remains in them, that remains throughout their lives, it can never be removed. In the same way, if the woman is not well behaved, it is not her fault but it is the fault of her mother father and her husband. It means that all of them deserve lesson. If an officer is not trained properly, then, it is the fault of the trainer who has trained him. I have marked very well in the society that when any girl comes to her husband’s house and she does not know to work properly, it is usually said that she has not been trained by her mother. This is the girl who does not work properly but her mother is blamed for this. So, the fault was of her mother, where is the girl at fault? So, the drum, rustic, Sudra, beasts, woman—all these deserve proper instruction. How are they at fault if they are not educated and trained properly? But those who misunderstand it and are unwise say that in this couplet the womankind has been condemned; so, delete the word ‘Nari’ from here and write down—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘ढोल गवाँर सूद्र पसु चारी। सकल ताड़ना के अधिकारी॥’</span> means ‘the drum, rustic, Shudra, beast—these four deserve instructions/lesson? You, yourself have not intelligence and you blame others. If the word ‘Nari’ is replaced by ‘Chari’ then, the word ‘Sakal’ will be redundant. Change the matter in the book what does not suit your mind and replace it by an other matter—it is a great fault. It is just like to murder the oration of Goswamiji. Maharaj. If it is minutely observed the murderer of speech is a greater crime than the crime of a man’s murder. It is the indigestion of wit to tell it wrong which is beyond your understanding. If the matter of the book does not suit your mind then change the book if the preceptor is against your liking, change the preceptor—if it continues so, then, who will be your preceptor to impart you education? How will you become sensible? You will have to change yourself according to him and not change him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The modern time is very strange. What we don’t understand, say that it is wrong. Be a little gracious, at least try to understand the matter. But it is the indigestion of your knowledge that you consider your knowledge more than sufficient and no room in your mind was left empty for more knowledge. Once, when a brother began to talk to me, I said to him; ‘Brother! Both of us are perfect in knowledge. By your mind you are learned and according to my mind I am learned. I don’t listen to you and you don’t listen to me. Neither I have to learn from you nor you have to learn from me. If the two stones dash with each other, it is only the spark that will come out. If the two scholars fight with each other, will there come out any peaceful result? There must be one of them to become the pupil, there must be one of them humble. The earthen pot must remain a little empty; how will the overflowing earthen pot be filled in? If there remains some room empty, only then, something more can be adjusted there.’<span class="char-style-override-10"> </span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The word ‘Tarana’ means—lesson. The ocean has said—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘प्रभु भल कीन्ह मोहि सिख दीन्ही’</span> (My Lord has done well in giving me lesson:) and it has not been said—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘मोहि ताड़ना दीन्ही’ </span>Giving me torture: How will the word ‘Tarana’ mean ‘torture’? The meaning will be derived according to the reference and context. The reference is of giving lesson and not of inflicting torture at all. If the drum, rustic etc., are bad, it is the fault of their teachers, they are not at fault.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-3">The audience—</span>Then, it is their praise!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-3">Swamiji—</span>Yes, it is praise. If there is any shortcoming, that is the fault of their teachers and not they are at fault at all. Really, the fact is so but Goswamiji is blamed that he reproached the womankind. O my feeder! Please, understand what is the reference of the matter and who has uttered it. The sayer can express his humbleness; how can he humiliate other one by blaming him? The ocean says humbly to the Lord that He did well by giving him a lesson; he deserved lesson. ‘Tarana’ means to impart a lesson well. So, he has said—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">The child does not improve so much with his mother as much with his father; he does not improve so much with his father as much in the company of his teacher; and does not improve so much in the company of his teacher as much as in the company of saints and exalted souls. I mean to say that the more attachment to the child means the more degradation of the child. A child living with his mother can not improve usually; because the mother has more attachment with her son, she is more affectionate to him. What is that affection that makes the child foolish, which is against the interest of the child. The kindness means to shape the child, to make him wise, learned and superior. The attachment of a father is not so much and the teacher’s attachment is even less than that of a father. The saints and exalted souls have no attachment at all and the child becomes extra-ordinary in their company. Goswamiji Maharaj lived with the saint Narhariji in his childhood. He says that he heard the character of Ram from his Guru in his childhood in the Shukarkshetra, but he was a child at that time, he was not mature then; so he could not understand that narration at that time.* But despite it what a great saint he became and how deeply he understood Ram’s character!</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">Condemnation of Matrishakti</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the modern age the women are being disgraced and humiliated excessively. Omitting their dignified status as mothers they are treated merely an object of enjoyment. The woman for the purpose of sexual enjoyment is called a prostitute. An enjoyable woman does not get that respect what a mother gets. But those who treat the woman as an enjoyable object, are the slaves of women; what will the men of lust understand this? They cannot really understand it even. Marriage is solemnized to become a mother and not for the enjoyment sake. A father gives away his daughter to bear the child and the bridegroom accepts the daughter in charity to bear the issue and prolong the dynasty. But these days the women are being checked to become a mother and they are being made an object to enjoy. What a great disgrace of the womankind is it!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Woman is in real sense a Matrishakti. She is the mother of men and women both. She becomes the wife of a man only but she is the mother of men and women both. If the man is virtuous, he is glorified only in one family but if the woman is chaste, she is glorified in both the families the paternal as well as the family of her husband. The king Janakji says to Sita—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘पुत्रि पबित्र किए कुल दोऊ’</span> (Manas, Ayodhya. 286/2). ‘Daughter, you have sanctified to both the clans (Viz, my clan and the clan of your husband)’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nowadays, the physical beauty of the daughter is kept on priority instead of her nature, feeling of tolerance, her moral devotion, her righteousness, her dexterity in household chores, virtues etc. The girl is not tested on the measurement of high living end its result but she is tested on the then measurement of facial beauty and passionate living. They don’t consider that the good nature will subsist her; but how long will beauty remain unfaded?* If all the ladies of the world are made available to a sensuous person, even then, he cannot be satisfied—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">यत् पृथिव्यां व्रीहियवं हिरण्यं पशव: स्त्रिय:।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">न दुह्यन्ति मन:प्रीतिं पुंस: कामहतस्य ते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Shrimadbha. 9/19/13)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘All the rice and barley, gold, animals and women that exist on earth, they cannot yield satisfaction to the mind of a man who is buffeted by lust.’</p>
<p class="Footnotes-English">* It was the outstanding beauty of Draupadi that caused the massacre of Jayadrath, Kichak and the entire army. So, it has been said—</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">ऋणकर्ता पिता शत्रु: माता च व्यभिचारिणी।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">भार्या रूपवती शत्रु: पुत्र: शत्रुरपण्डित:॥</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Right-English">(Chanakya Niti 6/10)</p>
<p class="Footnotes-English para-style-override-4">‘The father in debt, the mother of bad character, the beautiful wife and foolish son—these four are the cause of trouble like enemy.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Such a passionate men commit the act of vasectomy, abortion etc. Marriage is performed for the growth of the family. If the girl is virtuous and of moral conduct, her offspring will also be virtuous and moral after marriage; because the son and daughter resemble the nature of the mother usually. There is a Marwari proverb—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘नर नानाणे जाये है’</span> It means—A person’s nature is shaped according to the maternal house. <span class="char-style-override-7">‘माँ पर पूत पिता पर घोड़ा। बहुत नहीं तो थोड़ा थोड़ा॥’</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The son resembles his mother and the horse resembles father in their characteristics, if not completely, it must be to some extent.’ Even in giving away the daughter, she is honourable and not contemptible. This is not like other donations. In other donations, the donator has no right on his donation, but after the birth of child from the daughter, the mother and father get their right on the daughter and they can accept the food and water of her house if needed. It is so because the husband of the bride has accepted his daughter only to get rid of his father’s debt and after bearing the offspring of her, he becomes free from father’s debt. So, inspite of being the different Gotra, the grandson performs the annual rites and libation of water to his maternal grandfather and maternal grandmother which is popular in the society and in the Shastras.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Our Shastras have given due respect to the womankind as a whole. With the purpose of the protection of the woman the Shastras have ordained them to depend on the father, husband or son so that she may not wander about as orphan or may not become a prostitute.* If a woman joins a job, it is her disgrace. Her greatness lies if she is inside the house. She is a queen in the house but outside the house she is a maid servant. Inside the house she remains under the charge of a single man but outside she will have to remain under the control of many men and women, she is bound to tolerate the subordination, rebuke, contempt of her higher officers, which is against her delicate heart touching attitude and nature. She is worthy of honour and not of contempt. The subjection of father, husband or son is not really to make her subservient but contrary to it, is to make her quite independent. In the family, the old ‘Mother’ is given the highest respect; the sons and grandsons all give her regard but out of the house, an old woman is humiliated everywhere.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">* भ्रमन्सम्पूज्यते राजा भ्रमन्सम्पूज्यते द्विज:।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">भ्रमन्सम्पूज्यते योगी भ्रमन्ती स्त्री विनश्यति॥</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Right-English para-style-override-5">(Chanakya Niti 6/4)</p>
<p class="Footnotes-English">‘The king becomes adorable by his movement far and wide, the Brahman is adorable because of wandering about, the Yogi becomes adorable by his tour; but a woman is spoiled by her moving about here and there and she falls down from her dignity.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The women cannot do the outdoor works properly and the men cannot manage the domestic chores. When a woman serves anywhere, she remains busy is knitting the sweater even in the duty hours—she does the domestic work. The men boast of what work is done by the women; We are the males who work hard and earn money. But the men will realise what the woman does if they have to remain inside the house for a single day and they have to discharge the kitchen duty and keep the child in the lap. If the wife dies, the men send the child to the mother-in-law or to the maternal grandmother of the child or to the sister or father’s sister; because they cannot bring up them. But if the husband dies, the woman brings up the child suffering from the troubles even, she makes them able by imparting education to them. It is so because the woman is a Matrishakti, she is capable of fostering. I have marked the small children that if a female child finds anything, she keeps it in her pocket to give it to her younger brother and sister but on the other hand the boys eat away if they get any edible object. If any hermit, destitute, hungry man is sitting, many men will pass on by his side, the feeling to feed them will not come to their mind at all. But the women will ask them—‘Babaji will you eat something?’ It is because the woman are kind by nature. They have to bring up the children, so God has given them such a heart.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nowadays, it is in discussion to give them right equal to men, the Shastras have given more special rights to the woman than that of the man—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सहस्रं तु पितॄन्माता गौरवेणातिरिच्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Manu. 2/145)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The status of a mother has been considered one thousand times more than that of the father.’ </p>

<p class="TXT-Right">(Skandpuran, Kashi. 11/50)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Even the renunciants Sanyasis, venerable to all, should adore the mothers.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now-a-days, the pregnancy is tested and if in the pregnancy the female child is traced out, the abortion is effected; is it being given the equal right to the women? </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The word ‘Stree’ fails to create that feeling what the word ‘Man<span class="char-style-override-10">ँ</span>’ (mother) creates. So, Shankaracharyaji Maharaj calls ‘Shri Krishna’ also by the title mother (Man<span class="char-style-override-10">ँ</span>)—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘मात: कृष्णाभिधाने’ </span>(Prabodh. 244). In the ‘Upnishads’—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘मातृदेवो भव, पितृदेवो भव’</span> ‘Mother’ to be treated as God, ‘Father’ to be treated as God; saying so, ‘mother’ has been ordained to be served first. In ‘Vande Mataram’ also it is the mother who has been prayed in the hymn of her praise. In the Hinduism, the worship of Matrishakti has been given the special priority. Among the five gods ranking to the Lord even the maternal power (Goddess Durga) has been placed. ‘Devi Bhagavat’, ‘Durgasaptshati’ and other many books have been written on the maternal power. The women of the whole world as a whole have been accepted in the form of Matrishakti—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">विद्या: समस्तास्तव देवि भेदा:</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">स्त्रिय: समस्ता: सकला जगत्सु।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Durgasaptashati 11/6)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But what will the sensuous people understand? Really they cannot understand. They treat them as an objects of enjoyment. The Shastras have ordained for the women to follow the duty of widowhood shunning remarriage. This is honour to them and not disgrace. To suffer for the cause of morality is not contempt rather to say it is an austerity and patience. An endurant and austere is worthy of regard and honour in the society. The contempt of woman, to torture the woman, to beat them, to divorce them has nowhere been mentioned in the Shastras, for the males do so. Not only this, there is no rule even to beat the women despite their any mistake rather than she deserves forgiveness. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bhishmji was in the support of the Kaurava army as the chief commander—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘अपर्याप्तं तदस्माकं बलं भीष्माभिरक्षितम्’ </span>(Gita 1/10); but Duryodhan orders his army even to protect him—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘भीष्ममेवाभिरक्षन्तु भवन्त: सर्व एव हि’</span> (Gita 1/11). It is so because Duryodhan knew it that Bhishmji would never shoot his arrow at ‘Shikhandi’ if he comes on his front, instead he may give up his life. Shikhandi was of feminine gender previously, but not in the present; but in the present he is masculine even then, Bhishmji considers him feminine and does not shoot his arrow at him instead of this, he prefers to die—What a great honour of the womankind is! </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This event is concerned to a few years of the past time. Once, the king of Jodhpur, Sir Ummed Singhji and the king of Bikaner Sir Shardul Singh went to the forest for hunting. A lioness got wounded with the bullet shot in her leg by Shardul Singhji. Being wounded, growling she rushed towards him, then Shri Ummed Singhji said—‘Hira! What did you do this? She is a female. When he came to know this, he did not shoot at her again, he saved himself from her by making effort. What an honour of womanhood is! </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shastras have mentioned many duties for mankind—e.g. prayers (Sandhyopasana), offering to the Fire-god, Yagya, chanting of the Vedas etc., but the woman have been set free from all these performances as their duty and they are free from all the debts as the father’s debt etc.,* and they have been made half sharer of the husband’s fruit of his virtuous deeds. But those who are ignorant of the Shastras, are unable to understand it. Having them deviated from their duty, the women are made to indulge in many other complicated jobs. The Shastras have ordained only for the men to offer prayers (Sandhyopasana) after initiated with the sacred thread (Yagyopavit). But today by giving the sacred thread to the women, they are put to trouble. Is it a wise step? The wife is co-partner of her husband in his auspicious deeds but not of his evil doings. She gets the half of the virtuous deeds without any effort freely. It is common in practice in the society to call the doctor’s wife as ‘doctorani’ and Pandit’s wife as ‘Panditain’ even though she is uneducated. Really, nowadays, the superiority complex is prevailing in the society, so instead of giving the lesson of humility, it is only the arrogance and egotism which is being taught and said and it leads us to degradation. ‘If the men are doing so why should we not do? Why should we lag behind?’ It is only to strengthen the feeling of pride. Arrogance is the root cause of birth and death and of so many miseries and all kinds of distress—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">संसृत मूल सूलप्रद नाना।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सकल सोक दायक अभिमाना॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Manas, 7/73/3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘For pride is the root of metempsychosis and the cause of all kinds of pain and all form of grief.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What will a man of pride understand the essence of Shastras? Actually, he cannot understand it even. For the sake of human welfare, the mothers have done a lot. It is the mothers that have annihilated the demons like Raktabij etc. It is only the mothers that have protected the Hindu culture. Even today it is apparently visible that as much knowledge of our vows, festivals, the customs and traditions and the knowledge of mother-father’s annual offerings etc., is to the woman so much knowledge is not to the men. The men forget even the matters of their own family also, but the women, despite belonging to other clan, guide them about the particular day of their parents annual rites and offerings etc. The number of the visitors of the temples, Satsang, religious discourses, devotional songs is greater of the women than of the men. The woman are more in number than the men to take a holy bath on Kartik Purnima, to keep vow, to make charity, to worship and to recite the holy Ramayan etc. It means that the women are the protector of our cultural heritage. If their character corrupts, then who will protect the culture? There is a hymn—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">In the modern time, by the advertisement of the artificial methods of birth control the woman’s shame, modesty, chastity, character and conduct is being spoiled. As a result, the womankind is continuing to remain merely an object of enjoyment. If the character of womanhood is corrupted, what will be the condition of the nation? What lesson will the coming generation learn from the first Guru, the mother? If the womankind corrupts, her sons and daughters the both will be ruined. If the mother is chaste and ideal, her offsprings will not fall down even though the father is corrupt. So, it is the duty of the mankind to preserve and protect the character, modesty, shame and chastity of the women and spare her from insult and humiliation.</p>
