The doyen of the Hindu revival, the battler of secularists, communists
and other allied fiends and the exposer of Indiaâ€™s middle period history
has become a guest of the great Vaivasvata. He has been the corrective
influence on many a Hindu and been at the vanguard of the fight to
preserve the Dharma.

He has lived a full life and protected his small publishing houses the
Voice of India and Aditya Prakashan. Along with Ram Swarup will
remembered long for his attempt at awakening the slumbering Hindu
consciousness that had been subverted by the disasterous English rule.

A Hindu is first a Hindu and only then an Indian, or Carribean or
whatever. India assumes its importance for Indians because it has been
the home for the Hindu Dharma for more than 3 millenia.
