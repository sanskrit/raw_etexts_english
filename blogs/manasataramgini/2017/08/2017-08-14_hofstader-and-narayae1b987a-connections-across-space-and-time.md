title = "Hofstadter and Nārāyaṇa: connections across space and time"

+++
The scientist-philosopher Douglas Hofstadter presents an interesting
single-seeded sequence H in his book ‘Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal
Golden Braid’. It is generated by the recurrence relation,

![f\[n\]=n-f\[f\[f\[n-1\]\]\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3Dn-f%5Bf%5Bf%5Bn-1%5D%5D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[n]=n-f[f[f[n-1]]]") where
![f\[0\]=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B0%5D%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[0]=0") …(1)

Working it out one can see that it takes the form: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4,
5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13, 14, 14, 15, 16, 17, 17…

If we connect ![f\[n\] \\rightarrow
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D+%5Crightarrow+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[n] \\rightarrow n") in (1) then we get a tree structure which
simulates a specific pattern of succession and duplication (Figure 1).

[As we mentioned
before](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/journeying-through-the-fractal-slopes-of-mount-meru-with-two-seeded-recursive-sequences/),
we only got to read Hofstadter’s book briefly when we first came across
it. Hence, we did not have the chance to take in all that was discussed
in it. However, it seeded our own explorations along the lines he has
proposed in the book. Thus, in that period [we discovered for
ourselves](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/journeying-through-the-fractal-slopes-of-mount-meru-with-two-seeded-recursive-sequences/)
a two-seeded sequence generated by the recurrence relation,

![f\[n\]=n-f\[f\[f\[n-2\]\]\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3Dn-f%5Bf%5Bf%5Bn-2%5D%5D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[n]=n-f[f[f[n-2]]]"), where
![f\[1\]=f\[2\]=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B1%5D%3Df%5B2%5D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[1]=f[2]=1") …(2)

This, while similar in from to the above recurrence relation, produces a
different sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11,
12, 13, 14, 14, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 18, 18…

Our sequence (2) is related to Hofstadter’s H sequence in that adjacent
duplications in his H are replaced by one singleton and a triplication
in ours.

[As we have described
before](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/journeying-through-the-fractal-slopes-of-mount-meru-with-two-seeded-recursive-sequences/),
a convenient method for visualizing sequences such as this is to
‘rectify’ them: They increase linearly with a constant slope
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "m").
Hence, we find that slope and use ![f\[n\]-n\\cdot
m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D-n%5Ccdot+m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[n]-n\\cdot m") to render the sequence along the x-axis. For many
common sequences
![m=\\tfrac{1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m=\\tfrac{1}{2}") works. However, during our experimentation with the
sequence (2) ([illustrated in Figure 11 in the previous
article](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/journeying-through-the-fractal-slopes-of-mount-meru-with-two-seeded-recursive-sequences/))
it was obvious that
![m\>.5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3E.5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m\>.5"). Hence, we took the arithmetic mean of
![\\tfrac{f\[n\]}{n}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bf%5Bn%5D%7D%7Bn%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{f[n]}{n}") for large
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n")
and obtained ![m \\approx
0.682](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%5Capprox+0.682&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m \\approx 0.682"), which served as the required rectification factor.
Notably, the same value of
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "m")
applied for the H-sequence and we could accordingly rectify it (Figure
2)

[![Hofstader\_H](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/hofstader_h.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/hofstader_h.png)Figure
2

Similarly, during our explorations of two other two-seeded sequences
([See previous
article](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/journeying-through-the-fractal-slopes-of-mount-meru-with-two-seeded-recursive-sequences/))
we discovered that their rectification factor
![m=\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m=\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}"), where
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi") is the Golden Ratio:

![f\[n\]=n-f\[f\[n-1\]\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3Dn-f%5Bf%5Bn-1%5D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[n]=n-f[f[n-1]]"), where
![f\[1\]=f\[2\]=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B1%5D%3Df%5B2%5D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[1]=f[2]=1") …(3)  
![f\[n\]=f\[f\[f\[n-1\]\]\]+f\[n-f\[f\[n-1\]\]\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3Df%5Bf%5Bf%5Bn-1%5D%5D%5D%2Bf%5Bn-f%5Bf%5Bn-1%5D%5D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[n]=f[f[f[n-1]]]+f[n-f[f[n-1]]]"), where
![f\[1\]=f\[2\]=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B1%5D%3Df%5B2%5D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[1]=f[2]=1") …(4)

Since, (3) in particular resembles H and our above sequence (2) we
wondered if we could similarly get a precise expression for their shared
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "m").
We noted that in the case of the doubly nested recurrence relation (3)
its rectification factor
![m=\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m=\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}") was the first root of the quadratic
![x^2+x-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%2Bx-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^2+x-1=0"). For the triply nested recurrence relation (4) we noted
that its rectification factor
![m=\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m=\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}") was the root of the cubic
![x^3-2x+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3-2x%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^3-2x+1"). Thus, we realized that a connection exists between the
rectification factors and algebraic numbers. Armed with this knowledge
searched the roots of cubic polynomials to get the rectification factors
for H and our sequence (2). The real root of
![x^3+x-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3%2Bx-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^3+x-1=0"),
![x=0.6823278](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0.6823278&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x=0.6823278") yielded their required rectification factor. In the case
of (3) and (4) the rectification factor is the reciprocal of the Golden
Ratio, which is the convergent of the famous Meru sequence (known in the
west as Fibonacci),  
![\\displaystyle \\lim\_{n \\to \\infty}
\\dfrac{M\[n+1\]}{M\[n\]}=\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7BM%5Bn%2B1%5D%7D%7BM%5Bn%5D%7D%3D%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\dfrac{M[n+1]}{M[n]}=\\phi")

Thus, the rectification factors of the linearly growing two-seeded
sequences (3) and (4) were reciprocals of the convergent of a non-linear
sequence M. Notably the terms of M appear at each level of the tree of
these linear sequences (3) and (4); [see Figures 2 and 14 in the
previous
article](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/journeying-through-the-fractal-slopes-of-mount-meru-with-two-seeded-recursive-sequences/).
So question arose as to what is the corresponding non-linear sequence to
which the rectification factor
![m=0.6823278](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D0.6823278&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m=0.6823278") of H and (2) is similarly reciprocally related? The
answer to this remarkably leads us to the original cow sequence of the
great medieval Hindu mathematician Nārāyaṇa, son of Narasiṃha.

In his Gaṇita-kaumudi, Nārāyaṇa presents one of the earliest studies to
identify a discrete formula for the ideal population dynamics of an
organism which continually reproduces upon reaching a certain age. He
poses the following problem:  
prativarṣaṃ gauḥ sūte varṣa-tritayena tarṇakī tasyāḥ |  
vidvan viṃśati-varṣaiḥ gor ekasyāś ca santatiṃ kathaya ||  
Every year a cow gives birth, from its 3rd year, \[and so also\] her
calves.  
O scholar, tell, in 20 years \[of reproduction\] what will be the clan
size from one cow?

He then provides the answer as the following sum of a series:  
abdās tarṇy abd\[a+ū\]onāḥ pṛthak pṛthak yāvad alpatāṃ yānti |  
tāni kramaś c\[a+e\]aikādika-vārāṇāṃ padāni syuḥ ||  
Subtract the number of years (when a calf begins giving birth)
successively and separately from the number of years till the remainder
becomes less than the subtractive. Those are numbers for repeated
addition once etc in order. The sum of the summations along with 1 added
to the number of years \[is the desired number\]. Translation as per
Ramasubramanian and Sriram’s interpretation.

Let the sequence dh\[n\], for dhenu (cow), represent the number of cows
in the nth year. While Nārāyaṇa gives the direct formula for the nth
term, it can be expressed in modern terms rather simply by the below
recurrence relation for a triply seeded sequence,

![dh\[n\]=dh\[n-1\]+dh\[n-3\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=dh%5Bn%5D%3Ddh%5Bn-1%5D%2Bdh%5Bn-3%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"dh[n]=dh[n-1]+dh[n-3]"), where
![dh\[0\]=dh\[1\]=dh\[2\]=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=dh%5B0%5D%3Ddh%5B1%5D%3Ddh%5B2%5D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"dh[0]=dh[1]=dh[2]=1") … (5)

This sequence goes as, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 19, 28, 41, 60, 88,
129, 189, 277, 406, 595, 872, 1278, 1873, 2745, 4023, 5896, 8641… Thus,
the answer for Nārāyaṇa’s problem with 20 reproductive years is
![dh\[22\]=2745](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=dh%5B22%5D%3D2745&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"dh[22]=2745").

We note that, just a
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi") for the Meru sequence, this sequence too has a convergent which
we will call Nārāyaṇa’s convergent
![N\_c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"N_c"),

![\\displaystyle \\lim\_{n \\to \\infty} \\dfrac{dh\[n+1\]}{dh\[n\]}=
N\_c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7Bdh%5Bn%2B1%5D%7D%7Bdh%5Bn%5D%7D%3D+N_c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\dfrac{dh[n+1]}{dh[n]}= N_c")

Investigating this value, we found it to be the only real root of the
cubic equation
![x^3-x^2-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3-x%5E2-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^3-x^2-1=0"), i.e.
![N\_c=1.4655712319](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_c%3D1.4655712319&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"N_c=1.4655712319"). This result yields the relationship between the
rectification factor
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "m")
for the Hofstadter H sequence and our sequence (2) on one hand and the
cow sequence of Nārāyaṇa on the other:
![m=\\tfrac{1}{N\_c}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7BN_c%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m=\\tfrac{1}{N_c}"). Thus, the same reciprocal relationship, which we
saw between the Golden ratio, the convergent of the nonlinear Meru
sequence, and the rectification factors of the linear sequences (3) and
(4), is obtained for
![N\_c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"N_c"), the convergent of the dhenu sequence (5), and the linear
sequences H and (2).

Since the Hofstadter H sequence includes all Natural Numbers we ask if
there is any pattern to the occurrence of the dhenu numbers in it. This
relation turns out to be,

![f\[dh\[n\]\] =
dh\[n-1\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bdh%5Bn%5D%5D+%3D+dh%5Bn-1%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[dh[n]] = dh[n-1]")

The same relation also holds for our sequence (2) except that
alternately the values are either
![dh\[n-1\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=dh%5Bn-1%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"dh[n-1]") or
![dh\[n-1\]+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=dh%5Bn-1%5D%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"dh[n-1]+1"). A further interesting observation emerges as we examine
these sequences more closely. The sequence (3) with rectification factor
![m=\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m=\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}") has a fixed bandwidth oscillation ([see figure 5
in previous
article](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/journeying-through-the-fractal-slopes-of-mount-meru-with-two-seeded-recursive-sequences/)).
The H sequence and sequence (2) have a similar type of fixed bandwidth
oscillation. Consistent with this, their recurrence relation and that of
sequence (3) resemble each other with one of the terms being directly
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n")
itself. In contrast, sequence (4), which also has the rectification
factor
![m=\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m=\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}"), shows increasingly larger loops of the size of
the Meru numbers and a fractal structure. Hence, we asked if there is a
similar fractal sequence with
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "m")
same as H and sequence (2). Given that in the recurrence relation (4)
the two terms recursively call the sequence with one having a
subtraction,
![n-f\[f\[n-1\]\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-f%5Bf%5Bn-1%5D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n-f[f[n-1]]"), we looked for similar sequences and found that the
sequence discovered by Mallows has a comparable structure,

![f\[n\]=f\[f\[n-2\]\]+f\[n-f\[n-2\]\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3Df%5Bf%5Bn-2%5D%5D%2Bf%5Bn-f%5Bn-2%5D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[n]=f[f[n-2]]+f[n-f[n-2]]"), where
![f\[1\]=f\[2\]=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B1%5D%3Df%5B2%5D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[1]=f[2]=1") …(6)

Duly, we found that
![m=\\tfrac{1}{N\_c}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7BN_c%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m=\\tfrac{1}{N_c}") serves as a rectification factor for it (Figure 3)
consistent with what we had experimentally determined for the sequence.

[![Mallows\_sequence](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/mallows_sequence.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/mallows_sequence.png)Figure
3

![N\_c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"N_c") and
![\\tfrac{1}{N\_c}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7BN_c%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{1}{N_c}"), unlike
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi"), are not constructible by standard compass and straight-edge
construction. Rather, they need a construction of the type used for the
Delian altar of Apollo, i.e. doubling the cube. It goes thus (Figure 4):

1\) Draw a parabola with focus at ![(.5,
0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28.5%2C+0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(.5, 0)") and directrix as
![y=-\\tfrac{1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D-%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y=-\\tfrac{1}{2}"). This parabola has equation
![y=x^2-x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx%5E2-x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y=x^2-x").  
2\) Draw a rectangular hyperbola with the x- and y-axes as its
asymptotes and
![(1,1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2C1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(1,1)") and
![(-1,-1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-1%2C-1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(-1,-1)") as its vertices. This hyperbola has the equation
![y=\\tfrac{1}{x}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bx%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y=\\tfrac{1}{x}").  
3\) The point of intersection of the two conics, X, gives our desired
constants: ![(N\_c,
\\tfrac{1}{N\_c})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28N_c%2C+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7BN_c%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(N_c, \\tfrac{1}{N_c})").  
4\) Using this and the two conics we can construct a rectangle
![ABCD](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ABCD&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ABCD") comparable to the Golden rectangle.  
5\) Dissecting it using the square of side 1 allows us to construct two
further rectangles: ![ABCD \\sim GCXF \\sim
BEFX](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ABCD+%5Csim+GCXF+%5Csim+BEFX&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ABCD \\sim GCXF \\sim BEFX"). Together these furnish the various powers
of ![N\_c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"N_c") as shown in Figure 4.

[![nArAyaNa\_convergent](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/narayana_convergent.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/narayana_convergent.png)Figure
4

This finally leads to the question of whether this observation regarding
the algebraic number emerging as a convergent of a Nārāyaṇa-type series
and it reciprocal as the rectification factor of a Hofstadter-like
sequence is a more general one. In course of our explorations of
Hofstadter-like sequences we discovered a fractal sequence that we
termed the seahorse sequence ([Figure 12 in the previous
article](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/journeying-through-the-fractal-slopes-of-mount-meru-with-two-seeded-recursive-sequences/)).
This is given by the recurrence relation,

![f\[n\]=f\[f\[f\[n-1\]\]\]+f\[n-f\[f\[n-2\]\]-1\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3Df%5Bf%5Bf%5Bn-1%5D%5D%5D%2Bf%5Bn-f%5Bf%5Bn-2%5D%5D-1%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[n]=f[f[f[n-1]]]+f[n-f[f[n-2]]-1]") …(7)

For this sequence we experimentally established a rectification factor
![m=.45](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D.45&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m=.45"). Using the above-described principle we then identified its
proper form as the real root of the cubic equation
![x^3+2x-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3%2B2x-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^3+2x-1=0"). Thus,
![m=0.4533976515](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D0.4533976515&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m=0.4533976515"). Then we asked if there was a corresponding
Nārāyaṇa-like sequence whose convergent is the reciprocal of
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "m").
Our search yielded the following triply seeded Nārāyaṇa-like sequence
![nl](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=nl&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "nl")
provided by the recurrence relation:

![nl\[n\]=2nl\[n-1\]+nl\[n-3\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=nl%5Bn%5D%3D2nl%5Bn-1%5D%2Bnl%5Bn-3%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"nl[n]=2nl[n-1]+nl[n-3]"), where
![nl\[0\]=nl\[1\]=nl\[2\]=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=nl%5B0%5D%3Dnl%5B1%5D%3Dnl%5B2%5D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"nl[0]=nl[1]=nl[2]=1") …(8)

It goes as 1, 1, 1, 3, 7, 15, 33, 73, 161, 355, 783, 1727, 3809, 8401,
18529, 40867, 90135, 198799, 438465, 967065, 2132929, 4704323… We found
its convergent,

![N\_1= \\displaystyle \\lim\_{n \\to \\infty}
\\dfrac{nl\[n+1\]}{nl\[n\]} \\approx
2.205](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_1%3D+%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7Bnl%5Bn%2B1%5D%7D%7Bnl%5Bn%5D%7D+%5Capprox+2.205&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"N_1= \\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\dfrac{nl[n+1]}{nl[n]} \\approx 2.205")

This allowed us to establish it as the real root of
![x^3-2x^2-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3-2x%5E2-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^3-2x^2-1=0"), thus
![N\_1=2.2055694304006](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_1%3D2.2055694304006&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"N_1=2.2055694304006"). Here again for sequence (7) we get
![m=\\tfrac{1}{N\_1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7BN_1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m=\\tfrac{1}{N_1}"). In addition to these examples there is the trivial
case of sequences [shown in the previous
article](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/journeying-through-the-fractal-slopes-of-mount-meru-with-two-seeded-recursive-sequences/)
where the rectification factor is
![m=0.5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D0.5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m=0.5"). Its reciprocal
![c=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"c=2") corresponds to the trivial duplication sequence: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,
32… Together these four show us that the form of the polynomial
equations for the convergent and its reciprocal are also notable in
their parity:

This leads to a conjecture: The reciprocal of an algebraic number which
is the convergent of a non-linear Nārāyaṇa (Meru/dhenu)-like sequence
serves as a rectification factor for a Hofstadter-like sequence. We have
not attempted to prove this formally but the mathematically minded might
be interested in doing so.

As we saw above, for
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi") and
![N\_c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"N_c") their reciprocals are the rectification factors for two types of
Hofstadter-like sequences, namely one with a fixed bandwidth oscillation
and another with fractal loops of increasing size. In the case of
![N\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"N_1") its reciprocal rectifies the seahorse sequence (7) which is a
fractal sequence. We have not thus far found a fixed bandwidth sequence
rectified by
![\\tfrac{1}{N\_1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7BN_1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{1}{N_1}"). If such a sequence exists then more generally we
might speculate that for each rectification factor there are both fixed
bandwidth and fractal sequences.

In conclusion, we find a remarkable link (to us) between the medieval
mathematics of Nārāyaṇa and the modern mathematics of Douglas
Hofstadter. This yields some interesting results some of which to our
knowledge remains unexplored and unproven in terms of formal proofs.
Notably, unlike the Golden ratio which appears in many places in
mathematics and even in nature, we have not found equivalent occurrences
for ![N\_c,
N\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_c%2C+N_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"N_c, N_1") and their reciprocals. It almost appears as if nature has a
predilection for things constructible by compass and straight-edge.
However, we may note in passing that while writing this article we saw a
recent paper proving a theorem that a number which is related to our
![N\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"N_1"), precisely
![N\_1-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_1-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"N_1-1"), appears in the convergents of the random Fibonacci series of
Divakar Viswanath.
