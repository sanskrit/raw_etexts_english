title = "maitreyaâ€™s atomism"

+++
The bhagavata purANa preserves the 5 anuShTubhs composed by glAva
maitreya, the udgAtA of the kurus, when he was asked about the atomic
doctrine by vidura vaichitravIrya. It contains a clear exposition of the
atomic doctrine. It is interesting that these openly vaisheShika mantras
are preserved along side the more theistic formulation of typical of the
sAMkhya associated with pA\~ncharatra. It may also suggest the source
for the elements of atomism in vaiShNava tantras like the lakShmI
tantraM.

maitreya said:  
The ultimate reality is know to be made of numerous particles, which are
always elemental, called paramANu and it is an error of men to consider
it seen \[existance\] as continuous

These particles indeed comprise all substances, but retain their
structure, even if the substance transforms, these are the eternally
unchanging, original, supreme, indivisible \[existence\].

O great \[vidura\], in the same way time also has its discrete
divisions, which comprise its gross form and this can be measured by the
movement and combination of particles; viShNu is that which is
unmanifest, existing in movement and in potential.

Those discrete units of time, which are verily further indivisible,
correspond to the time required by a paramANu to cover the space
equivalent to a paramANu; this is verily the primal, supreme time.

Two paramANus are combine to form an aNu, and 3 aNus combine to form a
trasareNu\*; the rays of light emerging from a mesh can make these
\[trasareNus\] move up in empty space.

\*This idea follows the nyAya pattern of akshapAda as opposed to that
provided by kaNAda.
