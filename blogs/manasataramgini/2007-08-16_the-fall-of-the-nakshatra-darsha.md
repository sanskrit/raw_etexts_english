title = "The fall of the nakShatra-darshA"

+++
We were coming out of the house of boredom with Blackie and those who
were to be washed away by the flow of dvAdashAnta, like the enemies of
sudAsa on the paruShNi. We saw dIrghadanta hrasvaroman, kulu\~nchaputra
and bR^indAputra moving in the opposite direction. Blackie asked with
characteristic doubt : “O brAhmaNa which is the right path ?” We said: O
kR^iShNa-tvacha your path lies in the yonder region, near the shrine
where the awful tusked son of ambikA sleeps.”  
Verily Blackie never moved much from that place.

….

ST and Mis-creant where contending fiercely with she who is named after
ruru’s wife. But that nakShatra-darshA was one of the fiercest warriors,
verily an Amazon with a sharp bow. Scorched by her arrows ST and
Mis-creant fled in different directions. In one encounter she even
overthrew the 3rd vIra. The third vIra wounded thus was fleeing, even as
his sachiva was struck by a prayoga of trailokya stambhinI. Can a woman
be such a great warrior ? We asked in wonderment seeing the arrows she
rained on the armies of brave archers. Even as we were watching thus,
ekanetra calmly declared with much certainty: “She will fall much like
shveta and uttara in battle. She will not attain eko-mAnuSha AnandaH
like that other nakShatra-darsha.”

Soon enough, a mlechCha hero struck her down with his a\~NkuSha and put
an end to her string of victories. ekanetra smiled to ST and said go
convey the news to the rest. We were touched to see our co-ethnic fall
in battle, and wanted to go to her aid. But wise ekanetra smiled and
said: “I too feel somewhat like you do. But let her be. She has been an
enemy of the dharma in her moha. So let us not shed tears for her,
despite that closeness we might feel.”

ekanetra then smiled and added: “One day she will laugh and we will be
crying. Glory is like a falcon that sits on his shoulder today and on
that one there tommorow. So the Iranian of yore had said.”

….

We felt like Dattaji Shinde on the northern plain;  
by the perverse khANDavans our men lay slain;  
in the clasp of the foes our capital in waste had lain;  
our offerings have the gods decided to spurn?
