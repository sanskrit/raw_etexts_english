## LXIII

*To Mrs. Ole Bull*

C/O MISS DUTCHER  
THOUSAND ISLAND PARK  
N. Y.

*13th* \[*postmarked 11th*\] *July '95*.

DEAR MOTHER,

The shirts arrived yesterday; they are nice and fit me well.

Everybody liked them.

Landsberg arrived this morning with a picture of Shri Ramakrishna.

The Toronto affair has fallen through because the clergyman objected to
a heathen. There is one invitation from the Christian Union of Oak
Beach. I do not know whether I will go there.

As I intend to go to Chicago, in August, I ought to give to the people
here all the time I can.

I do not know yet the exact date when I start \[for Europe\] — but
somewhere at the end of August, I am sure.

Landsberg sends his love to all the rest.

Ever yours in love and gratitude,

VIVEKANANDA
