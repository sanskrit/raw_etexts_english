An updated version of our earlier ramblings first published at:

One of the central problems Hindus face on the intellectual battlefield
is articulating their position vis-a-vis the stances of their
Abrahamistic foes. An important aspect of this problem is the difficulty
faced by many modern Hindus in understanding the contrast between their
system and the exclusivity, belligerence and universalism of
Mohammedanism and cult of Jesus. Thus, we see numerous Hindus taking a
rather apologetic stance with respect to their polytheistic system. They
might even try to deny it by claiming that in reality they are
monotheistic, just as the followers of Mohammed and Jesus. We also see
this tendency in daily life: many Hindus use terminology like “God”, in
a sense similar to that used by the Abrahamists, instead of using their
own rich language full of nuance with terms such as ātman, brahman,
īśvara, or the specific names of deities from their pantheon. In our
opinion the lack of clarity on these issues directly contributes to
their flaccid response to the aggression of the Abrahamistic foes.
Consequently, the use of terminology in an Abrahamistic sense can be
seen as a memetic Trojan horse, left behind by the Mohammedans and
Christians, after their physical conquests were nullified to an extent
by the Hindu fight-back culminating in independence. Hence, we speculate
that the adoption of Abrahamistic terminology in this regard could
actually “soften” the Hindus who do so, and facilitate their fall to the
rampant evangelism of the two Abrahamistic cults in India.

As the great scholar of Indic tradition, śrī Lokesh Chandra explained in
an interview \[Footnote 1\], it is important that India retain and
celebrate its “polycentrism” rather than monotheism, as the former is
the defining feature of our civilization. Indeed, the great sage
uddālaka āruṇi states in the veda:

ekam eva advitīyam | tad aikṣata bahu syām prajāyeya | chandogyopaniṣad
in section 6.2  
It was only one without a second. It willed: “I shall multiply and
reproduce as many.”

Thus, in the in the Hindu system the one is seen as becoming many. Here
the arrow of causation accepts and emphasizes the emergence of
multiplicity as being the natural order. This is contrary to the
Abrahamistic system of monotheism where the unitary deity is defined by
exclusion of all others. Thus, the multiplicity, which was the natural
state in the pre-Abrahamistic Afro-Asiatic heathen systems of West Asia,
was force-fitted to a single standard. The multiplicity inherent in the
Hindu system is consonant with the nature of existence itself: At the
origin of the universe, in the earliest period, the unitary force
manifested as the four forces of nature. Likewise, unitary matter
manifested as particles with a multiplicity of masses, charges,
‘colors’, spins and other properties. Analogously, emergence of
multiplicity characterizes life, where all its diversity, with manifold
organisms including ourselves, has emerged from a single ancestral
organism through the process of reproduction (“bahu syām prajāyeya”).

Hence, the ṛṣi gṛtsamada śaunahotra states:  
yo apsv ā śucinā daivyena ṛtāvājasra urviyā vibhāti |  
vayā id anyā bhuvanāny asya pra jāyante vīrudhaś ca prajābhiḥ || ṛgveda
2.35.8  
All other beings are, as it were, branches of him, the plants, with
their progeny, are born (of him), who, imbued with the natural law
(ṛta), eternal, and widely-spreading, shines amid the waters with pure
and divine (radiance).

Similarly, the veda states:  
ajāyamāno bahudhā vijāyate | taittirīya+āraṇyaka in 3.13.1  
The unborn is multiply born (i.e. the unmanifest manifests multiply).

Thus, for the Hindu the multiplicity of forms and the unmanifest are not
a contradiction. Rather the direction of causation again emphasizes the
emergence of a multiplicity of forms from what is unmanifest or not
undergoing birth. This is again in contradiction to Abrahamistic
thought, which rails and rants against form, leading to iconoclastic
urges that seek to destroy all heathen depictions of divinities in
diverse forms. Here again, the Hindu system is consonant with nature:
from the incredibly dense singularity (i.e. the unmanifest) the universe
with all its forms originated. From unmanifest instructions in genes and
proteins present in a single-celled zygote a whole organism with a
multiplicity of cell types can emerge via repeated reproduction. Thus,
via its unitary emphasis and proscription of the manifestation of
multiplicity, Abrahamistic thought is like a still-born embryo where the
zygote never proceeded beyond the single-celled stage.

The heathens have had a long and sophisticated history of analyzing the
basic philosophical question in this regard. The core of this question
tackled both by Hindu and early Greek philosophies was what can be
termed “the many-one problem”. One way of stating it is that there are
many identical, similar or congruent entities, that just appear to be
multiple manifestations of one single prototype. So how do we deal with
the multiplicity while recognizing the unifying principle within them?
In Sanskrit grammar we can reduce the various expressions of language to
a relatively small set of prototypical rules – this was the means by
which the great pāṇini formulated his monumental grammar. Similarly, we
can classify the diversity of organisms to a few prototypes based on the
principle of homology. Thus, many can be explained as few. Next, one
might logically ask if this can be taken to the minimal prototype (may
be just one), which is the foundational reality, but at the same time
also explain the multiplicity logically rather than deny, exclude or
proscribe it as is typical of Abrahamistic monotheism. To this end the
Hindus applied themselves diligently.

The analysis of this question lies at the origin of one of the pillars
of Hindu thought and religion – sāṃkhya-yoga. sāṃkhya emerges in
“thought-matrix” of the upaniṣad-s: in section 6.13 of the
śvetāśvatara+upaniṣad we hear that sāṃkhya is the basis of mokṣa.
i.e., the soteriological conclusion of the realization of the unifying
principle. The essential premise of the sāṃkhya-class of explanations
for the many-one problem derives from a concept termed māyā, which goes
back to the ancient Indo-Aryan past. Knowing māyā is knowing the ways of
the deva-s\! The deva-s exhibit māyā: thus, their one true or prototypic
form appears in many diverse forms. This is true of indra in the ṛgveda.
There the ṛṣi viśvāmitra says:

rūpam-rūpaṃ maghavā bobhavīti māyāh kṛnvānas tanuvaṃ pari svāṃ |(RV
3.53.8).  
maghavan (indra) transforms into form after form, effecting the display
of māyā around his own body.

In the itihāsa-s, viṣṇu and rudra put forth their māyā to assume many
forms. In the purāṇa corpus this māyā is the great goddess māhākālī also
called yoga-māyā. Thus, right from the beginning the term māyā appears
to have implied the means by which the deva or dānava creates many forms
which “veil” the underlying primal form. Thus, one Hindu approach to the
“many-one” problem appears to have been a logical extension of this idea
to describe the universe itself. Hence, in sāṃkhya we have the one
puruṣa associating with prakṛti, who acting like the principle of māyā
creates a multiplicity that is seen as the universe. This connection
between the māyā of deva-s and sāṃkhya theory is very palpable in an
explanation of universe offered in an exposition of sāṃkhya in the
mahābhārata:

apāṃ phenopamaṃ lokaṃ viṣṇor māyā śatair vṛtam |  
citta-bhitti pratīkāśaṃ nala sāram anarthakam || (Mbh-”critical”
12.290.57)  
The universe is like the foam of water enveloped by hundreds of māyā-s
of viṣṇu, like an illusory wall and ephemeral as sap in a \[hollow\]
reed.

The use of māyā by deva-s leads to yoga, which was originally seen as a
system of praxis involving the direct application of sāṃkhya principles.
Evidence for this is abundant in the itihāsa-s and purāṇa-s. One of the
most famous expressions of this, known to most Hindus, is the statement
of kṛṣṇa in the bhagavad gītā:

nāhaṃ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ |  
mūḍho’yaṃ nābhijānāti loko mām-ajam-avyayaṃ || (BG7.25)  
I am not manifest to all, veiled by the māyā of my yoga. This deluded
world \[i.e. entrapped by the display of māyā\] knows not me, unborn and
unlimited.

A more palpable application of māyā displayed via yoga is described in
the mahābhārata, when at sunset on the fourteenth day of the Great War,
devakī-putra turning to arjuna says: “arjuna, I have obscured the sun by
the means of my yoga and the kaurava-s think it has set. Kill
jayadratha\!”

Another poignant expression of the fact that the application of yoga is
essentially the same as the display of māyā is suggested by the story of
the ancient bhārgava sage uśanas kāvya given in mahābhārata 12.278
(“critical edition”). kāvya was enraged with the deva-s because viṣṇu
had beheaded his mother, who was a partisan of the asura-s. kāyva used
his yoga to enter into kubera, the yakṣa who was the treasurer of the
deva-s and stole his wealth. Furious, kubera went to rudra and told him
that kāvya used his yoga to enter his \[kubera\]’s body and having
robbed him of his wealth came out of it and escaped. rudra, himself of
supreme yoga power, raised his dreaded trident and sought kāvya with the
intention of striking him. kāvya realized from a distance the intention
of rudra of superior yoga powers and wondered whether he should flee or
try some other trick. Then using his mighty yoga, uśanas kāvya, the
prefect and physician of the daitya-s, became small and went and sat on
the tip of rudra’s trident. Unable to use his weapon he bent it with his
arms to make it into the pināka bow\! At this point uśanas fell into
śiva’s hand, who promptly swallowed him and returned to perform his
meditative yoga. The bhārgava wandered endlessly in rudra’s stomach and
was absorbed into his body. As śiva had shut all his outlets in practice
of yoga, he was unable to find an exit. Unable to escape he repeatedly
worshiped the terrible mahādeva, who asked him to emerge from his semen.
Thus, did the bhṛgu drop out. When rudra saw him he raised his trident
to kill him. But umā intervened and asked him to spare the brāhmaṇa’s
life.

The point of note here is that the famous bhārgava magic of
parakāya-praveśa is effected by means of yoga, which is parallel to the
ability of deva-s to exhibit māyā transforming their bodies into many
forms. This is further clarified in the great itihāsa in course of the
description of yoga:

brahmāṇam-īśam varadaṃ ca viṣṇum  
bhavaṃ ca dharmaṃ ca ṣaḍānanaṃ ca  
so brahmaputrāṃś-ca mahānubhāvān || 58  
tamaś-ca kaṣṭaṃ sumahad-rajaś-ca  
sattvaṃ ca śuddhaṃ prakṛtiṃ parāṃ ca  
siddhiṃ ca devīṃ varuṇasya patnīṃ  
tejaśca kṛtsnaṃ sumahac-ca dhairyaṃ || 59  
narādhipaṃ vai vimalaṃ satāraṃ  
viśvāṃś-ca devān uragān pitṝṃś ca  
śailāṃś-ca kṛtsnānudadhīṃś-ca ghorān  
nadīś-ca sarvāḥ savanan ghanāṃś-ca || 60  
nāgān-nagān-yakṣa-gaṇān-diśaś-ca  
gandharva-saṅghān-puruṣān-striyaś-ca |  
parasparaṃ prāpya mahān-mahātmā  
viśeta yogī nacirādvimuktaḥ || 61 MBh(12.289.58-61)  
The high-souled yogin filled with greatness, at will, can enter into and
come out of, brahmā the lord of all, the boon-giving viṣṇu, bhava,
dharma, the six-faced kumāra, the sons of brahmā, tamas that results in
trouble, rajas, sattva, the mahat and the pure, primordial prakṛtī, the
goddess siddhi – the wife of varuṇa, the all-encompassing energy,
courage, the king, the sky with the stars, the universe, celestial
snakes, the ancestor-spirits, mountains, all terrible oceans, all
rivers, thick forests, serpents, plants, yakṣa bands, the directions
gandharva bands, and both males and females.

Thus it is clear the yoga was precisely the practical means of
“effecting māyā” — the yogin could literally enter into all possible
rūpa-s. We also see that it was described as a means of entering
prakṛti, which is (the cause of) māyā.

As the great scholar Ganganath Jha remarked sāmkhya and yoga appear to
be two faces of the same darśana. The former stands for the siddhānta or
the theoretical framework and the latter for the practical means of
achieving it. The earliest notable discoveries in terms of the practical
means that characterize yoga were made by the Indo-Aryans probably in
the late brāhmaṇa period of the Vedic age. One discovery was that there
was something unique about the problem of consciousness and that it
could be tackled in a special way by transcending the subject-object
distinction. The second discovery was that this issue of consciousness
could be understood only by some special physiologically alterations
connected to the nervous system. We have no clear evidence whether these
discoveries were known before or not – while some of the methods could
go back to human antiquity, at least some of the background knowledge
probably derived from the medical investigations of the atharvaveda. The
second of these discoveries led to the primitive “kuṇḍalini system” and
a precursor of what later came to be known as the khecarī mudra. The
earliest traces to these system in the late brāhmaṇa period are seen in
the ideas of the bhārgava prācinayogya in the taittirīya śruti and
yājñavalkya in the vājasaneyi śruti. It was further developed in the
bhṛgu smṛti \[Footnote 2\]. A subsequent preliminary synthesis of the
different themes under an overarching framework was attempted by
patañjali. However, his system was mainly an attempt to present yoga as
an independent darśana by incorporating a slightly modified form of
sāṃkhya as its internal siddhānta. The real task of a grand
synthesis, which brought together various themes into a comprehensive
system of practice was seen in the tantra-s. Here, in addition to the
multifaceted development of the traditions of physical practice, the
“kuṇḍalini” and “khecarī mudra” systems were brought together with
the other ancient Hindu tradition of the mantra-śāstra. Credit in this
regard goes to the great matsyendra, the fisherman-teacher, who wove the
different strands into the great tantric synthesis. This was indeed one
of the greatest achievements of Hindu thought, where the many and one
are seamlessly integrated, something which is much neglected by many
modern theoretical students of Hindu thought.
