Something which has long played upon my mind is a most curious
discrepancy between the Nordic mythology – and seemingly every other
Indo-European canon of belief.  
The subject of this purported disunity? The Dragon-Slaying of the
Thunderer-Striker Deific.

For as everybody knows – in the major, indeed downright iconic cases of
Indra contra Vritra or Herakles against the Hydra … these are events
which are said to have already occurred in the escalatingdistant
past.  
Yet when it comes to the Scandinavian Striker/Thunderer, Thor, His
successful combat is said to take place in the
(perhaps-not-all-that-)far distant future – at Ragnarok: the War at the
End of Time.

There IS an earlier encounter, wherein Thor manages to fish up the
Encircling World-Serpent – however, while the demonic beast struggles
mightily, and the mighty God exerts no less furious force … the combat
is said to be ultimately inconclusive. A matter deferred to the End of
Days.

Or is it …

The Gylfaginning phrases it thus:

“In the very moment when Thor clutched his hammer and raised it on high,
then the giant fumbled for his fish-knife and hacked off Thor’s line at
the gunwale, and the Serpent sank down into the sea. Thor hurled his
hammer after it; and men say that he struck off its head against the
bottom; but I think it were true to tell thee that the Midgard Serpent
yet lives and lies in the encompassing sea. But ‘Thor swung his fist and
brought it against Hymir’s ear, so that he plunged overboard, and Thor
saw the soles of his feet. And Thor waded to land.”

So as we can see, there is an acknowledgement in the scriptural
presentations of Sturluson for at least some ambiguity to the matter.
Or, rather, an acknowledgement that the dominant mythic recounting
amidst the Germanics was that Thor had indeed decapitated Jormungandr –
which Sturluson seeks to refute by placing words in the mouth of the
certain Great God to whom Gylfi is speaking.

Why might he have done this? Well, I am often loathe to presume that
this or that seemingly curious element to Sturluson’s effort is the
direct result of creeping Christianization – but in this instance,
deferring the combat to the Apocalypse may indeed be just exactly that.
The Revelations (‘Apocalypse’ in another language) at the Last Days of
the World per John on Patmos most certainly do entail a great Serpent
arising from the Sea as an essential, adversarial ingredient. And even
if this were not the ultimate inspiration for Sturluson’s recasting of
the event – it cannot be denied that there is something resonant in the
manner that at the Final Battle, the Dragon is slain and not before … in
a manner which also happens to slay, in exactly the same fashion as it
attempts to do so here (i.e. with poison-breath), its vanquisher.  
  
There is, we may say – both a ‘symmetry’ and a ‘finality’ to the
Sturluson-sourced account.

Yet while I do not dispute that there is an *underlying* truth to this
setup – based around the strong and increasingly escalant immanency of
evil and iniquity within the universe as we slouch toward the point at
which setting the entire world afire counts as a net improvement … it
presents some obvious problems for us in a comparative Indo-European
theological sense.  
  
And so it was therefore with great reassurance that I found the account
in the Husdrapa, whilst – as is my way – looking for something
completely different. For there, we have something completely different
in itsconclusions. Which does most definitely accord with several of
the salient details cited by Sturluson in the Gylfaginning presentation
– yet which is much less ambiguous as to its immediate outcome.

To quote in the Old Norse:

“Víðgymnir laust Vimrar  
vaðs af frônum naðri  
hlusta grunn við hrǫnnum.”

Which, to translate from the millennia-ancient ecclesiastical language
in question – gives us :

“The Wide-Wader of the ford of Vimur struck the ground of the ears
\[i.e. the Head\] off the gleaming serpent into the waves.”  
  
This is in reasonable accord with another pre-Sturluson accounting which
has come down to us of the deed – that of Gamli Gnævaðarskáld:  
  
“Meðan gramr, hinns svik samðit,  
snart Bilskirnis, hjarta,  
grundar fisk með grandi  
gljúfrskeljungs nam rjúfa.”

Or, in translation –

“While the ruler of Bilskirnir \[i.e. Thor\], the one who did not plan
treachery in his heart, quickly smashed the fish of the sea-bed \[i.e.
Jormungand\] with the destruction of the gully-whale \[i.e.
Mjolnir\].”  
  
There is also a potential ‘missing line’ in verse 25 of theHymiskviða
immediately prior to Jormungandr sinking to the bottom and following the
serpent roaring in pain at being struck, where a Smiting in the more
lethal sense

But let us bring things back to this Husdrapa account – for there are
several other elements within it of salient interest to us from a
comparative Indo-European mythological view.

The first of these concerns the immediately preceding lines of the
Husdrapa verse in question –

“Fullǫflugr lét fellir  
fjall-Gauts hnefa skjalla  
— ramt mein vas þat — reyni  
reyrar leggs við eyra.”

Translated:

“The most powerful feller of the mountain-Gautrlet his fist slam
against the ear of the tester of the bone of the reed \[alt.trns: ‘log
of the reed’\]; that was a mighty injury.”

This is a curious verse, and there is considerable scholarly debate as
to just who is doing what here, and unto whom. Some say that it is
Hymir, Thor’s companion in the boat, who is being recompensed for daring
to cut the line which had raised Jormungand (a detail interestingly not
mentioned in the Husdrapa account as it has come down to us). Others
suggest that it is the World-Serpent which suffers this grievous
injury.  
  
The adjacent characterization of the struck party as “the tester of the
bone of the reed” adds little in the way of clarity to matters.

The ‘Mountain-Gautr’ element is even less understood – with many
ascribing it a meaning of ‘Stone-Giant/Mountain-Giant’ due to the role
of ‘Gautr’ underpinning various Germanic ethnonyms … although it has
been acknowledged that this is a rather awkward fit, especially in light
of the more usually encountered Gaut figure and the associated etymology
for same – Odin Himself, and the terms for the pouring of libations
\[Proto-Germanic – Geutana; the sense of a Goði, a priest, is also most
relevant here – both for Odin specifically and in general terms\].

Predictably, I have a different view.  
  
In the course of the Vedas, we frequently find the Mountain invoked as a
metaphoric rendering for the Press-Stones with which Soma is extracted
from the stems of the Soma plant. I have earlier demonstrated this
understanding to be similarly preserved (uncoincidentally, in relation
to Odin and His Deeds and venturings) amidst the Norse via the
Hnitbjorg(‘Clashing Rocks’/Opening Mountain)conceptrybetween which
the Mead of Poetry is to be sourced. When the stalk in question is
pressed, the libation of the Soma juice is enabled to flow forth.
Something which is directly associated in the Vedic poetic perception
with the Strength of Indra (utilized to slay Vritra), indeed to the
point of occasional understandable direct conflation stating Soma is
what strikes down Vritra.  
  
‘Fellir’, as in ‘feller’ – to cause to fall – has obvious saliency for
‘slayer’, yet there is a rendering inEilífr Goðrúnarson’s Þórsdrápa
which renders this instead as “prepares”. Whether “Prepares” or “Exerts
crushing force”, I do not think it hard to see how the pulverization of
the stem of the plant would be a logical deployment for such a term.
Particularly when it comes to utilizing ‘press-stones’ (the ‘tester’, or
‘explorer’ of the contents of the reed in question).

The ‘most powerful’ exerterof the force in such a manner, which brings
forth the libation in question \[‘Gautr’ – that which pours forth\],
would assumedly be a quite potent Priest – a scenario which would fit
with the accompaniment of Indra in His Vritra-smiting endeavours by
either of Brihaspati/Agni/Vayu \[aka Odin – c.f my earlier works
demonstrating direct scriptural concordances in these regards; and
recalling also Odin as Gaut, for reasons that are now plainly apparent\]
or Trita Aptya (a more human Priest). Tellingly, we frequently find
Indra accompanied by Parvata \[that is to say Mountain\] upon His
adventures, as well – with the ‘Parvata’ in question plausibly meaning
either or both those aforementioned Press-Stones, and/or the Sky Father
deific acting as Their employer or in the similar guise to the Axis
Mundi (the World-Mountain – or, if we were speaking in Old Norse terms,
a certain Yggr-related Tree).  
  
The pattern of there being *two* (male) Dragonslayers making use of an
otherwise overtly pious element to carry out the deed is not confined to
the Vedas, either – Iolaus being guided by Athena to utilize Fire in the
course of the Hydra-slaying also fits this typology, for example.  
  
Although the association of Hymir (Thor’s companion in the vessel upon
the water), presents further intriguing resonancies. Other than the fact
that there is a brewing-vessel under his ownership (something we should
perhaps expect with relation to the production of the empowering elixir,
for reasons that should be fairly directly apparent), there is the most
curious situation in theHymiskviða of Hymir being presented as Tyr’s
father – which upon the surface would seem to contrast rather heavily
with Tyr being regarded as Odin’s Son. A contradiction which can be
easily resolved if we presume that it is in fact no contradiction at all
– and that Hymir’s goading reactions to Thor are broadly in the spirit
of the rivalry expressed between the disguised Odin and His Son
inHárbarðsljóð.

Now I may, perhaps, be accused of decontextualizing this one verse in
order to highlight a potential Vedic parallel which does not fit with
the broader presentation of the relevant mythic encounter in the Nordic
texts. Except that’s just the thing – the incredibly fragmentary state
of the Husdrapa means that it is almost, by default, decontextualized.
We are only able to tie verses together upon the fact that they’re
stated to be by the relevant author (or, in one case, inferred to be) in
the relevant poem – there is ample room for occurrences, surrounding
contextual information being omitted in those portions of the poem which
have not come down to us.  
  
A third detail of interest for us from the Husdrapa concerns
thisVíðgymnir epithet of Thor. Ostensibly, this directly connects to
another quite specific Thor myth – that of the fording of the Vimur
River during the course of Thor’s pursuit ofGeirröðr. However, I have
reason to believe that this, too, is a broader Indo-European typology
finding oblique expression via now-barely-understood kenning form. There
are a few competing theories as to whatVíðgymnir is actually supposed
to mean. Víðr should likely mean ‘Wide’, and thusly informs either the
‘Giant’ interpretation, or the ‘Wide-Wader’ one. I suspect that the
latter has the right of it, upon the basis of RV VIII 100 12’s
description of the ‘Wide Stride’ of Vishnu, a characteristic also
attested via the ‘Urukramah’ epithet of that figure. Vishnu (and more
especially Krishna), I have long suspected to harbour decisive elements
of the Indo-European Striker/Thunderer deific – including, in a rather
prominent encounter, a Dragon-subduing upon the waters \[c.f my earlier
work “Perseus , Krishna , Karna – Three Perspectives Upon The Origin
Myth Of The Indo-European Striker/Thunderer”\]. RV VIII 100, of course,
being also quite salient for this Nordic encounter with the Demon Dragon
in question, as it presents Indra accompanied by an unspecified
“comrade” in the course of His dragon-slaying venture, with the
‘wide-step’ in question undertaken (or at least mentioned) immediately
prior to the Smiting is to ensue. In other words – exactly where it is
in its Husdrapa context.  
  
To add to these, a fourth – that mention of the Reed has another
potential (albeit non-exclusive) explication. This is not the place to
get into the underlying meaning of them (which may accord with the
notion of the ‘power’ of the Thunder God being housed within), but
suffice to say that in both the Hindu and also intriguingly the Armenian
Indo-European renderings of the myth of the dragon-slaying
Striker/Thunderer – we find this aforementioned deity taking up
residence within the stalk of a lotus or reed respectively. It is
mentioned here due to another detail which unifies these varying
accounts somewhat.  
  
In the Armenian account of Vahagn (as in, Vritraghna – the Smiter of
Vritra), it is phrased thusly:

“The labour in the sea seized a red reed. Along the reed stalk smoke
ascended; along the reed stalk fire ascended. And out of the fire leapt
a golden-haired boy. He had fiery hair and a fiery beard, and his eyes
were little suns.”

A ‘fiery beard’, eh? Gosh, now Who does *that* remind one of!

Quoth the Husdrapa:

“Innmáni skein ennis  
ǫndótts vinar banda;  
ôss skaut œgigeislum  
orðsæll á men storðar.”

Translation:

“The interior-moon of the forehead \[i.e. the Eye\] of the Gods’ fierce
friend \[i.e. Thor\] shone; the renowned God shot terror-beams at the
necklace of the earth \[i.e. Jormungandr\].”  
  
This is corroborated via the Gylfaginning’spresentation of the
episode:

“And it may be said that no one has seen very fearful sights who might
not see that: bow Thor flashed fiery glances at the Serpent”  
  
There is quite an array of conceptry for rather powerful and luminous
eye-beams resultant from the investiture of the divine energy of the
Furor – Diomedes, granted the Menos-power by Athena, presents with
Flaming visage about His helmet as the dulling mist is lifted from His
Eyes, and it is similar with regard to Achilles. To quote directly from
the Iliad:

“Howbeit, when Achilles saw the arms,  
then came wrath upon him yet the more,  
and his eyes blazed forth in terrible wise  
from beneath their lids, as it had been flame;  
and he was glad as he held in his arms the glorious gifts of the god.”  
\[…\]  
“when Athena had dropped Nectar and Ambrosia into Achilles  
so that no cruel hunger should cause his limbs to fail him,  
She went back to the house of Her mighty Father.

\[…\] he gnashed his teeth, his eyes gleamed like fire,  
for his grief was greater than he could bear.  
Thus, then, full of fury against the Trojans,  
did he don the Gift of the God,  
the armor that Hephaistos had made him.”  
Read that second swathe again – Achilles samples of the Empowering
Elixir, and in a mighty rage, “his eyes gleamed like fire”.

We know that the Indo-European Striker/Thunderer consumes the Empowering
Elixir prior to wading forth into warfare with the Demon Dragon of the
Waters (the RV VIII 100 hymnal aforementioned is prominent in its direct
description of this up-arming). We know that this is described, it would
appear, in terms pertaining to the Eyes of the mighty figure ‘lighting
up’ with terrific radiancy. I do not mean to propose Achilles as an
instance of the Striker/Thunderer typology – only to observe that via
the triangulation afforded to us of the Iliad, the Armenian epic
aforequoted from, and other such conceptry … that this would appear to
support rather strongly the idea of Thor’s evident Terrifying Gaze of
celestial energy, is also similarly resultant from the imbibing of the
Empowering Elixir.  
  
Or, in other words, its position immediately prior to the actual
Dragon-Slaying carried out by Thor in the Husdrapa, and also
theoretically proximate to this Reed/Stalk business, further supports
that the Husdrapa account is in fact a quite close resonancy with the
broader and underlying Indo-European typology to the myth in
question.  
  
And by that I mean that it appears to contain elements which had fallen
out of some of the later Eddic presentations of the tale – the major
instances of which being, of course, somewhat ‘hack-job’ presentations
drawing together and editorializing in decidedly imperfect manner, the
contributions of earlier generations of Skalds.

Now does this mean that the original Husdrapa, in its fully-expansive
rather than merely excerpted-from format may have included verses in
which Thor drank an Empowering Elixir immediately prior to sailing out
into the wide-gulfs of the world to slay the Serpent? I am not sure. We
simply cannot tell based around the limited material that has come down
to us. Although there is certainly reasonable support for an endeavour
to link the preceding occurrences of theHymiskviða to the ritual
preparation for the brew at the ‘Feast of the Gods’ in our more familiar
Vedic context (as entailed, again, in RV VIII 100). And that
‘Wide-Wading’ epithet, likewise, seems too close in its occurrence to
the last lines of RV VIII 100, with the ‘Mountain-Gautr’ too otherwise
inexplicable via the more frequently encountered attempts-at-rendering
to be anything other than what we find in the comparative Vedic
expressionism.  
  
I am occasionally accused of having a totalitarian approach to these
matters – downright mono-myopic (that is to say – ‘one-eyed’) in my
perspective – as applies re-viewing various other Indo-European mythic
accounts which seem to me to be obviously ‘incomplete’ via the Vedic
lense that comes most natively to me. Yet I do feel it quite clearly the
case that our extant ability to *read* these fragmentary or bowdlerized
later Germanic texts in the absence of the actual original Skaldic forms
in something approaching their entirety, is contingent upon bringing
these other, non-Germanic sources to bear upon what has come down to us
as well.

After all – even if it is disputed that the precise illustrations of the
occurrences as found in these Eddic materials are close 1:1 parallels of
those found in the far more ancient Vedic verses and ritualine
metaphysics … it absolutely cannot be disputed that the events they
record are indeed the fundamental same.  
  
Ever since the Urheimat, it has been known that there is the Encircling
\[‘Vritra’\] Demon-Dragon of the Waters.

And ever since the Urheimat, it has been known likewise that there is
the Striker/Thunderer Deific Who Slays Him.

Ever since the serious application of the developments of Indo-European
linguistics and comparative mythology to the Germanic sphere, it has
also been known that Thor is this Striker/Thunderer – and
correspondingly, that Jormungand is this Serpent who is to be Slain.

Now, we can say with great surety thanks to the more comprehensive
application of these above-aforementioned rubricae:

That Jormungandr Is Undone!

And it is Thor Who Has Done It!

Therefore, upon this Thursday – Thorsday – we Hail to the Indo-European
Striker/Thunderer!

Jai Vritrahan  
Hail Hydra-Slayer  
Hail Thor !
