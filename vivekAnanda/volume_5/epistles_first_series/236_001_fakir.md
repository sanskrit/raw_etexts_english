## I

(Translated from [Bengali](b6022_23e5001.htm) )

ALLAHABAD  
*5th January, 1890*.

MY DEAR FAKIR, (Shri Yajneshwar Bhattacharya)

. . . A word for you. Remember always, I may not see you again. Be
moral. Be brave. Be a heart-whole man. Strictly moral, brave unto
desperation. Don't bother your head with religious theories. Cowards
only sin, brave men never, no, not even in mind. Try to love anybody and
everybody. Be a *man* and try to make those immediately under your care,
namely Ram, Krishnamayi, and Indu, brave, moral, and sympathising. No
religion for you, my children, but morality and bravery. No cowardice,
no sin, no crime, no weakness — the rest will come of itself. . . . And
don't take Ram with you ever or ever allow him to visit a theatre or any
enervating entertainment whatever. 

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.

MY DEAR RAM, KRISHNAMAYI, AND INDU,

Bear in mind, my children, that only cowards and those who are weak
commit sin and tell lies. The brave are always moral. Try to be moral,
try to be brave, try to be sympathising.

Yours,  
VIVEKANANDA.
