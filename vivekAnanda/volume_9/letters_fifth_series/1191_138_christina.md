## CXXXVIII

*To Sister Christine*

THE MATH, BELUR,  
DIST. HOWRAH, BENGAL, INDIA,

*10th May 1899*.

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,

I am getting better again. In my mind the whole of my complaint is bad
assimilation of food and nervous exhaustion. The first, I am taking care
of; the second will completely pass off when I meet you again. The great
joy of meeting old, old friends, you know! Cheer up! There is no cause
for anxiety. Do not believe a single desponding line I write now,
because I am at times not myself. I get so nervous.

I start this summer for Europe anyway, as you say in America. With all
love and blessings,

Yours ever in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.
