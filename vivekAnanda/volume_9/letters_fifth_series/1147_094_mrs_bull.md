## XCIV

*To Mrs. Ole Bull*

63 ST. GEORGE'S ROAD, LONDON, S.W.

*6th July 1896*

DEAR MRS. BULL —

I have sent to Mr. Leggett by last mail the power of attorney, and, as
you desired, this is to notify you of the fact and absolve you from the
responsibilities of the power of attorney which I gave you in America
last year.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA

Saradananda and Goodwin have arrived, I am sure, by this time. I have a
nice letter from Dr. Jain \[Dr. Lewis G. Janes\]. I am going to
Switzerland for a vacation in a few days. I mean to stay there a month
or more. I will return to London in the next fall. I do not know when I
go back to India.

Things are growing nicely here.

With love to all,

 

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA
