title = "Early Hindu mathematics and the exploration of some second degree indeterminate equations"

+++
The following is merely a record of our exploration as a
non-mathematician/non-computer scientist of a remarkable (at least to
us) class of numerical relationships.

An equation like
![x^2-x-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2-x-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^2-x-1=0") can be solved to obtain specific solutions as:
![x=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2},\\;\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%2B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%7D%7B2%7D%2C%5C%3B%5Cfrac%7B1-%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2},\\;\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}"). However, if we
have an equation like then
![437x+592y=298374](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=437x%2B592y%3D298374&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"437x+592y=298374") it is termed indeterminate as it has no unique set
of solutions. Rather the values of the variables satisfying it define a
curve in a space with as many dimensions as the number of variables,
which in the above case is a straight line on a plane. However, if we
constrain the solutions to being integers we get specific, though
sometimes infinite solutions. This constraint essentially reduces the
problem to finding the points on the curve that lie on a fixed lattice.
Further, if we add the constraint that the solutions should be positive
then we can come down to a limited set of solutions, like for the above
equation of the line we have ![(x=126,
y=411)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D126%2C+y%3D411%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x=126, y=411)") as lying on the integer lattice in the positive
quadrant. Such integral solutions to indeterminate equations are
referred to in western and thereby in modern mathematics as Diophantine
equations after the yavana mathematician Diophantos.

However, Hindu tradition has one of the deepest histories of the
analysis of such indeterminate equations. The earliest studies go back
to the ritual vedī-s of the Yajurveda and they find mention in the
problems of the śulbasūtra-s. This suggests that the Hindu interest in
them arose in the context of ritual. Similarly, Proclus, Diophantos and
Archimedes before him were likely building on a Pythagorean base,
suggesting that such problems might have existed in the ancestral ritual
tradition of both the yavana-s and ārya-s. Already in the Yajurveda
tradition we encounter such indeterminate equations of the linear form
and also those resulting in the bhujā-koṭi-karṇa (known in the west as
Pythagorean) triples (see below). It is also likely that the adhvaryu-s
used an equation of the form
![x^2=2y^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%3D2y%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^2=2y^2+1") to obtain the solutions ![(x=577,
y=408)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D577%2C+y%3D408%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x=577, y=408)") to obtain the value of ![\\sqrt{2} \\approx
1+\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{3}\\times\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{3}\\times
\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{34} =
\\frac{577}{408}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D+%5Capprox+1%2B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%2B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%5Ctimes%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%5Ctimes+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D+%5Ctimes+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B34%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B577%7D%7B408%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1+\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{3}\\times\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{3}\\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{34} = \\frac{577}{408}")
correct to 5 decimal places. That this was the case is supported by the
commentary of the great Nīlakaṇṭha somayājin who notes that the factor
17 in the denominator of the śulbasūtra value comes from ![17^2=2
\\times
12^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=17%5E2%3D2+%5Ctimes+12%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"17^2=2 \\times 12^2+1"). In the post-Vedic period the analysis of
indeterminate equations was advanced further. We learn in the teachings
of: 1) Āryabhaṭa of the kuṭṭaka algorithm for linear indeterminate
equations. 2) Brahmagupta and his successors Jayadeva and Bhāskara-II of
the algorithms to solve certain degree 2 indeterminate equations. 3)
Nārāyaṇa a general summary of these equations and their applications
(his text the Gaṇita-kaumudi).

Of the degree 2 indeterminate equations, integral solutions of those of
the form
![x^2=ay^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%3Day%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^2=ay^2+1") where
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a") is
an integer were of greatest interest to the Hindus. As we saw above such
an equation with
![a=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=2") might have been used by seers of the Yajurveda to approximate
![\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{2}"). Looking at this equation some things become immediately
clear. For ![(x=1,
y=0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D1%2C+y%3D0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x=1, y=0)") we get a trivial solution which is true for all
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a").
If ![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a")
is a perfect square then
![ay^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ay%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ay^2+1") will never be a perfect square so we have no solutions beyond
the trivial one. If
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a") is
not a perfect square we could potentially have infinite solutions
because at some point
![ay^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ay%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ay^2+1") is free to become a perfect square. This can be easily
understood geometrically: The equation
![x^2-ay^2=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2-ay%5E2%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^2-ay^2=1") defines a family of hyperbolas (Figure 1). Integral
solutions will occur where ever the hyperbola passes through the integer
lattice. From the equation we can deduce that one of the two asymptotes
of the hyperbola is
![y=\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{a}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cfrac%7Bx%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7Ba%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y=\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{a}}"). If
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a") is
a perfect square then the asymptote will pass through points on the
integer lattice but beyond the trivial case the hyperbola will never
pass through the points on the lattice. However, if
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a") is
not a perfect square then
![\\sqrt{a}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Ba%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{a}") will be irrational. Hence, as the hyperbola converges
towards it asymptote, each time it passes through a lattice point
![\\frac{x}{y}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bx%7D%7By%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\frac{x}{y}") will be a closer and closer approximation of
![\\sqrt{a}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Ba%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{a}").

[![chakravala\_hyperbola](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/chakravala_hyperbola.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/chakravala_hyperbola.png)Figure
1

For the particular case
![x^2=2y^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%3D2y%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^2=2y^2+1") there is a special significance that links arithmetic to
geometry. The sum of integers is given by the formula presented by sage
Śākapūṇi in Vedic antiquity:  
![1+2+3...n \\Rightarrow \\sum \\limits\_1^n i
=\\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2B2%2B3...n+%5CRightarrow+%5Csum+%5Climits_1%5En+i+%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bn%28n%2B1%29%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"1+2+3...n \\Rightarrow \\sum \\limits_1^n i =\\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}")  
By laying the integers as equidistant points on successive rows we get
an equilateral triangle lattice with the sum up to the nth integer
completing the next equilateral triangle (Figure 2). Hence these sums
are known as triangular numbers.

[![triangular\_numbers](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/triangular_numbers.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/triangular_numbers.png)Figure
2

Now consider the sum of odd integers:  
![1+3+5+7...(2n-1) \\Rightarrow \\sum \\limits\_1^n
(2i-1)=n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2B3%2B5%2B7...%282n-1%29+%5CRightarrow+%5Csum+%5Climits_1%5En+%282i-1%29%3Dn%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"1+3+5+7...(2n-1) \\Rightarrow \\sum \\limits_1^n (2i-1)=n^2")  
Laying out the nth odd number
![2n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2n-1"), with each new addition bracketing the previous one we get a
square lattice (Figure 3). Hence, their sum is
![n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n^2"). Thus these sums are known as square numbers.

[![square\_numbers](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/square_numbers.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/square_numbers.png)Figure
3

Now a question which arises is whether there are any triangular numbers
that are also square numbers. Such a question might be germane to a
neo-ritualist who wishes to make a triangular vedī with the same number
of lattice points as a square vedī. This is not entirely out of place
because square numbers arose first in the vaidika system of square
altars and the triangular numbers had a significance for the
Pythagoreans (also see [earlier
note](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/syllable-number-and-rules-in-the-ideal-realm/)).
In any case, the answer to this question is obtained thus: Let
![r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "r") be
the number to which we desire to sum ( i.e.
![1+2+3...+r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2B2%2B3...%2Br&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"1+2+3...+r")) to get the triangular number. Let
![s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "s") be
the number which we desire to be side of the square number (i.e
![1+3+5+...(2s-1)=s^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2B3%2B5%2B...%282s-1%29%3Ds%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"1+3+5+...(2s-1)=s^2")). Then we have:  
![\\dfrac{r(r+1)}{2}=s^2\\\\ r^2+r=2s^2\\\\ \\therefore
4r^2+4r=2(4s^2)\\\\ \\therefore 4r^2+4r+1=2(4s^2)+1\\\\ \\therefore
(2r+1)^2=2(2s)^2+1\\\\ let \\; x=2r+1 \\; and \\; y=2s \\\\ \\therefore
x^2=2y^2+1\\\\ \\therefore r=\\dfrac{x-1}{2} \\; and \\;
s=\\dfrac{y}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7Br%28r%2B1%29%7D%7B2%7D%3Ds%5E2%5C%5C+r%5E2%2Br%3D2s%5E2%5C%5C+%5Ctherefore+4r%5E2%2B4r%3D2%284s%5E2%29%5C%5C+%5Ctherefore+4r%5E2%2B4r%2B1%3D2%284s%5E2%29%2B1%5C%5C+%5Ctherefore+%282r%2B1%29%5E2%3D2%282s%29%5E2%2B1%5C%5C+let+%5C%3B+x%3D2r%2B1+%5C%3B+and+%5C%3B+y%3D2s+%5C%5C+%5Ctherefore+x%5E2%3D2y%5E2%2B1%5C%5C+%5Ctherefore+r%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bx-1%7D%7B2%7D+%5C%3B+and+%5C%3B+s%3D%5Cdfrac%7By%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\dfrac{r(r+1)}{2}=s^2\\\\ r^2+r=2s^2\\\\ \\therefore 4r^2+4r=2(4s^2)\\\\ \\therefore 4r^2+4r+1=2(4s^2)+1\\\\ \\therefore (2r+1)^2=2(2s)^2+1\\\\ let \\; x=2r+1 \\; and \\; y=2s \\\\ \\therefore x^2=2y^2+1\\\\ \\therefore r=\\dfrac{x-1}{2} \\; and \\; s=\\dfrac{y}{2}")

Thus the integral solutions of the above equation give us the triangular
numbers which are also square numbers. As one can notice
![2y^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2y%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2y^2+1") will always be an odd number; hence, for the solutions
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x")
will always be an odd number and
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "y")
will always be even \[an odd square will be ![(2n-1)^2=
4n^2-4n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282n-1%29%5E2%3D+4n%5E2-4n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(2n-1)^2= 4n^2-4n+1"); Now
![2y^2+1=4n^2-4n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2y%5E2%2B1%3D4n%5E2-4n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2y^2+1=4n^2-4n+1"); thus we have
![y^2=2n^2-2n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2%3D2n%5E2-2n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y^2=2n^2-2n"); hence
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "y") is
always even\]. Thus, for each solution of the above indeterminate
equation we get the equivalent triangular and square numbers.
Interestingly, each successive approximation of
![\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{2}") yields the point where triangular and square numbers are
equivalent. Illustrated in Figures 2 and 3 are the cases where the
triangular and square numbers become equal till ![r=49,
s=35)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D49%2C+s%3D35%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"r=49, s=35)"). Below is a table of the first 11 such values of
![(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x,y)") and corresponding
![(r,s)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r%2Cs%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(r,s)").![x2\_2y2\_1](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/x2_2y2_11.jpg?w=640)

As can be seen above these numbers can quickly large. A further question
is can we get such solutions more generally for the above equation where
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a")
takes values other than 2. The answer to this lies in one of the
greatest discoveries of the Hindu mind. For the rest of this note we
shall restrict ourselves to the first
![(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x,y)") that satisfies the equation, though the method discussed can be
used to get further values too.

Our encounter with this equation goes back to our youth when our father
had taken us to a bookshop. There a book on Hindu mathematics caught our
sight and in it we encountered this equation
![x^2=ay^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%3Day%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^2=ay^2+1") for the first time. We also noted in that the book that
Brahmagupta had mentioned that one could be considered as having some
mettle in mathematics if one solved the equation for ![a=83,
a=92](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D83%2C+a%3D92&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=83, a=92"). Interestingly, when these equations were first being
explored in the West (1600s) the Frenchman Fermat too posed one of them
as a major challenge to rival English mathematicians and others. Not
being of extensive means we were not in position of buying many books
those days and had to leave it in the shop and return home. Nevertheless
the problem stuck in our mind and we started exploring it with paper and
pen. We were able obtain the first solutions for numbers
![\\leq10](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleq10&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\leq10") but soon realized that 83 and 92 were beyond our means,
plainly showing us that we had no mathematical talents. However, the
book usefully informed us that there was an algorithm developed by the
Hindu mathematicians/scientists from Brahmagupta onwards culminating in
Jayadeva, which was known as the cakravāla that allowed one to solve any
such equation. Commonly one finds it attributed to Bhāskara-II but it is
already mentioned in the commentary called Sundarī of Udayadivākara from
1073 CE where he says it was achieved by Jayadeva before him. Hence, it
was already in place long before Bhāskara-II, who when providing it
merely says its is known or has been recited as the cakravāla
(cakravālam idaṃ jaguḥ |).

However, the time was too brief at the time of our first encounter for
us to understand the cakravāla. Hence, a little later when we had access
to a computer for the first time we wrote a simple program to carry out
a brute force search for all the first solutions to the equation till
![a=100](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D100&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=100"). We thus found the answers for ![a=83: (x=82,
y=9)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D83%3A+%28x%3D82%2C+y%3D9%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=83: (x=82, y=9)") and ![a=92: (x=1151,
y=120)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D92%3A+%28x%3D1151%2C+y%3D120%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=92: (x=1151, y=120)"). However, since our search was carried out only
to a maximum of
![10^5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"10^5") (1 lakṣa) we had several holes. This indicated a surprising fact
that for some values of
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a")
![(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x,y)") could suddenly take large values among otherwise pedestrian
values. This meant we had to have a better way of finding them. Hence,
we got back to study the cakravāla algorithm and implement it having
found a book describing it with a richer relative. In doing so we
realized that the way it was presented in the sources we used was not
the best for implementation on a computer. Hence, we had to implement it
in the form of a systematic search which catches all corner cases that
cannot be handled by the “simple” presentation we usually see for this
algorithm. Below is a presentation of such an implementation of the
function
![cv(a)=(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=cv%28a%29%3D%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"cv(a)=(x,y)") which would output the first non-trivial solutions of the
equation (Hindus termed the solutions
![(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x,y)") as antya and ādi: Brahmagupta or as jyeṣṭa and hrasva: Jayadeva
and Bhāskara-II)

If one instructs a computer to do the above procedure in any language it
understands one can unerringly get the first non-trivial solutions of
the equation under consideration. The implementation has three nested
loops. The outer loop catches the cases where
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a") is
a perfect square and has only trivial solutions. The innermost loop is
the core cakravāla procedure where the search iteratively proceeds until
![m\_n ==
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m_n+%3D%3D+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"m_n == 1"). As the first approach it starts with an initial
![p\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_n"), i.e. ![p\_0=\\lfloor \\sqrt{a}
\\rfloor](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_0%3D%5Clfloor+%5Csqrt%7Ba%7D+%5Crfloor&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_0=\\lfloor \\sqrt{a} \\rfloor"). This is what you typically see in
examples illustrating the procedure. However, one quickly realizes that
with
![a=14](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D14&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=14") that does not work even though it has a relatively simple
solution ![(x=15,
y=4)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D15%2C+y%3D4%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x=15, y=4)"). Here, we need to start with
![p\_n=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_n%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_n=4") instead of
![p\_n=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_n%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_n=3") because the latter results in fractional
![q\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"q_n") (note it has to always be integer for procedure). Bhāskara-II
seems indicates that one might need take an alternative starting point
with the ‘athavā’: guṇavarge prakṛtya +ūne .athavā +alpaṃ śeṣakaṃ yathā
| (guṇa-varga ![\\Rightarrow
p\_0^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CRightarrow+p_0%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\Rightarrow p_0^2") i.e. square of starting
![p\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_n"); prakṛtya ![\\Rightarrow
a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CRightarrow+a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\Rightarrow a")). But when we go to
![a=21](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D21&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=21") we see that both
![p\_0=4,5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_0%3D4%2C5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_0=4,5") fail. Hence, we need to go to
![p\_0=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_0%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_0=3") to get the solution without hitting a fractional
![q\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"q_n"). It is for this issue that we need to incorporate the second loop
where we search for the appropriate
![p\_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_0") systematically starting from ![\\lfloor\\sqrt{a}
\\rfloor](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clfloor%5Csqrt%7Ba%7D+%5Crfloor&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\lfloor\\sqrt{a} \\rfloor") and moving up and down from it by 1, 2 so
on. Thus, we have a simple implementation of the cakravāla on a computer
that anyone with even limited mathematical capacity like us can achieve.
Since by this procedure we always reach the solution, i.e. the algorithm
always halts, we have not implemented Brahmagupta and Bhāskara-II’s
shortcuts.

Thus, armed with the cakravāla in a second or so we obtained the values
of the first
![(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x,y)") for all
![a=1:100](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D1%3A100&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=1:100"). In the process we blazed through Bhāskara-II’s famous
illustration of
![a=61](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D61&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=61") which yields big values: ![(x=1766319049,
y=226153980)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D1766319049%2C+y%3D226153980%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x=1766319049, y=226153980)"). While big, to put it in perspective the
jyeṣṭa is still only about
![\\frac{1}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\frac{1}{3}") number of people alive on earth. As we tried to go past
the
![a=100](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D100&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=100") barrier towards
![a=200](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D200&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=200") we hit a snag as our numbers ran beyond our language’s standard
numbers kept as double-precision floating-point (64 bits \~ 15:17
digits). So we had re-implement the algorithm using multiple precision
floating-point numbers. This slowed it down a bit but was not too bad
given the cakravāla’s inherent speed. Now we could obtain a table of all
first ![(x,
y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2C+y%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x, y)") all the way to
![a=1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=1000"). Now, we are not talking just big but truly large numbers that
are a delight to the Hindu eye. In this range we reach the maximum
![(x=16421658242965910275055840472270471049,\\\\
y=638728478116949861246791167518480580)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D16421658242965910275055840472270471049%2C%5C%5C+y%3D638728478116949861246791167518480580%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

for
![a=661](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D661&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=661") interestingly 600 ahead of Bhāskara-II’s
![a=61](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D61&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=61"). To put is perspective that is close to the diameter of the
universe measured in Hydrogen atom diameters. At
![a=421](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D421&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=421") we get ![(x=3879474045914926879468217167061449,\\\\
y=189073995951839020880499780706260)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D3879474045914926879468217167061449%2C%5C%5C+y%3D189073995951839020880499780706260%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

which is roughly the diameter of an apple (6.27 cm) in Planck’s lengths.
We provide this
[table](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/chakravala_padded.pdf "chakravala_padded") for
the reader’s enjoyment as such information does not seem to be easily
available. The first two columns give the jyeṣṭa and hrasva. The next
two columns
![(n,m)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n%2Cm%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(n,m)") give the number of iterations of the second and total number of
iterations of the third loop that were needed until the solution was
obtained. The first non-trivial
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x")
values are also plotted for
![a=1:1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D1%3A1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=1:1000") (Figure 4).

Is there any pattern to these values? As noted above
![a=14,21](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D14%2C21&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=14,21") need us to search beyond the ![p\_0=\\lfloor \\sqrt{a}
\\rfloor](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_0%3D%5Clfloor+%5Csqrt%7Ba%7D+%5Crfloor&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_0=\\lfloor \\sqrt{a} \\rfloor"). Indeed, multiples of 7 seem have a
higher propensity for this problem because we encounter a similar issues
with 14, 21, 28, 70, 77, 98, 112, 126, 133, 140, 154, 161, 189, 238,
252, 259, 266, 273…: Out of the 142 multiples of 7 that
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a")
assumes between 1 and 1000, we need multiple rounds of exploration
![(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(n)") for 79 of them. Indeed the highest values of
![n=21](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D21&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=21") are attained for ![a= 966=7 \\times
138](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D+966%3D7+%5Ctimes+138&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a= 966=7 \\times 138") and ![a=987= 7 \\times
141](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D987%3D+7+%5Ctimes+141&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=987= 7 \\times 141").

For the actual values of
![(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x,y)") there are some patterns that can be easily proved: When
![a=k^2-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3Dk%5E2-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=k^2-1"), i.e.
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a") is
one less than a perfect square the solution is ![(x=k,
y=1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3Dk%2C+y%3D1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x=k, y=1)"). For
![a=k^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3Dk%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=k^2+1") we can easily show that ![(x=2k^2+1,
y=2k)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D2k%5E2%2B1%2C+y%3D2k%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x=2k^2+1, y=2k)"). When ![a=k^2 \\pm
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3Dk%5E2+%5Cpm+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=k^2 \\pm 2") it is obvious that ![(x=k^2 \\pm 1,
y=k)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3Dk%5E2+%5Cpm+1%2C+y%3Dk%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x=k^2 \\pm 1, y=k)"). Similarly, when ![a=4k^2 \\pm
4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D4k%5E2+%5Cpm+4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=4k^2 \\pm 4") then ![(x=2k^2 \\pm 1,
y=k)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D2k%5E2+%5Cpm+1%2C+y%3Dk%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x=2k^2 \\pm 1, y=k)"). Slightly more subtle ones are: when ![a=(3k)^2
\\pm
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D%283k%29%5E2+%5Cpm+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

y=2k)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D6k%5E2+%5Cpm+1%2C+y%3D2k%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x=6k^2 \\pm 1, y=2k)"); when ![a=9k^2 \\pm

"(x=3k^2 \\pm 1, y=k)"); when ![a=25k^2 \\pm
10](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D25k%5E2+%5Cpm+10&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=25k^2 \\pm 10") then ![(x=5k^2 \\pm 1,
y=k)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D5k%5E2+%5Cpm+1%2C+y%3Dk%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x=5k^2 \\pm 1, y=k)"). Such may be termed regular categories of
![(a:x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%3Ax%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(a:x,y)")

It also becomes apparent (Figure 4,
[Table](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/chakravala_padded.pdf "chakravala_padded"))
that for several prime values we get explosive eruptions of the
![(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x,y)") values. The famous explosive values like ![a=61, 109, 181, 397,
409, 421, 661, 673, 769,
937](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D61%2C+109%2C+181%2C+397%2C+409%2C+421%2C+661%2C+673%2C+769%2C+937&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=61, 109, 181, 397, 409, 421, 661, 673, 769, 937") are all primes. Now
if a prime happens to fall in one of the above categories where
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a")
can be regularly defined in terms of a perfect square then we get get
pedestrian values despite it being a prime (e.g. ![a=47 \\Rightarrow

"a=47 \\Rightarrow k^2-2") category or ![a=101 \\Rightarrow
k^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D101+%5CRightarrow+k%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=101 \\Rightarrow k^2+1") category). However, double their value
despite not being a prime has an explosive value if it escapes the above
categories; e.g. for ![a=94=47 \\times
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D94%3D47+%5Ctimes+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=94=47 \\times 2"), ![(x=2143295,
y=221064)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D2143295%2C+y%3D221064%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x=2143295, y=221064)") and for ![a= 202 = 101 \\times
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D+202+%3D+101+%5Ctimes+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a= 202 = 101 \\times 2"), ![(x=19731763,
y=1388322)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D19731763%2C+y%3D1388322%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x=19731763, y=1388322)"). Similarly, when take the case of 17 we see
that ![17 \\Rightarrow
k^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=17+%5CRightarrow+k%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"17 \\Rightarrow k^2+1"); ![17 \\times 2 =34 \\Rightarrow
k^2-2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=17+%5Ctimes+2+%3D34+%5CRightarrow+k%5E2-2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"17 \\times 2 =34 \\Rightarrow k^2-2"); ![17 \\times 3 =51 \\Rightarrow
k^2+2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=17+%5Ctimes+3+%3D51+%5CRightarrow+k%5E2%2B2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"17 \\times 3 =51 \\Rightarrow k^2+2"); ![17 \\times 4 =68 \\Rightarrow
4k^2+4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=17+%5Ctimes+4+%3D68+%5CRightarrow+4k%5E2%2B4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"17 \\times 4 =68 \\Rightarrow 4k^2+4"). Thus, the prime 17 is
suppressed over 4 successive multiples before it explodes finally at
![a=85](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D85&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=85") with ![(x=285769,
y=30996)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D285769%2C+y%3D30996%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x=285769, y=30996)"). Thus, more generally we see explosions whenever
a prime or its multiples escapes the regular categories. Among the
primes, a famous set of primes (studied intensely from Fermat, Lagrange,
Gauss to this date) that are of the form:
![p=r^2+ns^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3Dr%5E2%2Bns%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p=r^2+ns^2") (typically written as
![p=x^2+ny^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3Dx%5E2%2Bny%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p=x^2+ny^2"), where
![n=1,3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1%2C3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=1,3")) tend to be particularly explosive if they are not suppressed
by belonging one of the above regular categories. For example the above
listed famous explosive values (e.g 61, 109, 181 etc) can be expressed
as both
![p=r^2+s^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3Dr%5E2%2Bs%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p=r^2+s^2") and
![p=r^2+3s^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3Dr%5E2%2B3s%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p=r^2+3s^2"). Thus by Fermat’s theorems these primes are
simultaneously: ![p\\;mod\\;4 \\equiv
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%5C%3Bmod%5C%3B4+%5Cequiv+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p\\;mod\\;4 \\equiv 1") and ![p \\;mod\\; 3 \\equiv
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%5C%3Bmod%5C%3B+3+%5Cequiv+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p \\;mod\\; 3 \\equiv 1").

We can now understand what we see when we look closely at the log-scale
plot of ![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x") against
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a")
(Figure 5). We see “cycloid” like arcs between successive
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a")
which are perfect squares. These peaks of these arcs are more pronounced
for such even
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a").
These arcs arise from the regular categories. The “central” part of
these arcs are interrupted by eruptions arising from unsuppressed primes
and their multiples. As
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a")
increases the explosions get larger and larger, and as the distance
between successive perfect squares increases there are more unsuppressed
values which erupt. The distribution of values of
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x")
show an interesting statistical property. Though the median value (lower
dotted line in Figure 4, 5) is rather pedestrian the mean value is huge
(upper dotted line). This illustrates how the minority explosive values
have a much greater influence on the cumulative value of the system — a
pattern often seen in natural systems where a few “hubs” dominate a
distribution. This remarkable system made easy by the cakravāla
illustrates the beauty of this method of old Hindu mathematics. In the
past many have said that the Hindus were unlikely to have known of a
proof for the cakravāla. We do not think so; rather it is likely they
had a proof of some kind for why it always works and with it had some
grasp of its consequences for the theory of numbers.

In the final part of this note we shall consider another second degree
indeterminate equation, the bhujā-koṭi-karṇa nyāya:
![x^2+y^2=z^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%2By%5E2%3Dz%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^2+y^2=z^2"). Its integral solutions where ![(x,y,z \\neq
0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%2Cz+%5Cneq+0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x,y,z \\neq 0)") are the famous b-k-k triples (Pythagorean triples in
the west), which were studied by the Hindus since the days of the Veda.
This likely has a deep history among the ārya-s and other IE people,
which the white indological hot air is keen to ascribe to borrowing from
the Mesopotamians (a discerning Hindu will see through the foundations
of Mesopotamian boosterism that is common in the Abrahamosphere). In any
case, the properties of its solutions are well-know to lay people with
even the slightest mathematical interest but we are reiterating them
here as another illustration of how even a simple indeterminate
equations can produce complex patterns. whose. We encounter its
solutions explicitly in the śulbasūtra-s and they continue to be
discussed in subsequent Hindu mathematics. For instance the great sage
Baudhāyana says in his śulbasūtra:  
dīrgha-catur-aśrasya+akṣṇyā-rajjuḥ pārśva-mānī tiryañ-mānī ca yat pṛthag
bhūte kurutas tad ubhayaṃ karoti |  
The hypotenuse (akṣṇyā-rajju) i.e. diagonal of a rectangle produces  
\[the area\] that is equal to both the areas \[produced\] separately by
the horizontal and vertical sides.  
tāsāṃ trika-catuṣkayor dvādaśika-pañcikayoḥ pañcadaśika+aṣṭikayoḥ
saptika-caturviṃśikayor dvādaśika-pañcatriṃśikayoḥ
pañcadaśika-śaṭtriṃśikayor ity etāsu+upalabdhiḥ |  
Among the \[sides showing above relationship\] are those obtained in
this form: (3,4,\[5\]); (5,12,\[13\]); (8,15,\[17\]); (7,24,25);
(12,35,\[37\]); (15,36,\[39\]).

The first of the triples is the most primitive of triples and sets the
properties for all the other solutions: 1) ![xy\\; mod \\; 12 \\equiv
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=xy%5C%3B+mod+%5C%3B+12+%5Cequiv+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"xy\\; mod \\; 12 \\equiv 0"): the product of the two legs of the triple
is always divisible by 12. 2) ![xyz \\; mod \\; 60 \\equiv
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=xyz+%5C%3B+mod+%5C%3B+60+%5Cequiv+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"xyz \\; mod \\; 60 \\equiv 0"): the product of all three of them is
always divisible by 60. Now of the forms listed in the sūtra, the first
5 are illustrations of primitives i.e. are integers with greatest common
divisor 1 (i.e. they are coprime). The 6th is merely a illustration of
how further trivial triples can be obtained by merely scaling a
primitive in this case ![(5,12,13) \\times
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%285%2C12%2C13%29+%5Ctimes+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(5,12,13) \\times 3"). However, triples of sūtra are likely chosen to
illustrate another point:  
![z^2-y^2=(z-y)(z+y)=x^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%5E2-y%5E2%3D%28z-y%29%28z%2By%29%3Dx%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"z^2-y^2=(z-y)(z+y)=x^2")  
Three of them are of the form
![z-y=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z-y%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"z-y=1"), two are
![z-y=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z-y%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"z-y=2") and the odd one out is
![z-y=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z-y%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"z-y=3"). Since the adhvaryu uses difference of squares formula
![z^2-y^2=(z-y)(z+y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%5E2-y%5E2%3D%28z-y%29%28z%2By%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"z^2-y^2=(z-y)(z+y)") in the layout of the citi (3 sutra-s later in
Baudhāyana) this was likely used to obtain the illustrated triples by
setting
![(z-y)=1,2,3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28z-y%29%3D1%2C2%2C3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(z-y)=1,2,3"). With
![z-y=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z-y%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"z-y=1") we get
![x^2=z+y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%3Dz%2By&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^2=z+y") which easily yields the most primitive triple
![(5+4=3^2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%285%2B4%3D3%5E2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(5+4=3^2)") and further ![(12+13=5^2),
(24+25=7^2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2812%2B13%3D5%5E2%29%2C+%2824%2B25%3D7%5E2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(12+13=5^2), (24+25=7^2)") etc.

More generally all primitive triples can be obtained using the formula
in the complex plane:  
![x+iy=(m+in)^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Biy%3D%28m%2Bin%29%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x+iy=(m+in)^2") where
![(m,n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28m%2Cn%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(m,n)") are coprime and of opposite parity (i.e. one is even and the
other odd).  
Then the hypotenuse is
![z=Mod\\left(\\left(m+in\\right)^2\\right)=m^2+n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3DMod%5Cleft%28%5Cleft%28m%2Bin%5Cright%29%5E2%5Cright%29%3Dm%5E2%2Bn%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"z=Mod\\left(\\left(m+in\\right)^2\\right)=m^2+n^2"). Thus one can see
that in the triples
![z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "z")
and one of the legs would be odd and the other even. If we compute the
primitive triples and plot them on the xy plane (Figure 6) we see that
they present a complex pattern.

![triples\_primitive](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/triples_primitive.png?w=640)Figure

There are two aspects to the pattern: A relatively trivial aspect is the
arrangement of the points on parabolic arcs which stems from the
parabolic form of the generative formulae. Indeed, if one plots the
points as
![(x,y,z)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x,y,z)") in 3D, one can see that they lie on the parabolic sections
cutting the surface of the generative cone of the conic (Figure 7).

[![bkk\_cone](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/bkk_cone.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/bkk_cone.png)Figure
7

The intricacy of their actual pattern arises from the interplay of this
more obvious feature with the distribution of coprimes with opposite
parity.  One specific aspect of this arrangement is the presence of
certain
![(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x,y)") pairs that differ by 1, e.g. (3,4), i.e. triples with legs
differing by 1. Rather interestingly these pairs are related to a
specific case of the above considered indeterminate equations:
![x^2=8y^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%3D8y%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^2=8y^2+1"). The successive solutions of this equation are shown in
the below table:

![x2\_8y2\_1](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/x2_8y2_1.jpg?w=640)

From the
![y\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y_n") as above values (i.e. the y column) we get:  
![p\_n=y\_n+y\_{n+1}\\\\ a\_n=\\left \\lfloor\\dfrac{p\_n}{2} \\right
\\rfloor \\\\ b\_n=p\_n-a\_n\\\\
c\_n=y\_{n+1}-y\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_n%3Dy_n%2By_%7Bn%2B1%7D%5C%5C+a_n%3D%5Cleft+%5Clfloor%5Cdfrac%7Bp_n%7D%7B2%7D+%5Cright+%5Crfloor+%5C%5C+b_n%3Dp_n-a_n%5C%5C+c_n%3Dy_%7Bn%2B1%7D-y_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_n=y_n+y_{n+1}\\\\ a_n=\\left \\lfloor\\dfrac{p_n}{2} \\right \\rfloor \\\\ b_n=p_n-a_n\\\\ c_n=y_{n+1}-y_n")  
Now
![(a\_n,b\_n,c\_n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a_n%2Cb_n%2Cc_n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(a_n,b_n,c_n)") are the triples whose legs differ by 1

A further striking relationship captures a more general aspect of the
distribution of triples: We first order all triples by increasing
magnitude of their hypotenuse.
![z\_i](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"z_i") will be the ith hypotenuse and
![N(z)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%28z%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"N(z)") will be the number of triples with
![z\<z\_i](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3Cz_i&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"z\<z_i"). Then we see that:  
![\\lim \\limits\_{z\_i \\to \\infty} \\dfrac{N(z)}{z\_i}
=\\dfrac{1}{2\\pi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clim+%5Climits_%7Bz_i+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7BN%28z%29%7D%7Bz_i%7D+%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Cpi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\lim \\limits_{z_i \\to \\infty} \\dfrac{N(z)}{z_i} =\\dfrac{1}{2\\pi}")  
This convergence is illustrated in Figure 8.  Thus, remarkably, as is
typical of mathematics, we start with the elementary geometry of right
triangles which are part of the rectilinear figures of the vaidika
ritual, pass on to conics, intersect with the object of the cakravāla,
and end up with a nice appearance of that quintessential number
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi").  Thus, one appreciates Gauss’s famous statement: “ἀεὶ ὁ θεὸς
ἀριθμετἰζεῖ (the god always arithmeticizes)”.
