+++
The celebrated sautrAmaNI rite, which is one of the rare shrauta rites
in which oblations of
[beer](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/03/22/vedic-beer/) are
offered is a conservative one that goes back to the early vedic period.
The key oblations are readied thus are prepared thus (the production of
the [vedic
beer](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/03/22/vedic-beer/) has
already been described):  
The cups for the ashvins  
Material: ashvattha wood  
Flavoring: wheat flour and juice/powder of red large jujube fruit
(kuvala)  
mantra: tejo asi.. . SYV vajasaneyi saMhitA 19.9  
The cup for the sarasvati  
Material:udumbara wood  
Flavoring: coriander powder and juice/powder of yellow green large
jujube fruit (badara)  
mantra: vIryam asi … VS 19.9  
The cup for indra  
material: nygrodha wood  
mantra: balam asi … VS 19.9  
Flavoring: Barley powder and juice/powder of small red jujube
(karkandhu).  
Powder of wolf, tiger and lion hair are respectively added to the 3 sets
of cups with the mantra ojo asi (VS19.9)  
The total set of cups are 2 milk cups for ashvins; 2 beer cups for
ashvins; 1 milk cup for sarasvati; 1 beer cup for sarasvati; 1 milk cup
for indra; 1 beer cup for indra. The beer cups are filled by placing
them on earthen sthAli saucepans.  
These are for offerings in the AhavanIya. The adhvaryu then takes the
100-holed pitcher with a kusha grass filter and a gold ornament and
offers the remaining beer into the dakShiNAgni with the mantras punantu
mA (VS 19.37-44). In the charaka-sautrAmaNi it offered in the southern
AhavanIya (without the raised altar) typical of this rite. In this case
the pitcher may alternatively be 9-holed.

A variant of the sautramaNi is performed within the rAjasUya, the
charaka sautrAmaNi as instituted by the kR^iShNa-yajurvedic charakas.

The structure of the sautrAmaNi ritual closely follows its oldest
mention in the indra sutrAman sUktaM (RV 10.131):  
yuvaM surAmam ashvinA namuchAvAsure sachA |  
vipipAnAshubhas patI indraM karmasvAvatam ||  
Young ashvins, auspicious lords, drank swigs of good beer, and refreshed
indra in his work with the Asuric namuci.

putram iva pitarAv-ashvinobhendrAvathuH kAvyair-daMsanAbhiH |  
yat surAmaM vyapibaH shachIbhiH sarasvatI tvA maghavan-nabhiShNak ||  
As parents aid a son, the two Asvins, have helped you O indra, with
their wondrous powers and mantras. When you, with glory had drunk the
swigs of beer, sarasvati refreshed you maghavan.
