## CHAPTER I

THE HOUSE ON THE GANGES

PLACE: A cottage at Belur, beside the Ganges.

TIME: March to May, 1898.

Of the home by the Ganges the Master had said to one, "You will find
that little house of Dhira Mata like heaven, for it is all love, from
beginning to end.

It was so indeed. Within, an unbroken harmony, and without, everything
alike beautiful — the green stretch of grass, the tall cocoanut palms,
the little brown villages in the jungle, and the Nilkantha that built
her nest in a tree — top beside us, on purpose to bring us the blessings
of Shiva. In the morning the shadows lay behind the house, but in the
afternoons we could sit in front worshipping the Ganges herself — great
leonine mother! — and in sight of Dakshineswar.

There came one and another with traditions of the past, and we learnt of
the Master's eight years' wanderings; of the name changed from village
to village; of the Nirvikalpa Samâdhi; and of that sacred sorrow, too
deep for words or for common sight, that one who loved had alone seen.
And there too came the Master himself, with his stories of Umâ and
Shiva, of Râdhâ and Krishna, and his fragments of song and poetry.

It seemed as if he knew that the first material of a new consciousness
must be a succession of vivid but isolated experiences, poured out
without proper sequence so as to provoke the mind of the learner to work
for its own conception of order and relation. . . . For the most part it
was the Indian religions that he portrayed for us—today dealing with one
and tomorrow with another — his choice guided, seemingly, by the whim of
the moment. But it was not religion only that he poured out upon us.
Sometimes it would be history. Again, it would be folk-lore. On still
another occasion it would be the manifold anomalies and inconsistencies
of race, caste and custom. In fact India herself became, as heard in
him, as the last and noblest of the Purânas, uttering itself through his
lips.

Another point in which he had caught a great psychological secret was
that of never trying to soften for us that which would at first sight be
difficult or repellent. In matters Indian he would rather put forward,
in its extreme form at the beginning of our experience, all that might
seem impossible for European minds to enjoy. Thus he would quote, for
instance, some verses about Gauri and Shankar in a single form:

On one side grows the hair in long black curls,  
And on the other, corded like rope.  
On one side are seen the beautiful garlands,  
On the other, bone earrings and snake-like coils.  
One side is white with ashes, like the snow mountains,  
The other, golden as the light of dawn.  
For He, the Lord, took a form,  
And that was a divided form,  
Half-woman and half-man

. . . . . . .

Whatever might be the subject of the conversation, it ended always on
the note of the infinite. . . . He might appear to take up any subject —
literary, ethnological or scientific — but he always made us feel it as
an illustration of the Ultimate Vision. There was for him nothing
secular. He had a loathing for bondage and a horror of those who "cover
chains with flowers", but he never failed to make the true critic's
distinction between this and the highest forms of art.

One day we were receiving European guests and he entered into a long
talk about Persian poetry. Then suddenly, finding himself quoting the
poem that says, "For one mole on the face of my Beloved, I would give
all the wealth of Samarkand!" he turned and said energetically, "I would
not give a straw, you know, for the man who was incapable of
appreciating a love song!" His talk too teemed with epigrams.

It was that same afternoon, in the course of a long political argument,
that he said, "In order to become a nation, it appears that *we need a
common hate* as well as a common love".

Several months later he remarked that before one who had a mission he
never talked of any of the gods save Uma and Shiva. For Shiva and the
Mother made the great workers. Yet I have sometimes wondered if he knew
at this time how the end of every theme was Bhakti. Much as he dreaded
the luxury of spiritual emotion for those who might be enervated by it,
he could not help giving glimpses of what it meant to be consumed with
the intoxication of God. And so he would chant for us such poems as:

They have made Radha queen, in the beautiful

groves of Vrindaban.

At her gate stands Krishna, on guard.  
His flute is singing all the time:  
Radha is about to distribute infinite wealth of love.  
Though I am guard, all the world may enter.  
Come all ye who thirst! Say only 'Glory unto Radha!'  
Enter the region of love!

Or he would give us the great antiphonal Chorus of the Cowherds, written
by his friend: (The Bengali dramatist Girish Chandra Ghosh.)

Men:                Thou art the Soul of souls,

Thou yellow-garbed,  
With thy blue eyes.

Women:           Thou dark One! Thou

Shepherd of Vrindaban!  
Kneeling at the feet of the Shepherdesses.

Men:                My soul sings the praise of the glory

of the Lord,

Who took the human form.

Women:           Thy beauty for us, the Gopis.  
Men:                Thou Lord of Sacrifice.  

Saviour of the weak.

Women:           Who lovest Radha and thy body floats on its

own tears.

. . . . . .

MARCH 25.

. . . At this time the Swami kept the custom of coming to the cottage
early and spending the morning hours there, and again returning in the
late afternoon. On the second morning of this visit, however — Friday,
the Christian feast of the Annunciation — he took us all three back to
the Math, and there in the worship-room was held a little service of
initiation where one was made a Brahmachârini. That was the happiest of
mornings.

After the service we were taken upstairs. The Swami put on the ashes and
bone-earrings and matted locks of a Shiva-Yogi and sang and played to us
— Indian music on Indian instruments — for an hour.

And in the evening in our boat on the Ganges, he opened his heart to us
and told us much of his questions and anxieties regarding the trust that
he held from his own Master.

Another week and he was gone to Darjeeling; and till the day that the
plague declaration brought him back, we saw him again no more.

MAY 3.

Then two of us met him in the house of our Holy Mother. The political
sky was black. It seemed as if a storm were about to burst. . . .
Plague, panic and riot were doing their fell work. And the Master turned
to the two and said, "There are some who scoff at the existence of Kâli.
Yet today She is out there amongst the people. They are frantic with
fear, and the soldiery have been called to deal out death. Who can say
that God does not manifest Himself as evil as well as good? But only the
Hindu dares to worship Him in the evil".

He had come back and the old life was resumed once more, as far as could
be, seeing that an epidemic was in prospect and that measures were on
hand to give the people confidence. As long as this possibility darkened
the horizon, he would not leave Calcutta. But it passed away, and those
happy days with it, and the time came that we should go.
