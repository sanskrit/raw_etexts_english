## LXXVIII

*To Mr. E. T. Sturdy*

GRAND HOTEL,  
VALAIS,  
SWITZERLAND.

BLESSED AND BELOVED,

. . . I am reading a little, starving a good deal, and practising a good
deal more. The strolls in the woods are simply delicious. We are now
situated under three huge glaciers, and the scenery is very beautiful.

By the by, whatever scruples I may have had as to the Swiss-lake origin
of the Aryans have been taken clean off my mind. The Swiss is a Tartar
*minus* a pigtail. . . . 

Yours ever affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
