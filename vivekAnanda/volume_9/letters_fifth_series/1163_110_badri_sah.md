*To Lala Badri Sah*

DEVALDHAR BAGICHA,[1](#fn1)

*Thursday*, \[*June 1897*\]

DEAR BADRI SAH,

I have been very sorry to learn that you are not well. It would please
me very much if you would come down here for a few days, at any rate,
with us; and I am sure it would do you good.

Yours with blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA

1.  [^](#fn1_1)When Swami Vivekananda visited Almora in the summer of
    1897, he was the guest of Lala Badri Sah for about two and a half
    months. During this period the Swami primarily stayed at Badri Sah's
    house in the bazaar and occasionally retreated to the garden-house
    of the Sahs at Devaldhar, about twenty miles north of Almora. In
    Hindi, the word Bagicha means "garden".
