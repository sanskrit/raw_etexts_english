THE MATH, BELUR,  
HOWRAH, BENGAL,  
*17th February, 1901*.

DEAR JOE, (Miss Josephine MacLeod.)

Just now received your nice long letter. I am so glad that you met and
approve Miss Cornelia Sorabji. I knew her father at Poona, also a
younger sister who was in America. Perhaps her mother will remember me
as the Sannyasin who used to live with the Thakore Sahib of Limbdi at
Poona.

I hope you will go to Baroda and see the Maharani.

I am much better and hope to continue so for some time. I have just now
a beautiful letter from Mrs. Sevier in which she writes a whole lot of
beautiful things about you.

I am so glad you saw Mr. Tata and find him so strong and good.

I will of course accept an invitation if I am strong enough to go to
Bombay.

Do wire the name of the steamer you leave by for Colombo. With all love,

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
