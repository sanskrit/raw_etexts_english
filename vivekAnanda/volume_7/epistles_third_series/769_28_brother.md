## XXVIII

54 W. 33 NEW YORK,  
*25th April, 1895*.

DEAR BROTHER (To Dr. I. Janes.),

I was away in the Catskill mountains and it was almost impossible to get
a letter regularly posted from where I was — so accept my apology for
the delay in offering you my most heartfelt thanks for your letter in
the "Eagle".

It was so scholarly, truthful and noble and withal so permeated with
your natural universal love for the good and true everywhere. It is a
great work to bring this world into a spirit of sympathy with each other
but it should be done no doubt when such brave souls as you still hold
your own. Lord help you ever and ever my brother and may you live long
to carry on the mighty work you and your society has undertaken.

With my gratitude and love to you and to the members of the Ethical
Society.

I remain Yours ever truly,

VIVEKANANDA.
