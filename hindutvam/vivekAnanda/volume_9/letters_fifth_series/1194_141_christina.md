## CXLI

*To Sister Christine*

MARSEILLES,

*23rd July 1899*.

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,

Your very, very welcome wire just came. By next Sunday[1](#fn1) we
arrive in London, Albert Dock.[2](#fn2) We are a party of four: myself,
another Sannyasin,[3](#fn3) a Calcutta boy[4](#fn4) going to study in
America, and Miss \[Margaret\] Noble. Miss Noble is a young lady from
Wimbledon, near London, who has been working in India on the education
of girls.

Our stay in England will not be long, I am afraid, as this is neither
the season nor am I in fit condition to work much. Anyhow, we will be in
London a few weeks — at least myself — then go to the U.S. We will talk
over all this and infinite things besides when we meet. I do not think
even English summer days are long enough for all the chatter I will
assail you with.

We go to Wimbledon for a day or two, and then I come back to London and
find lodgings for myself and make plans.

Come to the Dock if that is possible and discreet. Yes, it is discreet,
as there is a lady in the party and others will come to meet her. Only,
Christina, don't if you feel the least tired or unwell. I hope you are
enjoying London immensely.

The Orientals do not like any effusion of feeling. They are trained to
hide all expression.

Is Mrs. Funkey \[Mary Caroline Funke\] with you? If so, give her my best
love.

I am much, much better just now. I am really quite another man this
time. I was nearly dead in Calcutta when I started, but this voyage has
improved me immensely.

Hoping soon to see you,

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.

1.  [^](#fn1_1)Perhaps at Marseilles Swami Vivekananda received
    information that their ship, the S.S. Golconda, would reach London
    on Sunday (July 30, 1899); however, he later learned that it would
    reach there on Monday (July 31, 1899). In order to inform Christina
    of the change, the Swami sent her a telegram from Camberwell, B.O.
    on July 30: "Golconda due docks 6 a.m. Monday".
2.  [^](#fn2_1)The S.S. Golconda actually arrived at the Tilbury Dock in
    London, instead of the Albert Dock, on Monday morning.
3.  [^](#fn3_1)Swami Vivekananda's brother-disciple Swami Turiyananda.
4.  [^](#fn4_1)Satish Chandra Chakravarty, Swami Saradananda's brother.
