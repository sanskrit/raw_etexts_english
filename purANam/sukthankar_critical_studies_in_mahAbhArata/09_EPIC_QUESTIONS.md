## Does Indra assume the form of a swan ? 

Mbh. (Crit. Ed.) 1. 57.21 : Msyartipeiia samkaralf. 

This is the second pada of a stanza occurring in the AdipaVvan which 
reads : 

bhagavm pujydte catra hdsyarupej^ta samkarah j 

svayatn eva grhitena Vasoh prltyd mohdtmanah || 

The Vulgate (1. 63. 21cd — ^22ab) differs from this only in so far that 
it reads the second quarter of the stanza as hmsarupena cesvamh. 

I have discussed the text-reading briefly in the Annals of the Bhandarkar 
Orientol Research Institute (vol. 16, p. 100 f.) and justified it, in my reply 
to the late Professor Winternitz, who in the course of a lengthy review^ of 
the Adiparvan had drawn attention to it, observing that as the reading was 
a lectio difficilior and was “ far from certain ” it requires a “ wavy line ” . 
While admitting that the reading adopted in the Critical Edition was a lec- 
tio difjicilioT I contended that sin<» the documentary evidence in its favour 
was complete, therefore it need not be regarded as uncertain and there was 
no need of a “wavy line.” There would have been no reason for me now 
to revert to it but for two facts. On the one hand, it has been again, inci- 
dentally, criticized^ by the late lamented Professor J. J. Meyer in his last 
publication, Trilogie dtindischer Mdchte u. Feste d. Vegetation? (Zurich- 
Leipzig 1937),— a thick opus with extremely rich and varied contents, en- 
livened as usual by the author’s spicy wit and trenchant style. On the other 
hand, the reading receives srfme confirmati(»i from a new and unexpected 
source. 

Meyer argues for the reading of the Vulgate, characterizing the hdsya- 
rupena of the Critical Edition as an astonishing (“ verwunderliche”) read- 
ing, and dismissing hdsya- as the stupid mistake of some scribe (“ein dum- 
mer Schreibfehler” ) . 

The context in which the Mbh. stanza occurs is as follows. The righteous 
king Uparicara Vasu, having laid down his arms, retired to the forest and

began, practising penance. Indra and the {2} other gods, apprehending trouble, 
appeared before him, and, dissuading him from continuing his fierce austeri- 
ties; induced him to return to his royal duties. He should rule the king- 
dom of Cedi as Indra’s special friend. As a mark of his favour, Indra pre- 
sented Vasu with various uncommon gifts, among them a crystalline aerial 
car {sphatikani vimanam) and a garland of unfading lotusesf (known as In- 
dramald) which would protect the king against the missiles of his enemies 
and bring him wealth and victory (vmjayantim) . But he gave him also a 
bamboo staff {vainavtm yasiim), which would protect the good {sistdndm 
pratipdlinim) and of course chastise the wicked. King Vasu brought home 
these precious gifts, according the wonderful staff full divine worsliip. That 
was how, we are told, the custom began of bringing from the forest, at a 
certain specified season, the staff, pole or tree, which was then set up, deco- 
rated with flowers, wreaths, flags, and with pilakas — whatever these latter 
are — and worshipped in due form. Here we find the stanza cited above, 
which says in effect that on this occasion Indra is worshipped, according to 
ancient rites, in a certain form assumed by the god of his own accord, out 
of love for Vasu Uparicara. 

What was this form ? Was it the form of a swan, as the Vulgate has 
it and as Meye.r argues ? That is the question . 

Before we try to answer this question, it would be well to examine the 
MS. evidence a little more closely than Meyer appears to have done. The 
important MS. reading (ignoring that of D^), as given in the Critical Edi- 
tion, may be jxit in the following synoptical form : 

N (except K^) hamsarupena 

samkarah (Br, Dn) cesvarah, 

Ki M ( = Text) hdsyarupena} ) 

T. G. Ya^tirupena Vdsavah. 

To this we may now add the important, newly discovered eight hun- 
dred years old Nepali MS. of the Adi (of which I have given full collations 
in ABORI, vol. 19, pp. 201 ff.), which agrees exactly with Ki M and there- 
fore supports the critical text in an unambiguous manner. 

Now let us see what Meyer has to say about these readings. Accord- 
ing to him (p, 5), the original cesvarah (found in the Vulgate) was mis- 
understood as referring to god Siva ; and, with a view to clarifying its mean- 
ing, it was deliberately changed by some scribe into samkarah, which latter 
is a well-known epithet of Siva. And further hdsyarupena of the Critical

EPIC QUESTIONS 


Edition is, according to Meyer, as already £3} remarked, nothing more than 
the stupid blunder of some copyist for the original hamsarupena. 

It may be made perfectly clear once for all that at least as far as the 
Mababharata text is concerned, the time when one could juggle with read- 
ings of MSS and lay down the law ex cathedra as to what is the original, 
what is an emendation and what is a scribe’s mistake, is long past. It has 
now become a very much more serious and complicated matter, since the 
publication of the Critical Edition. To entitle anyone to a hearing, he must 
first of all show that he understands the critical appalratus and that he has 
studied the stemma codicum published, by me on p. xxx of the Prolego- 
mena of niy edition of the Adiparvan. 

Let us now go back to the MSS. There we find that samkarailt (of the 
Critical Edition) is documented by the whole of the Northern Recension (in- 
cluding the new Nepali MS.) and the Malayalam version, while cesvarah 
(championed by Meyer) is merely the reading of Br, Dn ! Now one would 
like to know why what Meyer considers the original reading (cesvarah) is 
found only in the most recent version represented by Nilakantha (end of the 
17th century) with the sporadic support of one aberrant Bengali MS. (B 5 ), 
while what he considers a recent emendation (sanikarah is found in still 
older versions represented by MSS. scattered all over India from Kashmir 
to Malabar and from Gujarat to Bengal, including the distant Nepal and 
excepting (in addition to the Vulgate) only the Tamil-Telugu zone, which 
latter has moreover a third and divergent reading (Vdsavah). How is it 
that only the Nilakantha version has preserved the correct reading, while 
all other— much older — versions of North India together with the entire Ma- 
layalam version from the South contain what Meyer regards as a corrup- 
tion ? If samkarah of all N and M MSS. be a corrupt reading, as Meyer 
maintains, then Nilakaittha could have got his cesvarah only by emendation, 
because I do not think that Nilakafr^tha had access to any really old Maha- 
bharata MSS., containing very original readings. In thousands of cases his 
text shows what can be proved, with absolute certainty, to be secondary, in- 
ferior, or corrupt readings. 

This inability on the part of Meyer to recognize in a patently simple 
case what is original and what is secondary shows that he had only very 
vague notions of the relationship between the different recensions, versions 
and manuscripts. And the ignorance of this relationship is absolutely fatal 
to any attempt to discriminate between original readings and emendations and 
scribes’ mistakes. You can never find out an original reading by selecting 
one which suits your purpose, or satisfies your aesthetic sense, or appeals to 
you in some other way, and then looking about for reasons in support of your 
a priori choice; because almost always “ good ” reasons can be found for 
nearly every reading. It is not a qu^tion of dialectic, but £4} of documenta-

tion. And no amount of tendentious arguing will refute the objective evi- 
dence of MSS. 

MSS. in this case clearly prove that the process of alteration has been 
the reverse of what is imagined by Meyer. Here, it is evident, cesv^ah 
has not been changed into samkarah for the sake of clarity, as Meyer main- 
tains ; but, on the other hand, samkarah has been very clearly changed into 
cesvarah — already rendered suspect by the expletive ca — ^perhaps, to avoid 
confusion, samkara being here not the nomen proprium of Siva, but an epithet 
meaning “beneficent, promoting welfare 

We can now turn to the other word of the pada, the more difficult of the 
two: was it hdsyarupena, hamsarupena or yastirupena? Meyer (p. 5) 
rightly rejects the last. It is correct as far as the sense goes ; but it can hardly 
be the original reading. Were it so, no scribe would think of deliberately 
changing it into the obscure and almost unintelligible hdsyarupena or hanisaru- 
pena, both of which are, moreover, graphically unrelated with the former. 
From what we know of scribes’ emendations they tend generally to simplify 
the text, not to complicate it. If that be so, then either hdsyarupena or ham- 
sarupena i^ the correct reading. Moreover y astir upena is confined (like Vd- 
small) ^ to T G, and does not receive any support even from M, which in in- 
numerable cases has preserved — in contradiction to the T G version — the origi- 
nal reading, which has been emended or simplified in T G.^ 

There remains, therefore, only the two alternatives — hdsyarupena given 
by Ki M with the new Nepali MS, and hamsarupeum supported by N (ex- 
cept Kj ) . ByJ the test of the agreement between independent versions,'^ hds- 
yarupena is clearly indicated as the original reading, since we have here an 
agreement between the independent versions of the extreme North and the 
extreme South, it being preferable to hamsarupena, supported only by the 
central sub-recension. It is, moreover, undoubtedly the lectio diffidlwr (as 
was rightly observed by Winternitz in the course of the review mentioned 
above), which accounts for its being surreptitiously ousted by the other. 
Both documentary and intrinsic probability are thus unquestionably in fa- 
vour of the reading hdsyarupena adopted in the Critical Edition. 

What indeed are we to understand by the hamsarupetpa of the Vulgate ? 
The word hamsa has a number of meanings. Monier Williams gives the 
following : 

£51 a goose, gander, swan, flamingo (or other aquatic bird); the soul or spirit 
(sometimes 'the Universal Soul or Supreme Spirit’, identified with Viraj, Narayaoa,

son of Ari§ta ; of a son of Brahmadatta and general of Jarasamdha ; of various au- 
thors ; of one of the Moon’s horses ; of a mountain. 

Meyer (p. 6) has cited copious examples for the meanings of hmhsa 
as the sun, the sun-god, as Vii^inu and as Kr§iiia (son of Dharma). 

Unfortunately none of these fit in the case of Indra. Meyer (p. 6) 
found, however, a loophole in the meaning of hamsa as sungod”, and he sur- 
mised that perhaps the idea of this hamsarupa of Indra was to be dated back 
to the period when Indra was still recognized as a sun-god ! 

Nilakajitha, who has commented on this stanza, had naturally some diffi- 
culty in explaining this hamsarupa. According to him Indra was : hanisaru- 
pena yukto hamSarupt | tasya buddhisthasya rupasya visesariofh svayam eva 
etc. To Nilakaajtha the hamsa^iorm is present only in the mind (buddhistha) 
of the worshipper. To Meyer, on the other hand, who was a realist with a 
vengeance, this explanation naturally did not satisfy. According to him (p. 
4f.), Indra, who is ordinarily invisible to mortals, takes on the concrete form 
of a swan, so as to be visible to Vasu and his subjects. Meyer further found 
(p. 5) the aquatic bird admirably suited to the mirth and gaiety and the 
sportive games that accompany the ceremonial. 

Now which is the original and which is the emendation of these two 
readings ? The characteristic of a scribe’s emendation, as has been well said, 
is that it has all the appearance of improvement without its reality. Ours 
is a case in point, hiomsarupe^ is a phrase under which you can think all 
sorts of things, all equally vague ; but on closer inspection they prove to be 
uniformly inadequate. 

For why should Indra appear before Vasu, or the kings who followed in 
his footsteps, in the form of a swan of all things in the world, whether in a 
concrete shape before the eyes of his worshippers or in an abstract form 
in their minds ? He had assumed one form already : that of the ya^ti the 
staff. Meyer (p. 101) has himself established — ^absolutely incontrovertibly — 
that the tree or the pole or the staff which figures so prominently in the In- 
dramaha ceremony, was worshipped, if not by Vasu, at least by the people 
whom the writer of the Mahabharata account had in mind, as a symbol, {6} an 
image, or an incarnation of Indra himself, and not merely as a remembrance 
of a present from Indra to Vasu. As Meyer ha^ pointed out, the Puraqic 
writers, when speaking of the pde, refer to it unh^itatingly as Indra ” (or 
its synonyms “Sakra”, etc.) in such expressions as Sakr asthma or Indra-

r^pa 268, 6cd say in so many words that here is the god Indra himself, come 
to earth (bhumktha). 

And what a funny form to assume for the thousand-eyed god of gods, 
who had performed a hundred sacrifices, the wielder of the thunder-bolt, the 
destroyer of enemies’ forts, the killer of Vala (or Bala) and Vitra, and the 
hero of a thousand other wonderful exploits : the form of a bamboo staff, with 
wreaths and bells, flags and buntings hanging from it and with those curiously 
shaped pifakas, (sptne of which at any rate, according to Meyer 
(p. 96), were shaped like penies ! It was indeed a laughable form {hdsyaru- 
pa), calculated to provoke mirth and laughter. And this form, it must be 
borne in mind, was not given to Indra by any man ; such a thing would have 
been very likely resented by him. The great god, wishing to do good (iamka- 
ra) to Vasu, had assumed it himself {svayam eva grahitena) out of his great 
love for the high soul Uparicara Vasu {Vasoh prityd mahdtmanah). The 
jocular form — kriddvatdrarupa, as Devabodha^ puts it — assumed by the 
mighty god on this occasion caused great merriment ; and the feast was ac- 
cordingly celebrated with much laughter and gaiety, as described in the Bi*hat- 
samhita, the Vi§pudharmottara and other texts (Meyer, p. 103 f.). 

Thus both documentary probability and intrinsic considerations support 
the reading hdsyarupem ^amharah. This reading is therefore not so asto- 
nishing as Meyer seems to have thought ; but it is astonishing that 
Meyer who had with praiseworthy diligence extracted and trans- 
lated very lengthy passages from about a dozen original sources describing 
the ceremony in great detail, and not found anywhere (except in the Vul- 
gate) the remotest reference to Indra’s assuming the form of a ^wan or to his 
being represented as a swan, should have been so enamoured of the Vulgate 
leading, a reading which I am fully persuaded is nothing more than a scribe’s 
emendation in the archetype of the Central group. But perhaps even Meyer’s 
mistake is not so very astonishing : it is only an example of wishful think- 
ing. Does it not connect Indra with the sun (hamsa) {7} or at least with the 
sun-god ? And Meyer’s whole thesis (pp. 134-144) is that Indra was ori- 
ginally just not a rain-god or a thunder-god, but a sun-g)od, the vernal sun, 
the “ genius ” of fertility and vegetation, in fact, a phallic deity ! 

The redactors of the T G version were, perhaps, after all wise, in dis-

and adopted the plain and simple yastirupena Vd^avaJji, which is a correct 
paraphrase of the original and has the additional advantage of ibeing ab-

## The Parvasamgraha Figures 

The Parvasamgrahaparvan (Adi, adhy. 2) is a document of considerable 
importance.^ But its value has been unduly exaggerated by some scholars, 
a circumstance which has led to some highly misleading results and some 
curious conclusions It is thus supposed that Kr^na Dvaipayana Vyasa had 
himself counted and noted down the number of slokas he had composed, and 
that our Parvasamgraha was composed by Vyasa himself. No doubt it is 
sometimes stated in the Parvasarhgraha chapter that that sage had stated the 
extent of each of the eighteen parvans. But this attribution to Vyasa is 
naturally only pujarthe {honoris causa). It is nowhere suggested in the work 
itself that the first two adhyiayas of our epic were composed by Vyasa. They 
could not be, because they are obviously only a report of the conversation 
which took place between the Suta (Ugrasravas, son of Lomahar?ana) and 
the sages assembled at iSaunaka's twelve-year sacrifice in the Naimisa Forest. 
The erroneous supposition regarding the authorship of this adhyaya has led 
to the naive attempt on the part of some scholars to produce a text — a so- 
called critical text — of the Mahabharata containing the same number of 
adhyayas and slokas as that given in the Parvasarhgraha. Such an attempt 
is already negatived by our manuscripts and testimonia, which contain many 
variants of the figures in the Parvasarhgraha. Thus the figures for the Adi- 
parvan itself vary, according to different sources, between 7984 (Ka4mir|i 
Version and the Critical Edition) and 9984 (Andhra-6haratamu) . That is 
sufficient to discourage any attempt at too close a reliance on the data of this 
adhyaya of the Adiparvan. It has been common experience that figures in 
ancient works, if at all complicated, seldom come out right, and the figures 
of the Parvasamgraha are probably no exception to this rule.

but an accurate statement. And I have tried to substantiate this in this edition 
of the Principal Text of the Southern Recension.”

in one of many different ways. The most probable suggestion has been that 
they were arrived at, not by actual counting of the stanzas, as we should ordi- 
narily do now, but by computing the extent in some other way. Even now 
we speak of a story of 5000 words or a broadcast talk of 1500 words, and so 
on. The individual words are never counted in such computations ; the 
figures are only approximations. The figures given in our Parvasarhgraha 
chapter must be approximations of that type. They are not “ slokas"’ or 
stanzas as we ordinarily understand them ; but are, properly speaking, what 
are technically known as, “ granthas,’' a grantha being a unit of measurement 
of written matter equal to 32 ak^aras. 

Assuming this to be the case, the first difficulty is that the figures given 
in the lists appear not as round numbers, as we should expect them to be, but 
are apparently correct to the last digit ; for instance, the extent is given not 
as 8000 slokas, but as 7987. We actually come across such figures as these : 
6698, 7998, 8909, 14525, where true approximations would be 6700, 8000, 

8900, 14,500, and so on. The approximation seems to me to have been 

reached by some such process as this. First, an average was obtained by 
counting carefully all letters in a certain number of lines. This average was 
then multiplied by the number of lines in a page and the total number of 
complete pages. The number of “ granthas ” of the last page, which was 
rarely fully written out, seems to have been computed separately, and added 
to the previous total. The grand total of letters (ak^aras) was then divided 
by 32 to give the number of “ slokas or “ granthas,’’ fractions being omit- 
ted. That is how figures like those mentioned above must have been ob- 

tained. They are careful approximations, but approximations all the same. 
Moreover, as has been pointed out by me elsewhere,^ it would be impossible 
to count the exact number of stanzas in a composite text made up of slokas, 
tri§tubhs, “ fancy metres ” and prose passages, which we actually find in many 
of the parvans of the Mahabharata, as for instance in the Adi, Arapyaka and 
Anusasana. 

The figures we find in the Parvasamgraha chapter are fairly old ; we 
cannot say now exactly how old. They are certainly prior to 1000 A. D., 
when tlfe Javanese Bhdrata and the Andhra Bhdratamu were composed ; be- 
cause both these works contain similar lists, which agree in many particulars 
with our list. 

Here are the figures given in three different sources.

{552} The above is a conspectus of the figures for the adhyayas and slo- 
kas of the eighteen parvans of the Mahabhiarata according to (1) the Criti- 
cal Edition, (2) the Javanese Version,^ and (3) the Southern Recension by 
Professor P. P. S. Sastri. 

Observations on the Figures of the above Table. 

I. Adi : The first figure (8) of the Javanese number for the adhyayas 
of the Adi (818) is obviously wrong ; the other digits agree in the three texts. 
So we may take as correct the figures 218 , *2 which is given us by the Critical 
Edition and Southern Recension, the Vulgate reading (227) being certainly 
a mistake. — The number of slokas is no doubt a problem. I have adopted 
the figures given by the ;§aradia MS. and one “ K ” MS. (Ki),^ which is con- 
firmed by the Rajaguru MS. from Nepal,^ and I am still inclined to suppose 
that that was the original figure. The Javanese and Southern figures 8884 and 
9884 respectively differ by 1000 exactly, the Javanese figure being the same 
as that of the Mid-Indian group (Bengali-Devanagari). 

II. Sabhd : Tbe numbers are here absolutely certain. As regards the 
adhyayas, there is perfect agreement between the three sources, all of them 
giving 72, which is also the exact number of adhyiayas of our Critical Edi- 
tion of the Sabhia now passing through the press. The Vulgate figure (78) 
for the sloka is therefore unquestionably wrong. — The sloka number is also 
certainly 2511, as the Southern Recension, in which the first figure has been 
increased to 4, is demonstrably inflated to make it conform with the inter- 
polated text, and the additional stanzas of the Southern Recension do 
approximately amount to 2()(X). The correct figures for Sabha are therefore 72 
and 2511. 

{553} III. Aranyaka (commonly known as Vana) : As regards the 
adhyayas, the Javanese records 272 against the concordant figure 269 of all 
Indian version^. The latter may be taken to be the right figure, the discre- 
pancy of the Javanese, which is negligible, remaining unexplained. — The 
same is true of the figure for the slokas, the concordant figure (11,664) of 
all Indian versions being the original Parvasamgraha figure. 

IV. Virdfa : The Javanese figure for the adhyayas is unfortunately 
missing. But as our Critical Edition of the Virataparva has successfully

parwa, Oudjavaansch prazageschrijt, Gravenhage, 1906. pp. 5-6. The passage is re- 
produced in a note by H. Kern, “ Inhoudsopgave van T Mahabharata in T Ka- 
wi ” in Bijdfagen, set III, Vol. IV, pp. 92-95, Kern has given in this paper a com- 
parative table of the Indian and the Javanese figures.

and that it ^ould be 218.

identified the adhyiayas on the basis of the colophons given in MSS., there is 
no reason to doubt that the correct figure is 67, as given by the Sanskrit 
Parvaisarhgraha. — The three sources give three different figures for the slokas. 
The Southern Recension is obviously inflated, and may therefore be ignored, 
its figure having been revised — as in Sabha — ^to accord with its interpolated 
text. It is likely that the Javanese translator has confused the Sahskrit words 
for 50 and 15 {pmcasat and pancadaia). The first two digits of the figures 
given in the Critical Edition alnd the Javanese Version do agree. We may 
therefore reasonably assume the original figure to be 2050, which is given by 
the Critical Edition of the Parvasamgraha, though the two last digits natu- 
rally remain somewhat uncertain.^ 

V. Udyoga : The three sources agreeing exactly as regards the num- 
ber of adhydyas of the Udyoga, the figure 186 may be taken as certain. — The 
figures for the slokas, on the other hand, are in a chaotic condition, the three 
texts giving three different figures 6698, 6928, 7998 ; which agree only in 
respect of the last digit ! The figures for the slokas remain, therefore, 
doubtful. 

VI. iBhi^ma : The number of adhydyas in the Bhii§ma is given by the 
Critical Edition and the Javanese Version as 117, but the Southern Recension 
gives their number as 118. In any case, the difference is not very significant, 
and the number may be assumed to be 117 or 118 — There is no such doubt re- 
garding the number of slokas, which is unanimously given as 5884. 

VII. Drom : There is likewise considerable agreement as regards the 
adhydyas and slokas of the Dronja. The adhydya number {554} is 170. — As 
regards the number of slokas, the first two digits (89) are certain. And since 
both the Critical Edition and the Southern Recension agree on the figure 8909, 
that is indicated as the correct figure. The probability in fafvour of this 
figure is strengthened owing to the circumstance that the last two figures of 
the Javanese Version (84) are in all probability due tp contamination with 
the previous sldsa-figure 5884, which ends in 84. We may therefore adopt 
with confidence the concordant figure of the Indian versions 8909, the differ- 
ence between the Javanese and the Indian numbers being 75 ; the 
error is in any event not more than 1 per cent. 

VIII. : The figures for Kanja are exactly of the same type. 
The three sources agree in giving 69 as the number of adhydyas.— The Java- 
nese MSS. give ithe number of slokas as 970, which is obviously wrong, it 
being almost certain that the word for 4000 has been omitted by the scribe 
by oversight f so we get the original Javanese figure as [4]970. We may

nfistake in the Javanese text.

tentatively adopt the figure 4900, on the concordant evidence of Indian ver- 
sions. The difference between the Indian and Javanese figures being only 
70, the discrepancy is only about 1-4 per cent. 

IXi. Salya : In this parvan there is fortunately no doubt about the 
sloka number, which is unanimously given a‘s 3220. — And again, fortunately, 
as regards the adhyaya number, the discrepancy between the Indian (59) and 
Javanese (121) figures is so great that the Javanese may be ruled out as 
hopelessly corrupt. There is another test we may apply, the Javanese figure^ 
(121) for adhyayas gives the average of about 27 slokas to an adhyaya, while 
the Indian average is 54. Now the total number of adhyayas in the Maha- 
bharata i^ supposed to be 2000, and the number of stanzas 100,000 (^ta- 
sahasriaiui® ) , which ogives the average of slokas to an adhyaya as 50 and that 
is much nealrer the average for the Indian figure for the adhyiaya number of 
the 6alyaparvani than the Javanese figure. 

X. Sauptika : The figures for the Sauptika call for no remarks. They 
are uniformaly given in all thel three sources as 18 and 870 respectively. 

£555} XI. Strl : The sources do not agree as regards the number 
of adhyayas, but the Javanese figure (70) which is nearly two and half times 
as large as the Indian (27) is extremely improbable.^ We may therefore 
tentatively take the concordant Indian figure (27) as correct. — The difference 
between the Javanese and Indian figures for the slokas is only five. It would 
seem that the last digit waS lost in the Javanese tradition ; if that be so, the 
correct number is 775, as given unanimously by the Indian MSS. 

XII. Sdnti : The sloka figure for Santi (14,525) is given unanimously 
by all the three of our sources, which is a fortunate coincidence and also a 
remarkable prooif of the reliability of our tradition. The Vulgate figure 
(14,725) for the slokas is positively wrong. — ^There is a difference of only six 
between the Javanese and Indian figures for adhyayas^ the Indian tradition 
giving the figure as 339, the Javanese as 333. The agreement between the 
different Indian versions is a weighty point in favour of 339, which we may 
tentatively assume to be the correct figure. 

XIIL Amddsana : iThe evidence of the Javanese Version is unfortu- 
nately missing, the version ignoring this palrvan altogether, for some reason 
which it is hard to guess. It cannot be argued that it; is included in the 
Sinti, since there is no appreciable increase in the number of adhyayas or

suspicious,

EPIC QUESTIONS 


4lokaa of the Javanese Version of the Santi, as there would surely have been, 
had the two parvans been amalgamated as is done sometimes^ There 
being also no agreement between the various Indian versions, the figures for 
both adhyiaysLs and ^lokas of the Anu^sana remain uncertain. 

XIV. Asvamedhika : The number of adhydyas is unanimously given 
as 133, which may therefore be accepted as the correct figure. — ^There is a 
discrepancy as regards the number of slokas : the! Critical Edition gives the 
figure as 3320, while the Javanese and the {556} Southern Recension agree in 
giving the figure} asl 4420, this being one of the rare instances in which the 
Javanese and the Southern Recension agree against the Northern Recension. 
The Southern Recension contains here an additional sub-parvaln, comprising 
23 adhyayas and about 1700 Slokas, known as the Vaismavadharma parvan. 
There is no mention of any such parvan in the list of 100 pavans, given in 
the Pa!rvasamgraha, though some Southern MSS. do insert, in another place, 
a line which mentions the Vaistiavadharma among the contents of the Ai§va- 
medhika. In this Section, Yudhi§thira is instructed by iSr!-K|^a in the 
Dharma of the Vaisiriavas, which seems hardly necessary, after the instruc- 
tion he had received from Bha§ma in more than 21,000 stanzas on general 
Dharma (iS^ti and Anu^sana). The higher Southern number must there- 
fore be rega!rded as due to this inflation, and can in any case not be accepted. 
Nevertheless the peculiar agreement between the Javanese and the Southern 
is a disturbing factor. The number therefore may be regarded as doubtful. 

XV. Asrmuwdsika : There is not much doubt about the adhyayas of 
this parvan, though the Javanese Version has a high figure (92) i against the 
unanimous Indian figure 42, which may be assumed to be the correct figure.^ 
— ^As regards the number of slokas, there is a slight discrepancy of 2 between 
the Critical Edition and the Javanese Version, the former being 1506, the 
latter 1508. But the last digit in this number is not in doubt ; it must be 
six. The Southern Recension gives the figure 1906, which must be regarded 
as extremely doubtful, since even Professor Sastri, who has edited the 
Southern Recension, could not find more than 1108^ stanzas for this parvan.® 
There has been clearly a mistake in the countingl of the stanzas of this par- 

^ It is peihaps worth noticing that so late a commentator as Vadiraja (cf. 
P. K. Gone, ABORI, vol. 17, pp. 200^210, who assigns him to the seventeenth 
century), treats the Santi and Anu^sana as one parvan and has colophons like : 

—which ia quoted by Profeaaor P. S. Sastri in the Introduction to vrf. 17, 
(Anu^sana Parvan, part 2,) p. xxiv. 

2 Kern (lac, cit.) likewise suggests reading 42 for 92 of the Javanese. 

® It is interesting to note, as pointed out by Professor Sastri, Nannaya’s 
Andhra-Bhdratamu gives 1106 as the figure of slokas in the A4raiuav&$ika parvan, 
That probably is due to a fresh count, 



Ei>ic oufestiONS ii

van, and the Southern figure being palpably incorrect, we may utilize the 
approximate agreement between the Critical Editirm and the Javanese Ver- 
sion and adopt 1506 aa the probable original Parvasamgraha figure for the 
A^ramavasika. 

XVI. Mausala : All sources agree in giving the number of adhyayas 
aa 8 and the number of slokas aa 300, which may accordingly be taken as the 
correct figures. The text also seems to con-j;557}-tain; actually 300 stanzas. 
Consequently the vulgate reading 320, in the Parvasamgraha chapter, is 
clearly faulty and has been properly rejected. 

XVII. Mahaprasthdnika ; The Javanese figure for the number of 
adhyayas ia missing ; but the Indian sources, including the MSS., uniformly 
divide this short parvan into three adhyayals ; and the unanimous Indian 
reading cannot be called into question.— The number of slokas may also be 
regarded as correctly given in the Critical Edition, which is supported by the 
Southern Recension, though the Javanese Version adds, erroneously, three to 
the number, giving the figure as 123. I surmise that this addition of three to 
the 41oka number is a wrong tran^sition from the adhySya number, which 
is missing in 'die Javanese Version. The Vulgate figure (320) for the slokas 
is absurd and unquesticmably incorrect. 

XVIII,. SvatgoTohatia ; As in the previous case the adhyaya number 
is lost in the Javanese Version ; but there cannot be any doubt that the cor- 
rect figure is 5, which is given by all editions and MSS. of the Mahabharata. 
—The sloka number is unanimously given, by our three sources, as 200, which 
is a sufficiently correct approximation of the actual extent of this last parvan 
of the Great Epic ; and the Vulgate figure (209) may be unhesitatingly 
rejected. 

The table on the following page gives the figures for the adhyayas 
and slokas, book by book, arrived at by a collation of ’ the various extant 
versions of the Parvasarngraha chapter of the Adiparvah.
