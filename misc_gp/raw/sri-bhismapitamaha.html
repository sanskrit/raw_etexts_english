<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-2">Preface</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">PitŒmaha Bh¶¦ma has his distinguished place among the characters of MahŒbhŒrata. He was an ideal father-devotee, an ideal truthful, an ideal brave, a great scholar of Dharma, knower of the Divinity and a great devotee of God. The Lord K¾¦Äa, Himself, had mentioned appreciating his deep knowledge that—‘After the departure of Bh¶¦ma from this world, the total knowledge will be vanished. There is none else in the world except Bh¶¦ma to dispel the doubts of the confusing subjects of the world.’ PitŒmaha Bh¶¦ma’s character is the most pious and ideal from all points of views. It is Bh¶¦ma only similar to the great soul Bh¶¦ma. On account of being bound to his vow, there could be no issue to Bh¶¦ma, yet he is the grandfather of the whole world. Even today, the ‘TraivarÄika Hindus’ (BrŒhmaÄa, K¦atriya and VaiÜya) offer him handful of water while libating to their forefathers. Composing the brief life-sketch of such an ideal great man Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha, SwŒm¶ Ýr¶ AkhaÄÎŒnandaj¶ MahŒrŒja has done a great service to the people of India. This character was penned down long before but by the grace of God now, the auspicious opportunity has come to get it published. It is useful to all old-young, man-woman everyone and it is to sanctify the lives of all and sundry. It is expected that the readers will be benefited by it.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">Introduction of the Dynasty and Birth</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This world-creation is the playful activity of the Lord. It is very difficult to know its magnitude and division and sub-division and describe it just as of the Lord. At present, the cosmos, wherein we are living, is in the infinite space not more existent than an atom. In this universe even there are several gross, subtle and causal worlds and all of them are mutually related to one another. This gross earth, whereupon we live, is not protected and initiated by the living beings of this earth only; but the gods and demi-gods of subtle and causal worlds and saints, great men always remain engaged in its protection. From time to time, ever- liberated persons descend from the divine world and propagate Dharma, morality, righteousness, knowledge, happiness and peace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Such great souls are the members of Lord BrahmŒ’s assembly who have attained the Divine world with the power of their worship and devotion, they share the activities of Lord BrahmŒ, residing and aboding with Him and after completion of span of life, they too are liberated with Him. There are some who come back also from there, engage themselves in the welfare activities of the world and somedays when latencies of their desires are thoroughly dismissed, they are liberated again. Ýr¶ MahŒbhi¦akj¶’s name is very popular among those who attained the Divine world. He was an extremely pious king of Ik¦wŒku dynasty and by virtue of his meritorious deeds, he has attained such a supreme state.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, BrahmŒ’s assembly was in progress. Sages, great sages, hermits-saints, gods-demigods and all the members were occupying their own seats. The subjects in discussion was how to bring about maximum peace and happiness in the world? The only idea that was haunting their mind was that some exalted persons be sent and descending on the Earth, they should do good to all and sundry. At the same time, the presiding deity of the river Ganges Ýr¶ GaÆgŒj¶ happened to come there. All of them welcomed her. It was a matter of chance, that with a mild gust of wind her side corner of the <span class="char-style-override-7">s</span>ar¶ soared, all downcasted their eyes at once. Who is there not to obey the moral rules of propriety in the Divine world (Brahmaloka)?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was the God’s will, it was the pastime of the Lord. MahŒtmŒ MahŒbhi¦ak’s eyes did not lower down, he remained staring at GaÆgŒ without any shyness and hesitation. God knows what was there in his mind; but outwardly it was certainly violation of rules of the Divine world at all. So in the open council of the assembly in full strength, BrahmŒ said to MahŒbhi¦ak—‘Brother! You have violated the rules of this world, so, go to the mortal world for some days. Apart from supervising the work there, you will get the punishment also side by side for transgression of the moral rules. There is one thing more—Ýr¶ GaÆgŒj¶ has looked beautiful, sweet and attractive to you. It was your attraction towards her that you remained staring at her, so, going to the mortal world you will experience how hard-hearted GaÆgŒ is, to whom you were attracted so much, you will find what unpleasant acts she renders to you!’ MahŒbhi¦ak respectfully accepted BrahmŒ’s order. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A great magnanimous king, MahŒrŒjŒ Prat¶pa was Emperor of the earth those days. He had acquired the capacity to do good to the subjects by performing a severe penance and there was no other dynasty more pious, reputed and deserving than that. Ýr¶ MahŒbhi¦ak considered it better to be born as his son and by the permission of BrahmŒ, coming to him, he incarnated as his son. Like the moon of bright fortnight of a month, he began to grow up and his sharp talent, keen interest in the public welfare, promptness in his duty, became the cause of the king Prat¶pa’s attention towards his good education and the king made proper arrangement for his good education. In a very short time he became expert in all the spheres of knowledge and specially competent in archery. His special characteristic quality was that if he put his hand on the head of any old or sick person, he used to be quite well and healthy. That is why, he became famous by the name of ‘ÝŒntanu’. In the old age of Prat¶pa, ÝŒntanu had been born, so he was waiting for when his son might be able one and having handed over to him the duty and responsibility of ruling the subjects affectionately, he might go to the forest.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, Prat¶pa said to ÝŒntanu—‘Son! Now, you have grown up an able one from all point of view. I have become old. Now, I will perform penance leading an ascetic life, you look after the royal affairs. I tell you one thing more—A nymph of divine beauty wants to marry you. My son! You should marry her and fulfil her all the desires. She will meet you at a secluded place at an opportune time. My son! This is my last order for you.’ Having stated so, Prat¶pa got his all the subjects gathered and with unanimous consent, performed ÝŒntanu’s coronation and he himself set out for the forest to practise penance.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When GaÆgŒj¶ began to return from the divine world, all the events of the Divine world began to haunt her mind again and again. The soaring up of her body-clothes with a sudden gust of wind, MahŒbhi¦ak’s continuous staring, the curse of BrahmŒ etc., all these events began to haunt in her mind again and again. She began to think—‘It was I who have become the cause of the curse to MahŒbhi¦ak and leaving the Divine world, he has to go to the mortal world. Either directly or indirectly it is I who is the reason behind all these events, at all cost, I must do something. While GaÆgŒj¶ was just thinking this, her eyes fell towards an other direction, all the eight Vasus were coming downwards from the Heaven. A great curiosity was created in her mind, She asked the gods—‘O gods! Whether there is all well in the Heaven, why are all of you, the eight in number going together down on the Earth?’ The gods said—‘Mother! We all have been cursed to take birth in the mortal world. Undoubtedly, a little sin had been committed by us, but it was not so great a sin that such a severe punishment should be given to us. The fact was that the great sage Vasi¦¢ha was offering SandhyŒ prayer, secretly. We did not recognise him and without saluting him we proceeded onward. Considering this guilt done deliberately and taking it as the violation of propriety, he cursed us to take birth in human species. He is God-realised person, his speech cannot be untrue; but mother! We don’t want to be born from the womb of any worldly woman. Now, we are in your shelter and we pray to you to conceive us in your own foetus. Make us directly your own infant.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This appealed to the mind of GaÆgŒ, she said—‘Well tell me whom do you prefer to make your father?’ The gods said—‘We want to be born to the great king, ÝŒntanu, the son of the great and glorious king, Prat¶pa. GaÆgŒ said—‘Alright, your view is in consonance with my view. I too, want to please the great king, ÝŒntanu. It will kill two birds with one stone. I will be able to please and do good to him and your prayer will be fulfilled.’ The gods said—‘Mother! You will have to do one thing more. We don’t want to live in the humanly body for a long time, so just after birth, kindly, throw us into your water, as a result, the curse of the sage will also be acted upon and soon we will get salvation too.’ GaÆgŒ said—‘I accept your prayer, but there is one thing that must be done by you. ‘The birth of the son by ÝŒntanu through me should not be in vain. At least one son must remain alive.’ The Vasus said—‘We each will give over the eighth portion of our effulgence to youngest brother Dyo-named Vasu and he will stay on the earth for sometime. He will be magnanimous but his lineage will not continue’. GaÆgŒ agreed and Vasus went away to their respective abodes. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The great king; ÝŒntanu was nourishing the subjects with the best possible ability. In his kingdom none felt miserable. He used to find out the prior solution of any possible future disaster or untoward happening. He, himself, used to go among the subjects and find out their joys and sufferings and searched out the way for their welfare. One day, while walking, he reached the bank of the GaÆgŒj¶, adored by Siddhas and CŒraÄas. He saw a woman of matchless beauty and glow like goddess Lak¦m¶ wandering there. He became very eager to know something about her. He saw that she was staring at him lovingly and there was some indication from her side to have some talk with him. Having guessed her inner feelings, the Emperor ÝŒntanu asked her—‘Goddess! Who are you? Are you any divine being or female devil, are you the daughter of Gandharva race or serpentine race, it is impossible among the mankind to be such outstanding charming nymph like you. Is it so, as you are the same woman of divine beauty whose hint had been given to me by my father? Really, if it is so, oblige to accept me.’ Glancing towards the king with a mild and sweet smile GaÆgŒ Dev¶ said keeping in her mind the utterance of the Vasus—‘O the king! In fact, I am the same, I will fulfil your desire and I will obey your orders; but you too, will have to make a promise. Whatever the behaviour it may be, either favourable or unfavourable to you, is done by me, neither restrain me from doing so nor speak any harsh word to me. So long as you will keep this promise, I will remain with you till then, the day, you violate it by restraining me from doing so, or speak any harsh word to me, I will depart from you that very moment.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king agreed to the condition of GaÆgŒ and very gladly he brought her to the capital having seated her on his chariot. They both began to live happily. Keeping his vow ÝŒntanu never querried to know about her anything. He was very much pleased with his wife’s character, behaviour, generosity and her devoted sense of service and began to lead his life with peace and happiness. Time waits for none. It never takes too long to pass on. The good days of happiness pass away very soon. A number of years passed, but to the king it seemed to be a very short period of time. In order, seven children were born and GaÆgŒ used to throw them into her water, asserting that she did so only to please him (Vasu). This work of GaÆgŒ was much unpleasant to the king, but due to the fear of GaÆgŒ’s separation, he could not raise any objection. When the eighth son was born, then also GaÆgŒ was going to throw the child with a smile on her face, but this time, the king could not control himself. He said to GaÆgŒ to let the child’s life be saved—‘Hey RŒma! Who are you? While killing your own children with such cruelty, do you not feel miserable? You are a murderer and sinner. At least, do tell me your name? GaÆgŒ said—‘If you want, you may keep this child with you gladly. I will not kill him now. Due to this son you will be called an eminent father. Now, I will not stay with you, my stay period has been completed. My father is Jahnu, the royal sage, my name is GaÆgŒ, great sages are there to attend me, I stayed with you for so long to serve the purpose of gods. All these eight sons are Vasu gods. They had to take birth in the human species on the curse of Vasi¦¢ha. You became their father and I became their mother as per their will. It was according to their prayer that I have thrown them into my water so that they may be liberated from birth in human species. I had got the gods promised to let one son remain alive. Now, this son will remain alive and I depart. It is now, I am taking him away with me. There he will study and learn something and when he becomes mature, he will come back to you.’ Having stated so, GaÆgŒ Dev¶ disappeared with the eighth son. The same Dyo-named Vasu, being the son of ÝŒntanu, known by the name Devavrata and later on became famous by the name of Bh¶¦ma.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">Great Sacrifice for the sake of Father</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The world literally means, which moves slowly. In other words, the continuous change is the form of this world. One who is dear today, may he unfavourable and one who is not favourite today, will be favourite tomorrow. Every moment, the nearest objects become the farthest one and the farthest objects become the nearest one. From eternity, in the flowing current, God knows, wherefrom the objects like straw come and flow together but the next moment, they are separated from each other. If any living being desires to keep a particular object of the world always with him or he should never part with it, this is impossible. It can never be so. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The same GaÆgŒ for the sake of whom MahŒbhi¦ak had desired to adopt her as his own, having violated the rules of BrahmŒ-assembly and had seen the murder of his seven sons before his own eyes due to attachment, went away leaving ÝŒntanu. The son, for the sake of whom ÝŒntanu violated his promise, and accepted even the separation from GaÆgŒ, it might be for a very short time, went away with GaÆgŒ. ÝŒntanu’s eyes opened. His inclination and liking to the religion was already there in him—it had strengthened now more. There was none unhappy in his kingdom. All and sundry got engaged in YajÛas, charity and penance. The social system based on VarÄŒÜrama Dharma was strengthened. ÝŒntanu had no attachment or aversion to anyone. His righteousness, truthfulness and his simplicity was popular all around far and wide. Everyone had due regard for his valour. In spite of his immense strength, he was of forgiving disposition like earth. None caused any trouble to any living being in his kingdom, no creature was the prey of violence. Violence was forbidden at all in his entire kingdom. He considered all the afflicted persons, helpless one, animals-birds etc., as his own son. By his impact, all the subjects were becoming righteous and that is why, all the kings jointly had awarded him the title of ‘<span class="char-style-override-7">e</span>mperor’ (king of kings) unanimously.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He had only one worry in his mind. He always remained eager to view his son, Devavrata. He used to think of him always and remained restless to think how to get his son. It is a matter of great astonishment as how and why the desire of such a righteous and God- devoted person was not fulfilled; but the delay in the meeting of his son to him was also in his own interest as well as in the interest of his son, because all the Divine dispensations are full of Divine mercy and love and it is beneficial for the entire universe. The Emperor ÝŒntanu too, kept on waiting for the Divine grace, keeping faith in the divine dispensation. One day or the other, his desire will be fulfilled certainly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, the Emperor ÝŒntanu reached the bank of the Ganges river while walking. He was amazed greatly to see the water level of the Ganges having receded to a great extent. He began to think to himself what the reason was that the Ganges was as if becoming emaciated that day; her fast current of waves are not seen along the bank of GaÆgŒ. He began to move ahead towards the water coming from. After going awhile he saw that a tall and well-built bodied very healthy, strong and handsome boy having the splendid glow and valorous like Indra was using his Divine weapons, by checking the current of GaÆgŒ with his arrows. His mind began to whirl seeing this wonderful and unnatural act for the mankind. He had seen only once his son at the birth time, so he failed to recognise his vigorous son; but this boy had recognised his father. He mentally saluted him and he disappeared from there to attract him towards himself. The Emperor ÝŒntanu searched out him here and there being astonished; but he could not get his trace anywhere.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Addressing GaÆgŒj¶, he said—‘Goddess! Who is this boy, who has disappeared just now and whom does he belong to? I want to see him again!’ Hearing the prayer of the king, the presiding deity of the Ganges river, well dressed with clothes and ornaments, GaÆgŒ in the female guise, holding the right hand of Devavrata, came before the Emperor. GaÆgŒ disclosed before him—‘This is the boy born of my eighth pregnancy, he has studied all the fields of knowledge. No brave can face him in the battlefield, his potency and valour is boundless. This son of yours has studied the Vedas and all its six branches completely under the guidance of the great sage Vasi¦¢ha. This boy has learnt all those skills and science which is known to ÝukrŒcŒrya, the Guru of demons and he has learnt all that whatever B¾haspati, the Guru of the gods knows; this boy has learnt all this. The gods and the devils both love him; what else, even the great sage, ParaÜurŒma, the embodiment of the Lord himself, has given him all his divine and infallible arms. He is self-restrained of high rank, virtuous, righteous, a great devotee of the God and the knower of Truth. Now, I hand him over to you, please, take him with you.’ Meeting his son, ÝŒntanu was highly delighted. His joys had no bound. He along with Devavrata returned to capital. He appointed Devavrata as crown-prince. The subjects as a whole got delighted with his noble character and simplicity. The king, ÝŒntanu, having handed over the entire royal responsibility to Devavrata, began to lead a carefree life. Thus, four years passed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lord’s frolicsome activities are not known, when and what will He inspire in the mind of anyone whosoever he may be? What purpose will He get served when and through whose body? It is only He, who knows it. Having made Devavrata, the crown-prince, ÝŒntanu had become carefree. None expected at all that he would again be sensual and he would again be involved with the worldly affairs. Now, it was the thinking of all that he had such a big empire, he has a son like Devavrata, he would spend his whole time in the worship of Lord only, but God’s will was otherwise. It was the will of God to get him still remarried and generate a great dynasty and it happened so even. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, while roaming about, he reached the bank of YamunŒ river. There, it was spreading a divine and wonderful fragrance. ÝŒntanu got very much delighted and began to find out wherefrom the fragrance was coming. Moving ahead he happened to see an exquisitely beautiful girl. Seeing her, he asked—‘Who are you and why have you come here?’ The girl replied—‘I am the daughter of DŒÜarŒja, and I help the visitors to cross the river from here by boat.’ The <span class="char-style-override-7">e</span>mperor ÝŒntanu got fascinated seeing her beauty and then approaching her foster god-father Ni¦ŒdarŒja, he expressed his desire. DŒÜarŒja said—‘Your majesty! It is well known to all that a daughter cannot be kept at her paternal home. She will have to be given to someone or the other. I have no objection to give her to you, you are the king of the country. What better fortune for me can be if she serves you, becoming your own. You are truthful, I have full faith in your words. It is my heartiest desire also to hand over my daughter to such a worthy and suitable person like you, yet I have already taken a vow. If you may fulfil it, there will be left no hindrance in handing over my daughter to you.’ ÝŒntanu asked—‘Brother! What you mean to say? Speak frankly. Having heard you, if it is worth my doing and your vow is under my capacity to fulfil, I will certainly do it. If being beyond my capacity, I will be helpless.’ DŒÜarŒja said—‘Lord! It is my resolve that the son born of her pregnancy will be heir to the kingdom. You will not be able to make the king to any other son born of the pregnancy of the else queen.’ The Emperor ÝŒntanu could not fulfil the prayer of DŒÜarŒja, though his mind was captivated by her, his life had come under her sway, yet being overpowered by sense of the duty and affection of Devavrata he did not accept it, he returned to his royal palace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even when the Emperor ÝŒntanu reached his capital, he could not forget that beautiful maiden. She used to haunt his mind intermittently. Due to anxiety, his condition became deplorable. His anxiety could not remain hidden from Devavrata. Going to him in a lonely place he asked—‘Father! With the worldly point of view nothing has gone wrong against you that may assail you any harm. All the kings obey you and the subjects are happy. There looks no symptom of any disease even in your body, I am hale and hearty and happy. Then, yet what is the cause of your anxiety? Do you remain absorbed in thinking about myself? If it is true, then do tell me frankly. Since a number of days I have marked attentively that you don’t go outside riding the horse, your glow is deteriorating day by day. Your body is growing to be pale and tardy. What is that agony disturbing your mind so much? Kindly tell me frankly, I will try my best to remove it.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">ÝŒntanu did not give him any clear reply, he said only—‘Son! You are my only son. You have a great interest in arms and weapons and there is passion of war in you. May God protect you from any  misery! But I remain always worried to see the transience of human life. Considering that you are alone one superior to even hundreds of sons, I don’t marry again and don’t generate any son.’ Though, ÝŒntanu did not disclose his feelings clearly, yet for Devavrata it took no time to understand, he was extraordinary intelligent. Going to the old minister and well-wisher of his father, he asked him the reason of his father’s anxiety. There he came to know all about explicitly. With the old K¦atriya family members and the ministers he journeyed to the DŒÜarŒja’s residence. After duly adoring Devavrata, DŒÜarŒja entreated him paying due regards to all, he made a prayer to order him for his appropriate service. Devavrata begged for his daughter, Satyavat¶ for the sake of his father. DŒÜarŒja said—‘Prince! You are the superior most among the Bharata race.’ When you yourself are offering this proposal from your own mouth, then, how can I ignore it? Even Indra will have to repent having rejected such a praiseworthy and humble proposal, then how can I? It is well known to you and if you don’t know, then better you know it that she is not my legitimate daughter. She is the non-placental daughter of righteous king Uparicara like you and the great sage ParŒÜara has made her fragrant by his grace and he has washed away her all the blemishes. Her father too, had reminded me again and again to marry her to the king, ÝŒntanu alone. The great sage, Asit had asked for this girl, but I did not accept his offer. I am the father of this girl, so it is not improper to say something in her interest, kindly, pardon me for my impudence. It appears a flaw in giving this girl to your father; that is ‘the enmity from a powerful’; because the son born of her pregnancy, may fight against you for the kingdom and it is certain that anyone who stands as your rival, will be ruined. Whosoever they may be—gods, demons, Gandharvas, and so one cannot remain alive going against you. It is enough! It is the only fear that creates hesitation in my mind to marry her to your father.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The prince said solemnly before all, assuring with the promise—‘DŒÜarŒja’! I will fulfil your desire for the sake of my father’s pleasure. I take vow to assure you that the son born of the womb of your daughter, will be entitled to the kingship. I assert on oath truthfully. My promise can never be false, such a man of promise neither has been born till now nor will be born in future on the earth.’*</p>

<p class="Footnotes-Bold">योऽस्यां जनिष्यते पुत्र: स नो राजा भविष्यति॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the vow of Devavrata, all the K¦atriyas began to applaud—‘Well done! Excellent!’ All unanimously began to praise him with one voice. But DŒÜarŒja was yet not satisfied, he wanted him to take a harder vow than this. If he had not made him to take such an oath, Bh¶¦ma would have not been so much reputed and glorious in the world today. In fact, it was due to his vow that Bh¶¦ma was named Bh¶¦ma. Sometimes, there remains hidden the most valuable thing in spite of appearing outwardly, very harsh and cruel act.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Well, then DŒÜarŒja asked Bh¶¦ma to take a stiffer promise. He said—‘You are righteous and worthy, you are the son of the Emperor; ÝŒntanu and his representative as well. I have full faith in whatever you say. You will never deviate from your words, but I have to say something more in this context. On account of my too much attachment and love for my daughter, I will not be satisfied unless doing whatever I can do for her betterment. It is what I have to say that you have given the words of promise, no doubt; but probably it may be that your son might deprive of Satyavat¶’s son from kingship. He might not keep your promise. To remove this suspicion what can you do? I want to know it.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having heard DŒÜarŒja, the Prince, Devavrata being devoted to truthfulness, took his vow for the pleasure of his father. He said—‘DŒÜarŒja! I assure you by giving you the true words of promise before the present kings, and ministers and the elderly persons that my firm determination can never be shaken, I have already given up the kingship. Now, regarding the son, I promise to remain celibate all my life. Because of being issueless there will not be any obstacle for me in getting salvation, God will be graceful to me. I am very much pleased with DŒÜarŒja because it is his kindness upon me, which provided me an opportunity to make such a promise and now, I will be able to devote my life in the worship of God leading the life of a celibate.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having heard the unearthly words of Bh¶¦ma, the devotee DŒÜarŒja’s the whole body got thrilled and being very much delighted, he gave words to hand over his daughter. At that moment, the sages and gods residing in the space, rained flowers on Bh¶¦ma and praised him shouting—‘It is Bh¶¦ma, it is Bh¶¦ma.’ It is this hard vow that made Devavrata as Bh¶¦ma by name. Having seated Satyavat¶ on the chariot, he came back to HastinŒpura accompanied by all and prayed to his father at his feet. All and sundry began to praise Bh¶¦ma. Having seen and heard this arduous act by Bh¶¦ma, ÝŒntanu became overjoyed and he granted him the boon of ‘death at his will.’ He said—‘Bh¶¦ma! So long as you desire to remain alive, the Death cannot come even so close to you. When you order her, thenafter getting your permission, death will have her control on you. Bh¶¦ma! In fact, you are sinless. Really, I am not granting you any boon, it is simply the trivial reward of your pure-heartedness.’*</p>

<p class="Footnotes-Bold">त्वत्तो ह्यनुज्ञां सम्प्राप्य मृत्यु: प्रभवितानघ॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">ÝŒntanu kept pretty Satyavat¶ endowed with youthfulness and outstanding beautiful appearence in his gynaecium. After consulting the astrologers, he married her at the most auspicious moment and they both began to live happily.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦ma was the great scholar of all the scriptures. Having studied and pondered over them, he had made up his mind that there is nothing substantial in the world. If there is any fruitfulness of life, that is only the worship of the Lord. Even before the marriage of ÝŒntanu, he used to share the royal responsibility considering it his duty and the Lord’s command, and now, it came to be a better opportunity and chance for him. If there was the least trace of any attachment in the past, that also got vanished. At least, his mind has no attraction for any lady or gold. He is free from the worldly desires. He fulfilled his duty of nourishing subjects even now wholeheartedly, tried his best to win his father’s pleasure by all the means and always remembered the Lord. Thus, a long time passed.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">The Birth of CitrŒÆgada and Vicitrav¶rya, Royal Enjoyment, Death and Satyavat¶’s Lamentation</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is no end of living being’s aspirations, He aspires every moment. If truly spoken, it is he who aspires every moment. Why does he so aspire? It is so because it seems to him that he lacks something, some object is not in My possession, I lack some status, he may get the object of his desire, I will obtain the certain object or thing, my power, potency, valour or by any means or by anyway. I will avail such type of pleasure, I will secure the best enjoyment. Such type of conceptions go on revolving in his mind, It is enough! The wakeful and the dreaming lives of all the beings pass on either remaining in fancy or in fulfilling the imagined longings. If the desired object is achieved, he gets elated with joy and his joys have no bounds, and if the desired object is not attained, he starts crying beating his head. This is the reality of this whole world. Such a miserable situation has been created by oneself being oblivious of God and the self because of one’s egotism. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O simple hearted beings! Do you want to create or destroy this world-creation according to your own assumption? Do you suppose that each of us will be able to create the world according to the individual assumption? Are you confident that worldly order can be run in a well- organised way? As a matter of fact, the director and creator of the entire world is a single one, all the activities of the world, minute particles, atoms are being supervised. There is the natural law of joining the particular element or particle with the particular element or particle. When a particle of atom has to join and to which particle of atom, is guided by the strict law. It is pre-determined about who will eat, which grain he will eat, at which place he will eat, in which utensil he will eat; it has been fixed, based on the account prepared as the total vicissitudes of fortune. Each and every atom is a living being, they have their own separate fates. They too, are enjoying by someone’s will. None can mould them otherwise. Then, the question arises why to indulge our mind by presuming through the imagination to solve the divine mathematics and thus, why should the most valuable time of life be wasted? Why should a person not remain absorbed in the adoration of God or meditate on the self? This change is sure about to occur. The ignorant will be grieved, delighted, they will weep and laugh, but those who know this reality, remain balanced and unaffected and neither weep nor laugh with the change of circumstances. They remain equipoised in all the situations.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was in ÝŒntanu’s mind that he had one son, he should marry again and many sons should be born. All  of them would be tremendously valiant similar to Bh¶¦ma, all would be blessed with long-life, seeing them leading a very comfortable and luxurious life in their young age and attending him with their services, he would be very happy; but his imagination and thinking proved false. He resolved himself, he tried his best, the wedding was about to be ceremonised, children also were to be born. All this was fulfilled; no doubt, but such a time arrived, which creates horror and terror in the mind of ignorant persons only even to imagine it or hear it. The moment of ÝŒntanu’s death approached him and he passed away leaving behind such a big empire and his so handsome and valorous sons. It is not enough to talk of them—He passed away forever leaving behind him even the charming  lady, whose charm had attracted him so much that he had deprived his eldest and very dear son from the empire as well as the same enjoyments, for which he, himself, was fond of.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He had two sons more—CitrŒÆgada and Vicitrav¶rya. After the death of ÝŒntanu, by the order of Satyavat¶, Bh¶¦ma enthroned CitrŒÆgada. CitrŒÆgada was the Emperor’s son; he was vigorous, young and enthusiastic. He was proud of his arms. He defeated all the kings of the earth. He did not consider anyone equal to himself. He considered everyone inferior. Well! Just see! All are the offsprings of Almighty God, they are alive by His grace. God is dwelling in everyone, all that we see, is the manifestation of God in different forms. In fact, God is omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent. Nothing exists other than God. Then, why should anyone consider the other one inferior? It is terrific darkness, utter ignorance and a great insult of the Almighty God Himself, having appeared here disguised in different forms. But how strange it would be for CitrŒÆgada, overpowered by the intoxication of his victories to realise the truth! He was too proud to understand anything else. He showed off airs while walking, he behaved in a boastful and arrogant way while talking to anyone and never glanced with straight eyes, gods, demons, human beings all were defeated by him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The creation is large beyond the limit, there is one better than the other in this God’s creation. One may be very brave but it cannot be said that there is none braver than he. Alas! He is not better than an insect but he is equal to it. In the whole universe, the Sun is like a particle. In a single sun, the earth is like a particle. In the Earth a man, how much great and brave he may be, but his value is not more than a particle; but he does not think about his appearnce, his identity and his momentary life and that is why he remains proud of and boastful. Ultimately, a brave like CitrŒÆgada appeared before him. His name was also ‘CitrŒÆgada’. He was a Gandharva. CitrŒÆgada, the mankind was extraordinary vigorous but CitrŒÆgada, the Gandharva was more and great vigorous. There was no reason of war, even against him, it was the only pretext why he had given himself the same ‘name’. A fierce battle was fought. In Kuruk¦etra on the bank of Saraswat¶ river both the braves continued fighting for three years without break. At last, CitrŒÆgada, the mankind was defeated, and the Gandharva CitrŒÆgada won the war. The same man, that did not consider anyone equal to him, fell down on the ground with his body soaked in blood and the vultures and crows appeased their hunger with his flesh. This is the end of all howsoever brave or howsoever great Emperor he may be.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After the death of CitrŒÆgada, by the order of Satyavat¶, Vicitrav¶rya was enthroned. Still he was immature in his age, he was a child, Bh¶¦ma began to have a very careful look to control him and began to remain attentive so that the subjects might not suffer due to the king. Satyavat¶ was desirous that her son be married and the daughter-in-law should share the royal palace. The children should be born and she may lead a happy life. How endless the ambitions and desires are! The ruler of a vast empire like ÝŒntanu, her husband died. The most valiant son like CitrŒÆgada also died; but even then, she has the expectation in her mind that she would be happy with Vicitrav¶rya’s sons. Really, what a miraculous is the God’s illusion! It is not easy to get through it and cross it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Satyavat¶ said to Bh¶¦ma for Vicitrav¶rya’s marriage and insisted to get Vicitrav¶rya married as soon as possible. For Bh¶¦ma Satyavat¶’s order was not defiable like the Vedas-words. He had sacrificed the empire for his father’s pleasure. He had taken the vow of life-long celibacy. Remaining himself unmarried, even, he became anxious to get his brother married to obey his step-mother’s order. He came to know that the SwayaÅvara (Suitor’s assembly) of the three very charming and beautiful like the fairies-daughters of the king of KŒÜ¶ was about to be held. All alone he made his journey for KŒÜ¶ by his chariot. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The kings of different countries had assembled at the royal palace of the king of KŒÜ¶. They had come there with a great enthusiasm to obtain the beautiful girls in the SwayaÅvara. These girls were also present there. The dynasty and merits of all the kings were being narrated one by one. Seeing Bh¶¦ma in the SwayaÅvara all began to discuss in different ways. Someone said—‘Till now, he remained unmarried, then in this age, how did he deviate? What was the need to come in the ‘SwayaÅvara?’ The next one said—‘He had taken the vow in over-excitement, now, his enthusiasm has cooled down, now he wants to marry.’ The others came to speak—‘How will he show his face to others after breaking his promise? How and what logic will be given in its justification?’ It is a proverb that the sinners find sin everywhere. These kings were sinful. They were thursting upon their own impurity on Bh¶¦ma even and blaming him. They were not aware of at all that Bh¶¦ma had come to obey his step-mother’s order without caring for his own defame. Not for his sake but he has to come for the sake of his brother; but there were a few righteous kings also who had faith in Bh¶¦ma’s vow, They knew that even sun and moon may change the direction of their movement but Bh¶¦ma cannot deviate from his promise.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the above conversation, Bh¶¦ma had a loud laughter. He thought, he has to take away the maids indeed, why not to teach them a good lesson as they are laughing much being proud of their prowess. He forcibly got all the three maidens seated on his chariot and said very seriously and fearlessly to the king of KŒÜ¶ and all the other kings—‘Brothers! In our ‘ÝŒstras’ there are examples of different kinds of marriages—out of them ‘Brahma’, ‘r¦a’ ‘Daiva’ etc., types of marriages have been considered superior. Here all the braves are assembled and it is the braves and deserving persons only who are rightful to own the maidens. So, I have got the maidens seated on my chariot. Anyone of you who is proud of his bravery, who, in real sense, wants these maidens, should come forward to defeat me. Without considering the victory or defeat, at least, he should make a trial of his strength; then, let us see further.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Challenging him, many of them, pressing their lips under teeth, became ready to fight; The arms of some of them fell down in haste, and its clinking resounded in all the directions. Having mounted on chariots, elephants and horses, they rushed to surround Bh¶¦ma. Having been insulted by Bh¶¦ma, at that time, all of them had raised their eyebrows, their eyes had gone red in anger. It appeared as if all were running to swallow Bh¶¦ma. A fierce battle was fought, none of them could stay before Bh¶¦ma. One and all were defeated, giving challenge, ÝŒlva was the last one to come to face, but at last, he also was defeated by Bh¶¦ma. Even, having arrested ÝŒlva, Bh¶¦ma did not kill him, showing mercy, he left him. ÝŒlva went back to his city and began to rule there righteously. All the kings returned to their own capitals. Having got all the three maidens seated on his chariot Bh¶¦ma returned HastinŒpura crossing over the forests, rivers, mountains and rough and rugged fields full of trees. On the way, he had the feeling in his mind that all the three maidens were like his younger sisters or like daughters or like daughter-in-laws. Having reached HastinŒpura, he handed over the three maidens to Vicitrav¶rya and after consulting the mother Satyavat¶, he began to make preparations for their marriage. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Among the three daughters of KŒÜ¶ king, AmbŒ was the eldest one, the names of the two younger sisters were AmbikŒ and AmbŒlikŒ. AmbŒ said to Bh¶¦ma—‘O the saintly one! You are extremely righteous one, so, I have no hesitation to open my mind before you. When in the ‘SwayaÅvara’ (suitor’s assembly) the kings of different countries had gathered, I had choosen the great king, ÝŒlva as my husband from the core of my heart, so moraly, only he is my husband now. My father, too, had the same opinion. So, kindly, manage in such a way as my righteousness may not be vitiated.’ Having heard the words of AmbŒ, Bh¶¦ma began to ponder over what he should do. He called in the Brahmins, versed with Vedas and sought advice from them and at last, he made up his mind that AmbŒ should be made free to go there, where she was willing to go. AmbŒ was informed that if she was willing, she might go to ÝŒlva. AmbikŒ and AmbŒlikŒ were married with Vicitrav¶rya. He began to enjoy the householder life with both the queens.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦ma deputed many maid-servants and old BrŒhmaÄas with AmbŒ, accompanied by all of them, she reached ÝŒlva at the proper time. Approaching there she said to ÝŒlva—‘O the best one among the human beings! I have choosen you as my husband and you have admitted it also, so, now accept me.’ Smiling ÝŒlva said—‘O the beauty queen! You have already lived in the house of someone else; so I cannot marry with you. Bh¶¦ma had seated you on his chariot holding your hands. He had won you in the war. You had not even opposed then. So, a righteous person like me cannot make you my life-partner. You can go anywhere gladly either to Bh¶¦ma or anywhere else as you wish. Now go, there is no need to stay here.’ AmbŒ began to weep. She implored earnestly and humbly—‘O the king! You should not use such words, Bh¶¦ma had taken me away forcibly, but neither I was attracted to him nor did he cast his evil glance at me. It is you only whom I love, I am faultless and I have come in your shelter. Bh¶¦ma has permitted me to come here. He has not to marry himself, he has married my sisters with his brother. I speak on oath that I don’t want to marry anyone else but you. I am fond of your love and your leavings of food. Kindly, accept me.’ But ÝŒlva turned a deaf ear to her, contrary to it, ÝŒlva persuaded her in such a way that she was convinced that it was Bh¶¦ma only responsible for all the blame. She went to the hermitage of the sages with the motive to take revenge upon him and reaching there, she stated to them her determination that ‘Now, I will not seek shelter to anyone. I will perform the severest penance leading the life as life-long female celibate. My humble prayer to all of you is to allow me to stay in the hermitage.’ The sages tried their best to convince her to go back to her father. But she did not return and remained obstinate.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The conversation of AmbŒ with the sages was just going on when the sage HotravŒhana happened to visit there. After the formal reception, when he came to know about AmbŒ, he showed a great sympathy to her. In blood-relation he was her maternal grandfather. He extended consolation to AmbŒ and he took the responsibility of safeguarding her. He advised AmbŒ—‘You should take the shelter of ParaÜurŒma of Bh¾gu clan; pray to him and seek his help through my introduction. It is sure that he will remove your misery.’ While discussions were going on, abruptly, the pupil of ParaÜurŒma—Ak¾tavarÄa reached there and on query he stated that Ýr¶ ParaÜurŒmaj¶ MahŒrŒja was coming to visit here the next day positively. Ak¾tavarÄa too, stated such versions that also proved the fault of Bh¶¦ma only and it strengthened the motive of AmbŒ’s determination to take revenge upon Bh¶¦ma. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is the next morning when ParaÜurŒma visited there. All the sages received him with due welcome and regard. HotravŒhana stated the narrative of AmbŒ and AmbŒ prayed to him in a very pathetic voice—‘Kindly, punish Bh¶¦ma.’ ParaÜurŒma said—‘I have already given up the use of weapons. Bh¶¦ma is noble and reverent, he will agree to my advice. You, don’t be nervous.’ But AmbŒ was bent upon her determination and insisted upon—‘You kindly, kill Bh¶¦ma.’ Ak¾tavarÄa too, emphasised before ParaÜurŒmaj¶—‘If Bh¶¦ma does not agree to you, and does not accept his defeat, it is your duty to wage a war against him and kill him.’ ParaÜurŒmaj¶ too, came to remember his vow to destroy the K¦atriyas. The old mental impression was awakened. He said before the sages—‘First I will try to convince Bh¶¦ma. I will go to him with the daughter of the king of KŒÜ¶, and compel him to accept her. If he does not consent to my advice, I will leave no stone unturned in killing him.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">AmbŒ, HotravŒhana and many other sages went to the holy land of Kuruk¦etra with ParaÜurŒma. All of them stayed on the bank of Saraswat¶ river and message was sent to Bh¶¦ma that they had come. Just then, Bh¶¦ma along with Brahmins, priests etc., reached there to welcome them with due regard. ParaÜurŒma accepted his hospitality, asked about his welfare and said to Bh¶¦ma—‘Bh¶¦ma! <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou have committed a great crime to kidnap AmbŒ; because she was already mentally attached to ÝŒlva. First in spite of being indifferent, you kidnapped AmbŒ, and secondly later on, you deserted her. Now, how can a righteous person accept her? It is you only the cause behind all this. I, hereby, order you to accept and safeguard righteousness. You should not disgrace her likewise.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">ParaÜurŒma’s words were expressing a suggestion as Bh¶¦ma should marry AmbŒ; but Bh¶¦ma could not even imagine so. He said—‘Lord! How can she be married with my brother Vicitrav¶rya? She has already told me earlier that she has mentally chosen ÝŒlva as her husband. That is why I had sent her to ÝŒlva. I have not violated moral rules at all. Being swayed by fear, mercy, greed or lust one should never do anything against Dharma, this is my concluded promise.’ ParaÜurŒma said—‘If you don’t obey my order, now I will kill your advisers, minister, attendants and servants along with you even.’ Bh¶¦ma made a great humble solicitation and said—‘I cannot deviate from the righteousness on account of fear. You are my preceptor; but for the sake of righteousness, if I have to fight a war against you even, I can fight.’ Hearing the words of Bh¶¦ma, ParaÜurŒma got wild with anger. He fixed the time of war and asked him to reach to fight the war at exact time. Bh¶¦ma made necessary preparations for the war. Being well equipped with arms and missiles, having been seated on the chariot, he marched for Kuruk¦etra. The ‘Elderly’ ones (guide) blessed him, the Brahmins blessed him benedictions and Bh¶¦ma reached Kuruk¦etra. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At opportune moment, Bh¶¦ma’s mother GaÆgŒ Dev¶ appeared before him and began to say—‘Son! What are you going to do? I, just, go to ParaÜurŒma, I will pray to him and will try to convince him. Don’t fight against ParaÜurŒma,’ with folded hands, Bh¶¦ma narrated all facts to the mother and also told the impropriety of his order. GaÆgŒ Dev¶ approached ParaÜurŒma but ParaÜurŒma paid no heed to her words. At last, both came face to face in the battlefield. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦ma said to ParaÜurŒmaj¶—‘My lord! I am on the chariot and you are on the ground. It is improper to fight in this way. If you want to fight against me, kindly be seated on the chariot and wear the armour.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘ParaÜurŒma said—‘Bh¶¦ma! <span class="char-style-override-7">i</span>t is this earth as my chariot, all the four Vedas are my horses, the wind is my charioteer and GŒyatr¶ is my armour. Having been protected by them, I will fight against you.’ After uttering this much, ParaÜurŒma started raining arrows. At that time, Bh¶¦ma visualised that ParaÜurŒma was seated on an imaginary divine chariot through his will-power, the divine horses are harnessed to it. He was well equipped with all the weapons and he was wearing the armour. Bh¶¦ma put down his bow and arrow and bare footed going, he saluted to the feet of ParaÜurŒma and said—‘Gurudeva! Bless me for victory and order me to fight against you.’ ParaÜurŒma admired Bh¶¦ma and mentioned Bh¶¦ma’s behaviour an ideal. He ordered to start war and said—‘I am fighting merely to get victory over you, hence, I cannot bless you for victory.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The time of arms-attack from both the sides came, the conch shell was blown, Bh¶¦ma said—‘Lord! You have thrown several arrows at me, my horses have come close to faint, yet it has no affect on me. Though, you have deviated from the dignity of a ‘Guru’ (spiritual guide) yet I consider you my spiritual guide even then. At present I want to say a few words to you reverently—I don’t attack the Vedas, Brahma-splendour and penance performed by you, existing in your body. By being equipped with arms and armour, a Brahmin turns to K¦atriya feeling so I attack your K¦atriya feeling now just see the impact of my bow and vigour of my arms, I cut off your bow.’ Saying these words Bh¶¦ma shot an arrow and ParaÜurŒma’s bow, having been sundered fell on the ground. Thus, attack and counter-attack started from both the sides.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This war continued for twenty-three days without break. Both of them having done their routine work, being fresh, taking bath, making morning and evening SandhyŒ prayer etc., used to confront against each other in the battlefield and remained grappled with each other till sun-set (The time of SandhyŒ). One day, Bh¶¦ma, having made prayer to the gods with great holiness in the night, went to sleep. He resolved—‘If I may give defeat to ParaÜurŒma, let the gods appear before me in the dream.’ He slept in the position of lying on the right side. In the night, all of the eight Vasus appeared before Bh¶¦ma in the disguised form of Brahmins and said—‘In the previous birth, you had the knowledge of ‘PraÜwapa Astra’ (PraÜwapa weapon), when you recollect it, it will come to you and by its power you will win ParaÜurŒma. By its use, ParaÜurŒma will lie down asleep in the battlefield and you will win. By the use of ‘Sambodhan Astra’ he will again awake. Thus, you will win also and ParaÜurŒma will not die even.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The next day, in the war, ParaÜurŒma mobilised ‘BrahmŒstra’. Bh¶¦ma also used the same BrahmŒstra to pacify it. The cry of distress spread all around, all the directions resounded with the repeated cry for help. Bh¶¦ma thought of using ‘PraÜwapa Astra’. In the mean time, the gods said from the space—‘Bh¶¦ma! Don’t use the PraÜwapa-Astra.’ Bh¶¦ma did not pay heed to it. He was just going to use the PraÜwapa Astra, when NŒrada appeared and checked him and all the eight Vasus also supported NŒrada and endorsed his advice. Bh¶¦ma, too, agreed. When the PraÜwapa Astra was not used, abruptly, just suddenly the voice from ParaÜurŒma’s lips escaped—‘Bh¶¦ma got victory over me.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then, at that time, the grandfather of ParaÜurŒma, having appeared in the battlefield, restrained ParaÜurŒma from fighting the war and by the mediation of forefathers, gods and sages, the war was stopped. Approaching ParaÜurŒma, Bh¶¦ma saluted to his feet. At then, smiling ParaÜurŒma said cheerfully—‘O the best of the braves Bh¶¦ma! There is no other K¦atriya on the earth so brave as you. You satisfied me in the war.’ Thenafter ParaÜurŒma said to AmbŒ—‘Princess! I fought the battle to the best of my capacity for your sake, but I could not defeat Bh¶¦ma. I don’t have more prowess than this much. Now, I am ready to do whatever you say more.’ AmbŒ said—‘Lord! Your words are true; even the great gods cannot win Bh¶¦ma. Now, I will spend my life in penance and acquire the power so that I might kill Bh¶¦ma.’ Having stated so, AmbŒ went away. Bh¶¦ma and ParaÜurŒma both went back to their respective places.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On one side, Bh¶¦ma was fighting for the sake of Vicitrav¶rya but on the other side Vicitrav¶rya was indulging in sensuous pleasures. Vicitrav¶rya forgot this world having got the empire of the earth, a protector like Bh¶¦ma, young aged two beauty queens, he forgot his life and forgot even God, the ultimate goal of life. There was no short of luxuries, even at a will anything could be brought from the heaven. Well! Then what is need to remember the Lord being overwhelmed by all the possible comforts and luxurious objects? But he might forget—the death never forgets. It was hovering over his head. It was one day when the death sent its messengers, Vicitrav¶rya fell a victim to Tuberculosis. The lewdness after which, he neglected the most sublime good, forgot the Dharma and accomplishment, as a result of the same lewdness he got this disease of T.B. This is the reality of this world. The object that provides us happiness first as it seems so, becomes the cause of misery later on; because this world is transient and sorrowful. Adopt any object of the world, no doubt it may give pleasure for a moment. That is also illusive and for name sake; later on it is only full of sorrow and distress. Contrary to it, if the Almighty God’s shelter is taken, in spite of seeming to be sorrowful at first, but there is only happiness forever. But the human being is so ignorant, so entangled in delusion that he gives up the eternal happiness forever for the sake of momentary joys. Vicitrav¶rya’s condition was the same. He was unable to move and walk. His feebleness went on increasing day by day.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All the efforts were made to get him rid of the disease. The famous doctors from the country to country were called and consulted. Having spent a lot of money, the most valuable medicines were prepared. Bh¶¦ma also tried his best for the treatment of Vicitrav¶rya and for his health to recover; but in the court of death nones argument was heard. One day, Vicitrav¶rya passed away from this world. His empire was left here. Even his beloved queens did not accompany him. His body was transformed into five original elements, only his virtuous and sinful acts accompanied him. The life that could make it possible to attain the Lord, was wasted in lewdness by him in this way.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">DŒÜarŒja, the father of Satyavat¶, had hatched big plans for the empire to issues of Satyavat¶ from ÝŒntanu, had put many conditions, had made Bh¶¦ma to take oath that he would never aspire for the empire, lead the life-long celibate life, the dynasty of the same Satyavat¶ began to perish to dust. Satyavat¶ got bereaved. Even Bh¶¦ma got worried to see the Bharat lineage going to end in this way. He performed the obsequies of Vicitrav¶rya according to the rules of the ÝŒstras and became carefree relying on God. It was his conviction that nothing is possible against God’s-will in the Lord’s empire and whatever happens by the will of God, will be always quite auspicious. He engaged himself in the worship of God.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">The Birth of Kaurava-PŒÄÎavas, their <br/>Education and Training</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Big lectures may be delivered regarding right living, we may boast of speaking the truth; but when the time comes to lead a right living, when the difficult situation arises to remain firm on truthfulness, even the reputed orators and preachers deviate from them. I cannot consider them righteous or lover of truth. They have no control over their inner sense, they themselves have no real faith in Dharma and truth. Whatever they say about  Dharma and truth, they speak only to get name and fame or display hypocrisy. Such righteous persons are false and showy and in the nick of time they deviate from the right course of Dharma, and speaking truth. One may outwardly show himself of being righteous but in the life such a time occurs when righteousness and truthfulness are put to test. One who remains firm on Dharma and stands for the truth firmly, in real sense it is he, who is righteous and truthful.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">No doubt, Bh¶¦ma had taken the vow for the pleasure of his father, that he would not become the Emperor, he would not marry, but the real opportune moment of its test had yet not occurred. He had his father, he had his mother, they ruled. There was no question before him at all. When his father passed away, one of his brothers became the king. When the brother died, the next brother became the King. Till then, there was no question before him. After the death of Vicitrav¶rya, in the Bharata family, Bh¶¦ma alone was left alive. Not with the angle of the empire-greed but from the duty point of view too, the responsibility of looking after the subjects of the kingdom and their welfare had fallen upon him. It is not so that it was necessary for him to bring about progeny and hence indulge in sense pleasures, cause of indulgence and enjoyment; but it had become necessary for the protection of the lineage also. He would have never be blamed by the people in the world, if he had become the king and produced the children, but Bh¶¦ma was dedicated to truthfulness and he was truly righteous. It was beyond his imagination that he had to rule or to produce children.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There came an other great problem before Bh¶¦ma. The same mother Satyavat¶ for whose sake he had taken vow to obey her order, he had kidnapped the daughters of KŒÜ¶rŒja in spite of having no need for himself, he never felt the least hesitation in fulfilling her desire, came to him and she said to him—‘Son! You, produce the children.’ Trying to convince Bh¶¦ma, Satyavat¶ said—‘Son! You are devoted to Dharma. It is necessary for you to protect the dynasty and Dharma. Will the throne, sitting on which the great and valiant Emperors have ruled since long in the past, remain void? Will the kindling light of the dynasty which has been illuminating from BrahmŒ till now, be put off now? You can ponder over the morality like AÆgirŒ and ÝukrŒcŒrya at the time of calamity. I am well acquainted with your profoundity. Now, do something so that the Dharma and the lineage may not vanish.’ Even after hearing his mother’s order, there was not the least dilemma in Bh¶¦ma’s mind. He said—‘Mother! What you say is literally correct, but I am bound by my promise. Mother! How can I deviate from that promise made by me at the time of your giving away in the marriage? Hence, I cannot give up my promise at all.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦ma further continued—‘I may surrender the kingdom of all the three worlds, I may give up the kingdom of the gods, and I can give up anything more valuable than this; but I cannot give up the truthfulness at any cost. The earth may give up odour, the water may give up its sapidity, the effulgence may give up form, the wind may give up the touch, the sun may give up radiance, the comet may give up its warmth, the ether may give up  the sound, and moon may give up coolness, Indra may give up prowess, DharmarŒja may give up his righteousness; but I cannot even resolve to break my promise and give up the truth at all.’*</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">After hearing the words of her righteous and truthful son, Satyavat¶ said—‘Son! I know your fidelity to truth. If you want, you can create all the three worlds and all the substances under it by the power of your austerity. It is known to me that you had taken oath for my sake only, but you should do something so that this pedigree may not be ruind.’ Bh¶¦ma said—‘Mother! Just see the Dharma, don’t lead me towards impiety being attached to the dynasty. Don’t persuade me to tread on the path of unrighteousness. Truth is greater to all the Dharmas. Having been born in such a high lineage, how should I deviate from the truth?’ Having stated thus, Bh¶¦ma persuaded Satyavat¶ to take the shelter of any righteous and austere Brahmin. By his grace, the lineage will be protected.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having heard Bh¶¦ma, Satyavat¶ became thoughtful. At last, she said in the mild tone looking downward and feeling a little shy—‘Son! Bh¶¦ma! Nothing is hidden to you, so I tell you frankly. I am the foster daughter of DŒÜarŒja, I am the daughter of Uparicara Vasu, I was born of the womb of a fish and my father gave me to DŒÜarŒja. He was a great righteous person. He was having a boat in the YamunŒ river, I lived on that boat. I used to make any traveller cross the river without charging any money at all. Doing this work I became young. One day, the great sage, ParŒÜara came by the same way, his gracious look fell upon me. Son! Don’t misunderstand that any evil feeling came to his mind; because he is a great-souled sage. Sometimes, even some bad deeds in the eyes of common people, done by persons being devoid of sensual enjoyments, prove to be supremely auspicious in the world. When he expressed his desire before me, I got afraid of my father and morality; but his curse also frightened me not less in anyway. After blessing with boon to me, I agreed to him and with his semen, from my womb VyŒsadeva was born. The sage granted me boon that my virginity would not be affected. My son VyŒsa is a great austere and righteous, If you permit, I should call him and let the lineage be protected through him.’ Bh¶¦ma permitted. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Satyavat¶ remembered VyŒsa and he just at once reached there, leaving the composition of Brahma-sµutras. The mother embraced her son to her heart with great love because of getting him after a long time. Due to her affection, milk flowed out of her breast, tears came out of her eyes. Having saluted his mother, VyŒsa asked for the service he is to render. Satyavat¶ insisted upon him to save the vanishing Bharata lineage. VyŒsaj¶ said—‘If your daghter-in-laws don’t hate me to see my old and deshaped body, and they may tolerate the foul smell of my body and they may not be frightened to see my body, they will bear the pregnancy. Ask them to pass on before my eyes being fully naked. It is enough! They will be pregnant only by my eye-sight.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Approaching AmbikŒ, Satyavat¶ persuaded her and any how, she made her agree by scolding her that she should pass on before the eyes of VyŒsa being fully naked; but it was not appealing to her mind. Having closed her eyes with great hesitation she went before him. By the kind attitude of VyŒsa she became pregnant. When the mother asked VyŒsa, he told her seeing with this divine eyes that she had passed before my eyes having her eyes closed; so her son would be blind; but he will produce hundred sons. The mother prayed her son to produce one son more because a blind cannot be king. In the period of AmbŒlikŒ’s menstruation VyŒsa came again. By the inspiration of Satyavat¶, she did go before his eyes with opened eyes no doubt, but her body turned pale, on account of her being frightened. So, VyŒsa said—‘<span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou turned pale to see me with fear; hence, the son born of your womb will be yellowish.’ When the mother got this news, she again prayed to VyŒsa—‘<span class="char-style-override-7">p</span>roduce one son more.’ VyŒsaj¶ again accepted it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After a period of time, AmbikŒ took bath after menses again and Satyavat¶, having remembered VyŒsadeva called him. This turn also AmbikŒ dared not to go before him. She sent her an exquisitely beautiful maidservant before him. VyŒsadeva was very much pleased with her behaviour. He granted her boon that she would get rid of the maidservant class since that day. Her son would be a great religious and outstanding talented. VyŒsaj¶ MahŒrŒja went away. Through the AmbikŒ’s pregnancy Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra, AmbŒlikŒ’s pregnancy PŒÄÎu and through the maidservant’s pregnancy Vidura were born. The saint Bh¶¦ma began to bring them up with great affection, muttering the divine name.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By the birth of PŒÄÎu and Vidura, the country was highly benefitted. The food-grain beyond the expectation began to grow on the earth. The juice (greenary) and vitality, specially came in it. It began to rain timely. The trees were laden with fruits and flowers. Animals and birds began to move happily. The flowers began to be novel fragrant and the fruits began to be of unique taste. The artists and painters, the learned scholars and the persons of noble and good character began to increase in number all around. The fear of thieves and robbers was removed. None did even think of ill to others. Sinful ideas never occurred in anybody’s mind. Everywhere all over the country the virtuous works like YajÛa etc., were commonly performed. Pride, anger and greed had decreased. All people gratified other by making sacrifice. There was no widow and miser. All the homes were ready to welcome the guests. Their doors remained open for the guests. Bh¶¦ma was vigilant and very careful for their good education from their very childhood. They had hardly grown up to be young, they became well versed in all the ÝŒstras and science of arms. Specially, PŒÄÎu was very expert in archery, Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra was physically strong and Vidura was expert in the code of ethics. After this Bh¶¦ma coronated PŒÄÎu on throne on his being mature. Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra was blind and Vidura was maidservant’s son. So, according to the moral rules, they were not considered entitled to the throne. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">With the consent of all the three, they were married. Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra was married to ‘GŒndhŒr¶’, PŒÄÎu was married to ‘MŒdr¶’, the daughter of King of Madra and the sister of Ýailya and Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s aunt, Kunt¶. Vidura was married to the virtuous and endowed with all the merits, the daughter of the maidservant of ‘Yadu clan’, (Yadu dynasty). All the three began to do their duties happily and Bh¶¦ma began to live peacefully keeping his eyes on them.  </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">With the passage of time hundred sons were born to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra. They were valiant, one better than the other. Well enough! There would be hardly an Indian, who would have not heard the name of Duryodhana and Du¬ÜŒsana. There was no issue with the semen of the Emperor, PŒÄÎu. He was of a strange nature. He took keen interest in hunting. He passed most of his time on the hills, but this addiction is really very bad. Whether, the killing of a creature can ever be righteous? PŒÄÎu was afflicted by this blemish and he had to suffer also its ill effect. One day, he shot an arrow at a seer disguised in the form of a deer and while dying, the seer cursed him,—‘If you ever go for physical relation with any woman with the motive to produce a child, you will die. Since that day, PŒÄÎu began to lead a restrained life and MŒdr¶ as well as Kunt¶ began to attend him.  </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Kunt¶ had already acquired the power to invoke the gods due to the spell blessed by DurvŒsŒ. Whenever she desired, she invoked any god to be present. She had already tested it by calling the Sun by whose grace KarÄa was born. After seeking the permission of the righteous husband, PŒÄÎu, she invoked ‘Dharma’, ‘Indra’ and ‘Wind’ and by their grace she got three sons Yudhi¦¢hira, Arjuna and Bh¶ma respectively. It was she to invoke AÜwin¶kumŒra, she got ‘MŒdr¶’ also to get two sons, whose names were Nakula and Sahadeva. After some days, PŒÄÎu died. So long as PŒÄÎu remained out on the hills, in that duration under the supervision of Bh¶¦ma with the consent of Vidura, it was Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra to look after the royal affairs and used to send the materials there to PŒÄÎu according to his requirement. Now, the sages sent PŒÄÎu’s sons with Kunt¶ to HastinŒpura and on account of their being immature, all the royal affairs remained under Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra’s control. Reaching HastinŒpura all the five PŒÄÎavas and Duryodhana etc., hundred Kauravas began to acquire education and practise Archery. They had a great devotion and reverence for Bh¶¦ma and obeyed his orders and Bh¶¦ma too, with a great affection and fondingly looked after them. Thus, the childhood of Kauravas and PŒÄÎavas began to pass on. </p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-7">‘Duryodhana’s jealousy of PŒÄÎavas’ prosperity, Misbehaviour with PŒÄÎavas and Bh¶¦ma’s Sermon’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The human nature is unique from the eternity. In spite of dashing against the gust of the world-waves, a man does not come back to his sense, God knows what was that miserable moment when he had forgotten his self that he began to run after the illusory objects, different from his own self. If it had remained limited to this extent merely, it would not have been a matter of astonishment, but its range went on increasing. He experienced his own self different from himself, and in the different appearing objects he contrived ‘This is good, this is bad, this is mine, this is belonging to another.’ Then, for one own’s good and for our own protection, efforts were started to be made, and restlessness began to be felt to remove the evil and ruin that belonging to others. This initial tendency of life filled in the same feeling in all other classes of birth and whereas human-class of birth is superior in talent and wisdom, such a feeling is not expected to exist there but contrary to it, specially, it appeared there more. It is enough! Whatever the attempts are made now, it is based on this very root tendency and the entire mankind has become an effigy of attachment and jealousy. By the grace of the Lord, by the great kindness of the saints and by discrimination in pure heart, if judged, then only the impressions of attachment and aversion can be rooted out. Then the man does not remain a man, he becomes a great soul, he becomes the spirit or God. A common being is overwhelmed with these both sentiments and their activities are being directed by these tendencies. Those, who are overpowered by attachment and aversion, are the men of demoniac traits, and those who are the least affected, are the persons of divine traits. Generally, there happens to be strife between the both with each other and at last, those of divine property win over. In the coming chapters, we will mark how much divine property has increased among the PŒÄÎavas and how much among the Kauravas. How much the instincts of attachment and malice have affected whose inner-sense and to what extent, will be worth seeing? Those who are risen above these, are already exalted souls, but here will be the bird-eye-view description of the sequence of those evils existing in them. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the advice of VyŒsadeva, Satyavat¶, AmbikŒ and AmbŒlikŒ all the three went to practise penance and after performing due penance they got salvation. Kunt¶ poured down her affection on all the five PŒÄÎavas equally, she remained cautious about their sorrow and happiness and felt delighted only to see them. Bh¶¦ma had the same affection and attachment to the both PŒÄÎavas and the Kauravas and remained engaged in the muttering of the Lord’s name. With the consent of Vidura, Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra managed the nourishment of subjects and all were very happy. All the lads were initiated according to Vedic rules, enjoying the royal comforts they began to grow in their paternal palace. From the very childhood, the seed germination of jealousy and hatred among the Kauravas against the PŒÄÎavas began to be initiated. The reason behind it was that Bh¶masena was better than all in race, in shooting, in eating and drinking, in raising dust. The Kauravas felt jealous in their mind to see the might of Bh¶masena. If by the way just in fun, there happened to be any contest, Bh¶ma used to give defeat to one hundred one Kauravas all alone himself smilingly. He used to clash their heads with one another, holding with his hands, and he knocked them down. Holding about ten with both the hands, he used to duck them in the water and after making them devoid of energy, he took them out of the water. When they started plucking fruits to eat having climbed up the small trees, Bh¶masena shaked the trees holding its root and with a good number of fruits they also used to fall down. Bh¶masena had no feeling of hatred in his mind, it was simply child mentality or the childish behaviour of childhood, but the Kauravas got irritated with their child mentality. Slowly and slowly, the sense of enmity went on strengthening in their mind. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Duryodhana’s mind got contaminated. He began to crave that Bh¶ma should be killed any how. The evil thought also sometimes came to his mind that PŒÄÎavas could be arrested any how, no obstacle would exist in their way of acquiring the royal power and they will enjoy the kingship free from thorns. Once, he made such a conspiracy that he gave poison to Bh¶ma and got him thrown away into the Ganges river getting him bound with the creepers, but it did not assail any harm to Bh¶ma. Bh¶ma came back from there having drunk the essence of mercury which increased his body strength much more. Yudhi¦¢hira got Bh¶ma persuaded that it should never be made public at all, otherwise it would defame themselves. Duryodhana was not separate one at all. Thus, on the advice of Ýakun¶ and KarÄa, Duryodhana tried to cause ill to them but it was the Vidura’s counsel that made them to remain safe. All these occurrences used to come to the knowledge of Bh¶¦ma also. He considered it that they were immatured yet, remained idle, so many ill wills might be occurring in their minds. They should be engaged in some works. Making his mind so, he deputed K¾pŒcŒrya to train them in archery. All the Kauravas and PŒÄÎavas began to study Vedas and all the six subsidiaries of Vedas and ÝŒstra’s from him. It was K¾pŒcŒrya, who taught them the skill of archery also.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, being shocked with the insult by Drupada, DroÄŒcŒrya came there. He had acquired the entire knowledge of archery from the great scholars like ParaÜurŒma etc. Seeing the boys playing, he was desirous of getting himself introduced to  Bh¶¦ma. He showed such a skill of archery to Yudhi¦¢hira, Duryodhana etc., that they were spell-bound and with the inspiration of DroÄŒcŒrya, they informed Bh¶¦ma about his visit. Bh¶¦ma was very much pleased. He insisted upon DroÄŒcŒrya having given him warm welcome—‘Kindly stay here and train my grandsons in archery. There will be no flaw in your respect and honour. The entire property of Kauravas is your property at all, we will obey you. We are lucky that we have been favoured by your auspicious visit. We are greatly obliged to your this kindness.’ DroÄa accepted it. At the auspicious moment, the sons of Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and PŒÄÎava were initiated by him and they began to learn the secrets of archery, its use and its withdrawal. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The PŒÄÎavas and specially Arjuna rendered great services to DroÄŒcŒrya. Being pleased, he trained Arjuna even with the knowledge of BrahmŒstra. There also Duryodhana had a great rivalry with the PŒÄÎavas. He created friendship with KarÄa to defeat them. The idea, how to humiliate the PŒÄÎavas, always dwelt in his mind. He wanted to arrest or kill them. But  the PŒÄÎavas had never even thought of against him. They tried to remain always friendly, peacefully and affectionately with them. One day, the education of the princess came to an end, they got success appearing at the test before Bh¶¦ma etc. Arjuna and KarÄa were the toppers. Arjuna was praised specially. Duryodhana’s heart began to burn with jealousy. Arjuna won Drupad to please DroÄŒcŒrya and then he became DroÄŒcŒrya’s friend. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">With excellence of PŒÄÎavas, not only Duryodhana but his all the brothers and even Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra himself, got worried. All of them began to find out the plan to destroy PŒÄÎavas. At last, it was decided that the PŒÄÎavas should be settled in the VarÄŒvata city. It was the duplicity in Duryodhana’s mind that they would be burnt in the place of shellac. Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra said—‘If we do any injustice to the PŒÄÎavas, Bh¶¦ma will be annoyed.’ But Duryodhana said—‘Don’t be afraid of him. He treats both of us with same eyes, he will remain indifferent in this conflict.’ At last, Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra sent PŒÄÎavas to VarÄŒvata. Nowadays Bh¶¦ma used to remain very sad. Duryodhana did serve him enough, but did not consult him in the royal affairs. If Vidura gave him his opinion, it was never heeded. That is why the PŒÄÎavas saluted the feet of Bh¶¦ma while going to VarÄŒvata from HastinŒpura, but Bh¶¦ma said nothing. They went away.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When in the Draupad¶’s SwayaÅvara all the five PŒÄÎavas appeared and the people of HastinŒpura came to know it, Duryodhana and Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra were greatly worried. They had the assumption that the PŒÄÎavas had been burnt to ashes in the ‘LŒk¦Œg¾ha’ of VarÄŒvata, and their kingship was free from thorns, but the PŒÄÎavas were safe. Now, they began to plan how to ruin the PŒÄÎavas. It was a very complicated situation. Bh¶¦ma was summoned. Bh¶¦ma said—‘<span class="char-style-override-7">f</span>or me, the Kauravas and PŒÄÎavas both are equal! I have love and affection for the both of them. I want the protection of the PŒÄÎavas also like you. Don’t fight against them, surrender half of the kingdom to them and live amicably.’ He said further—‘Duryodhana! As you consider yourself the heir of the kingdom, in the same way, Yudhi¦¢hira too, is rightful. If the royal throne is not given to them, then, how can you be entitled alone? You have grabbed it by immoral means, they must get it. Humbleness is superior to impertinence, Glory is superior to infamy. The life of a disgraced king is a burden. Our conduct and behaviour should be worthy of our ancestors. The wicked Purocana, who wanted to burn them to ashes in ‘LŒk¦Œg¾ha’, died himself. Since I heard that all five PŒÄÎavas along with Kunt¶ had been burnt to ashes, since then I remained very much restless. In my opinion Purocana was not at fault, it was you all to be blamed. The news of their being alive, erased your infamy, now go, enjoy and rejoice. The PŒÄÎavas are great devotees and righteous and they are single by heart and they have love for each other. They have the equal share in this kingdom and they must get it. You have no capacity to win them. They have been turned out of the kingdom by immoral way, their share must be given to them at any cost. Duryodhana! If you have the least faith in piety, if you want to keep your old grandfather happy, if you want repute, glory and welfare of the Kauravas, better, handover half of the kingship to the PŒÄÎavas.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">DroÄŒcŒrya and Vidura supported the advice of Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha. In spite of disagreeing with Bh¶¦ma, Duryodhana agreed to call back the PŒÄÎavas against his will to please Bh¶¦ma, Vidura was sent. On the advice of Ýri K¾¦Äa and Drupada, the PŒÄÎavas came back to HastinŒpura. Bh¶¦ma felt very much delighted. The PŒÄÎavas began to live with Draupad¶ happily, they forgot the wrong done by Duryodhana. With the help of Ýri K¾¦Äa having burnt the KhŒÄÎava-forest from the divine assembly made by MŒyŒ, they began to control the royal affairs. The five PŒÄÎavas produced five sons. They expanded the area of their empire, having defeated the great kings. The divine property increased. Seeing their prosperity, Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha remained very happy and experiencing the God’s grace, he kept himself engaged in making pilgrimages, associating with saints and worshipping God. Thus days passed by.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-8">Yudhi¦¢hira’s ‘RŒjasµuya YajÛa’, ‘Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s Foremost Worship’, The Description of <br/>Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s guise and Glory, <br/>ÝiÜupŒla’s Murder</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There appears to be different and several types of pleasures and comforts in the world. They can be experienced in different forms. They can be classified as physical, sensuous, internal, intellectual etc. In this world, those who run in the best condition of life, get all such types of joys and pleasures. The body should be strong, the senses should be free from any disease and from enjoying the sensuous pleasures, mentaly satisfied with wealth, family, empire, honour, repute etc., intellectually well versed with the sciences of different objects, being skilled in politics and social order, his ideas and consents are followed by the majority. If all the above mentioned are experienced by any individual, then it can be said that such a person is happy from the worldly point of view; but the perfection of happiness does not end here only. Along with all these, whether these objects are in the form of enjoyable objects or in the forms of tools of enjoyment or as the causes of arrogancy, but death is certain. With the blessings of God we can attain death as per our will, but in spite of its attainment, the desire for the happiness has not got its limit. After pondering over it appears so, that if all the worldly objects are attained permanently and aversion can be rooted out, even then, we lack something or the other, and some lack always strikes to our mind. In spite of getting all these, there remains something still to get. The ÝŒstras and the saints have pondered over this fundamental truth from the very beginning and it is a matter of good luck that they are concured with the fact that peace cannot be achieved by these external objects, these worldly joys are momentary and good for nothing. To expect true happiness and peace from these worldly objects, is just like to quench thirst with the mirage. Neither anyone has achieved real happiness from the worldly objects nor there is any hope to achieve in future.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then, the question is this that where lies the true happiness and peace? Where is consummation of intellect, mind and senses? Because without achieving the answer of these, life is not an accomplished one. Now the only answer is that dwelling inside of the inner-self i.e., tmŒ of tmŒ, the source of happiness, SaccidŒnanda Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is recognized, attained and craving to reach Him. After attaining Him, infinite ocean of mean, sensual pleasures is conquered and along with this everything is conquered. That means God is realized by intellect, mind acquire Him alone and senses reach to Him. In reality, at this point, we would have got everything.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What was not gained in the life of Bh¶¦ma? But it was not only the worldly happiness like other beings, but in spite of all the gains, remaining indifferent to them, he used to think of the Lord only intellectually, used to experience the frolicsome activities of the Lord and felt His touch with his sense-organs only everywhere. What a great love and devotion to the Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa he had, comes out everywhere in his life. He was a great devotee of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, a great seer of truth and great obedient. His knowledge of ultimate truth, his devotional love and the fact of obedience, is an ideal for all and we want to see the same ideal spirit in the lives of all human beings.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">DharmarŒja Yudhi¦¢hira’s assembly was formed. The powerful force and potency of the brothers and the assistance of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was already handy to him. Truly speaking, he was a devotee of K¾¦Äa, through His inspiration, he tended towards ‘RŒjasµuya YajÛa’, to be done for His pleasure. The brothers made a bid for the world conquest, with the help of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, Bh¶ma killed JarŒsandha. Hundreds of kings were released from the jail, he got their sympathy and favour and the ‘RŒjasµuya YajÛa’ was performed on a grand scale. On the last day of the ‘YajÛa’, when the auspicious day of the welcome and reception of the guests and visitors came, the question arose who should be the distinguished person to be given the first priority for worship. It was the Bh¶¦ma alone the oldest and well-versed saint present there in the pavilion where the YajÛa was performed. Considering him the most appropriate to decide it, DharmarŒja Yudhi¦¢hira asked—‘PitŒmaha! Who should be the first one among the all present here, to be adored?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦ma said—‘Yudhi¦¢hira! Among all the reputed persons present here, as regards lustre, glory, vitality, prowess, knowledge, science etc., Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa stands first. For example, when the sun rises and brightens, the glow of the stars becomes not only insignificant but vanishes away and becomes invisible, in the same way, before Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, all others stand in the same condition. It is the Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa who is enhancing the glory of this assembly just as the sun purifies ascetical place  with its brightness and the wind fills up a still place with motion. It is His light that illumines the entire world and it is His bliss that delights everyone. Hence, it is Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa who should be worshipped first of all.’ Thus, in the full open assembly, praising for the glory and greatness of Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha ordered Sahadeva to give the first devotional and reverential offering to the Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. Sahadeva implemented his order just the moment. According to the ordains of the ÝŒstras, Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa accepted the reverential and devotional offering, offered by the devotee PŒÄÎavas, gladly in the scriptural prescribed way.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the same pavilion, ÝiÜupŒla, the king of Cedi DeÜa was also present. He could not endure the worship of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. He became furious with anger, his eyes became red in rage. Standing up, having insulted Bh¶¦ma and Yudhi¦¢hira, he began to speak ill of K¾¦Äa and criticised Him. ÝiÜupŒla said—‘Yudhi¦¢hira! There are great righteous, learned and virtuous kings present here, before them Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is not worthy of worship at all. You have worshipped him without getting unanimous approval, He is quite unworthy, you have no knowledge of the minute secrets of religion. You are a child in this matter. The old Bh¶¦ma too, has violated the moral binding and thus, he has shown his ignorance. Everyone considered you theologian and devoted to religion, but you have made an improper practice only to please K¾¦Äa. All of us will condemn you. K¾¦Äa is not a king, he is not the oldest one even; because his father, VŒsudeva is also present in this YajÛa-pavilion. If you consider him your well-wisher and devoted, is Drupada inferior to him? Among the preceptors, it is DroÄŒcŒrya, among the Vedic Brahmins, it is VyŒsa and Bh¶¦ma having control over death at his will, are present here, than how can the worship of K¾¦Äa be possible? Had we been invited only to be insulted? We have not made you our <span class="char-style-override-7">e</span>mperor due to fear, greed or any attachment. Having considered you righteous only, we have given you the tribute. You have spoiled your repute and glory and your righteousness by doing this immoral work. K¾¦Äa was also not expected to accept this worship. This single immoral act has proved the lack of intelligence of all the three—Bh¶¦ma, Yudhi¦¢hira and K¾¦Äa. Now I can stay no longer in this assembly.’ Having uttered so, ÝiÜupŒla along with his follower kings, looking with slanting glance towards Yudhi¦¢hira etc., began to go out of the assembly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Yudhi¦¢hira went to ÝiÜupŒla and began to convince him in mild tone that—‘O the king! Just think over with cool mind—is it right for you to go out being annoyed from among so many kings? Whatever you said about Bh¶¦ma and Lord K¾¦Äa was not worth saying. You will have to be the sharer of immorality. Your words did not do any harm to Bh¶¦ma etc., at all but your tongue undoubtedly got polluted. Here, there are more learned persons than you, they are wiser and more devoted to religion than you. No one was dissatisfied to see the K¾¦Äa’s worship. Their behaviour and conduct is quite moral. You don’t know so much about Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s Tattva, mystery, attributes, influence and glory and his greatness as much Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha knows and to know, it is beyond your approach also.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Seeing Yudhi¦¢hira showing modesty, humbleness and meekness to ÝiÜupŒla, Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha said—‘Son! It is Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa only greater than all and ancient. It is not proper to behave so humbly with him who does not regard that very Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, the Supreme and adorable. Who is the Superior most among the K¦atriyas? Really it is he who is valiant and victorious? Is there any king whom K¾¦Äa has not defeated in the war? If there is anyone, then do speak anyone. It is not so, that he is adorable only with my view; but he is adorable for the whole world, he is the support and abode of the entire world. After thorough consideration and having taken the wise decision we have worshipped Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. Yudhi¦¢hira! There is no need to say more to ÝiÜupŒla now. Stabilize your mind. I have availed the opportunity of getting the association of great sages and seers, I have heard numerous virtues and noble qualities of Puru¦ottama Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, from their mouths. I know even his excellent and supernatural acts. Those, who suspect his magnitude, have never got the association of the virtuous and righteous persons.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘ÝiÜupŒla! If we have worshipped Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, it is not because he is a relative, a well-wisher, or by our own decision. We have done so, actually he deserves to be worshipped.’ If his divinity is ignored even and only his qualities are observed, even than, the knowledge of Vedas and six auxillaries of the Vedas, strength, charity, skill, heroism, repute, intelligence, meekness, lustre, observance of morality, patience, contentment and nourishment,—all these virtues and more numberless attributes are present there in Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. He is dear to all, mastermind, preceptor, father, Guru and everything. That is why we have worshipped him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O the kings! All of us should be pleased with the worship of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa because the worship of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is the worship of all. This embodiment of goodness, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa only, is the cause of the entire world creation, its sustenance, and destruction. He is appearing in the form of the world. Prak¾ti and Puru¦a are His own forms. He, being the knower of the innermost feelings of all, and omnipresent is beyond all. All the five elements, mind, reason and egotism, all the four kinds of beings are existing in Him. Not only in this cosmos but in all the universes, it is only Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, the Supreme. In His each and every hair-root, numerous cosmos are created and engrossed like the water-drop particle in the ocean. ÝiÜupŒla is yet a child, He does not know the aspects of personage and the magnanimity of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. The question is how to know, he has never tried to know about. I want to know anyone else other than ÝiÜupŒla, who does not want the worship of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa? I want to say unequivocally that I have worshipped Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. If anybody considers it improper, it has no meaning, whatever he wants to do he may do, it does not count.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After the statement of Bh¶¦ma, Sahadeva said—‘We have worshipped Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and that is quite justified. If it is unbearable to anyone, I subdue him and his head is under my feet. If he thinks himself energetic and brave, he should come forward and I am here, ready to encounter him. Nobody opposed Sahadeva. The flowers began to rain from the space. The gods began to congratulate Sahadeva applauding him ‘Bravo, Bravo.’ The seer, NŒrada, spoke once unequivocally words standing from his seat—‘The persons who don’t worship the lotus-eyed Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa in spite of being a human being, are like dead in spite of remaining alive. Actually, they should not be talked even.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The proceeding of the ‘YajÛa’ went on continuing. The other kings began to be worshipped. Moving apart from there, ÝiÜupŒla began to consult a few kings to create hindrance in the ‘YajÛa’ by breaking out the war in-between just then. Some of the kings joined him also. For sometime the uproar was created.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At then, approaching Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha, Yudhi¦¢hira asked—‘PitŒmaha! Many of the kings being angry are bent upon fighting on the instigation of ÝiÜupŒla. What should I do at present? Kindly, find out the way, guide me so that no hindrance may be created in the ‘YajÛa’ and it may be conducive to the welfare of all.’ Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha said—‘Yudhi¦¢hira! There is no reason to worry, your way is without thorns. I have already made up my mind in this regard what is to be done. Just for the example, seeing the lion asleep even the dogs start barking, and they run away when he is awaken, exactly the same, so long as Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is silent, only till then they are babbling. When he stands, all of them will become mum. Be sure of it that if they create any hindrance in the ‘YajÛa’ on the persuation of ÝiÜupŒla, all will be killed. The effulgence by which ÝiÜupŒla is harping on, will be swallowed by Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. Yudhi¦¢hira! Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is the cause of origin and destruction of the universe Himself and Himself is NŒrŒyaÄa. Those who want to assail harm to Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, have become perverse of intellect.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha was saying this openly before all. ÝiÜupŒla was also hearing it. He lost his self-control. Being enraged, he began to use ill and harsh words for Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, Bh¶¦ma and PŒÄÎavas. Hearing his words, Bh¶ma became red with anger. His natural red eyes expanded more. He began to crunch his lips with his teeth, on his forehead three lines of mark began to be visible clearly. His body began to tremble. Most of the people became silent casually to see his horrible feature. No one dared to speak. If anybody dared even to speak, his tongue was tied. Now, it was not late when Bh¶ma might attack upon ÝiÜupŒla. Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha, stretching his long hands very peacefully, restrained him. He pacified Bh¶ma with his didactic and sweet words. Bh¶ma could not violate his order due to his reverence and dignified attitude for Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha then, smiting ÝiÜupŒla said—‘Bh¶¦Ãa, why are you taking trouble to restrain Bh¶masena? At least set him a little free, so that all present here, may see how Bh¶ma is burnt to ashes hardly reaching me.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Paying no heed to ÝiÜupŒla’s words Bh¶¦Ãa said to Bh¶masena—‘Bh¶masena! At the very moment of ÝiÜupŒla’s birth, it had been finalised who would be the cause for his death.’ When he was born, he had started braying like donkey just falling on the earth and began to weep. He had four hands and three eyes. His mother, father and all other family members got worried what to do. At the same time there happened to be an oracle—‘There is no reason to fear. This child will cause no harm to you. He will be very powerful and prosperous. At present, he will not die, but one who will kill him has been born.’ Being impressed by the oracle, the mother lifted the son to her lap and being restless with the oracle of his death said addressing towards the incorporeal voice—‘having saluted to that one who has made this prophecy, I want to know something more. Who will be that one to kill him?’ The incorporeal voice answered—‘He will be killed with the hands of that one in whose lap just when he goes, the two hands and one eye of this child will disappear. He will kill him.’ This news spread all around. The kings and aristocrats of several countries began to visit to view this child. ÝiÜupŒla’s father gave due regard and warm reception to all and placed the child in their laps. Thus, the child was handed over to the thousands of laps but his two hands and the third eye did not disappear.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, hearing the news of this child of his maternal aunt, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa also visited. After the due regard and welcome, he also took ÝiÜupŒla in his lap. Just with the touch of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s body, his third eye vanished and his both two hands fell down having been detached from his body. At this being shocked, ÝiÜupŒla’s mother said to her nephew, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa—‘Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! It is only you to give shelter to the frightened persons, it is you to give peace and fearlessness. I ask for a boon from you, kindly, grant me.’ Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said—‘Dev¶! Don’t be afraid, there is no fear to you from me. What boon should I grant you?’ I will do whatever you say, whether it is possible or not.’ Then, ÝiÜupŒla’s mother said—‘Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! If any offence is done by this ÝiÜupŒla against you, kindly, you will pardon him.’ Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said—‘If your son commits even hundred sins, deserving death, I will pardon him and say nothing. Don’t be agonised.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ending the narrative, Bh¶¦ma said—‘Bh¶masena! Just mind, being overpowered by the same boon of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa ÝiÜupŒla is giving challenge fearlessly for the encounter in war. It is the truth that his challenge is also being made on the inspiration of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. Whatever ÝiÜupŒla has said in this open assembly, can never be expected from a noble person. There is no need to be terrified. Now, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa wants to take back His power.’ Hearing such secret from the mouth of Bh¶¦ma, ÝiÜupŒla became wild with anger. Being maddened by anger, he began to abuse openly. At last, Bh¶¦ma said—‘There is no gain now to talk, whosoever has capacity and courage to fight war, may call Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, just now, the matter will be resolved.’ Hearing the words of Bh¶¦ma, ÝiÜupŒla giving challenge to Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, said—‘Come forward, let us try out our comparative strength. Today, along with PŒÄÎavas, having killed you, let me fulfil my long-standing desire.’ He began to speak very harsh words of many different types.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After the utterance of ÝiÜupŒla’s harsh words, with gravity and patience, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said in a very soft and mild tone—‘O the kings! All of you know ÝiÜupŒla, his relation with us is not hidden to anyone. Till now, I have never caused any evil to him, yet, this vile fellow remains always engaged in assailing harm to us. He keeps enmity with us without any reason. When he got the information of my visit to PrŒgjyoti¦apura, he went secretly to DwŒrakŒ and set DwŒrakŒ on fire. The king Bhoja was recreating at the Raiwataka mountain, then, he killed his attendants without any reason. In the ‘AÜwamedha YajÛa’ of my father, he stole the horse. When the wife of great ascetic Babhru was going to the Sauv¶ra country, this mean got her raped having made an attack on the way. Having put on the dress of Karu¦arŒja, he kidnapped his would be wife having cheated of her. I forgave him till now for his faults, considering my promise given to my maternal aunt and I did not kill him up till now. I have disclosed his conduct before all of you, very clearly. I have already pardoned him for his one hundred crimes. Now, this mean cannot escape from death and at any cost he cannot remain alive. Today my furry cannot go waste by anyway.’ In the open full assembly, in spite of being exposed in such a way, ÝiÜupŒla did not feel ashamed at all. Contrary to it, he began to mock at K¾¦Äa laughing.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa recalled the ‘SudarÜana Cakra’. In front of all it came into the hands of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. As soon as Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa ordered, just then it moved glittering and having separated ÝiÜupŒla’s head from his body felled it on the ground. While the kings were looking around, in the twinkling of an eye, light emerged out of his body like lightening, and moving round about Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s feet merged into His body. Everyone was amazed to see it. All praised Bh¶¦ma highly. His knowledge and his experience began to be appreciated all around. It was on the tongue of all and sundry that there was none on the earth equal to Bh¶¦ma as a seer of Truth. Yudhi¦¢hira’s ‘YajÛa’ was completed without any obstacle. All went to their abodes.</p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-9">Kaurava’s defeat in VirŒ¢anagar, Bh¶¦ma’s Sermons, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s visit as a Messenger, Again Bh¶¦ma’s Sermon, War Preparation</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Time takes no time to pass on. Time goes on very fast. It seems that the happy days pass on so soon that we don’t realise when they passed. In the same way, the days of misery also pass on, but it seems that the days of misfortune are not passing on soon. When the persons of divine property remain happy, naturally, it creates jealousy in the minds of persons having demoniac propensities. Those, having demoniac property, become great enemy just getting a little pretext. Those, having divine property, are never jealous in their mind, they never want to cause ill to anyone. That is why, in spite of hindrances in the beginning, their happiness is stable but on the other hand, those, having demoniac traits, can never be happy at all. Sometimes, it appears that they are happy; but the reality is otherwise, they remain restless and their heart remains burning in the fire of intense jealousy, unrest and disorder. The persons of divine endowment elapse the ages long heavenly pleasures like momentary and possessors of the demoniac disposition suffer for the unlimited period from the torture of Hell. Even a little period of time becomes too long for them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The PŒÄÎava’s ‘YajÛa’ was accomplished without any hindrance. They worshipped the Lord with great piety and peace through that ‘YajÛa’. There was no jealousy and hatred for anybody in their mind. Thus far, even Duryodhana etc., had been accorded a warm welcome and high honour in this ‘YajÛa’; but going through all this, Duryodhana etc., were not happy. The fire of intense jealousy blazed more in his heart. By forming groupism, they began to plan how to grab the PŒÄÎavas property. By the advice of Ýakun¶, it was decided to gamble and having sought permission forcibly from Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra, they called in the PŒÄÎavas. The gambling was held. By the cunning tricks of Ýakun¶, the PŒÄÎavas lost not only their property and entire wealth but even themselves and their beloved wife also. Even after their defeat the Kauravas were not satisfied yet. They tried to make menstruous Draupad¶ naked in the open assembly. By the Lord’s grace, she was delivered. All that time, the atmosphere of that place got so much polluted that in spite of Draupad¶’s several queries, no one answered her questions. So many of them turned their face back and even Bh¶¦ma diverted the matter towards Yudhi¦¢hira without giving clear answer.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, the question arises, why did a righteous, and a great scholar of religion like Bh¶¦ma not answer the questions of Draupad¶? After contemplation, it appears that the circumstances of that period were intricate and adverse. The PŒÄÎavas lived far away. Bh¶¦ma lived along with the Kauravas. It was Duryodhana, who managed for his meals etc. Due to his impure food materials and impure association, Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha’s mind had also been somewhat polluted. That is why, in spite of his effort to think over, Bh¶¦ma could not find out the true answers of Draupad¶’s profound questions and could not decide what to answer. In this regard there is a hearsay. It is not known, whether this fable has been cited in any scripture or not. But, undoubtedly, it has been heard through the elderly people certainly. When Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha was lying on the bed of arrows and DharmarŒja Yudhi¦¢hira was listening from him different kinds of religious acts, moral duties, devotion and fundamental truths, Draupad¶ happened to laugh abruptly. Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha asked Draupad¶ to see her laughing—‘Daughter! <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou cannot laugh without any reason, tell me the reason of your laughter at this moment?’ Draupad¶ opened her mind before him with some hesitation. She said—‘DŒdŒj¶! (Grandfather) <span class="char-style-override-7">w</span>hen I was being undressed in the open assembly and I was asking you what the morality ordained at that moment; whether himself, the loser Yudhi¦¢hira, had right to lose me or not; then you uttered that your mind was not able to decide rightly just and diverted me to Yudhi¦¢hira with the advice that ‘whatever Yudhi¦¢hira says is right; but today you are giving sermons on the fundamental truths of religion. Seeing this, I came to laugh.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha said—‘Daughter! At that moment, on account of the association with the Kauravas and due to eating their impure polluted meal, my wit had failed to decide right and wrong, moral and immoral because of being polluted. Now, with the stroke of the arrows, the polluted blood of my body has gone out and my mind and understanding has become pure. At present, the secrets of the truths are clearly visible to me.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Probably, Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha’s understanding might have been spoiled or not, this hearsay, at least, teaches us that the polluted atmosphere and company of persons of evil nature, may have their impact even on the exalted souls. It may be possible that Bh¶¦ma might have played the part knowingly and inspired us to remain free from such faults or remain away from such blames in spite of even accepting some stigma to himself; because every activity of the great persons is done for the good of the common human beings.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In spite of all these occurrences, Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha’s inclination was towards the PŒÄÎavas and his mind and heart remained always in favour of the PŒÄÎavas. Its evidence can be viewed at a number of places in MahŒbhŒrata. At the first time of gambling, Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra returned back the entire property to Draupad¶, set the PŒÄÎavas free; in the second chance of gambling, it was decided that for twelve years the PŒÄÎavas would remain exiled and one year dwelling incognito. Going to the forest they practised dire penance, Arjuna acquired PŒÜupŒt astra (Lord Ýiva’s weapon). They spent the thirteenth year in VirŒ¢anagar dwelling incognito in disguised form. Thus, having one year of dwelling incognito passed. The Kauravas were greatly worried to know where the PŒÄÎavas were dwelling and how to ruin them? The detectives reported that they could not be traced out and expressed the assumption that they were not alive probably. Duryodhana sought the opinion and the advice of Du¬ÜŒsana, KarÄa and DroÄacŒrya. They advised to find out them. Bh¶¦ma supported the statement of DroÄŒcŒrya and said—‘The PŒÄÎavas are the followers of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, they observe the moral conduct. There is no possibility of their destruction at all. I just tell you the them out. The reason given by the other ones regarding Yudhi¦¢hira’s dwelling in a hidden place does not appeal me. There can never be any harm or ill to the king of that country or city where the PŒÄÎavas would be dwelling. The people of that place would be munificent, humble, soft speaking, righteous, keepers of the propriety, self-controlled, truthful and devoted to their religion. The chanting of Vedas would be being heard, several ‘YajÛa’s would be being performed. It would be raining timely, The earth would be laden with grains and there would be greenery everywhere and there the earth would be free from fear. The grains would be tasty, and the fruits would be nutrious. It must be breezing sweet, soft and fragrant. There would be no animosity anywhere. The cows would be healthy and strong. The Brahmins there would be engaged in observing the Dharma. There would be mutual love among the people. There would be no untimely death. The people would be inclined towards hospitability of the guests. People there, would be enthusiastic. The virtues of truthfulness, patience, charitability, peace, forgiveness, splendour, fame, liberal-mindedness, kindness, simplicity, are always possessed by Yudhi¦¢hira. Wherever they live, virtues spread over. They are learned and great souls, they must be dwelling anywhere in disguise. I can say nothing more than this.’ If it is necessary to search out them, try to find out them at such a place.’ Bh¶¦ma’s these words indicate his opinion about Yudhi¦¢hira etc. In spite of dwelling with Duryodhana, he had a great faith and hope only in Yudhi¦¢hira by heart and from time to time he admires the virtues of Yudhi¦¢hira too.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the advice of SuÜarmŒ, the Kauravas invaded upon VirŒ¢a, the king of Matsya country. Those days, the PŒÄÎavas were dwelling there in disguise. The great king VirŒ¢a had gone to another direction to fight against SuÜarmŒ, the Kauravas attacked from the another direction. Seeing the opportunity, Arjuna appeared. This did not remain hidden to the Kauravas also. This was talk of the time among the public that Arjuna had appeared before, the completion of ‘one year dwelling incognito’; he will have to undergo the exile of twelve years again. After DroÄŒcŒrya’s query, Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha said—‘O the preceptor! There are many big and small degrees of the wheel of time, as KŒ¦¢ha, KŒla, Muhurta, day, fortnight, month, Graha, Nak¦atra, season and year. The increasing and decreasing meteoric speed and it’s turn upside down and inside out, every fifth year, two months increase. Including those intercalary months, today thirteen months have completed and five months six days more have been added to thirteen years. The PŒÄÎava’s vow has been completed, that is why Arjuna has appeared before you. All the five PŒÄÎavas and specially, Yudhi¦¢hira understands essence of the fundamental truth and economics. There can be no possibility of the moral and religious fault from them. They are free from greed. They have practised hard spiritual discipline. They don’t want to get the kingdom by immoral means. They have not shown their prowess yet because remaining bound by the religious principles. They can accept to go into the mouth of death smiling; they can never accept to go on the immoral path. They will take their rightful share at any cost. Even Indra cannot grab their share. Now, we will have to fight battle with them.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That day, none could stand before Arjuna. Having been defeated, the Kauravas returned back to HastinŒpura. Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha was not worried even the least on the defeat of Kauravas. He was very glad to know about the well-being of the PŒÄÎavas. It was his heartiest desire that the PŒÄÎavas should get their state without any war and the PŒÄÎavas and Kauravas both should remain happy. But he was waiting for the God’s will. He knew and he was confident that whatever God does, that will be good. Convinced of this fact, he used to remain engaged in the Lord’s worship.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The PŒÄÎavas appeared. VirŒ¢a’s daughter, UttarŒ was married with Abhimanyu. On the auspicious occasion of the marriage ceremony, the friendly kings of a number of countries, presented themselves. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and BalarŒma also reached. There was exchange of thought that the PŒÄÎavas must get their kingdom. It was decided to put this proposal before Kauravas modestly. Even then, if they don’t agree to give back the PŒÄÎavas state, the war should be waged. Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra sent SaÛjaya to the PŒÄÎavas and tried to get the matter settled without giving them anything as their share. SaÛjaya came back from there. He narrated the PŒÄÎavas enthusiasm and gave his opinion that it would be better not to fight any war against them. The discussion started on this subject in the Kaurava’s assembly. First of all, Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha explained very clearly and openly—‘Duryodhana! To win the PŒÄÎavas is beyond your power. Nobody can give defeat to the side where K¾¦Äa and Arjuna are there. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna are ‘Nara-NŒrŒyaÄa’ in person. It is not only I utter so, all the gods and sages know this fact.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once, the BrahmŒ’s assembly was in progress. B¾haspati, ÝukrŒcŒrya, Sapta¾¦i, Indra, Fire and Wind gods, perfect saints, Gandharvas, all were occupying their seats at the proper place in the assembly. At the same moment, Nara-NŒrŒyaÄa also passed by that way. All and sundry got amazed to see Their glorious and splendrous face. They did not even stay in the BrahmŒ’s assembly and proceeded on. B¾haspati asked BrahmŒ—‘Lord! Who are they passing on ahead without worshipping you?’ BrahmŒ said—‘They are Nara-NŒrŒyaÄa who enlighten all the three worlds by virtue of their splendour. In the entire universe, bliss and peace are spread over only by them. They are the two lovely aspects of the single Lord to destroy the demons. So, Duryodhana, the idea to win Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna is not commendable.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha continued—‘Those days, the war between the demons and gods was going on. The gods were frightened. They approached Nara-NŒrŒyaÄa. They supplicated and prayed for the boon. Nara-NŒrŒyaÄa said—‘Indra! Demand whatever you desire.’ Then, he asked for His help in the war. With the help of Nara-NŒrŒyaÄa, Indra got victory and the demons were defeated. Nara-NŒrŒyaÄa have given defeat to the demons several times. The same ‘Nara’ is Arjuna and the same ‘NŒrŒyaÄa’ is Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. I am not speaking it from my ownself. The knower of Vedas, NŒrada has narrated it to me. No brave of the worlds can defeat Them. Duryodhana! You are not listening to me at present, but when you see  Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, wielding a discus, Conch shell, mace (GadŒ), Padma (lotus) and Arjuna, armed with GŒÄÎ¶va bow sitting together in the same chariot, you will remember my words. If you don’t follow my advice, the entire dynasty of Kuru will be destroyed at all without any doubt. I have told you a great secret, even then, if you don’t listen to me and follow the advice of KarÄa, blemished by ParaÜurŒma’s curse, lower-caste Sµuta’s son and evil-minded Ýakun¶ and Du¬ÜŒsana, then, it means that your understanding has been corrupted with the both Dharma and sense.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the words of Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha, KarÄa lost his temper. He said—‘PitŒmaha! You will never try to speak such words in future. I have adopted and practised the duties of K¦atriyas. I extend my advice to Duryodhana to follow the duties of K¦atriyas. There is nothing in me to be blamed or misconduct of any type. I will kill Arjuna in the war to please Duryodhana. Now, good relation with them is never possible.’ I will please Duryodhana whatever I might have to do.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the words of KarÄa, Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha said to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra—‘Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra! KarÄa several times boasts of himself that—‘I will kill the PŒÄÎavas’ but I know the strength and weakness of the both. He is not even the sixteenth portion of the PŒÄÎavas. On account of him a great calamity is about to fall on your wicked sons. Duryodhana is puffed up on his strength. He has disdained and insulted the godly PŒÄÎavas only due to him. What is more that KarÄa has done till now? Arjuna killed his brother, VikarÄa before him and then where had his vigour gone? When Arjuna alone, forcing one hundred Kauravas including Duryodhana, Arjuna snatched their clothes then whether KarÄa was asleep? When the Gandharvas had taken away the Kauravas arresting them, then, how had KarÄa faced them? It was the PŒÄÎavas who had protected the Kauravas at that time. This KarÄa boasts of his greatness himself with his own mouth and usually, gives them worthless advice that may destroy the both virtue and semanticism. Without agreeing to his advice, make a treaty with the PŒÄÎavas and handover their share to them’. DroÄŒcŒrya supported the suggestion of Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha. God knows what was there in the Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra’s mind that he did not pay heed to the words of Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha and began to talk with SaÛjaya.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa came to HastinŒpura with the proposal of treaty from the PŒÄÎavas side, Duryodhana secretly made the conspiracy that Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa should be arrested. When Bh¶¦ma came to know this fact, he said to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra rudely in very harsh words—‘Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra! <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>our son is dull-witted. He only thinks on the line that the family may be ruined. He does not follow the right path even after the guidance of the well-wishers and friends. You too, support your vicious son, the follower of an evil course and act accordingly, paying no attention to your well-wisher’s advice. If Duryodhana caused any harm to K¾¦Äa, he would be burnt to ashes in K¾¦Äa’s fiery anger. He has deviated from the righteousness. I don’t want to hear his damaging words. ‘Having said so, Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha stood up and went away.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When Lord K¾¦Äa put the proposal of treaty before all in the assembly and got them persuaded that there was only loss and loss in the war, so they should follow the righteous path and handover to DharmarŒja, his share. At that time, addressing Duryodhana, Bh¶¦ma said—‘Son! Obey Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s order, given with the motive of welfare of your brothers. It is very bad to be overpowered by anger. If you don’t accept Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s advice, it will not do good to you. To obey His order is the only source of true happiness and welfare. The words of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa are according to the virtue and worldly meaningful conduct and helpful in achieving the true goal of life. Don’t ruin the subjects, accept the treaty-proposal. Son! Being mad in anger don’t create trouble for your friend’s lives, don’t ruin the auspicious Goddess Lak¦m¶ like empire of Bharata dynasty. I advise you again and again not to deviate from the righteousness.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After Bh¶¦ma it was DroÄŒcŒrya, Vidura and Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra who tried to convince him but Duryodhana did not agree to anybody’s suggestion. Seeing his behaviour, Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha and DroÄŒcŒrya were very much pained. They began to say to Duryodhana jointly together— ‘Duryodhana! Still there is a chance for you to come around, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna have not declared war. Yet, Arjuna’s bow ‘GŒÄÎ¶va’ has not been filled with bow string. Still, oblations have not been made to the fire-god by Dhaumya for the destruction of the enemies. Yudhi¦¢hira’s peaceful spirit has not glanced at you with wrathful eyes. Twisting his mace like the horrible death (Yama) Bh¶masena is not yet destroying your army. Still think over, come to senses and avoid massacre, just now salute Yudhi¦¢hira bowing your head; he will embrace you. Let him keep his right hand on your shoulders and pat the hands on your back affectionately. Meet the five PŒÄÎavas with love, let all shed their joyous tears. Let the peace be declared, and without bloodshed, may the people start living happily!’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Duryodhana did not concede to anybody’s suggestion, contrary to it he went away leaving the assembly and began to try to arrest Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. Showing his divine potency, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa set out therefrom and after his departure, Bh¶¦ma and DroÄa began to persuade Duryodhana again. They said—‘Duryodhana! The message sent by Kunt¶  through Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa to the PŒÄÎavas is known to you also. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is agreeing with it and the PŒÄÎavas are sure to obey their mother’s command. Till now, they were bound by morality. That is why they remained suffering till now. Now, there is no hope that they would remain peaceful. They can never forget the humiliation of Draupad¶ in the open assembly caused by you. It was not protested and opposed at that time, only because of moral binding. According to their promise they have suffered the exiled life and dwelling incognito for one year. Now, there is no moral binding. They are already in possession of the infallible weapons. They are expert in the science of arms. They have braves like Bh¶ma and Arjuna and they have supporter like Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, they can never sit silent. You do know well that Arjuna alone defeated all of us in VirŒ¢anagara. It was Arjuna to release you from the clutches of Gandharvas. It is simply a specimen of Arjuna’s prowess. To remain amicably with them, is the only way of protection of Kuru dynasty. Let all the assistants go back. Meet with them unarmed. Whatever we the both olds are saying, that is in your interest, follow our advice and act wisely.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Duryodhana did not agree at all to anyone, war became imminent. From both the sides, much preparations had already been made. The rest preparation was also made. Now, only the declaration of war was left to be made.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A great problem was created before Bh¶¦ma at that moment. Since the day he had promised to give up the royal throne, it never came in his mind that the kingdom was his own or he had any attachment with it. Whenever the help was required, he helped. If his any advice was needed, he gave it otherwise he used to remain engaged in worshipping God silently sitting in a secluded place. It was in his mind that Duryodhana had given the dwelling place, he manages for his fooding and clothing, so his body nourished with his grain, belonged to him. Just like a warrior lives a life staying in the royal shelter, he also staying in the shelter of Duryodhana, is brought up with the grain of Duryodhana. I ought to give up my life for the sake of Duryodhana fighting like a warrior. On the other hand, it also striked in his mind that Yudhi¦¢hira was virtuous, he, himself was ‘Dharma’ itself. I should remain on his side. He became somewhat perplexed with both of the thoughts, but at last, it was decided by him that it would be so as God wills, there is no need to stay in a fix now. Being self assured, He began to remain absorbed in dwelling upon God.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-10">The Rules of MahŒbhŒrata war, Lord K¾¦Äa’s backtrack from his vow for keeping Bh¶¦ma’s pledge</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The purpose of the Lord’s incarnation is to end the unrighteousness and establish rule of righteousness. When on the earth atrocities and the tyrants are in the ascendance, than God incarnates Himself to destroy them and for the ascendance of virtues and righteous persons. Along with the Lord, many gods, great souls also incarnate on the earth usually to assist the Lord in His frolicsome activities. Yudhi¦¢hira, Arjuna etc., are the same type of incarnations. If the Lord wanted, Yudhi¦¢hira could have got the royal kingdom only by His SaÆkalpa even; the atrocious might be extirpated; but the Lord’s aim was not to do so. By causing war between the divine and demoniac persons, He wanted to show it clearly that He supports the Divine persons. There was one more object also. Those days, many demons also were born in the form of K¦atriyas. Some hiding themselves, or some manifesting themselves used to behave against the righteousness. His purpose was to annihilate both the kinds of demons. Considering it not necessary to use the arms Himself, the Lord called some of them in favour of the PŒÄÎavas and some in favour of the Kauravas (so-called demons in the form of K¦atriyas). In both the groups there were sufficient number of demons, Gha¢otkaca etc., were on oneside, and on the other side, Alambu¦a etc., mighty than them. Now, such gods and great souls were needed that themselves should belong to the group against righteousness, but remaining in the shield of Dharma and declaring themselves in favour of righteousness, should also kill those demons fighting from the side of DharmarŒja.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This should be the work of the beloved devotees of the Lord instead of the righteous persons fighting from the DharmarŒja’s side. There is nothing to say about those who remain with the Lord and slay the demons; but those who fulfil the Lord’s will and help Him in His purpose of incarnation by belonging to the opposite group of the Lord, of course, they, themselves shoot the arrow even on the Lord, are the great souls of repute and it is undoubtedly, they are performing the great deeds of the Lord even unknowingly. After the consideration from this point of view, it appears so that remaining on the PŒÄÎavas side, SŒtyak¶ etc., are doing such works for the establishment of righteousness, the same work is being done by Bh¶¦ma, DroÄa and KarÄa standing on Duryodhana’s side. All of them are the incarnation of the gods. They are assisting in the Lord’s frolicsome activities. For the pleasure of the Lord, in spite of seeming to be doing the deeds in favour of immorality outwardly, they are proving themselves to be helpful for the Lord in relieving the burden of the earth just as Yudhi¦¢hira, Arjuna and Bh¶ma. In this way thus, with another point of view to please the Lord, having accepted the unrighteous side, they have shown the extremity of their devotion or it appears clearly that the Lord has shown His excessive affection to them selecting them to play such parts in His frolicsome activities. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It matters little what the people think of but by the Lord’s will, by His inspiration—Bh¶¦ma participated on Duryodhana’s side to support and assist the Lord’s cause and becoming the commander of his army, first he pledged to kill ten thousand braves of the PŒÄÎavas side daily.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When both the sides were fully prepared, approaching Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha, Duryodhana said to him very humbly with folded palms—‘PitŒmaha! My army is well prepared by all the means to fight, but it is getting loss for want of a suitable commander. The army may be very powerful and very big but without an worthy commander, the entire army cannot do anything. You are the expert in the war-strategy, a great righteous person and my well-wisher. Nobody can kill you because your death is at your will. It is you who is my protector and axiomatic commander. Remaining under your protection, there will be no fear of gods even. Just as the gods army is headed by KŒrtikeya, in the same way lead my army. All of us will follow you.’ Hearing Duryodhana’s prayer Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha said—‘Duryodhana! You are right in your version—In my vision the PŒÄÎavas are the same like you. According to my pledge, I will fight from your side, and give sermon to the PŒÄÎavas for their welfare. Arjuna is a great brave, Arjuna has the knowledge of several divine weapons and arms, and he possesses the capacity to fight the war against me, even then he won’t fight against me face to face. I have a great affection for the PŒÄÎavas, I will not kill anyone of them. If I don’t die earlier, I take my vow that I will kill ten thousands warriors of their side daily. Besides it, there is a condition either KarÄa should fight the war first or I should fight. In the war KarÄa has rivalry with me, both of us will not fight jointly together’. KarÄa said—‘I will not fight in the life time of PitŒmaha; Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha accepted the commander-post. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Duryodhana in the prescribed way consecrated Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha on the post of commander. The Brahmins were donated numerous kinds of gifts. A number of bands and drums began to be sounded, all the directions resounded with the lion roar of the warriors and trumpet of the horses and elephants, many fierce disturbances occurred in the sky, space and on the earth. Keeping Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha ahead, all set out on the journey of  Kuruk¦etra. Having reached Kuruk¦etra, the camps of the army were setup. An other HastinŒpura was created there. Now enough, it was the wait of the war to start.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha explained to Duryodhana, the capacities of the MahŒrath¶s, Atirath¶s, Rath¶ and Ekarath¶ of his side. In this context he addressed KarÄa as Ardharath¶. PitŒmaha said—‘Duryodhana! You hope to win the PŒÄÎavas trusting on the words of that KarÄa, who is a proudy, mean and liar, he does not possess even the original armour and a large earring. He has been cursed also by ParaÜurŒma on account of his false statement as telling himself to be a Brahmin and thus, deceiving him by his false version. I don’t consider him a Rath¶, Atirath¶, I consider him only Ardharath¶.’ DroÄŒcŒrya also supported Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha. He said—‘What an act of heroism has been shown by KarÄa till now? He talks tall but at the critical moment he runs away.’ KarÄa got irritated by hearing the words of the both. He was going to gabble beyond limit but Duryodhana interrupted him and diverted the matter in-between by asking Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha about the strength and warriors of the PŒÄÎavas side. Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha described in detail about the strength of the PŒÄÎavas and said in the last—‘I, alone, will fight against these braves and I will check them. On their side it is only eunuch, Drupada Kumara ‘ÝikhaÄÎ¶’ against whom I cannot fight. Eunuch (ÝikhaÄÎ¶) was AmbŒ, the daughter of KŒÜ¶rŒja in the previous birth. AmbŒ practised penance to kill me and she has been born to Drupada in the form of female eunuch (ÝikhaÄÎin¶). By the grace of a demigod the female eunuch has now become the male eunuch, but because of being first a female, I will not attack with arms and weapon.’ Duryodhana consented to his statement.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thenafter, the Kauravas and the PŒÄÎavas decided war rules. It was decided as per rule that in the evening at the cease of the war, all will maintain cordial relation. Those, only having the equal strength, will fight against each other in an equitable way. Nobody will cheat anyone in the war, and no injustice will be done by anyone. The speech fight should be faced with the speech only. Those who run away or gets out of the battlefield by anyway, will not be assaulted at all. The charioteer will fight against the charioteer, the elephant rider will fight against elephant rider, the horserider will fight against the horserider, the infantry will fight against infantry according to their skill, will, courage, zeal, and prowess. First of all after making alert, then, the attack will be made. Such one who is careless having belief that none would assail him or who is perturbed and frightened, will not be attacked. No assault will be made on assaulted. No assault will be made on the charioteer, load-bearer, one who will be fighting with one man, whose armour is cut off, whose arms are broken or being without weapon, who is armsless, such persons will never be attacked. No assault will be made on charioteer, load-bearer elephants, horses, bullocks etc., or who earn their living by manufacturing the arms or the arms-carriers, the players of conch-shell, drums, bands etc.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">These were the rules of the great war of India. The world today that boasts of its civilization, must compare a bit wisely the most treacherous modern civilization with the ancient civilization. Today, in the great fierce warfare, the soldiers having covered their mouth and nose with shield, are safe from the affect of the gasses; but the destitute children; crippled, disabled persons, women who have no concern with the war, are in a great peril. Is it the sign of an advanced culture? It was once the time, it was once the civilization when after fighting for their share the whole day, in the evening, the brave warriors of both the sides used to embrace each other. It is not enough to talk of embracing each other but more than this, they remained ready to offer everything possible on their demand. It is not known about this story where and when it is related to, but I have heard it and no doubt it is a very good story. When Duryodhana was going to KŒmyaka forest to root out the PŒÄÎavas, and he wanted to destroy the PŒÄÎavas anyhow, at that time, Arjuna’s friend GandharvarŒja, Citrasena drived away the Kauravas. They took away Duryodhana,  having arrested him. When it came to Yudhi¦¢hira’s knowledge, he sent Arjuna saying that—‘In the mutual strife we are five in number and they are hundred; but in the hostility with others we are jointly one hundred five in number together.When the Gandharvas did not release Duryodhana on the simple request of Arjuna, then, Arjuna got Duryodhana released by fighting a war against them. At that moment, being obliged to Arjuna by his righteous deed, Duryodhana said—‘Brother! Demand whatever you desire; If you want, I may give you the entire empire, if you want I may establish a new city for you and if you say, I may surrender my life to you. Arjuna did not agree to accept anything, then, Duryodhana became sad. Seeing Duryodhana sad, Arjuna said—‘Well! Keep my things safe as trust, when I need, I will demand it. Duryodhana became pleased.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the great war of India on the pressing solicitation of Duryodhana one day, Bh¶¦ma had taken a vow—‘I will kill all the five PŒÄÎavas with these five arrows’. When this news came to the PŒÄÎavas camp, DharmarŒja got much worried. Whenever any misfortune or misery befell on the PŒÄÎavas, then they had the only shelter, that was the shelter of Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. Just while remembering, He presented Himself there. Hearing the vow of Bh¶¦ma, he smiled as if it were a trivial matter for him. He reminded Arjuna of the event of that day. Arjuna had already forgotten it. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said—‘Arjuna! Let both of us go to Duryodhana. Now, ‘it has become a must to be benefitted with the event of that day.’ Arjuna happened to be in a fix. He did not want to take the return of his obligation in this way, but first there was the question of life and death of all the five brothers and secondly it was the order of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa; he could not avoid his words. He went to the Duryodhana’s camp with Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was night. Being tired of the whole day, the warriors were sleeping. The guards were keeping a watch, but all recognised Arjuna. None checked him. They reached Duryodhana. Duryodhana received both of them warmly like his dearest friend and asked—‘Tell me your purpose of coming at this time.’ Arjuna reminded him of the event of the day of his release from Citrasena and asked—‘Do you remember your words?’ Duryodhana said—‘Brother! So long as I am alive, I cannnot forget your obligation. What do you want? If you say, I will stop the war. (I may enthrone you) Let me do whatever you say. Arjuna said—‘Brother! Now, the war is already going on, now what is the use to stop it. We want to take the kingdom with our powers and prowess, we cannot accept any charity donated by anyone. We have come here with a particular purpose. Please, give me your crown for one hour, Then after I will return it. Duryodhana, at once, handedover his crown to Arjuna. Now, the Lord K¾¦Äa put Arjuna ahead and himself followed him. Both of  them came to the camp of Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha. At that moment, PitŒmaha was meditating upon God. Approaching him Arjuna saluted. Seeing the crown with his half opened eyes he thought that it would be Duryodhana to come as usual; he blessed him and on the demand of Arjuna he gave his five arrows also. When Arjuna came out with the arrows, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa went before Bh¶¦ma then. Seeing Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha got amazed. He asked—‘Lord! How are You here at this time? The Lord said—‘PitŒmaha! When you have taken vow to kill the PŒÄÎavas, how can I sleep? Now, your arrows have slipped out of your hands? Will you kill the PŒÄÎavas tomorrow?’ Bh¶¦ma said—‘Lord! Who can kill them who are under <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>our protection? What is the value there in my vow? Let <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>our wish be fulfilled. Let not be any desire in me against <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>our wish.’ Smiling, the Lord came back with Arjuna, thus, the PŒÄÎavas were protected.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Here, the single purpose to mention this event is that in the ancient time what holy civilization was there! In the return of one obligation only, a defamed person like Duryodhana can handover his own crown and can go to the extent to be ready to give up his life even. Is there any such a bold person with modern civilization who can behave with his enemy in such a way? or is there any such a person of such firm conviction that he may dare to go in the enemy’s camp unarmed in the night? Well, the rules of the war between Kauravas and PŒÄÎavas were framed and they were implemented also to the best possible extent. I don’t say that there was no violation of the rules at all. No doubt the rules were violated and certainly violated but it was condemned also not less ultimately, war is war at all.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The armies of both the sides were arrayed for battle. Whatever the delusion and dismay occurred in Arjuna’s mind, was removed by the Lord by giving the sermons of the G¶tŒ. From both the sides great braves began to make war cry, the conch-shells were blown. Still sometime was there for the arms to be discharged. In the meanwhile it was marked with great wonder that DharmarŒja Yudhi¦¢hira, having put off his armour and coming down from his chariot unarmed, was moving towards the Kauravas army. Seeing him going in this way, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, Arjuna, Bh¶ma and Sahadeva began to follow him and also other kings so Arjuna said—‘Honourable <span class="char-style-override-7">l</span>ord! What are you doing? What is your motive to go on foot amidst the army of the enemy leaving us behind? Bh¶masena said—‘You are having given up your arms and armour, proceeding towards the army of the enemy, well equipped with the arms and weapons, what is in your mind? Nakula and Sahadeva also questioned, but he answered to none, he continued going. Smiling Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa made the people understand that he knew his mind. Really, he was going to salute Bh¶¦ma, DroÄa, K¾pa etc., the olders and elders and to seek their permission to wage the war. It is only by paying due regard to the ‘Gurujanas’ (spiritual guides) and obeying their order a person gets victory. The doubt of all was cleared.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The army men of the Kauravas were giving their own views differently talking to each other. Someone said that Yudhi¦¢hira got afraid, someone said that he was going to them to seek shelter, somebody said that he proved to be a blot in the family. Yudhi¦¢hira paid no heed to anybody what he was saying. He went to Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha straightway, touched his feet and said—‘PitŒmaha! Such circumstances have come that being compelled, we have to fight against you. Kindly permit us for this and bless us. Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha said—‘Son! You are a great knower of virtue. You have followed the path of morality by seeking permission from me in this way. If you had not done so, I would have cursed you for your defeat. Now, I am very much pleased with you. May you be victor in the war and your ambition be fulfilled! Go, I order you to fight the war. Yudhi¦¢hira! Demand of me if you want anything more. You cannot be defeated by any means. O the king! What should I say? How should I clarify you? Take it for sure that man is the slave of wealth. But the wealth is not slave of anyone. It is only the money that has become the cause for the Kauravas to enslave me. That is why I am talking to you like eunuch that I am helpless. Having accepted the riches and sustenance of the Kauravas, my mind is enslaved. Except the assistance in the war, you can demand anything whatever you want and I can give you that.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Yudhi¦¢hira said—‘PitŒmaha! It is your magnanimity. How can we know your motive behind what you say? If you fight from the Duryodhana side, you must fight. Let your body be from his side but your heart should be from our side, and may you be always giving us the advice of our interest, this is what I demand from you.’ Bh¶¦ma said—‘I will fight from the Duryodhana side, explain clearly what advice can I give you?’ Then, Yudhi¦¢hira said—‘PitŒmaha! I want your advice of my interest as how can I win you in the war? Nobody can give you defeat and no one can kill you. You, yourself tell me the device of your death.’ Bh¶¦mapitŒmah said—‘Yudhi¦¢hira! There none is visible who can kill me in the war. Even, the Lord Indra, himself cannot win me, time of my death is still not in sight, hence go at present and come again at right time and I will help you. Having the blessings of DroÄŒcŒrya, K¾pŒcŒrya etc., Yudhi¦¢hira came back to his army.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The war broke out. Here, it is not our subject of the description how fierce the war was, who were killed in the war, who shot how many arrows at whom, and everyday, how many braves were killed. In nutshell it is enough to know that it was a fierce war and Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha killed ten thousand soldiers everyday according to his promise. The third day, the PŒÄÎavas outwitted the Kauravas by the midday. The Kauravas soldiers began to run away, Duryodhana, himself fainted. The charioteer saved his life taking him away from the battlefield. After being conscious, Duryodhana persuaded the soldiers to return back and then going to Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha began to say—‘PitŒmaha! It can never be said proper that my army should run away in this way in spite of you, DroÄacŒrya, K¾pŒcŒrya remaining alive. At any cost, I cannot accept it that the PŒÄÎavas are more valiant than you all. It seems to me that you don’t check the PŒÄÎavas forcibly showing kindness to them and you are forgiving them knowingly. If such was your wish, then why didn’t you make it clear in the beginning? I have waged this war on your assurance. If really, you are not giving up my alliance, then, fight the war according to your valour and destroy the enemy.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the words of Duryodhana, Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha began to laugh. Then, being red in anger, his eyes became livid with rage, he said to Duryodhana—‘Duryodhana! If you had paid attention to my words, why would have come such miserable plight? I have told you the truth again and again and I have already indicated your interest also. I have told you this fact several times—‘If all the gods including even Indra, want to defeat the PŒÄÎavas, they are not capable of it. I am old, there are remaining a few days of my life. Whatever is possible for me to do, I am doing. Well, see if you want to see my prowess, I, alone, check the PŒÄÎavas and their all the warriors.’ Just hearing these words coming out of the mouth of Bh¶¦map¶tamaha, among the army men of the Kauravas, the conch-shells began to sound. All rushed up to attack on their opponents. In the midst of the PŒÄÎavas army also different types of large Kettledrums began to sound.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The war of that day was the wonderful war. On the whole battle ground of Kuruk¦etra, there were the heads of the body only visible. Some were shouting—‘kill-kill’, cut down butcher, slay on and there were some whose legs and hands had been severed from the body and they were groaning with pain lying down in the battlefield. The exceedingly powerful Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha began to kill addressing the name of the warriors of the PŒÄÎava’s side with the rain of his arrows intermingling all the ten directions. At that time it was only Bh¶¦ma alone visible in hundreds and thousand forms on account of his agility. Being wounded by his arrows, the army of the PŒÄÎavas became somewhat like unconscious and began to cry in distress. The PŒÄÎavas soldiers began to flee away.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said to Arjuna—‘See! Now, a very difficult and horrible time has come before us, if you don’t assault on Bh¶¦ma at present, you can do nothing. You, had taken the vow earlier that whosoever comes before me to fight, they might be even Bh¶¦ma, DroÄa or K¾pŒcŒrya. I will fight against them and kill them and their attendants. Now, the time has ripen, fulfil your promise.’ Arjuna said—‘Drive my chariot to them.’ The Lord moved the chariot ahead. Seeing Arjuna’s chariot moving towards Bh¶¦ma, the soldiers got encouraged, they also returned back, again the fierce war started. Shooting his arrows swiftly, Arjuna disjoined many cords of Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha’s bow. Bh¶¦ma applauded Arjuna and asked to fight firmly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦ma anguished Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna both with his harrowing arrows, their bodies got mangled. The entire army got wounded by the arrows of Bh¶¦ma and began to run away. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa began to think that Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha was fighting in full swing and Arjuna was fighting mildly. Arjuna had the reverence for him in his mind. That is why he was not using the sharp and hard arrows at him. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was thinking so on the one hand, but on the other side, Arjuna’s chariot was surrounded by the arrows of Bh¶¦ma. The Kaurava’s army also tried to surround him from all the four sides. At the same moment SŒtyaki reached there for the help of Arjuna. He saw that the PŒÄÎava’s troop had been frightened by the rain of Bh¶¦ma’s arrows. Thus, seeing the PŒÄÎava’s army running away. SŒtyaki encouraged them and making an appeal in the name of K¦atriya’s moral duty said—‘To run away from the battlefield is not the work of braves.’ Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa saw that Bh¶¦ma’s violence was continuously intensifying and in spite of SŒtyaki’s persuation, the soldiers were not coming back, Arjuna was fighting mildly and Bh¶¦ma was fighting the limit of hardness. He addressed SŒtyaki and said—‘O the brave! Those who are running away, let them flee away, today, I, alone, will kill Bh¶¦ma, DroÄa and his attendants. Just see this frolic, standing aside. I will kill Bh¶¦ma, taking the horrible ‘Cakra’ (wheel) in My hand and do good to the PŒÄÎavas. I will enthrone Yudhi¦¢hira having killed the Kauravas and their supporters.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having uttered this much the Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa left the rein of the horses. He jumped from the chariot, holding the ‘Cakra’ (discus) glittering like sun’s brightness, hard and sharp like thunderbolt. Just as a lion rushes to kill an elephant, in the same way Lord K¾¦Äa moved fast towards the Kaurava’s army to kill Bh¶¦ma. The golden yellow cloth was gracing His blue-white body like the black cloud combined with lightening of the rainy season. The Cakra (discus) in His hand was taking round in a great speed. Seeing Him in this form, all beings began to cry loudly in distress. It came to the everyone’s mind that the last moment of Bh¶¦ma’s life had approached.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦ma was neither the least perturbed to see Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa with ‘Cakra’ (discus) in His hands going towards him nor he deviated at all. Twanging his bow string he said—‘Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! You are the abode of the entire world beings, You have come today with ‘discus’ in your hands; do come, I welcome You in this form—I salute You, You are, the protector of the living beings who come to Your shelter, isn’t it? Protect this shelter-seeker and make me fall down from this chariot having slayed me with Your ‘Cakra’ (discus). It is only gain and gain that lies in being killed by Your hands. I will get repute in this world and in the divine world I will gain the salvation. Being killed with Your hands what a great glory I will gain, I don’t know, You rushed to kill me, it is only this much that increased my repute and glory thousands and thousands of times.’*</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said—‘Bh¶¦ma! It was proper for you to check Duryodhana at the very start of the gambling. That time passed, then, you ought to have checked him at the start of the war and if Kauravas did not listen to your good advice, then, it was proper for you to give them up. But you did not do so, contrary to it, you chose their side, if you had not been on their side, this fierce war would not have taken place.’ Bh¶¦ma then said—‘JanŒrdana! I don’t know what is Your will and what You say? In this world it is only Your Will that is being fulfilled, all are dancing to Your tune. Not only once, not only twice but a number of times I made the Kauravas understand but they did not pay heed to my suggestion. Your will is Supreme. It is Your Will that I am fighting from the Kaurava’s side.’ Just while Bh¶¦ma was continuing his version, having jumped down from his chariot Arjuna caught hold of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. At that time, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was going towards Bh¶¦ma very speedily. He did not stop even after Arjuna’s check. Pulling him He moved towards Bh¶¦ma. On the tenth step Arjuna could fix his feet and could stop Him. Entreating Arjuna said—‘Lord! Don’t break Your pledge for our sake. I speak on oath that I will not fight now a light war, by Your order I will slay the elders also.’ Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa got satisfied hearing the Arjuna’s promise and oath. For a moment remaining standstill with the ‘Cakra’ (discus) in His hands, He came back to the Arjuna’s chariot and took the control of the reins of the horses. Thenafter Arjuna fought so fiercely that not only in the battle-field but in all the worlds the cry of distress broke out, abruptly everyone remained standstill. It was only Bh¶¦ma alone who could stand before Arjuna.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this war, God knows how many demons were killed, to a great extent the burden of the earth was relieved. The will of God—His resolve began to be fulfilled.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-11">The Description of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s greatness by Bh¶¦ma, The Lord’s going back of his pledge for Bh¶¦ma’s vow, Falling down of Bh¶¦ma</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The great characteristic of the great souls is that they may remain engaged in any business outwardly but they keep in their memory the Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. The Lord may either appear before their eyes even in however horrible form, they recognise the Lord. Even for a moment the sweet image of the Lord does not disappear from their mind-screen. In their inner-self there is not such a single thought even which is devoid of the knowledge of the God’s glory and greatness. The memory of the Lord is the life of the great saints, the Lord’s remembrance is vital force of great saints they, themselves are actually the Lord’s remembrance, apart from the remembrance they don’t have their own existence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha’s life it is the predominance of the Lord’s remembering. He does nothing with his own will, he acts upon everything according to the God’s will. When the Lord came to kill him with the ‘Cakra’ (discus) in His hands, then even, he distinguised the Lord as usual as he recognised Him always and even later on, we will mark at the place from place that he is absorbed in the memory of the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The fourth day-war came to an end. That day, many brothers of  Duryodhana were killed. Death-like atmosphere spread over in the army of Kauravas. There began to be shouts of joy among the PŒÄÎava’s armymen. Duryodhana was greatly worried. He approached Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha in the night. He began to say to Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha as if wailing—‘PitŒmaha!’ DroÄŒcŒrya, K¾pŒcŒrya, Ýalya etc., including you are in my favour and fighting the war truly wholeheartedly. I think so that there is no other combatant in the universe parallel to you. Even all the warriors of the PŒÄÎavas together cannot defeat you alone. It is a great doubt in my mind to know who is that one on whose support the PŒÄÎavas are going on winning us? Kindly, tell me the reason of their victory.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha said—‘Duryodhana! I have already emphasized the fact several times before you but you did not pay any attention to it.’ Even, now I would like to advise you to make treaty with the PŒÄÎavas. By this treaty it will be good, not to you only, but it will be good for the entire world. You are creating an obstacle in the God-gifted royal enjoyments to be enjoyed by you yourself and those with whom being friendly and amicably, both of you should enjoy the kingship and the royal comforts and enjoyments, you are behaving with the sense of hostility with them. Either, they are defeated or you are defeated, it is you or your brethren will remain deprived of this enjoyment. Son Duryodhana! The PŒÄÎavas can do everything very easily. I don’t see anyone in the universe who may kill them. Such a being has been neither born nor can be born in future, who may kill those PŒÄÎavas who always remain under the protection of Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. These words are not my own but I am stating the words as I have heard the myths from the mouths of the self-realised saints. Listen to me attentively.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once, all the gods, sages and saints went to BrahmŒj¶ on the GandhamŒdana mountain. Just before them an aeroplane appeared in the space, the Lord BrahmŒ came to know that it was the Supreme being God. Having stood from His seat, the BrahmŒ saluted and entreated him with pious heart. The gods and the sages followed Him. BrahmŒ worshipped Him with reverence and with devout humbleness began to pray Him. He said—‘Lord! All of us are in <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>our shelter, it is You, the creator, sustainer and the Destroyer—all. You are the Supreme being Puru¦ottama. You are the base of all the worlds. The entire universe is Your manifestation. We are ignorant of <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>our virtues, lustre, glory and vigour. You are the only goal of the all and sundry, it is Your grace that this earth exists fearlessly. Kindly, incarnate in the Yadu-dynasty to relieve the burden of the earth. Assume the human body with all <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>our four aspects and fulfil our desire. Your names are unique, Your form is marvellous, it is all of us take shelter at Your feet.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said in the sober tone affectionately—‘I have incarnated reading your mind. I will fulfil your prayer.’ Having uttered this much He disappeared. Now the gods and sages expressed their curiosity before BrahmŒ that they were eager to know who was that inconceivable power in the form of an unique great personality had appeared just before you?’ The Lord BrahmŒ said in a very modest tone—‘He is the Supreme Lord, the soul of all the beings the ‘Supreme Brahma’. He is the Supreme, superior most, the ultimate goal. In all the three ages, He remains unchangeable, He is the refuge of all the three periods and ages. It is His kind grace that He has talked to me today. I have made prayer to Him for the world being that He should incarnate in the VŒsudeva’s family in the Yadu dynasty. The demons, killed in the gods-demons war, the Daityas and demons have taken birth on the earth in the form of mankind. It is necessary for <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou to incarnate on the earth to kill them. He has accepted my prayer. Now, He will incarnate in the form of Nara-NŒrŒyaÄa on the earth. None can win Him, the fools cannot know Him. O the sages and gods ! Never disobey Him considering a common man. He is worthy of adoration to all, all of us are His offsprings. We should always pay Him due regards. Anyone who disregards Him considering that Supreme being, a common man, is a great sinner.’*</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦ma said—‘Duryodhana ! Having stated this, BrahmŒ went away to His world. I have heard this narrative from ParaÜurŒma, MŒrkaÄÎeya, VyŒsa and NŒrada also. VŒsudeva Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is the father of even the world creator, BrahmŒ, being acquainted with it, is there anyone who will not worship Him? I, myself, along with so many other sages have cajoled you again and again not to invite enmity with VŒsudeva and PŒÄÎavas; but you did not listen to anyone being infatuated, better it is if you awaken, even now it is good. Your enmity with Arjuna and Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, the embodiment of Nara and NŒrŒyaÄa, is your great misfortune. I consider you a cruel demon. I again remind you that it is merely Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, the Supreme Lord of the Nature; the side which he favours, will be winner; because where there Lord is present, righteousness is there; where there is righteousness and morality, there exists the victory. At present, the Lord, Himself, is the protector of the PŒÄÎavas, the Lord, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa always helps them, advises them, and saves them at the time of the least fear. It is only Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s patronage that becomes the cause of the PŒÄÎavas victory. I have given you the answers of your questions in brief. Now what do you want to know?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Duryodhana asked—‘PitŒmaha! I have a great curiosity in my mind as well as I have a great desire to know about the existence and manifestation of the Lord of the universe and the Supreme God VŒsudeva.’ Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha said—‘Son! The Lord, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is the God of the gods. No one is superior to Him. He has extraordinary distinctive characteristics, divine attributes. The sage, MŒrkaÄÎeyaj¶ has sketched Him as the greatest and wonderful. ‘He is the immortal soul of all. He is the cause of the entire creation and generations. It is He who is holding Himself all the creation. He has assumed the entire creation. He has created the space, time, object and its course of law. SaÆkar¦aÄa, NŒrŒyaÄa, BrahmŒ and Ýe¦anŒga, also have been born to Him. It is He, the embodiment of VŒrŒha, N¾siÆgha, VŒmana. It is He who is the true well-wisher, true friend, mother-father and Guru. One who accepts His shelter, and the one whom he adopts being pleased, gains the eternal joy and his life become fulfilled. The great sage, NŒrada has described Him dear to the world beings and thoughtful of all beings. MŒrkaÄÎeya has personified Him as YajÛa of all YajÛas, the penance of penances, and personified form of past, present and future. Bh¾gu has called Him—‘Deva-Deva’ and the ancient great form of Vi¦Äu. DwaipŒyana VyŒsa has characterised Him as the founder of Indra. The great sages, Asita and Dewala have stated that He is imperceptible from VŒsudeva’s body and perceptible from mind. It is the saying of SanakŒdikas that Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is the Supreme God, He is the wisdom of all the great sages and Dharmas. Son! I have described the glory of VŒsudeva Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa in detail very clearly, may your inner spirit be pious through this and may you serve Him! I have very well explained why can Arjuna and Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa not be won? Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is deeply affectionate towards them and He is very much pleased with them, so giving up the hope to win them, better it is to make a treaty with them and pass your life happily. The unavoidable ultimate result of the enmity with Nara and NŒrŒyaÄa is your ruin.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Duryodhana heard Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha’s words in detail and realised also the truth of his words. He made up his mind that Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna were far-far superior to him, yet, he could not act upon his sermon. He saluted him and came back to his camp. The next morning the war started again. In the same way, the war of the eighth day also came to be over. That day also, it was the PŒÄÎavas to win. The Kauravas got very much worried. Ýakun¶, Du¬<span>Ü</span>Œsana, Duryodhana, KarÄa discussed together that if Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha keeps away from the war and KarÄa is entrusted with the responsibilities, KarÄa can win the PŒÄÎavas very soon. KarÄa, himself said—‘If  Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha gives up the arms and weapons, he alone can kill the PŒÄÎavas.’ Duryodhana went to Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha with this proposal.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Duryodhana said to Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha—‘O the destroyer of the enemies! We expect on your strength to defeat not only the PŒÄÎavas but all the gods and devils, kindly defeat the PŒÄÎavas. If you have special grace for the PŒÄÎavas as it is our bad luck, and you have any aversion with us, then order KarÄa, an expert in war, to fight, he is ready to defeat the PŒÄÎavas including the entire army. What is your order?’ Hearing Duryodhana’s words, Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha began to take long breath. Duryodhana tried to give a fatal wound to his heart. In spite of it, he did not say anything rude. He said—‘Duryodhana! I am fighting the war very honestly without caring for my own life, then, yet, why do you say so? Arjuna had won Indra himself at the time of KhŒÄÎava fire. When the Gandharvas caught you, your brothers as well as KarÄa ran away leaving you alone, then Arjuna, alone won the Gandharvas. In VirŒ¢anagara we could do nothing against Arjuna, contrary to it he had taken away all the clothes of the great warriors. This is the burning example of his valour. Where was the KarÄa’s valour had gone at that time, when Arjuna had snatched their clothes and gave it to UttarŒ in gift? NŒrada, the sages and seers, whom they regard the ParamŒtmŒ (<span class="char-style-override-7">s</span>upreme Divine), God of the gods, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is Arjuna’s helper and supporter. Thus, how can I defeat Arjuna? I cannot discharge my arrows on ÝikhaÄÎ¶, even knowing that to kill the PŒÄÎavas is beyond my capacity, I will leave no stone unturned from my side. Go and take rest, I will fight tomorrow a fierce war. So long as this earth exists, my war-fighting will be the subject of discussion!’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is not known whether this fable is in any scripture or not, it has been heard from the mouths of the great saints, possibly it may be in any scripture. The fable is that on Duryodhana’s great insistence and compelling him again and again that ‘If you fight from my side whole-heartedly with truthful attitude, take any vow regarding killing the PŒÄÎavas.’ Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha took out five arrows from his quiver and took an oath that if the Almighty God so wishes, I will kill the PŒÄÎavas with these five arrows; Amidst Kaurava’s army the joy spread all around and being overjoyed, the drums of joy began to be beaten and sounded. It came to everyone’s mind that all the PŒÄÎavas were but to die. Can Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha’s vow be proved false? All around the people began to rejoice in the hope of the war-end.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This news reached the PŒÄÎavas camp also through the detectives. All the five PŒÄÎavas assembled. They began to ponder over in anguish what to do now? How to save themselves from the fierce pledge of Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha? All were passing through worry. Arjuna had firm faith in Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa in his mind, he, too, could not speak. Draupad¶ was also sitting there. She had many experiences of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. Whenever Draupad¶ had called, her call had been answered. That day, Du¬<span>Ü</span>Œsana had tried to make her naked in the open assembly, hearing her cry, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa reached speedly and He protected her, lengthening the cloth. With the fear of DurvŒsŒ, when all the PŒÄÎavas were at their wit’s end, Draupad¶ called Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, then, at the same moment running bare foot and by eating one leaf from her pot, He protected the PŒÄÎavas from the great furry of DurvŒsŒ. Recollecting Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s infinite grace, Draupad¶ was in ecstasy, and being carefree by the way, she said—‘There is nothing to worry. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is our protector, why not to bring this matter to His knowledge.’ After the rememberance of Lord’s support, the PŒÄÎavas got rid of all the worries, they began to remember <span class="char-style-override-7">h</span>im with the obligatory feeling.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At the same moment, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa entered smiling and said—‘Today I am too late due to looking after the horses, tell, why are you sitting mum? Has any serious problem occurred?’ Yudhi¦¢hira said with the folded hands—‘Lord! What is hidden to you? Don’t you know that Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha has taken out five arrows to kill us five brothers? We were in the same worry as how would we be saved now? Our lives are in your hand, do what you wish. We don’t know whether you save us or not.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord began to laugh. He said—‘It is not in My hand today to save you or not. Today if Draupad¶ wants, she may save you.’ Draupad¶ happened to speak—‘Lord! What do <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou say? Will I not try my best to protect my dearest husbands? Kindly, disclose the device soon, if the sacrifice of my life even may protect their lives. The Lord said—‘There is no question of any sacrifice, you will have to accompany me to Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha? Draupad¶ got ready; Draupad¶ moved ahead and the Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa began to follow her. Thus, they crossed the path going through the PŒÄÎava’s army.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was before entering the Kaurava’s army, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said—‘Draupad¶! Your entire body is wrapped in clothes, but your shoes are visible clearly. Because of its make belonging to Punjab everyone will come to know that it is Draupad¶ going in shoes made in Punjab. Then, suspicion will be created about me also, so handover your shoes to me; and thus, you will not be distinguished and they will consider me also with your shoes as your attendant.’ Draupad¶ with a bit hesitation but being overwhelmed by the Lord’s love, gave her shoes to the Lord. Dwelling on the Lord’s love to the devotees being steeped in ecstasy, Draupad¶ was going ahead and having wrapped Draupad¶’s, shoes in His ‘PitŒmbara’ (yellow clothing) holding in His arm-pit, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was following her. Is there possible any other one such a master of the miserable and lovely creatures loving to them so much?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At that moment, Bh¶¦ma was absorbed in the contemplation of the Lord sitting on his bed. He was thinking—‘What a wretched life I have got! I am in the opposite camp of the side supported by the Lord. Not only is the side, but I have strengthened my body with their grain also and fighting from their side and today, goaded by Duryodhana I have taken the vow even to kill the PŒÄÎavas also against my conscience. My offence is beyond the limit. Will the Lord save the PŒÄÎavas by finding out any means? O Lord! Snatch away the power of these arrows, so that these arrows may not kill the PŒÄÎavas even after using them. I am the associate of the wickeds, I am the offender of Your devotees. I have no love to Your feet, my this life is worthless. Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha was ruminating over likewise, his heart was suffering from the acute pain like the bites of hundreds of poisonous scorpions. The tears were flowing continuously from his eyes. In such circumstances, Draupad¶ going there saluted his feet. Bh¶¦ma said with half-opened eyes and thought that she would be Duryodhana’s wife. Remaining absorbed in the same sequence of thoughts Bh¶¦ma said—‘Daughter! Be ever blessed with coverture.’ Draupad¶, casting her head downward stood aside. Smiling, the Lord entered. Having distinguished Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s steps-sound and His smile, Bh¶¦ma opened his eyes and saw that the Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was smiling standing there. Being amazed he accorded Him warm welcome. He had already recognised Draupad¶ till now and he had become aware of the fact that why Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa had played this role. He said to Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa—‘Lord! I did come to know why You have visited at this time; You are devotee of devotees, You remain worried always day and night for their protection. You have acted this role to protect them from my vow. May Your desire be fulfilled! Well! Who can supersede Your will? Now, my vow has been broken. Draupad¶’s married life became happy forever. Now, what is Your command? Do tell me, I will do so.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said—‘PitŒmaha! You are My true devotee. You broke your promise to fulfil My desire. Your vow is well known as ‘Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha-promise; whatever oath you have taken, has never been broken by you. By giving up your promise you have donated <span class="char-style-override-7">m</span>e the superior most object. I will remain life-long obliged and life-long indebted to you.’ The Lord will remain life-long indebted; hearing this, Bh¶¦ma got overwhelmed with joy. For a long time he remained sinking and rising in the endless ocean of Lord’s grace. After coming to senses, he said—‘Well Lord! The PŒÄÎavas were protected, but the matter between you and me will be settled tomorrow. As I have given up my promise, in the same way, Your promise should also be broken tomorrow. You, too, will have to take weapons in your hands.’ The Lord gave His acceptance remaining mum and came back with Draupad¶.*</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-8">* It is also heard that to take five arrows, Arjuna went to Duryodhana and asked for his crown.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦ma began to sing to himself—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘If today I don’t compel Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa to hold the weapon, I will not be called the son of ÝŒntanu and I will be a shame to mother GaÆgŒ. Breaking the chariot, I will shake the great chariot by breaking it along with HanumŒn’s flag! If I don’t do so, I speak on the oath of K¾¦Äa, may I not get the fate of a K¦atriya! I will run towards the PŒÄÎavas army and shed the river of blood. SµuradŒsa says, without victory in the battlefield, I will not turn my back till I remain alive.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The ninth day, in the morning, after the daily routine of worship etc., all the warriors reached the battlefield. That day, the war was more terrible than that of the previous days. If it is required to know more about who were the warriors to fight against whom and who killed whom and how many arrows were shot by whom, the ‘Bh¶¦ma Parva’ of ‘MahŒbhŒrata’ should be read. At that moment Bh¶¦ma was proving to be ignited like forest conflagration in the PŒÄÎavas army. Many of the chariots were the fire-clatern, there was the flame of arrows, the swords, the mace, etc., were fuel, arrows were sparks. A fierce human-butchery was being made.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Today Lord K¾¦Äa looked greatly worried. He saw that Arjuna was somewhat swayed by Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha’s glory and obligation. In spite of reminding him even several times, he was not using the hard weapons against Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha and Bh¶¦ma was displaying his terrible powers as bound by his promise to Duryodhana. Even the Lord also had to manifest his kindness to devotee and the glory of Bh¶¦ma. He coaxed Arjuna once and twice, but no extra effort was made from the Arjuna side. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa drove the Arjuna’s chariot before Bh¶¦ma. The war between Bh¶¦ma and Arjuna began to be fought. Several weapons of Bh¶¦ma were destroyed by Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa with the chariot’s movements and the tactful driving of the horses; but yet, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna both were not saved from being wounded by the weapons of Bh¶¦ma. In the third day war, when the Lord had assumed His ‘Cakra’ (discus), then it was the Arjuna’s weakness mainly responsible; but today, it was the main reason to manifest Bh¶¦ma’s fierceness and glory. He left the rein of the horses of the Arjuna’s chariot. He jumped from the chariot and making the war-cry again and holding the whip in His hand rushed to kill Bh¶¦ma. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s eyes were growing red. His body was smeared with blood. Because of the fast speed His P¶tŒmbara (yellow clothing) was flying back side. By the blow of His feet, the earth was cracking. Seeing Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa rushing towards Bh¶¦ma in this way, the warriors of the Kaurava side got overpowered by fear and there was a cry from their mouth. ‘Bh¶¦ma to die, Bh¶¦ma to die; At that time when Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was going very speedily towards Bh¶¦ma, it appeared that a big and vigorous lion was rushing to attack a mad elephant. The P¶tŒmbara (yellow clothing) was on His swarthy-emerald-body like the stabled lightening in the clouds of rainy season.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Seeing Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa moving towards Bh¶¦ma, all were frightened but Bh¶¦ma did not deviate the least. Stretching his bowstring, he said—‘Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! I salute to Your feet. Come on! Come on! I welcome You in this heroic form! It is desirable to me to taste the heroic death caused by You in this great war. It is the highest good for me to die with Your hands. It is only to repute me in all the three worlds You have kept my vow having broken Your own vow. Affectionate to the devotees! I am Your attendant. You may assail me with any blow of Your will.’*</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Just after Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, Arjuna also jumped from his chariot. Just hardly approaching Bh¶¦ma he caught hold of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. He stopped after dragging him a little. Arjuna began to entreat Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa in a very affectionate humble tone—‘Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! You have already taken vow earlier not to fight a war. Don’t make it otherwise, if <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou fight against PitŒmaha with weapons, <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou will be defamed among the people for <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>our falsehood, its responsibility lies on me. I speak on the oath of weapons, truth and urbane that I will kill Bh¶¦ma in the war.’ Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa went back on the chariot with Arjuna and arrows began to rain from both sides. In the ninth-day-war the PŒÄÎavas army got mangled. All the braves got tired. The war of that day was declared to be halted a bit before sun-set for performing SandhyŒ and taking rest.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the night, K¾¦Äa and the PŒÄÎavas gathered together. Looking towards Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, Yudhi¦¢hira said—‘Lord! Bh¶¦ma is destroying our army. While raining the arrows, even Indra and Yama cannot defeat him, what to talk of us? It becomes impossible for me to look towards Him at the time of war. Our army is decreasing day by day. Now, I have no desire to fight the war even. It is better to pass on life living in the forest than this human butchery. I have stepped in on the path of ruin and destruction by waging war. What is your view? Kindly, give us salutary advice in accordance with righteousness.’ Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa praising the valour of PŒÄÎavas like Arjuna and Bh¶ma, said—‘There is no worry. Your brothers can defeat Bh¶¦ma, but if you don’t have faith in them, permit <span class="char-style-override-7">m</span>e to fight the war. If Arjuna, himself, does not want to kill Bh¶¦ma, I <span class="char-style-override-7">m</span>yself will kill Bh¶¦ma before his eyes. If you have hope of victory only in Bh¶¦ma’s death, I alone, will kill Bh¶¦ma in the war tomorrow. I am not separate from you. One, who is your enemy, is <span class="char-style-override-7">m</span>y enemy also; specially, Arjuna is <span class="char-style-override-7">m</span>y brother, friend, relative and pupil. I can give even the flesh of <span class="char-style-override-7">m</span>y body in pieces for his sake. It is not much difficult to kill Bh¶¦ma.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Yudhi¦¢hira said—‘Lord! What you say is quite correct. None can stay before <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou. I am fortunate that I have <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou as my helper or protector, but having the consideration of <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>our glory and our glory, I don’t want to engage <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou in war. When the people would call you as the violater of <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>our promise, how much my heart will be agonised. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! Bh¶¦ma has immense affection for me, in the childhood, after my father’s death, it was he who brought me up. He has promised me to think of my victory and fight from the Duryodhana’s side. Now, the way to get the victory over him, should be asked from him; himself. To me it appeals, later on as you suggest.’ Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa endorsed Yudhi¦¢hira’s opinion. All of them went to Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After the formal and due reception Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha said—‘O the braves! <span class="char-style-override-7">t</span>ell me, what should I do for your pleasure? I will certainly do even the most difficult work for your sake.’ Yudhi¦¢hira said in pathetic voice on PitŒmaha’s query again and again—‘PitŒmaha! <span class="char-style-override-7">h</span>ow we will win? How should we get back our royal kingdom? How should we escape from this man-slaughter? It is not possible so long as you are alive, kindly, disclose us the way of your death.’ Bh¶¦ma said—‘You cannot win so long as I am alive. If you want to win, kill me first having assaulted me severely. I permit you to use even the hardest and the most fatal arrows at me. First try to kill me.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">DharmarŒja Yudhi¦¢hira said—‘If all the gods and demons including Indra even, jointly together want to win you, cannot win you at all. Now, it is you to tell us how to win you?’ Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha said—‘It is correct, no doubt, If I give up the arms and weapons, only, then, even the gods can kill me. So long as I have arms and weapons in my hands, nobody can kill me. O the son of Dharma! <span class="char-style-override-7">i</span>t is my principle that I should not fight against any such one as un-armed, without armour, fallen down, without flag, running away, frightened, refugee, women, female-named, crippled, the only son of a father, issueless and impotent. I have already taken vow that I cannot use my arms against Drupada’s issue—ÝikhaÄÎ¶ because he has been a female first. So, let the warrior-chief, Arjuna throw his sharp arrows at me standing behind ÝikhaÄÎ¶. ÝikhaÄÎ¶ is ominous and female of the past, so in spite of holding bow and arrow, I will not assault him. I can be killed either by Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa or Arjuna, in case I give up my arms. This is the only way for you to get the victory.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Seeking permission from Bh¶¦ma, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna came to their camp. After reaching the camp Arjuna got very much sad. Arjuna said—‘Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! I will murder and kill that dearest and adorable one in whose lap I used to play in my childhood, whose beard I used to scratch and on whose body, I used to throw up dust, when I addressed him calling as father and who said fonding with a great affection that ‘I am the father of your father’, it is he whom I will kill by standing behind ÝikhaÄÎ¶. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! This work cannot be done by me. Bh¶¦ma may destroy my entire army, it may be my victory or defeat,—I cannot kill him.’ Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa again repeated the sermons of the G¶tŒ, in brief, and said—‘Being free from jealousy and hatred, giving up the hope of victory and defeat, being free from the worry of gain or loss, whosoever comes face to face in the war, it is the moral duty of a K¦atriya to kill him.’ After a long persuation, Arjuna agreed and it was decided to fight the war making ÝikhaÄÎ¶ on the front.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the tenth day it was a fierce war. It is not the desired to describe it in detail, here. The fierce battle was fought between Bh¶¦ma and Arjuna. ÝikhaÄÎ¶ was standing ahead only for mere show, with his arrows Bh¶¦ma was not even wounded fiercely. On account of ÝikhaÄÎ¶’s presence on the front, he could not assault directly and openly. Bh¶¦ma began to think standing in the battlefield if Lord K¾¦Äa had not been their protector, he would have killed all the five PŒÄÎavas with a single arrow; but the PŒÄÎavas could not be killed and he could not kill ÝikhaÄÎ¶ because of being woman-kind. In such a situation it is better not to fight war. I have got the boon of ‘Death at will’. At present the Lord K¾¦Äa is standing before me. Before His eyes it is for my highest good to sleep down on the bed of arrows. What concern have I got now with the troublesome affairs of this world? The victory of the PŒÄÎavas is definite, then why should I create any obstacle in their victory, remaining alive for some days more?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦ma was absorbed in thinking all about it. At that same time, the sages and the beneficient Vasus aboding in the space, said to Bh¶¦ma addressing him—‘Bh¶¦ma! <span class="char-style-override-7">w</span>hat you think is quite good; if you want to do good to yourself, ourselves and the universe, now stop fighting. You have rightly thought regarding your duty. A long time of your stay in the mortal world passed, now come to our world.’ Just as these words came out from the sages and demi-gods mouths, it began to breeze cool, fragrant, mild air, the drums began to be sounded in the divine world and gods began to make the flower-rain from the sky. This oracle was heard by none except Bh¶¦ma and SaÛjaya.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Knowing the intention of the gods and sages, in spite of being afflicted by the arrows of Arjuna, he gave up the discharge of arms. ÝikhaÄÎ¶ shot nine arrows at the bosom of Bh¶¦ma but he did not deviate at all. Then after Arjuna and ÝikhaÄÎ¶ shot many arrows at Bh¶¦ma, his whole body was pierced with the arrows. There was no space left of even one inch, where the arrows of Arjuna had not pierced. In the tenth day war the exalted soul Bh¶¦ma fell down from his chariot sometime before the sun-set. In the space, the gods and on the earth—the kings began to make cry of distress. The earth trembled and in the space a loud uproar started. In his body the arrows had thrusted in so many numbers that his body could not touch the ground, the bed of arrows was created. The head was hanging downwards. At the same moment a divine voice came from the space how did the great soul Bh¶¦ma give up his body in the period of the southward course of the sun? Bh¶¦ma became conscious. He said—‘I am still alive.’ Everyone expressed delight.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having come to know the desire of Bh¶¦ma, the daughter of HimawŒna and the mother of Bh¶¦ma—GaÆgŒ sent the great sages in the form of swans to him. Approaching Bh¶¦ma they circumambulated him. They discussed between themselves how Bh¶¦ma gave up his life in the period of the southward course of the sun? Bh¶¦ma said to them—‘I will remain alive till the end of that period. After the beginning the period of the northward course of the sun, I will go to the divine abode. By the grace of my father, I have got the control over death. Whenever I wish, I can die only.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just while Bh¶¦ma’s falling down, the war was over. All the warriors gathered there. As regards DroÄŒcŒrya, he fainted just the moment hearing this news, when he came to consciousness all the braves came to Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha. Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha addressed all of them with a great affection—‘O the braves! I welcome all of you, I am feeling delighted to see you.’ The head of Bh¶¦ma was hanging downward. Having received all warmly he said—‘O the kings! <span class="char-style-override-7">m</span>y head is hanging down too low, I need cushion.’ All the kings and Kauravas rushed with the soft and valuable pillows of the good quality immediately. But Bh¶¦ma, instead of accepting them, said—‘These pillows are not worth of heroic bed.’ Looking towards Arjuna, he said—‘Brave Arjuna! Give me the pillow what you consider suitable to this heroic bed.’ Having stretched his ‘GŒÄÎ¶va bow’ he sought his permission and shot three arrows at Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha’s head. His head lifted up and fixed upward thus, he said to Arjuna—‘You are very intelligent. If you had not provided me such a pillow, I would have annoyed with you and cursed you. The righteous K¦atriyas deserve such a bed and such a pillow.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">PitŒmaha said to the kings—‘I have now, got the suitable pillow. I will remain lying on this bed till the period of the Northward course of the sun starts. Dig the pit all around it. I will remain remembering the God lying down on this bed. I have one request more,—‘If the war may be ended any how, stop it. At the same moment, by the order of Duryodhana, a number of expert surgeons and well versed doctors of ‘Ayurveda’ came to Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha with all the material aids of surgery.’ Seeing them Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha said to Duryodhana—‘See them off with warm reception whatever the fees you have to pay them, pay it. Now, I have already attained the supreme state, now, there is no need of doctors. What is their use now? I am lying on the arrows-bed. Now, it is not proper to desire to be well and recover. You should consign me to the flame in the pyre of the arrows.’ Duryodhana bade the physicians. All were amazed to see Bh¶¦ma’s steadiness in Dharma and his death according to the ordain of Dharma. All and sundry saluted him, circumambulated him and having deputed a number of guards, all went away to their respective camps.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The next day in the morning, all of them came to Bh¶¦ma, lying down on the arrows-bed. When all of them occupied their seats, Bh¶¦ma asked for water to drink. At the same moments the kings brought the superior kind of food items and tasty water. Seeing this Bh¶¦ma, said—‘Now, I am lying on this arrow-bed, no doubt, but I am not in the mortal world. Now, I should not accept the fine food and water of this world.’ After saying this, Bh¶¦ma remembered Arjuna. Going near PitŒmaha, Arjuna saluted him and with folded hands said very humbly—‘Reverent PitŒmaha! What service should I render you?’ Having received warmly, the vigorous Arjuna, he said to him delightfully—‘Son! By the infliction of your arrows my body is burning, my throat is parching and I am feeling pain in the vital parts of the body. I am feeling thirsty, so quench my thirst providing me water. None is worthy to quench my thirst except you.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Receiving the order of Bh¶¦ma, Arjuna stretched the string of his bow, hearing its sound like the thunderbolt even the great heroes got frightened. Having stretched the arrow at the bow, Arjuna circumambulated Bh¶¦ma, and by the use of ‘Parjanya-weapon’, on the right side of PitŒmaha, Arjuna shot his arrow at the earth. The earth cracked and flow of fragrant nectarial, sweet, limpid, cool water came out from the crack of the earth. The great soul Bh¶¦ma was very much pleased to drink that water and he was much delighted and satiated. The kings got amazed, the Kauravas shrinked being afraid.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦ma highly praised Arjuna before all the kings and said—‘Son Arjuna! The work what you have done today and the example you have set today; is not strange for you. NŒrada had told me that—‘You are the ancient ‘Nara’ sage. With the assistance of all the gods even Indra cannot do that work what you can do alone. Puru¦ottama Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is your helper. There is no one on the earth such an archer like you. We tried our best to coax Duryodhana, but he does not listen to anyone’s advice; he will be destroyed very soon with the strength of Bh¶ma.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the words of Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha, Duryodhana became sad. Bh¶¦ma said—‘Duryodhana, It is not the time to be furiated. You have seen with your eyes how Arjuna has made me drink water? Who is there any brave on the earth to do such a work? Who knows all about the divine weapons except Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna? No one can win them. It is only to remain friendly with them, is good to you as well as to the entire world. So long as your elders, kith and kin and your family members are alive, it is better for you to make a treaty with them. Whatever Arjuna has done is sufficient for your alertness. May my death be the end of this blood-shed. Handover half of the kingdom to the PŒÄÎavas. Forgetting the enmity, embrace each other with love. The path you have choosen to tread on, is the path of ruin.’ Having said this much, Bh¶¦ma became silent. Seeking permission from him, all went away to their respective places.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When everyone went away, KarÄa came to Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha. KarÄa’s eyes were filled with tears. He said in the choked voice—‘PitŒmaha! I am KarÄa, the son of RŒdhŒ. In spite of being faultless, you used to have rancour with me.’ Hearing the words of KarÄa, he opened his eyes slowly and slowly. He removed the guards from there and clasped him to bosom with his one hand. He said—‘Dear KarÄa! <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou have done quite well to come to me at this moment. Brave! <span class="char-style-override-7">t</span>he sage NŒrada and the great sage VyŒsa have told me that you are not the son of RŒdhŒ but Kunt¶’s son. Your father is not Adhiratha but the lord Sun Himself. I am speaking the truth; I have not the least feeling of hatred for you in my heart. Knowingly, I have used harsh words against you so that your lustre may decrease. There can be rare vigorous like you in the world. You are steadfast in BrahmŒ, brave and highly munificent. By your excellence, the egotism of the Kauravas will wax more and they will be more envious to the PŒÄÎavas that is why I used to insult you. Even MagadharŒja JarŒsandha could not face you. If you want to please me at this moment do one thing. Join the PŒÄÎavas and the war will be over, and with my death the fire of enmity will be extinguished and the peace will spread over the subjects.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">KarÄa said—‘PitŒmaha! Your version is correct word by word. No doubt, I am the son of Kunt¶, but I have grown up so matured with the riches and mercy of Duryodhana, it is also the fact. I have already surrendered my life to Duryodhana. There is no ray of hope visible to be got united with PŒÄÎavas. I know it very well that the PŒÄÎavas are invincible with the help of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. Yet, knowingly, I have courage and zeal to fight against them. So, order me to fight against Arjuna. It is my innermost desire that I should fight the war only after seeking your permission. If ever I have uttered any such word as good or bad to you in anger or fickleness, kindly, pardon me for saying so as well as my ill-behaviour with you.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha said—‘Son! If this enmity cannot be rooted out, then, fight the war. Fulfil your assigned duty, giving up laziness, carelessness and anger, in accordance with your strength and enthusiasm, abiding by morality. May your desire be fulfilled. You will meet the good fate with Arjuna’s arrows. For a K¦atriya, righteous war is the best role of life only. It may be possible that you may not live with peace and happiness in this world, lest you should not be deprived of peace and happiness in the next world even by going against the righteousness. So, I advise you to fight always guarding righteousness.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having taken the permission of Bh¶¦ma, KarÄa went away. Lying down on the arrows-bed, Bh¶¦ma began to think of the Lord his mind fully focussed on Him.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-12">Bh¶¦ma’s Meditation by Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, Humble request to Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha for Sermon</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If it is analysed with the practical point of view, then also it is quite obvious that worldly beings are absolutely ungrateful. We remain absorbed in thinking of worldly pleasures, having forgotten that omnipotent, the most kind-hearted, the Great father—Lord, who awakened us and made us alert from the long deep sleep of cataclysm, who blessed us with the talent to understand and distinguish the right and wrong, who made us human beings, whose graceful sight has kept us alive, in Whose lap we are dwelling, Who does not keep us away from His eye-sight even for a moment. We are engrossed in sensual pleasures, serve creatures of this world, and go on flattering them like the dogs. We did not establish relationship with Him who is the possessor of each and everything, rather we forgot Him. We developed relationships, we remembered those, who are always ready to burn us in the flaming fire of the Hell. In spite of it all, the great kind Lord condones our mistakes. He appears just while remembering Him, He sits to remember, He runs hundred steps though we run only one step yet. He does good to him even, who goes to harm Him. I cannot even dream that having ignored such a kind Lord, why do we remember and think of others? But we do so, it is truth.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This relates to Bh¶¦ma. Those who do not remember and think of God, are in the consciousness of God, then, it cannot be easily guessed how much thinking is done by the Lord of those, who have detached themselves totally from the attachment of the worldly pleasures. Bh¶¦ma had no attachment with this world at all. He had nothing to do with the worldly affairs. In spite of living in this world and while discharging his duty in the war even, he remained thinking of God. He recognise that Lord even in the guise of destroyer. Now, he is lying on the arrows-bed, there would be hardly the space of even two fingers in his body left from the piercing of the arrows. Then, would he be remembering his body lying at arrows or feeling the pain in his body? No, not at all. He is not mindful about anything; but he is absorbed only in the remembrance of the Lord, he is always steeped in thinking of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is no need to go to the battlefield of Kuruk¦etra to view Bh¶¦ma absorbed in remembering the Supreme Lord. It is needed to approach the Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa to get his view; because Bh¶¦ma’s soul lies with Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and what Bh¶¦ma is doing, it is Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa only who knows, but it is rather more difficult to reach the Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. To reach Him, it is needed to have an approach to His some devotees or some His acquaintance. Let us move to DharmarŒja to know something. In fact, it is only to approach DharmarŒja and follow him through which we can make our reach to the Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Well! The eighteen days long MahŒbhŒrata war is over, DharmarŒja Yudhi¦¢hira refused to accept the kingdom, but his brothers, NŒrada, VyŒsa and more by Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, compelled him to accept the kingship. Yudhi¦¢hira became the king. He remained careful everyday and every moment to discharge his duties. GŒndhŒr¶, Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra, Vidura, all the kith and kin were being given due regard by him and thus, doing so, he kept his subjects contented. Today, having pleased all, he was going to Lord K¾¦Äa. Let us follow him. Let us get the view of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa through His kind mercy and His affection towards His devotees in its embodied form.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Going there Yudhi¦¢hira saw that Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was sitting on the golden bed-stead embedded with gems, His lustre like the sapphire embedded with gold, was spreading all around. It is the blue-white affectionate radiance of His body like the cloud of rainy season. He has wrapped His body with the P¶tŒmbara (yellow clothing) like the stable lightening. The divine ornaments are adorning His body. The Kaustubha jewel worn at throat was glittering as if the <span class="char-style-override-7">l</span>ord sun was just rising near UdayŒcala. Really, it was an excellent splendour, it was worth-seeing.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Seeing Him Yudhi¦¢hira asked—‘Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! Have You had a sound sleep in the night? Have You felt any trouble? With Your kindness we are happy. With Your mercy we have got victory and repute. It is Your grace that we did not deviate from the righteousness. The humble and meek words, uttered in mild tone in this way by Yudhi¦¢hira, could not reach Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s ears. At that time, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was looking as if sitting on the bed-stead but it was not so, He was near Bh¶¦ma. Yudhi¦¢hira saw that Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was lost in the ecstasy of His thoughts, He had not heard his words. He got amazed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After long interval, Yudhi¦¢hira again prayed to Lord! Upon whom have You concentrated Your mind? Is there all well in all the three worlds? At present, being transcendent of awakefulness, dreaming state and sound sleep, all these three states, You exist in the fourth state of blessedness (transcendence). Controlling all the five vital forces, You have established the senses in the mind and the senses and mind in intellect and the intellect in the soul. Even Your soft small hair of the body don’t move. Your body has become steady like stone, You are motionless like a flame in a windless place. What is the reason of Your going to meditation in this way? If I am fit to know it and if it is not any secret matter, then, You must tell me. Lord! It is You, the preserver and the destroyer of this world. Perishable and non-perishable, Prak¾ti and Puru¦a, manifest and unmanifest all are only Your expansion. You are eternal, infinite and primaeval. I salute You meekly and devotedly and want to know why and whom did You meditate?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing Yudhi¦¢hira’s prayer, Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa diverted his mind and sense organs at their respective positions. Then, after smiling He said—‘Yudhi¦¢hira! What is there anything to keep hidden from you? At present I was thinking of your grandfather, old PitŒmaha Bh¶¦ma. DharmarŒja! He is remembering Me lying on the arrows-bed-stead like the extinguishing fire. It is My vow that I should meditate him who meditates Me or it may be said in this way that it has become My nature that I fail to check Myself from meditating him who meditates Me. So, My mind was inclined towards him. The same great soul Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha whose twang could not be born by even Indra, no king could stand before whose valour, who could not be defeated by ParaÜurŒma even after fighting war against him for twenty-three days, has come to My shelter having surrendered himself. Bhagavat¶ BhŒg¶rath¶ has made her womb blessed by conceiving him, the great Mahar¦i Vasi¦¢ha had proved his knowledge fruitful by imparting him the knowledge, ParaÜurŒma had glorified his state of a preceptor by making him his pupil and who is the base of all the Vedas and its auxiliaries, the entire knowledge, master of all the divine arms and missiles, and knower of all the three times, the past, present and future, the same great MahŒtmŒ Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha, having controlled his mind and sense organs, has come to My shelter. So, I was thinking of him being concentrated. Dear DharmarŒja! After his departure from this world, this earth will be devoid of glamour like the moonless night. In his absence, the entire earth will become bereft of knowledge. So, go to him and ask him all about the secrets of four grades of society and all the four stages of life, all the four types of knowledge, all the four object of human life and anything else whatever you wish to ask and the secrets of those.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">With tears in his eyes Yudhi¦¢hira said in choking voice—‘Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! I have full faith in whatever You have said about glory of Bh¶¦ma. A number of sages and seers have told me about his greatness. Then, after all, You are the Lord of all the three worlds. How can there be any suspicion in Your version? You are always very gracious upon me, kindly take me to him along with Yourself. Just when the summer solstice starts, he will pass away from this world, so, at such a moment he should have Your vision. You are the eternal God, Supreme soul. By your vision, the PitŒmaha will get fulfilled. Hearing the prayer of Yudhi¦¢hira, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa ordered SŒtyaki to make His chariot ready.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, DharmarŒja Yudhi¦¢hira, K¾pŒcŒrya, Bh¶ma, Arjuna etc., all went to Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha. On the way, on the query of DharmarŒja Yudhi¦¢hira, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa sketched the character of ParaÜurŒma. Having reached Bh¶¦ma, they saw that being deprived of lustre like the sinking sun, he was lying on the arrows-bed-stead surrounded by great saints and sages. Having left their chariot at a distance they walked near Bh¶¦ma and having saluted the great sages like VyŒsa etc., they all sat down surrounding Bh¶¦ma.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Addressing the MahŒtmŒ Bh¶¦ma, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said—‘Isn’t it that your knowledge is as fresh as earlier? Whether, isn’t it so, that due to excess pain inflicted by PŒÄÎavas, your mind or wit has not become unsteady? You are entitled to die as per your will by your virtuous father, ÝŒntanu’s boon. Even the great sages, seers and gods have not acquired the right of ‘death at will’ till now. The people fail to bear the pain of even the needle-pricking in the body, but a number of arrows have pierced into your body. You, yourself, are imparting sermons to the great gods, what to talk to you about the birth and death? You are already acquainted with the mystery of all the religions, Vedas, portion of Vedas, wealth, righteousness, sensuousness, salvation all and you know its fundamental truth. Neither such a virtuous person like you has been ever heard nor seen in the world. You can create the world with the power of your penance. At present, DharmarŒja Yudhi¦¢hira is mournful on the destruction of the kith and kin, brothers and relatives and other family members. You know very well the mystery of all the religions. There is no other one visible to give the solution of his confusion. Kindly, satisfy him and pacify his mournful mind.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Raising his head a bit and folding his hands, Bh¶¦ma said to Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa—‘Lord! You are the cause of all the happenings and a great storehouse of all the things. You are beyond the Nature and omnipresent in all the objects of Nature. You are the shelter of all the beings, and You are ever changeless, imperishable and the embodiment of truths, consciousness and bliss. You have infinite power. Like the linseed flower, Your black body looks very dear to me. The splendour of P¶tŒmbara over this body seems to me as if the lightening has become stable and fixed on the clouds of rainy season. I am in Your shelter with great devotion and true heart.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Smiling Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said in a serene voice—‘O the great saint! Have the vision of My divine body. You have great devotion to Me. That is why I am giving you the view of My divine body. You are My great devotee, you are of a very simple nature, you are ascetic, truthful, self-restrained and a great donator. So, you are worthy to get the view of My body. The person who is devoid of devotion, who is of wicked nature and who is not calm, never gets My view. Having given up this body, you will go to the divine abode, wherefrom nobody has to return back. You will remain alive still for fifty six days. Then, you will get salvation. The Vasus are protecting you, being existed in the space. After giving up your body, no God-realized soul like you will be remaining here. So, we have come here to you to make you discourse your whole experienced knowledge. Your experienced virtues will get protection and Yudhi¦¢hira’s sorrow will also be driven away.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">With folded hands, Bh¶¦ma said—‘I am very much delighted to hear You. Well! What morality and righteousness I can describe before You? It is You, who is the cause behind all the morals and immorals in the world, whatever the duty or omission, have been determined for the mankind. To describe about the mystery of moral truth before You is just the same as to describe about the celestial world before Indra. My body is badly inflicted with pain on account of the piercing of the arrows, my heart is agonised and the intelligence has waved. The speech is unable to come out, the strength has exhausted. The soul is fluttering to go out as soon as possible. It is Your majesty that has kept me alive. You are the treasure of the entire knowledge. Before You, what sermon can I give? Before the ‘Guru’ what can a pupil speak? So, pardon me. It is You to give sermon to Yudhi¦¢hira.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said—‘PitŒmaha! You have the knowledge of all Tattvas, full of vitality and the ornament of Bharata dynasty. So, your these humble words are worthy of you. If you are suffering from pain in your body due to wounds, I grant you the boon to set you free from compunction, faint, burning sensation and hunger, thirst, all these suffering may not affect you and become ineffective. Let the entire knowledge be kindled in your heart; your intellect may be pure, your mind may be devoid of Rajas and Tamas. Only mode of Sattva may remain. As much you would ponder over virtues and wealth, so much the more your intelligence will wax. You will get the divine sight and you will be able to know the secrets of all the objects.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having heard these divine words of Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, VedavyŒsa etc., and other sages and seers eulogised Him. It began to rain the flowers from the space on Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, Bh¶¦ma and PŒÄÎavas. The nymphs began to sing, the Gandharvas began to play on the musical instruments. It began to breeze the cool, mild, fragrant air and there was calmness in all the directions. The beautiful birds began to chirp. Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha came to consciousness. His wisdom, all the knowledge shone through his intellect. It began to happen the auspicious omens all around.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The evening had set in. By the permission of the sages, having consented to meet again the next day, all went away to their respective places.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-13">The Moral Sermons of PitŒmaha</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The truth which is perceived by one’s own intellect, how much praiseworthy it would have been if all intelligent had perceived the same truth! Then Truth would have been sans doubt. But irony is this that intellect and perception differs from individual to individual. What to say about intellects, even from which we view with our own eyes, does not appear the same. All the eyes are not on the same level and so also their power. Horizon of all stands on different footing. All do not view one tree of same thickness. All do not see the same individual of the same colour and same form. Its reason is difference in the power of eyes. Likewise there is difference in comprehending power of intellects. All have different conceptions of Truth. Truth as experienced by one, may not be acceptable by other one as truth.  Whatever height of one’s intellectual knowledge might be and whatever intellectual decision one might prove with his logics, neither knowledge nor logics are authentic.  Root cause of various cults, creeds and principles in world is due to different intellects. All have expressed truth but that truth is integrated with one’s individuality and his own intellectism. This is the absolute truth—such fact cannot be unequivocally expressed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But there is one such knowledge which is ever changeless, one-formed, immovable and immutable it cannot be visualized as different in spite of different individuals and their different intellects. From the view point of the knowledge of the world, hesitation is there to designate it as knowledge but there is no other word so as to express our view. What is that knowledge, that knowledge is knowledge personified itself. He is  tmŒ Himself, God Himself, Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa Himself. When He manifests in one’s heart, his individuality vanishes and Supreme Truth and pure knowledge spreads through him. In other words we can say that knowledge imparted by Lord K¾¦Äa is true knowledge. Knowledge intuited by one’s intellect is utterly unauthentic and baseless. That is why exalted souls do not propagate their intellectual knowledge till they realize it imparted by Lord Himself. That propagation is propagation of his own individuality as it is a screen in some form on the divine knowledge. Yes, therefore, it can be said that only exalted souls alone propagate God-gifted knowledge, not their own individualised knowledge.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having studied Bh¶¦ma’s biography so much, we can say with the least doubt, that Bh¶¦ma is an exalted soul. He is the personification of selfless Karmayog¶. His life is full of valour and potency. He has unswerving devotion to God. He does not forget the Lord even for a moment and beyond this, even the Lord Himself meditates on him. The knowledge of the Supreme Lord is about to be preached by that Bh¶¦ma. The same reference has been mentioned in the previous first chapter that Bh¶¦ma denied to sermonise his own personal knowledge. The Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa imparted him His knowledge. Now, Bh¶¦ma became entitled to sermonise knowledge in the real sense. He is the true preacher of knowledge, who gives the sermons of knowledge having such a right. Generally, nowadays there has occurred the flood of preachers; but who is that preacher like Bh¶¦ma who has been ordained by the Lord directly?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In accordance with the predecision, everyone reached near the Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha’s arrows-bed-stead. The great sages and seers had already reached. On the inspiration of great sage NŒrada and Yudhi¦¢hira, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa started the conversation with Bh¶¦ma. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said—‘PitŒmaha! Did you feel any trouble in the night? Isn’t it that your body is free from pain and your mind is free of sensation of pain and is calm?’ PitŒmaha said—‘Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! By Your grace, infatuation, burning sensation, tiredness, perturbation and all the diseases vanished. As the result of Your mercy I have come to be well acquainted with the knowledge of all the three periods of time (TrikŒla). The virtues of Vedas, moral duties and duties of the four stages of life, the four grades of birth, caste, country and domestic duties and all the morals have awakened in my heart. At present, my mind is steady and wit is stainless. On account of Your contemplation, I have become alive again. Now, I can answer the religious and spiritual questions, but I have to ask You one thing, that why did You, Yourself, not give sermons to Yudhi¦¢hira?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said—‘PitŒmaha! I am the cause of all the goodness and repute, seen in the world. All the sentiments of the world are born of Me. I am the centre of all the great fame; it is without any doubt. I have got My wisdom entered your heart. It is My wish that you should preach the sermons and that should remain stable like the Vedas. Anyone who follows your sermons, will be benefited in this world, the next world and he will attain the highest good. Since your birth till now, no blemish-spot has been traced out in your life; you have deep insight of religion. Throughout your life you have done SatsaÆga, worshipped sages and gods. I want to make your reputation permanent. Fulfil My and everyone’s desire. It will do highest good to you.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having got permission from the Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, PitŒmaha asked Yudhi¦¢hira to question. Going near him, Yudhi¦¢hira saluted his feet and then very humbly asked many questions relating to religion and spiritualism. Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha answered those questions separately. Its detail description is available in ‘ÝŒntiparva’ of MahŒbhŒrata. Every querier male and female should have the self study of this reference. All that sermons cannot be extracted here. If it is mentioned in brief even, it will be a voluminous book. Here, only a few statements for name-sake are being presented.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Son! Saluting Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, the Supreme controller of the universe, religion and morality and the Brahmins, I, tell you something related to religion. Attentively listen to it. The kings should keep gods, persons of Daivi riches and <span class="char-style-override-7">b</span>rahmins pleased with their good conduct and behaviour. By their happiness, the Dharma gets pleased and by religious happiness, all the happiness and peace prevails. There is a great need of manliness in life. Without manly strength luck is never fruitified. It is God’s endowment or fruit of destiny is decided after the result. First of all we should make efforts. While the work has been started, if there occurs any obstacle, it should be faced boldly with full strength and continued to make efforts to get the work accomplished.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For a king it is more essential to take the shelter of truth always. Without the base of the truth, none believes him, and the next world, too is lost. His close friends also remain suspicious of him and the enemies also take advantage of the weakness by declaring and propagating his untruthfulness. The king who is brave, enduring, of good conduct, chariteer, calm, kind, righteous, self-restrained and smiling, is never devoid of riches. A king should not be either too simple or too violent. A simple king is not awe-inspiring and by a violent king everyone remains frightened; he remains unacquainted with the real fact. A king’s sole duty is to protect the righteousness and in protection of righteousness there is the protection of the subjects. The protection of religion is needed for goodness of the subjects. To share the joys and sorrows of the subjects and consider it of his ownself, is the most important duty of a king. A king should not always forgive or always punish; because forgiveness increases the number of culprits and continuous punishment annoys the public. A king should always remain vigilant by testing his men regularly directly, or indirectly, secretly or openly by the instinct of ÝŒstras. He should not be addicted to any evil habit. Making the king addicted to vice, the people want to take undue advantage. A king should not be perturbed at the time of great calamities even, He should not make fun with his attendants and maintain his army strong. The insolent servants, never discharge their duties sincerely, they avoid the orders. They try to know the secrets. Sometimes they happen to demand the most valuable things. Such types of several faults occur in them. Who deserves treaty and who deserves to be fought, should be decided by self-decision after thinking over intelligently and according to the advice of intelligent and reliable advisers and ministers. There are seven limbs of an empire—The Emperor king, minister, well-wishers, treasury, the nation, the fort and the army force. The hostile to these, whosoever might be, must be destroyed. In the same way, there are several duties of the kings. They are only for the protection of the subjects.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Brahmins should always remain firm, and unwaveringly dedicated to their own duties as per their grade in life. To use the bow and arrow, to kill the enemies, agriculture, business, animal husbandry and service—is not the duty of Brahmins. To study and to impart knowledge, to perform ‘YajÛa’ and to get it performed, to donate and to accept the donation—these are the six duties have been assigned for the Brahmins. Master of his senses, performance of ‘YajÛa’, truthful, kind, enduring, tolerant, unavaricious, simple, cool-minded, non-violent and forgiving natured Brahmin is a Brahmin in true sense. A Brahmin can do good to all the world being even staying at one place and without any physical work. His chanting of the Vedas, fire-sacrifice and his virtuous resolve are helpful enough for the world beings. K¦atriyas are the protectors of the Brahmins. The VaiÜyas have to manage for the fooding-clothing etc., of the Brahmins and K¦atriyas, both. All these three castes are very helpful to each other. The lower caste is closely related to these three. As a matter of truth, only by the co-operation of all, right living can be lived, so in spite of the division of work, all are entitled equally for the same fruit of salvation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There are four stages of life—celibacy, householder-life, ascetic-life and renunciation. There are classified duties of the each stage. All are to be followed as ordained. A Brahmin is bound by all the four stages. He is free to take renunciation without passing the householder-life and ascetic-life. If he so desires, he may lead a householder-life after the celibacy. In the renunciation stage, one should remain free from joys and sorrows, a homeless life, be contented with whatever may be available to eat and thus, passing, he should be Master of senses—subdued, calm, bereft of sense enjoyments, free from modifications. In the householder stage, it has been emphasised to repeat the enchanting of the Vedas, to procreate issues, to enjoy the sensuousness restrainedly, to remain guileless, to take regulated food and to get rid of the debts of the ancestors and gods. This is righteousness and morality. The house-holder should be grateful, devotee to gods, truthful, benevolent, chariteer and remaining with his wife during her menstruation. The rules of ascetic life are very hard. While studying Vedas, they accept the celibacy and if their inner-sense is under their control, they accept it for the whole life. In true sense, he, who has been initiated with sacred thread, having controlled his sense-organs, worship gods, repeating of the Mantras, service of ( cŒrya), salutation to ‘Guru’, study of the Vedas and its parts, he keeps breath control and does meditation, gives up the sensuous enjoyment and the association of the sinners, is a true celibate.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Tolerance is very necessary. If anybody humiliates, one should not be angry abruptly, one should remain modest. One who behaves so, never suffers any trouble. There is an ancient history on this subject. Once the ocean asked the rivers, submerging in it—‘O the rivers! <span class="char-style-override-7">w</span>ith the current of your waves, many uprooted trees are seen coming, but till now, no cane tree came up, what is its reason? Is it so, that you don’t bring it considering the cane trees grown on your banks as insignificant or they are your friends?’ In reply, Ýr¶ GaÆgŒj¶ said—‘O the Master! The other trees remain stood stiff, in one way, they oppose us, but the cane do not do so, It bows down seeing the speed of our flow, and when the waves-flow is over, it comes to its usual position. It takes the advantage of opportunity, enduring, humble, and agreeable to us, that is why we don’t uproot it.’ The same position is with the speed of the wind also. The trees, the creepers, the bushes, which bow down before the speedy wind, are not uprooted. To become meek, is the characteristic of the intellectuals. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A man should be of a good character. By virtue of his character, PrahlŒda got the kingdom of Indra. Indra was very much worried, he went to his spiritual guide. He asked for the way to get back his kingdom. Then, the god’s spiritual guide B¾haspati said—‘Acquire knowledge.’ When Indra asked a better way than this, he sent him to ÝukrŒcŒrya. ÝukrŒcŒrya sent him to PrahlŒda, Indra went to PrahlŒda, in disguise and prayed to him to impart him sermon on how to get prosperity. PrahlŒda said—‘I am busy with the royal affairs, where have I time to give sermons?’ Indra said—‘Alright! When you are free, you can give your sermon?’ PrahlŒda was very much pleased and in his free time he used to give him sermon. Indra, in the disguise of a Brahmin began to attend him very humbly staying with him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> Once, disguised as Brahmin, Indra asked—‘O the king of demons! <span class="char-style-override-7">h</span>ow did you get the kingship of all the three worlds?’ PrahlŒda said—‘Brahmin! I never insulted and neglected the <span class="char-style-override-7">b</span>rahmin, being proud of kingship. I listen to their sermons, adopt it with paying due regard to them and behave accordingly. They give me sermons always, being pleased with my service and good conduct. After giving sermons PrahlŒda said to Indra—‘Brahmin! I am very much pleased with your service, demand anything whatever you want.’ The Brahmin said—‘If you want to grant me boon being pleased, give me your purity of character.’ PrahlŒda accepted the Brahmin’s prayer. He transfered his stainless character to Indra. Indra went away from there.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At the same moment a silhouette came out of his body. On PrahlŒda’s query the silhouette answered—‘My name is pure charactership, you have given up me, now, I will stay in the same <span class="char-style-override-7">b</span>rahmin’s body. That shadow went away. Then after, righteousness, truth, vitality and goddess Lak¦m¶, all came out one by one, having given the introduction, each one took leave of him and all of them went away; because where there is purity of character, there they live. What is the good character? Not to hurt anyone by mind, speech and behaviour, to donate in charity, and to be compassionate to everyone—This is called good charactership. Any such deed which is not beneficial to others, and becomes the cause of shame in the society, should never be done. A man of vicious character can never attain glory and prosperity. It it is attained any how, it cannot last. Any person who has to attain stable happiness and wealth, should be of high character.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The hospitality and protection to the shelter-seeking person is the great morale and righteous act. Why human being only, even in the animals and birds life, this characteristic has been noticed and by this way they have acquired such a position as it is rare for mankind. Relating to this matter ParaÜurŒma has related to Mucukunda a good story. In the ancient time, there was a cruel hunter. Being fedup of his cruelty, even his kinsfolk had desisted him. It was his sole work to kill the animals and birds. One day he was loitering in the forest, it happened to occur a very terrible gust of wind, the big trees even began to fall, the sky got overcast with clouds and the lightening began to flash. The earth was filled with water, there was no resort anywhere even for the animals and birds. That fowler himself was also shivering with cold. Neither he was getting any place to stay nor had he strength to move anywhere. At the same moment, a female pigeon afflicted with cold, happened to be seen. That fowler himself was already agonised with cold, but even being in such a condition, he caught the female pigeon. He kept it in a cage. He himself being distressed, did not hesitate the least in causing trouble to that female pigeon.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At the same time, the fowler saw a tree, it was a very charming tree as if the <span class="char-style-override-7">l</span>ord BrahmŒ had created that tree to do good to others. The sky became clear, the stars began to be visible. The fowler took the shelter under that very tree spreading the leaves and making its bed, he lay down on it keeping his head on a piece of stone. That tree was the abode of that female pigeon. Her husband, pigeon lived there on that tree. Because of not coming of the female pigeon on time, he was wailing bitterly. Hearing the wail of her husband, the female pigeon was grieved badly, on the other hand, she was proud of her good luck also. She began to think—‘My husband remains so much pleased with me, then, what can be another matter of happiness for me?’ From the inside of the cage, she said calling her husband—‘Lord! It is for your goodness to give welcome and protect this hungry fowler, shivering with cold. He has come to your dwelling place. Being birds, we are no doubt, weak, but it is the moral duty of such a knower of self like you to protect the shelter-seeking being. You can get another wife in place of mine, but it is doubtful to get such an opportunity of a guest’s service. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the words of his wife, the pigeon was very much delighted. He began to say to the fowler with due regard—‘Brother! You should feel your own home here, don’t worry at all. You are my guest, your service is my duty.’ The tree provides shade even to him who cuts itself. Even the enemy should be received respectfully on his visit at the home. What do you want at this moment? I will fulfil your desire to the best of my capacity. The fowler said—‘At present, I am shivering with cold, do something to be protected from the cold.’ The pigeon collected the dry leaves. Bringing fire from the blacksmith, he kindled it. The fowler began to warm himself with the fire. He got rid of the shivering from cold. Then, seeing towards the pigeon he said—‘I am hungry. I need something to eat.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The pigeon said—‘I have nothing to appease your hunger. I bring my livelihood daily and thus, I live my life.’ Again after the pause of thinking he said—‘Well! <span class="char-style-override-7">w</span>ait for a while, just I manage for your food.’ He again lit the fire and circumambulating it thrice, he jumped into the fire saying that—‘Sir, accept my service.’ Seeing this condition of the pigeon’ the fowler’s cruel heart melted. He began to curse himself and began to weep. He repented very much. He threw away his cage, fishing rod, arrow and set the female pigeon free, and going on fast, he decided to get his body reduced to skeleton. Having determined so, he went away from there.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Coming out of the cage, the female pigeon began to wail on separation from her husband. Her attachment to her husband was sincere. She decided to prove her life meaningful. She also jumped into the fire. Both of them went to the Heaven in a celestial chariot. The sages admired them, worshipped them and gods paid them due regard and they began to live happily. The fowler also saw them they were going to the heaven. The forest conflagration engulfed the forest and fowler was also burnt and went to the heaven. As a result of guest service and providing shelter to shelter-seeking beings, one not only attains heavenly abode but the served one seeing him getting the supreme state, he also attains supreme position. The guest service and protection to the shelter-seeking person is the supreme virtue.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Dharma itself is very subtle. It begins from physical action and secures the subtlest part of the spiritualism. Virtue improves one’s life. It brings goodness to the caste and society. By it, peace prevails in all beings of the universe and it spreads purity in all the worlds. Dharma purifies our body, restrains the sense-organs, removes the mind’s distraction and chastises the intellect. It stablizes the soul in its ownself. What to say more of it, Dharma is the countenance of the Supreme Lord. Nothing is greater than righteousness. This entire universe comes out of it, exists in it and ultimately merges in it. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All the bodies of the human beings or creatures are formed of the five elements. The <span class="char-style-override-7">s</span>upreme Lord, the creater of the universe has established all the five elements in the bodies of the world-beings. Words, sound, ears and all the pores are evolution of the ether. Touch, activities and skin—all these three are evolutions of the wind. There are three evolutions of radiance also—appearance, eyes and digestion. Juice, moisture and tongue are the three evolutions of water. Smell, nose and body are the evolution of the earth. With the subtle form of the five great elements our inner sense has been formed. Through these organs the embodied soul comes to know the sensual enjoyments, the sense-organs experience the sense objects, our mind thinks this way or the other way, our intellect takes the right decision and the soul like a witness continues witnessing everything. Peace is achieved after the knowledge of the evolution and dissolution of the world through the pure intelligence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sattva, Raja and Tama—these are the three modes of Prak¾ti that control the intellect and the intellect controls mind and sense-organs. In the absence of intellect, no work can be done. The intellect with admixture of RajoguÄa provides the experience of the sensuous objects, the talent, with admixture of Sattva make us to realise the Supreme Lord. The talent with admixture of Tamas creates delusion. The Sattva brings peace and self-restrain. Rajas causes anger and desire, and the element of Tamas causes fear and dismay. Sattva provides pleasure, the Rajas is the cause of sorrow and the Tamas is the cause of infatuation. The sentiments of delightfulness, love, pleasure and peace ensue form the Sattva and the feelings dissatisfaction, agony, sorrow, greed, impatience and the feeling of humiliation, delusion, carelessness, laziness, dream ensue dullness from the Rajas and the Tamas respectively. To obey the ordains of the scriptures and to do our duties means to overpower Rajas and Tamas and to establish the dominance of Sattva. The purpose of the different types of physical and mental practices is also the same. This is the only reason behind the different forms and explanation of righteousness. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was all about the expansion of reason, now listen about the soul. Ego etc., are the evolutes of intellect, but the soul is quite apart from these. As the fruit of the fig and the worms in it, and the water and the fish living in it, are not the same. In spite of living together they are not the same. Similarly the intellect and the soul though living together but they are quite apart. The intellect etc., do not know the soul but the soul knows them all. The soul knows the reason and its all the calculations and knows even beyond it also. The man being steadfast in soul and absorbed in meditation, transcends the intellect and all the subjects related to it. One who always abides in the self, he is liberated while living. The person who remains detached from the worldly affairs in spite of living in the world like the swan, goes beyond all the fears. Sorrow, anxiety and agony, only belong to all the three modes of Prak¾ti. Soul is transcendent and apart from sorrow and the three modes of Prak¾ti. Morality, worldly gain and enjoyments, all these three are not the fruits of efforts in the real sense of the term, the true fruit of efforts is the salvation only. It is he who becomes completely detached from all these three, achieves deliverance. It is a must to detach the sense organs from the sensuous pleasures for the sake of self-realisation. There is no other way possible. There is no other knowledge better than self-realisation. He, who has realised his self, is fulfilled. Self-realised souls are never afraid of anyone. Salvation is absolute one. The salvation of everyone is the same. He, who is endowed with qualities, can be compared in attributes. He, who is devoid of any quality, can never be compared in qualities by anyway. Action is related to body only, with the association of the mind, it becomes virtuous or vicious. Worship is concerned to mind only whether it is the worship of inanimate or animate; The worship of inanimate will attach but the worship of absolute animate will provide deliverance. Knowledge is a product of intellect, whether wander about being misled getting the knowledge of inanimate, or realizing the knowledge of the soul, become peaceful forever. The worship is intrinsic than work, and knowledge is more intrinsic than worship. Rising above these three, it is better to live apart from all these three.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Meditation is highly needed for the abidance in the self. The act which is performed without any hindrance in the meditation, is praise-worthy. Only that state of mind is desirable which is neither swayed or distracted by attachment or hatred. For meditation such a place is needed where there is no frequency of women and no such object as may create any hindrance. The body should be so light that there should not be need of blood circulation to make it steady. With the virtuous deeds and by the natural fragrance of the body, the gods at that place should be so much pleased that they should not create any disturbance in the meditation. With sincere heart and with the pitious feeling, such a prayer to the Lord should be made for the meditation that Lord! Incline my mind to <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ourself.’ Sit on a stable seat of mat, and think that the Almighty God is present all around. He is making my body steady, initiating my sense organs introspective; concentrating my mind to Himself. Burn the lust and anger to ashes. Don’t care for the heat and cold. Don’t care for any worldly object. If even the dissolution of the world occurs, let it be so. If the throat is being cut, let it be so; you ought to remain concentrated into the meditation. Abide in the self in such a way as you may not feel the touch of your skin, you may not hear anything with your ears, you may not see anyone with your eyes, you may not taste with your tongue and you may not smell with your nose. Forget the sense-organs and objects that influence your mind to come out through the sense-organs, to enjoy the sensuousness. Absorb your mind in infinite consciousness and infinite Bliss. Sink yourself and sink in such a way as there may not remain any idea to come out again. Those who have any other idea of doing some other job after sometime breaking their meditation, they cannot really meditate. Meditation is the SŒdhanŒ of the mind. The mind disappears in the darkness like the lightening after flash, in spite of great efforts to concentrate the mind. Such a state of the mind is not desirable. The image of the individual whom we love comes before us. It should not be so, having forgotten all the worldly names and forms, raising ourselves above the Tamas, the Rajas and the Sattva; we should abide steadily in the self.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The great saintly person liberated while alive, never insists for anything, never opposes anything, never hates anybody, never aspires for anything. He treats all the creatures equally. He values all on the balance of equanimity. He, neither appreciates nor criticises the actions of others. He pervades all equally like ether. Neither he is afraid of anyone nor anyone is afraid of him. Neither he desires nor craves. He never thinks that ‘anyone is vicious’ and never he speaks anyone to be sinner. By his body, he never treats anyone with his disdaining behaviour. He only abides in Brahma who is never a source of agony to anyone in past, present and future. Really He is the exalted soul to whom the worshipper is not dear and the killer is not unpleasant.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is not easy for each and everyone to get liberated while alive, renouncing all activities of the physical body to meditate with mind and to abide in the attributeless absolute self. Those who are attached to this body and its activities, have forgotten their inner-organ and are abiding only in this physical body. Well! How can they meditate? For them, there should be such an effort and way, as they may watch their mind also along with the physical activities, rather to say that they should do such acts as may initiate them towards mind more emphatically in spite of being related to the body. Such an act is muttering divine name. In such muttering, there is the pronunciation of Mantra with the tongue, the roasary moves in the hands, in spite of remaining attached with the worldly affairs by the mind first but at last, the mind is diverted towards the Japa. Thus, our inner-sense awakens and begins to concentrate to the Lord. Muttering Japa is a must, it may be either of the Goddess GŒyatr¶ or of the sacred syllable OM of any divine name. Being introspective is the sign of the success of Japa. He who in spite of Japa, does not become introspective, lacks the quest of spiritualism in his mind or he lacks devotion, it should be considered so. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Yudhi¦¢hira! <span class="char-style-override-7">w</span>hat should I tell you; you already know everything. If you want to ask any question regarding the highest good of universe, ask and let me answer also. Actually, the fact is that all the religion’s origin is Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. He is the originator of all the religions. Liberation in life and abidance in the self waits for K¾¦Äa’s grace. He is NirguÄa Brahma. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is the SaguÄa Brahma, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is with form and Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is without form. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is Prak¾ti and Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is Vik¾ti. There is nothing but Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is mother, father, brother, relative, well-wisher, friend, husband, son, all and everything. He is a Puru¦a and He is Puru¦ottama. He is the living being, He is the BrahmŒ. It is Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa the knower and it is Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, is worth knowing the knowledge itself; It is Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, the BrahmŒ; and it is Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, the living being. That Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is the Supreme God, whom you consider your maternal uncle’s son, who worked as your minister, who was once your messenger, who was your friend; who acted to wash the feet of your guests in your YajÛa, who drove the chariot of Arjuna in the war; who bore my sharp arrows at His bosom for the sake of Arjuna. His meditation, His remembrance, His contemplation, muttering of His name, chanting of His name, His resort His shelter, His worship and His adoration, it is supreme achievement, it is His association, brother! It is real self-interest. It is all in all. This is the sermon and this is the ordain. This is the theme of all the sermons and essence of ÝŒstras. There is nothing more than this. All of you worship K¾¦Äa only worship Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. I have to say nothing more.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once again, I tell you that if Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha’s sermons are required for self-study, the whole portion—‘ÝŒntiparva’ should be read. Here, only a few words of his sermons have been quoted and that is not even from one side, but the sentences taken out from the place to place abruptly. Thus, after the sermons of a number of days, he ordered all of them to go to HastinŒpura, and to come back when the sun moves Northward. At that moment! I will get my desired state having given up this body. All went away. Having closed his eyes, Bh¶¦ma began to think of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, the Supreme Lord.</p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-14">Bh¶¦ma’s last prayer to Lord K¾¦Äa and his death</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It has been heard through a saint that if it is desirable to know about the daily routine of an individual’s life, he should be contacted suddenly at 10 P.M., or 4 A.M. It is to be presumed that he, whose the above mentioned time passes in frivolity, he would have been passing most of his time in error only. This has been mentioned here only for example. If you want to know the history of the whole life of a person, one should scan his last life. He, who had muttered divine name during his life, he would only mutter divine name at the time of death. He who would have meditation for whole life, he will meditate in the last days of his life. He, who would have passed his whole life in viewing Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, would die in the last, viewing Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa certainly. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, too, has confirmed the same view saying <span class="char-style-override-9">‘SadŒ TadbhŒvabhŒvita¬’</span><span class="char-style-override-10">(सदा तद्भावभावित:)</span> (being ever absorbed in its thought).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the beginning of his life, Bh¶¦ma had pondered over the Lord. He had performed all his duties selflessly for the pleasure of Lord or for carrying out his behests equipoised in success and failure. His life was only thinking of Lord or His remembrance. His eyes perceived the Lord all along. Now, it was the last time of his life. Can there be any doubt that he would give up his body remembering, thinking and viewing the Lord in the usual way?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The sun came to summer solstice, the day of Bh¶¦ma’s body-abandonment reached. Covering the distance from HastinŒpura, Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra, the PŒÄÎavas, Lord K¾¦Äa all came to be present. The seer VedavyŒsa, the sage NŒrada and Asita were already present there. Yudhi¦¢hira saluted all of them. He asked Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha for his order for himself. Holding Yudhi¦¢hira’s hand in his own hands, PitŒmaha said in a profound voice—‘Yudhi¦¢hira! <span class="char-style-override-7">i</span>t is now summer solstice. I am very much delighted to see you here with ministers, friends, and the preceptors. Today, fifty-eight days passed lying on these sharp arrows. It is the bright fort-night of the moon of the eleventh month, now, I should abandon my body.’ Thenafter PitŒmaha called Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and said—‘O the king! <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou have understood the essence of righteousness and worldly gains. You have served the learned Brahmins, you have studied the ÝŒstras (scriptures). There is no reason to be grieved. It is on account of ignorance, the people feel joy or sorrow. It will happen what is predetermined to happen, the ignorant persons are inflicted with attachment and sorrow because of their prior resolve that it should not happen so and it should happen so. The PŒÄÎavas are your sons, they will obey you. Your one hundred sons were wicked souls, they did not obey you. They were hostile to God, you should not lament for them.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha said to Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa—‘Lord! You are the only Supreme Lord of all the gods, I salute you with the sincere heart. It is You only the sole protector of mine. I have realised your identity. Now permit me to give up body.’ The Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa permitted him. Having assimilated and controlled his sense-organs, mental dispositions and talent, Bh¶¦mapitŒmaha started eulogy. A number of sages and seers were sitting around him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He said—‘O the Supreme Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! You are the Supreme Brahma. The great gods and sages don’t know Your truth. The entire universe exists in You. All the Vedas and PurŒÄas (mythologies) praise of Your glory, You are the great lover of devotees. Merely Your name-repetition, assists the people to get rid of the world. It is only for the protection of the Vedas, You have incarnated. After the actual knowledge, a man realizes his self as yourself. It is You only worthy of adoration, it is You only worthy of giving shelter to the shelter-seeking beings. You are the wish-yielding tree, You are the treasure of the entire world, You are the monosyllable Brahma beyond Sat (existent) and Asat (non-existent) and the Supreme Truth. You are eternal and infinite, all the beings abide in You, it is due to ignorance, they feel sad and joyful. After knowing You, the fear of death runs away. It is You Who have sustained the earth. It is You who sleep on the hoods of ‘Ýe¦anŒga’. You are the real Truth, You are the real righteousness, You are the eternal time spirit, You are the form of sphere. You are the SŒÆkhyayoga and the liberation itself. Lord! I salute your feet again and again.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Lord! You are the cause and You are the effect. It is You Who is formidable and non–formidable, both. It is You, Who appear in the form of KŒla, directions and objects. It is You, Who is this world and who is the next world. It is You Who is BrahmŒ, Vi¦Äu and MaheÜa. Your body is not made of five material elements. You are all in all manifestations. You are beyond the time, Your body is dark like the linseed flower, yellow garments is fluttering. I salute You. He who salutes You, gets rid of all the fears. In the life of being, the most valuable object is Your name. Whosoever has remembered Your name and taken its shelter, has got rid of all the bondages. He got rid of all the miseries.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! You are the Bliss personified. When You wield the MŒyŒ, the wave of creation flows. I have surrendered You my selfless intellect. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! <span class="char-style-override-7">h</span>ow charming is Your body! Your dark-blueish body like TamŒla tree is before my eye-sight. Your ‘P¶tŒmbara’ (yellow clothing) glittering like the sun rays is hoisting on Your shoulders. Your curly hair like emerald gem are lopping on Your smooth cheeks. The tenderness of Your lotus face is quite obvious. O Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, the friend of Arjuna! May I have my sincere love in You! Yes! You are the friend of Arjuna. I remember the scene of that time when Your black hair were dusted with the dust created by the hoofs of the horses, On Your face, the drops of sweat were shining. I cut down Your armour with my arrows, the skin of Your body began to shatter by my arrows. ‘Yes, I don’t miss to remember that image, may my mind remain absorbed in that image!’ Arjuna said—‘Drive my chariot amidst both the armies.’ O the excellent charioteer of Arjuna! Yes! How was it possible for You to make delay? You drove the chariot at once in the middle of both the armies. Arjuna’s condition was in a fix. He began to tremble. Oh! <span class="char-style-override-7">h</span>ow to kill these preceptors? O the preceptor of the preceptors Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! <span class="char-style-override-7">h</span>ow long could his weakness continue before You? Through Your sermons, You removed his ignorance. May my attachment to Your feet remain continuing as usual! Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! What more should I say to You? You took vow not to use weapons. I took vow to compel You to use the weapons. In face of a devotee’s vow, how could the Lord keep on His vow? You broke Your promise and proved my promise true. I very well remember it, when You were rushing towards me with the wheel of the chariot in Your hands. At that moment, the earth began to shudder, Your wrapper fell down from Your shoulders. May Your that same view remain always in my memory! I, myself, also, left no stone unturned from my side even. With my sharp arrows, I cut down Your armour. So many arrows pierced into your body that Your body was smeared with blood. In such a condition You were rushing towards me to kill me, my eyes sighted it. My mind was charmed with that very image and that image got enshrined in my heart. You were sitting on Arjuna’s chariot, the Whip in Your one hand and the rein of the horses was in the other hand. The life sacrificers of the ‘MahŒbhŒrata-war’ saw Your that image and merged in You. I am the lover of Your that image. May I not forget Your that image even for a moment! Gop¶s were enchanted with Your elegant motion, Your bewitching activities, Your mild sweet smile and Your fascinating look etc., and began to show off their good luck. You, too, are a wonderful actor, You hid yourself behind, they were anguished with the pangs of separation and what was the way for them to do, they began to imitate the same role of Your frolicsome activities. They forgot themselves, and got absorbed. You appeared in their rapt attention, anguished song and in their pangs of separation. This is the way, You appear, that is why I am dedicated to Your feet.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa! I can never forget the ‘RŒjasµuya YajÛa’ of Yudhi¦¢hira. It is the happening of my eye-sight. You were sitting on the Supreme throne among the sages, saints and gods. The PŒÄÎavas worshipped You. How delighted I was! Today You are before my eye-sight, at the time of death, You are before my eye-sight. What an excellent fortune! <span class="char-style-override-7">h</span>ow lucky I am gratified and fulfilled. I gave up the attachment, my ignorance has been removed. The darkness before my eyes has gone. I am glancing that in reality You are single one and appear in different forms in each different body just like the same sun reflects in different forms in the water of different pots, but actually it is single one. In fact, You are birthless, there are no different pots and there is no water of the pots even, it is only You. I have identified myself with You. I have merged in You. I became identical to You.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having uttered this much Bh¶¦ma became silent. The gods began to rain the flowers on his body. The people saw with great astonishment that as by the degrees the vital force of Bh¶¦ma’s body was moving upward, so like that the arrows of his body were coming out in the same degree of speed and the wounds were healing up. What to talk of others, even Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, Himself, VyŒsa and Yudhi¦¢hira were spell-bound. Bh¶¦ma merged into the Lord. He merged with the Lord. The slogans of ‘Glory to Bh¶¦ma’ began to resound in the space. All people offered libations of GaÆgŒ water.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The PŒÄÎavas prepared the funeral pyre. Bh¶¦ma’s body was cremated. At that moment, the goddess BhŒg¶rath¶ in person came out of the water. Being inflicted with grief, she began to praise Bh¶¦ma’s virtues lamenting and weeping. She began to say—‘My son, Bh¶¦ma was the only supreme exalted soul on the entire earth, his behaviour was ideal, his wit was outstanding, he had outstanding repute for humbleness and modesty. He was the servant of the preceptors and elder ones. He was a great devotee of father and mother. His celibacy-vow was matchless, even ParaÜurŒma could not defeat him. There was no other chivalrous person equal to him—on the earth. My same vigorous son was killed by ÝikhaÄÎ¶, it is a matter of great sorrow. In his separation why is my heart not breaking into pieces? My heart is hard like stone.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and VedavyŒsa went to her. They said—‘Goddess! Don’t be grieved, your son Bh¶¦ma has attained the supreme state. He was one of the eight Vasus. He is the most benevolent being of the world. He was born due to Vasi¦¢ha’s curse. It is not ÝikhaÄÎ¶ but Arjuna, who killed him. He has given up his life with his own will.’ The goddess BhŒg¶rath¶’s grief was removed to a great extent due to their convincing consolation. She went to her realm. All of them came to HastinŒpura from there.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This creation of the world is the frolicsome pastime of the Lord. A number of great persons are usually born from time to time for the protection of righteousness, and maintain ideals. Bh¶¦ma is the distinguished one among them. We can learn a lot from his character. May God Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa purify our heart so that we might attain the unswerving devotion to the Lord, dedication to the duty and the superior knowledge of truth like him by sketching the character of that great man. Bh¶¦ma’s life is the accomplished life. His action is perfect. His vigour is perfect and his knowledge is perfect. The Lord is there where there is perfection and where there is perfection there is the Lord. Bh¶¦ma’s life is absorbed in God and the Lord is absorbed in Bh¶¦ma’s life. The memory of Bh¶¦ma’s life is the memory of the Lord.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-15">Divine Preaching of MahŒbhŒrata</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Greed only, is the cause of the sin, Having given up the association of the greedy, let us serve the virtuous persons. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">PitŒmaha Bh¶¦ma is lying on arrows bed-stead. The sages are sitting around him. DharmarŒja Yudhi¦¢hira is asking Truth of religion and PitŒmaha is sermonising him. Having come to be acquainted with so many facts, Yudhi¦¢hira said—‘O PitŒmaha! Where lies the sin and what is its origin? Kindly tell me its mystery.’ PitŒmaha said—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O DharmarŒja! I just tell you the abode of sin; Listen to me attentively. Greed is a big alligator, it originates sin. Greed is the root cause of sin, immorality, great sorrow and deception. Greed that causes man to commit sin, lust, anger, attachment, illusion, egotism, prestige, subservience, lack of forgiveness, impudence, poverty, anxiety and infamy are originated from greed only. Attachment to the enjoyment of pleasures, extreme craving, prompting to do vicious acts, intoxication of high family, knowledge, handsomeness, wealth, enmity to all the beings, disregard of all and sundry, disbelief, crookedness with everyone, usurping of other’s wealth, adultery with other women, unrestrained speech, unrestrained thoughts, to denounce anyone abruptly, to be slave of sexual pleasures, to pamper the stomach, premature death, jealousy, bound to tell a lie, to be slave of the palate, to boast of himself, enviousness, rivalary, misappropriate acts, show off courage of every sort and happen to act undesirable actions etc., other evils are born of greed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">From the birth to the old age at any stage or in any condition, it is very difficult to give up greed. A man becomes old, but greed never grows old. The water of the over-flooded rivers merge in the sea-water but the sea is never satiated with that water, similarly desires of a greedy person are insatiable. The real form of greed is exactly not known to even gods, demons, human beings and none else. It is right for a contemplative  person to win over such a greed completely. In the greedy persons, unable to control their mind, malice, denounce rigidness and enviousness etc., demerits are visible in abundance. Even the great scholars of scriptures, the dispellers of the other persons doubts of mind, suffer merely in this world being overpowered by greed. The men of avarice nature are found to be obsessed in the enviousness and anger always. They get always corrupted from the moral character of the virtuous person. Their heart remains flooded with cruelty and they appear very sweet by their speech. The simple persons are often deceived just like the well covered with grass. In the disguise of morality, they are the treacherous, the most unkind and narrow minded persons to wound the others feeling in the false garb of righteousness. They destroy the moral path made by the holy and virtuous great men being tempted by greed on the basis of false evidences and means (by the misinterpretation of the religious precepts). On account of their self-interest the entire social system is disturbed and others also sighting their examples start behaving immoral conduct. O Yudhi¦¢hira ! Pride, anger, passion, joy, sorrow, extreme arrogance—all the demerits reflect in the greedy person. It is better to escape from such persons considering them cunning. The general good can be possible only in the association of virtuous and truthful persons. ‘O the king! The behaviour of virtuous persons is always worth imitating. Remaining in their touch you should always make your doubts clear. As a result of their association they get rid of the fear of rebirth and the next world. They remain equal forever, acquisitions of pleasant and unpleasant they always shun meat and drinking. Such noble and virtuous persons remain totally devoted in following the truth and doing moral duties admiring the great persons, considering the both joy and sorrow equal remaining self-restraint. They don’t expect anything in return after doing good to anyone or donating something in charity. They are the persons to pay due regard and reception to the kind saints, the forefathers, gods and guests. They remain engaged always in doing good to all the beings and these noble persons don’t deviate from morality even in their miserable days and they sacrifice even their lives gladly for benevolence. No human being or any attraction of the world can deviate such noble persons from the path of truth. Their character is full of ideal morality and they never violate the moral conduct practised by the saintly holy persons. They are never source of annoyance to anyone because their goal is always selfless and guileless love with all the beings. Everyone should take advantage of association with such stable-minded, non-violent saintly persons. They are totally devoid of sexuality, anger, attachment and arrogance. The doubts of mind should be made clear by such saints who observe propriety of conduct. They don’t follow the moral conduct for wealth or fame, but they follow the moral conduct considering it their duty. Just as the food is necessary for the protection of the body. Similarly virtues should be observed considering it as duty. With this attitude they live rightful living. The ever contented such hermits are always quite free of fear, anger, mental fickleness and sorrow. They never boast of their morality and righteousness to deceive others. There being no hidden interest in the least, they never take the shelter of hypocrisy. They never commit any mistake in taking any decision in the influence of greed or attachment because they are always impartial, righteous, truthful and frank in speech. You must have your love for such noble persons. They are never delighted in gain and never sorrowful in distress. Being bereft of attachment and egotism, they always abide in Sattva. Because of their equanimity, they consider joy-sorrow, pleasant and unpleasant or life, death equal. They are firm industrious remain stable on truth and morality. You should remain dedicated in the service of such great virtuous persons carefully with self-restraint.</p>
