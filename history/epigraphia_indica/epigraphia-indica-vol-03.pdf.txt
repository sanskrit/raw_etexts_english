No. 1. PATTADAKAL PILLAR INSCRIPTION OF THE OF KIBTITAEMAN II. 
BY J. F. FLEET, I.C.S., PH.D., CJ.E. 
HE existence of this inscription appears to have "been first made known by Dr. JL in his reportsof the Arohceological Survey of Western India.,Vol. I. p. S3 (p^blfshsd in 1874).Its contents were first brought to notice in 1881, "by myself,in the Indian Axiiqv&ri'. Vol. X- p. 168 ; the esfcampagesthat I had then made* howeers did not enable me to it with any completeness beyond line 11, In March, 1882^ I received some ink-impressions from Mr. H. Cousens : but theys again, did not enable me to deal -with the record fully* I edit it now from some better ink-impressions and some estampages, which were made under my awn direction in March, 1891* 
Pattadakal is a village about eightmiles to the east by north ol B&d&mi, the chief town of the Badami Talnka or subdivision in the Bijapur District, Bombay Presidency, And the inscription is on a monolith pillar, apparentlyof red sandstone, which stands in the house of 
a name which, betrays 
a god. 
The upper partof the pillaris octagonal ;and this partcontains the inscription which I edit, and which is presentedin two copies. One copy of it is in i^ertr-STS lines, in the local characters of the periodto which the record refers itself, lying on the =orih-T"est: west, south west, and south faces : here, the writing covers a spaceof about 2' 3" broad by 3' 10* high ; and the size of the letters, which are verywell formed and boldly engraved,varies from about 
*to If". The other copy is in twenty-sight lines, in Vftgart characters, lying on the east, north-east, and north faces : here the writing covers a spaceof about 2' 0* broad by 3' Iff high; and the size of the letters varies from about f to If. These Kagan characters are intermediate in type between those of the BSdh-Gaya inscriptionof Mahananian ot A.D. 51 1 o* 588 (Gupta, Inscriptions, p. 276, Hate *K.), and those of the S^gad eo??er-PMe 
Of Khadg&Yaloka-Dantidurgaof A.D. 753-54 (Ind. Ant. Vol. Xi. p. 110, P.ate) ; but 
i The aoath^rt face is blank, except where it was utilised, Beat the bottom, to insert a passage that carelessly omitted in the Nfigatfferfe (a&> page 6 below, note S).
1PIGEAPHIA INDIOA. [Vox,. III.   
approximate more closely to the characters of the B6dh-Gay& inscription than to those of tii<u Ssteiaagad. grant: for instance, the initial a is exactly like the initial & of the B&dh-Gaya inscription, (allowing, of course, for the mark which turns a into d), whereas the initial of ths; SainSngad grant is a very different letter; thep, m, s, and y follow the B6dh-Gay& inscription. in not having the fully-developed top line which appearsin the Samangad grant j and the Ja, p, asd o have the pointed forms of the Bddh-Gaya inscription : on the other hand, except perhaps is. acMrya, line 23, in the conjunct letter ry, the r is formed above the line of writing, as in the Samangad grant, and not on it, as in the B6dh-Gay& inscription. The peculiarities of the characters are evidently due to the Brahman from Northern India, for whom the pillar was set 't?'Aaad tte eomParative results suggest that the Nagari alphabet which is exhibited in the SamSngad grant, was developed in Central and Southern India more quickly than in Northern India. It should also be noted that such of the letters of the present Nagari record as -were rally executed in what was evidently the intended style, and have been well preserved, show, wherever the form of the letter permits of it, a well-marked triangular top, in which the apex of the triangle points downwards, and the centre of it is left in relief in the middle of the three strokes by which the top is formed: this is discernible in ft, oA, j, t, cL, n, p, bit, ynf y, r, I, v, St sb, s, and h; the shapes of g, n, n, f, n, and dh, do not permit of it j in th it is doubtful It 
may also be mentioned that this record and the Samangad grant, which is six months earlier in actual date, give the earliest instances, as yet obtained, of the use of NAgaxi characters in Western India. My test of the inscription is put together from the two copies. Owing- to the rough treatment that the pillar has received at theiands of its worshippers, each copy of the mscnptzonis more or less damaged : but they mostly supply each other's deficiencies; and the whole text is decipherable, without any doubtful points, except three akshara* at the end of

No. 1.] PATTADAKAL IFSCRIPTIOH OF K1ET1VARMAN II. 3   
of the god SiTas under the name of VijayeSvara* This temple is now known by the name of Sanigamfesvara 5 but there is no question as to its identity : there are two short inscriptions on structural parts of it, whieli give the name of the god as Vijayesvara [Ind* Ant.'Vol* X. p. 170); and the same name remained in use at any rate till A.D. 1162 (cTbwr, J3o. Sr. S. As. Sac. Vol. XI* 
p. 273). It then mentions Vljay&difcya's SOB, Vikram&ditya II., whom it describes as haying1 bruised the town of Kafichi ;1 and it tells us that his Mahddevi or queen-consort, Ldkamahft dvi, who belonged to the race of the Haihayas, *.e. the Kalachuris, erected & great stone temple of the god Siva, under the name of Loke&vara. This temple, again,still exists, "but is now known by the name of Virup&ksba ; the identity is established by records on structural parts of it, which give its name as L6k6svara, and speak of it as the temple of L6kamahMevi (Ind* Ant. Vol. X. pp. 165, 167, and Vol. XI. p. 124) : it stands on the south-east of the temple of Vijaysvara~(SamgamSsvara). The record then mentions a Kdjnt^ or queen3 of Vikra xaMitya II., named Trailokyamahad^vi, who was the uterine younger sister of L6kamah&d&vi? and was the mother of VikramMitya's son and successor, Kirtivarman II. ; and it tells ns that she erected a greatstone temple of Siva under the name of Trail6kysvara* This temple, which must have stood somewhere on the north-east of the temple of L6Msvara,-(Vimpaksha)? is not now in existence, I think.51 The inscription then proceedsto record that the pillar itself, stamped with the mark of the Jw&ZZa, or trident, which is^the weapon of Siva, was set up,in the middle of these three shrines, by * sculptor named Subhaddva, for an Achdrya xuamed JMnasiva, who had come from the Mrigathanikahara vishaya on the north bank of the Ganges; and it concludes by recording certain grants. 
As regardsthe date* the inscriptionrefers itself to the reigm of Kirtivarman II,, by speakingof him with the paramounttitles. And further^ though it does not quote the year of the Saka era or the regnal year,it givesdetails^ which enable us to place it exactly. The grants were made, or one of them was made, on the occasion of a total eclipse of the stms on the new-moon tithi of the month SrSvana; and the "Englishdate is the 25th June9 AJD. J764: on this day, which correspondsto the new-moon day ofNthe first pwrnimdnta Sravana of Saka Samvat 677 current, there was a total eclipse of the sun9 which was visible right across India.s

Here, on the south face? there are remains of five or more lines, of about twenty letters each, in the same local characters, and, on the east face, remains of eightlines of about twenty letters each, in MSgarl characters, of the same type;these two records, againj, are duplicates; but all that can be made out is that the inscription registers a grantof land, purchased with gady&nakas of gold, by the son of a jBhaffa named Pulivarman, and that it probably speaksof Pattadakal by its ancient name of Kisiivolal or IGsuvoiaL And on the west face there are remains of eleven or twelve lines, of about twenty, letters each, in the sam local characters: but, the north face being apparently quite blank, this record was not duplicatedin Nagarij and it is BO much damaged that nothing intelligible can be made out, except that, in the fifth line, B&d&mi is perhaps mentioned as V&tftpl* 
3 The word used is mmardan^ which may mean eifeher bruising" or*destroy ing.* But the Woltkal^ri grant says that, though he entered KMehl* he did not destroy it (avindsy, praotfyas Ind. Ant. Vol. VIJL p. 28* and o&-Iw. Inscrs. Vol. I. p* 146)* 
2 Unless, perhaps^it is the temple* partly of Northern and partly of Br^idiaB style, which Dr. Borgess (Zoo. &it. p- 33) describes as standing close oa the north side of the temple of Ysjayegwra<Samgame6v*tm)* Bat, tfaea, its position does not give the triangle that is requiredin connection with the description of the erection of the pillar (sea the Tests and page 5 below* note 10).

s la both versions* the first m is expressed by a plain symbol, and the second by the word itself in writing. 9 We have here evidently a verse., in the A&riti groupof metres, though the form in which it stands is oot correct : the first two pddas contain twenty-two eetfland are exactly uniform with each other; the third jpdda* however, COBtains twenty-three feet^ and matches the preceding two in only the last seven feet; and the fourth p4l&* though it contains only twenty-two feet* is uniform with the first and second in^only the first seven feet. The verse seems to me to have been quoted, with imperfect recollection, from some Saiva poem, similar to the Vaistmaira &ita-GMda* And the third and fourth pdda& might be put right by adopting some such reading as cfa4Wflamltw-|j4^^

is now partially in ruins. I was told that the stones of several mandapas and of the enclosure of the tank in front of the temple were utilised for building the bridges over the Kojpdam (Coleroon) and the Kavfiri rivers. The south wall of the shrine still bears an inscription of the Hoysala king Vira-BmaBtliadvas in which the temple is called Posaligvara (for Poysa* 
5 i.e. 'the tsvara (temple) of the Poysala (king)/ The name by which the temple goes , Bhdjisvara, is a corruption of the original PSsalisvara, and owes its origin to a confusion between the long-forgotten Poysala king andthe^ popularly known king Bh6ja. The walls of 
a neighbouring modern temple of K&li, called Sellayi, contain detached inscribed stones on which some Hoysala "birndas are distinctly visible, and which, therefore, appear to have origin ally belonged to the Poysalesvara temple,1 The Poysalesvara of the Kartnan&r inscription is evidently the temple to which the Jambukesvara inscriptionrefers. Accordingly, there can be BO doubt that the modem Kannsniir is the actual site of VUo?amap"ora9 the southern residence of Somesvara. 
As regards Virs-BamanSthadevaj, he must have been a successor of SdmSftvara, an inscription of whose 23rd year is quoted in an inscriptionof the 4th year of R&mantha in the JamTmkesvam temple. His relation to the hitherto known chief line of the Hoysala dynasty is established by an inscriptionof the Banganaths temple, which records a gift by Ponnam.- fosclamah^dSvis2 who styles herself the uterine sister of Vira-Bamanathadeva and the daughter of the Hoysala king Vira-S5m.6sva.ra by the Ch&lukya princess Devalamah,dv5L3 It thus appears that, while S6msvara was succeeded on the throne of Dvarasamudra by Narasirixha III., his son by Bijjaladevi,4 the southern part of his dominions went to R&man&tha, his son by Devaladevi. An inscriptionin the Jambukesvara temple furnishes the name of one of the queens of king l&ma&&thad6va. This was KamalSdevij the daughter of a certain Ariya Pillai. The name of this queen's younger sister was OhikkaS6maladevi95 who appears to have received the" Kanarese prefix chikka,*younger/in order to distinguish her from the elder Som^laclevi*6 who "was one of the "queensof Ramanatha/s father S&mesvara.

Tuesday, the thirteenth tithi of the bright half of Srftrana in the Prajftpati year, which correspondedto the tweniy-fonrth sol&r day of the month of JLp of the seventeenth (year of the reign)** 
The ahove five dates Ban be easily calculated by an expert, because we knoW9 from the inscriptionof PonBambalad6vi, that R&man&tha was a son of SdmSsvara. Hence the only possible Praj&pati year in date No- V. is Saka-Samvat 1194 As this was also the 17th yeaa? of Bam^toatha>'re%n,the dates of Nos. IM, and IV. will fall in Saka-Samvat 1192; the date of Ho, H, in Sakfr-Saotoat 1184 ; the date of No. I. in Saka-Samyat 1179 j and his accession to the thrroe in Saka-Sariivat 1177.8 It further follows that the defeat and death of Sdmdgvam and 
the wronation of Ha^asimha III. at Dvftrasamudra probably took place In the same Saka year, 1177. The earliest known inscription of Narasimha HE. is actually dated in this year4 From an inscription, which is dated in the 29th year of the reign of Vii?a^S6masvaracidvB, at TiraTasi Beer^Srirangam,it -follows that the accession of SdmSsvara took place between mYat 1146, the date of Ms predecessor Farasimha II., and Saka-Saonrat 1177 29 =

1148. An inscription of the Poysa|a Mug Vira^HferasiiiiliadiTB in the Ba&gandtito temple suggests that, subsequently to Saka-Samvafc 1194 (the date of No* V), Bamanatha was succeeded or supplanted by his half-brother Narasimha III* This inscriptionis dated in the cyclic year Vijayett which would correspond to Saka-Samvat 1216, and refers to 3D6valadvis whof as 
stated above? was the mother of Bftmanftt|ia 
The fact that Rftmanfttha held Sriraiigsm aftefr the death of his father, suggests that the defeat which Sundara-Pandya inflicted on S6mvar% had no permanent effect, but that Rlman&tha soon recaptured Srirangam^ from the P&ndya king. The subjoined inscription appears to have been engraved between Saka-Sazhvat 1175, the date of the Bangalore Museum plates of S6m6svara, and Safca-Samvat 11793 the earliest date of R&man&tha* 
The immediate purpose of the BaAganatlaa inscription of SttndaraBndya is a description of his building operations at, and gifts to, the temple. He built a shrine of JTarasimha (verses 2 and 10) and another of Vishnu's attendant Vishvaksna (verse 8), both of which were covered with gold, and a gilt tower which contained an image of Narasianh (?)* Further* h covered the (original or central) shrine ol the temple with gold, an achievement of which he must have been, specially proud, as he assumed, -with reference to it, the surname i.e **the king who has covered (the temple) with gold/* and as h 
placed in the shrine a golden image of Vistara* which he called after -his own new surname (3), He also covered the inner wall of the (central) shrine with gold (22) and built* in front of it, a dining-hall, which, he equipped with golden vessels (23). In the course of two"dining-weeks/* which he called after his own name, he"filled the capacious belly**' of the god, or rather of Ms votaries (26), IB the month of Chaitraj he celebrated the "procession-festival** of the god (20). For the**festival of the god's sporting with JQakshmi/' he builfc a golden ship (21). The last verse (80) of the inscription states that the king built three golden domes over the image of Hdmfiohehhfi^ (compare verse 3), over that of Q-aruda (compare verse 16), and over the hall which contained the eonch of Vishnu (compare verse 6)* , The following miscellaneous gifts to Banganatha are enumerated in the inscription:- A garlandof emeralds (verse 4), a crown of jewels (5), a golden image of Sshs (6), a golden arch (9), a pearl garland (11), a canopy of pearls (12), different kinds of golden fruits (13), a golden ear (14% a. golden trough (15), a golden image of Gtenxda (16)* a golden imder-garment (17) a golden aureola (18), a golden pedestal (19), ornaments of jewels (24), a golden armour (25), goldenvessels (28), and a golden throne (29). The first of the gifts which are here enumerated, appears to have suggested' the surname MsrakatarpritMviblirit^ i.e.*< the merald*king/? which is applied to Sundara-P&ndya in verse 13.

The first four bear writing on both sides;and the last is inscribed on the iii-er side only^ while its second side bears the numeral"five"at the top. The first side of the first plate has the symbols of the SUB and moon at the left and right top-corners respectively, and below the mooa the figure of a bull, tied by a rope to a tripod, which, is surmounted by a trident,jThe occurrence of such symbols^ quite common in stone-inscriptions^is rather rare on conger-platen. The lines written across the breadth of the plates and number about twenty on each, side. The raised, rims appear to have been flattened and filed on the borders, and, consequently, some letters which run into them, have been partly injured* Nevertheless, the rnscrirtio:: is in good preservation^ and, with very few exceptions, every letter of it can be made out with certainty. 
The language of the inscription is Sanskrit verse of various metres, written in faint, but boldly engraved Teliigu characters. The chief peculiarityof tie alphabet is the manner in which the aspirate letters are distinguished from the unaspirated ones* The letters da and are distinguished as in Old Kanarese or Telugn,- the Erst by an opening on the right side. the second by being fully closed up. But in lines 24 and 163, dtia is written in its modern form, i.e. with the addition of a vertical stroke below. The difference which the writer Has ^tterr^tei to keep up between la and bfaa, is rather complex- The top-stroke ffalekaftu* as it is called in Kanarese, or talaJcaftu in Telugu) is considered sufficient to ffstiEgrrish the aspirate from the unaspirated, except in cases where snots, a stroke is to be omitted in writing^as when other vowels but a, u and 4 are affixed to the consonant, and when it appears conjnnct with another. Ttere are several cases, too, in which both the talaJcaftn and the devrnv^rcl stroke appear in tie same letter (11. 120, 127, 137, 141, 144, cfc.)- I* be observed that, in ayhVkdnih* in line 11, Sfctf is written as in Old Kanarese or Telugu, with an openingin the centre Below, The downward stroke of tha and gha is dispensed with, because no cc-f^=:cn could arise between them and their corresponding nnaspirated forms ; -whereas, in the case of flfftoandpia,it is retained as the only mark of distinction from the ^aspirated.

It is worth noticing that the word ndtha, which occurs four times la the Inscription (II. 50^ 525 181 189), is spelt In the first three 
"with an anusvdra before tha* This may be clue to the tendency of the Telugo. language to insert an awusvdra in such, cases (compare tawtnnMd'it and tammttihdu'). The spelling hramhmassom (11. 178 and 179 f.) for brdlimasvam^ saijni (1 87) for sathjZi, saijna (L 186) for samjna, the prefixingof a y "before i and s and vice versa (11. 21, 22? 23, 44, 65, 160, 163 'and ISO) are also due to the Telugu pronunciation of Sanskrit. 
The inscription opens with, an invocation to the Boar-incarnation of Vishnu (verse 1). I., the first historical ancestor of the first Vijayanagara dynasty^ is then ?ntrodticed without any reference to his mythical descent from the Moon, as is done iu other Vijayanagara grants (verse 2). He had five sons, Harlliara, 
and (verses 3 and 4). Of these, the first two ruled one after the other, is said to have defeated the Muhammadaiis (Terse 5). Kampa (verse 4) or (verse 6) tad a son, called II, (verse 7), during whose time the subjoined inscription was written. Of this king we learn nothing but a number of bintdas (verse II). The inscription records tie grant of the village of Bitraguata (verses 20, 21) or Bittaratei^ta (verse 19) to twenty-eight Brfthmanas, wtose nain^s and g6tras are specified In verses 27 to" 33 ; and refers incidentallyto the grant of another Tillage,mss. (verse 24). Both grants were made a,t the suggestion of the king's spiritual pr--eptc-;the Saiva philosopher 
(verse 12 and line 189), after whoso name- the village of Bitragunta received the "surname (versea 21, 34 35 and 42). The date of the first grant was the Bew^moon day of the third month o Sftka-SazhvfiA 1278 (ia numerical words aad figures), the cyclic year Durankha. The Ascription w^s written by the court- ieater of 1L (Yetse So). At the end of the document (L 184), the king is stated to have by Ms OWE hand the name of the tutelar deity of the city of Vijayana-ar^ (verse 42). This the origin of ihe colophons S&VMtpdhha, Sri-VeAkaf*** or Srt-Mma at the end ox otter vrjayanagara inscriptions. 
The motiTe for making the grant under consideration is stated to bare been twofold, -first, a reqnest or almost a compulsory demand, of the preceptor Srifeantliaiiatlia, and, .eeondly, the kings own desire to procure immortality to his father (verses 17* and 20). The second statement3 farther suggests that the expression pratyabddhdlS in verse 20 means at the ^versarj(of his lather's deatt);3 The iascrlption does not inform us if the first or any followingifflrnvwaajyis meuit. But ihe motive why the king made the grant, tVe.'to procuring hir to his fatter, pyes us sufficient room for conjecture. It is a weU-known Hind4 Jiat the spmt of a dead man will continue to be a Prfto, or an eyii spirit, until the

After this period, -and through the several charities made during the final ?3r3~7r_zr-c the Preia is supposed to become one of the Monies, i.e. to become classed vith die PihidSzzs.1 Thus, It may be that the ,rr"T?:'srtrj on which ir-ricrfelitj* or godhead v?ac cojisn-ee! on Katapa? was tLe first; and, If so, fee date of JCazcpa's and tie rrc-B-ifcr of ^r^^r-^:?

The contents of the irserir!:io^ furnish us with two -?-:i*r.t facts, viz. first, tie distinct mention of the five sons of Saihgama I., and, secondly,'that of a grandson of his, by name StrdigsiTns EL Both those facts are valuable; for, most of tie iz^cri^Hcris thai contain a regular genoalogy of the first ^I^ya-iag^rr. dynasty, mention only Harihara I. and Bakka L, the first and third sons of Samgama L, s.nd ignore ~?' ^zi^ii* the othei* three; acd even the limited few that mention all the five sons of S^v"?Tr- L,s are either open to suspicion or i:_T?r>y?capf!v read. The ?irp^rtc.ncj of the second fact is eTen greater,, inasmuch as it eaalbles us to correct certain inferences which have been dra/^n from tlio colophon of the llfdli&i'tud Bhdtuvritti, This colophonreads us follows:"Tlie lLf*.dli&rl*jd Vritti9 composed by ^f/jrr^Sc^c^a (who was) the uterine brother of ??Ia*??^c; the son of (and) the great minister of ?r,.fri^"^-a^j the son of ISanprrf^r., the gloriouslord of tlie Eastern, Western and.

According to Mr. Sewett's Lists of Antiquities, Vol. I, p. 142, Bitragunta2 the first of the villages granted, is situated 7 miles south by -west of KHvaiij which is 32 miles from X9ell&r (Nellore) and is the head-qtiartarsof the Kavali t&luka in the Kellore district. Its situation is described in tie inscriptionas being 3 y6janas north of the town of Vlkrazaasiiiihapiira in ihe district called PSkavisliaya, which was situated on the shore of the Eastern ocean, i.e. the Bay of Bengal (verse 19), I do not know if the name Vikramasimhapura still exists; "but the name Paka survives in the name 01 a certain sect of Telugu-spealritig SMras B the Mysore territory$ who profess to come from Pakanadn^ the country of Paka, and are as such called Pakanatis, The other Tillage,, Siihkesari9 Is said to be situated in the district called Mnlikidesa on the northern bank of the Penn&y i\e. the well-known Penner river, and to the north of the Saiva temple at Puslipaeliala (?erse 24), which is identical with Pustt.pagiri9 
8 miles north of Kadapa (Cuddapah). A native of Pushpagiri informed me that close to Pushpagiri is a village named S'unkesara, which appears to be the same as the Simkesari of the grant.It inay be also remarked that a certain class of Smarta Bralimanas, who call 
themselves Mr^kir.dr.TC.rr.; profess to have emigrated from the Muliki country. The otter places. meBtioned In the inscription as the boundaries of the two villages (verses 22 and 25) I am unable to identify. Bat so much is certain that Samgama II* held portions of the present Hellore and CmddapaSi districts, while his uncle Bukka I* was reigningat Vijayaaftgara. Samgama II. can scarcely have "been dependent on Bixkka I., as he would Jhave 
otherwise referred to the latter as his overlord in his inscription* The fact that lie represents Ms owa father as the actual successor of Harihara I. also suggests that lie considered himself entirely independent of Bukka I.

SAKA-SAMTAT 1346. 
BY E. HULTZSOH* PH.D. 
This inscriptionis engraved on tliree copper-platesof 5f by 9| inches, which weres < found hidden in a paffd land, belonging to one ArunSchala Aiyar,in the village of Satyamangalam in the TMur (Vellore) t&luk&," and kindly transmitted to me for examination by the Collector of the North Areot district, Mr. H. Le Fanu, LO.S. The ring on which the plates must have been originally strung,is missing. The inscriptionis in the Wandingarl alphabet and in Sanskrit verse; a few short passagesin prose occur in lines 42 fc, 51 f., and at the end of the last plate. 
The inscription records that king Devaraya II of Vijayanagara bestowed on eight Brahmanas the agrahdraof CMtoytyiirtis which he had snrnamed (DevarsLyapura) after himself (verse 25). This village was situated in Anda-nadu,3 a sub-division of Marataka^ nagara~prnta* The grant was made at the temple of Virtipakslia4 on the bank of the TuiigaTbliadra river (v. 23). The date of the grant was Monday, the new-moon tithi of Ashadha in Saka-Saxhvat 18485 the Krddhi samvatsara (T. 24). Mr, Dikshit has favoured me with the following information regardingthis date : 
" Amanta jLshadha krisTina amdvdsyd of Saka-Samvat 1346 expired, the Krfidhi samvatsara, ended on Tuesday, the 25th July, A.D. 1424^ commencing on Monday, the 24th July, as late as 56 gJi. 13 p. Ujjain mean-time. This is not the tifki in question^ as the original has a Monday* Besides, Ashadha was intercalary in this year, and its amavtisyd ended on Monday^ 
the 2Gtli June, AD 1424, at 31 gh. 56 p. Ujjain mean-time* This seems to be the tifhi in question, though the word adJiika*,ccintercalary/5 is not added in the original. There was a solar eclipse on this date (26th June), though I have not ascertained whether it was visible in India or not." 
The historically important part of the inscription is the genealogyof the first dynasty of Vljayanagara^ which is givenin verses 3 to 21. As in other inscriptions^5 Yadu of the race of the Moon is mentioned as the mythicalancestor of this dynasty. The first historical person is Samgama IJ (v, 5), One of Ms sons was Biikka [I.] (v, 6), whose descendants are named in the same order as in a previously published inscriptionof D&varaya II.6 Besides, the new inscription mentions the names of the queens of Bukka I. and of Ms three direct descendants* and

No. 6 BUGUDA PLATES OF MADHAVAVABMAN. 
BY F. KiELHOKHj PH.D., OJ.E. ; GOTTIKGSM. 
The copper-plates which contain this inscription, were found in an earthen pot3 buried in a field in the villageof Biiguda, in the Gnmsiir talnka of the Gafijam district of the Madras presidency.4 On the 28ili July 1S9G* they were sent to Dr. Hnltzsch by Mr. E. C* Jolmson, I*C.S 8? Collector of Gaiij&m, and 1 now edit the inscription from the original plates and from excellent Impressions, received from Dr. Hnitzsctu The original plateswill be deposited in the GrQTernment Central Museum, Madras. 
The inscription is on tbree plates,, each of which measures about 6JV broad by 3" high and the edges of which are fashioned slightly thicker than the rest, to protect the -writing, The first plateis inscribed on one side only ; the two others are Inscribed on botii sides* The engraving is deep and well done, A careful erairixia^Vri sliows that these plates orfffinsn-T Bore another inscription, the letters of which probably were beaten in to make room for the i ascription her edited; but some letters of the older inscription may still be ree^i-ecL ever in the ink-impression, especially on the second side of the second plate. The three plates are held together by a ring, which is about 3" in diameter, and on -which is soldered a round about If in diameter. The seal apparentlycontains s'orne -writing and an emblem; but are too much worn to be made out with certainty. Before the plates came into Dr. Hultzsch's hands, somebody had attemptedto remove the ring; and, in doing so, lie had rudely cut the plates

from the ring-holesto the edges, and thus damaged some of the writing. With this exception, and exceptthat four aksharas are broken away at the edges, the platesare well preserved. The size of the letters Is about '. The characters are N.gari3 similar to, but more modern than, those of the Gorfikhpnr copper-plate grant of Jaydditya of Vijayapura.1 The language is Sanskrit. Lines 31-41 are in prose \ the rest of the inscription, exceptingtbe introductory 6m svasti, is in verse. As regards orthography, the letter 6 is throughoutdenoted by the signfor t?;the guttural nasal is used instead of anusvdra before the palatalsibilant, in ansuWiih, line 2, prdnsur, line 7, and in the "word vansa, in lines 14 and 19 ;and tbe 
vowel ri is employed instead of ri in triVhuvana, line 6, and triyarsheya (for triydrsMija= trydrsJi&yct), line 38 The language is simple, but not always correct; and though the general sense is plain enough, it is in one or two passages Impossible to construe the words properly. and to make out with certainty what the writer exactly meant to say. 
The inscription is one of the illustrious Madhavavarman (line 30), who, froto his residence at EaingSda (line 29) ? informs his officials and the people generally that, on the occasion of a solar eclipsea he gave the villageof Puipina (line 36) ,which was in the Khadira pdttaJcaof the G-udda vishaya,to the JSliatta Vamana (line 40) ,who was a son of Adityadeva and grandson 
of Vamana, and a student of the Taittiriya eharana, of the Harita gotra, and with the threefold pravara, Aiigirasa, Amt-arSsha2 and Yauvanasva. 
After the words dm svasti, the inscription opens with two verses, one of which invokes the protectionof the god gambhii (Siva), while the other glorifies the donor, here called the JtdjSndra MSdhavSndra. Verses 3-12 then give the genealogyof the donor* The first personage spoken of is Pulindasexxas famous amongst the peoples of Kallxiga.9 He, although endowed with many excellent qualities (a lofty stature, strong arms, a broad chest, etc.'), did not covet sovereignty for himself, bat rather worshipped Brahman, in order that the god might create a fit ruler of the land* And Brahman granted his wish, and created, anparenlly out of a rock, the lord Sailodbliava (verse 5), who became the founder of a AVii^T/.s^d family. In this family was born Banabhlta (verse 6) ; his son was the lord of the earth SainyafoMta (verse 7) ; in his family Yasobhita was born (verse S) ;his son again was SainyabMta (verse 9) ; and his son was the powerful and pious prince HMtavavarman (verses 10-12). Beyond 
the indication that these chiefs ruled in the country of Kalingas nothing of importanceis reported of any of them, Verse 12 is followed by the formal part of the granfcs the contents of \7hich have been given above, Here I would only add that the list of officials, in lines 31-33, is a fairly long one, and that it includes officials termed antaranga, vaifadsika, and jpattaldka, who are not met ivitla ordinarily. The formal part of the grant closes with the usual admonition not to disturb tie donee in the enjoyrr^er.t of the land granted to him, and is followed, in lines 42-493 by five of tlie customary benedictive and imprecatory verses. The second verse, and evidently the third, fourth and fifth too, are stated to he a quotation from the Law of Mann {Manava Dharma, line 44 t) B Another verse informs us that the grant was written by Upendrasiaglia, the son of Kiandabhogin, marked 3(?) by Jayaeinglia, and engraved by Esddifchcgir:. The inscriptioncloses with the statement that the d&taka for this grant iras the pratihdrin Q?.igabhacLra 
Tie inscriptionis not dated, and I have not found the Barnes of any of the chiefs ntnt:cned in it in other inscriptions ; nor am I able to identify the localities which are spoken of in this grant.

it is worded in every particular exactly like, the cos-er-r and cites the same yerses jts, t inscription of Bhojadeva, publishedin the Indian Antiqiiary ,Tol. VI. pp. 53-55. After two verses, glorifying the god Siva (Vy&rnakess, SraarsrAt:) and invoking >,; 3 blessings, Jayasiiiihadeva, described as stated above, gives notice (in lines 6-17) to all cttlc-i.'.> and to the resident Pttttaktl-i- s."d peopleof the villageof Bblma, which belonged to the Maktala village (group of) Fovty-Uvoiu the Purnapatliaka mandala, that, residing at Dnara, he grai.:..: 
the said villageof BMma up to its properboundaries (and inclusive of; the grass and past:;:-,. land, with the money-rent and share of the produce, with the ?:f>jr&^rz and irc!:id:r.~ all unvs. to the Brahmans of the pattasdld at the holy Amaresvara, for food and other purposes. An I (in lines 18-21) he commands the resident Patt&ldla and people to make over to the donees s.\\ due share of the produce, money-rent, and so forth, excepting what had been ?.--?'--.---- for gods and Brahiuiu.is ; and admonishes the rulers that may come after him, to assent to r.nd preserve the religions gift thus conferred. This formal part of the grant is followed : in lir.c- '21-28) by five of the customary benedictive and imprecatory verses. Line ~29 gives, in fcrur^ only, the date, the 13th of the dark lialf of Ac^adha of the year 1112, followed b;,- il;, words 9vayamt=Ajnd,'1 showingthat the order aboufc this grant was delivered to tie pfe :,j,!e concerned by the king in person, and by the words"bliss (and) good fortune." And t-K inscriptioncloses with the words :" This is the own sign-manualof the ilIusti-:--s Jaya simhadeva," which are also engraved (inline 15) at the bottom of the first plate.2 
I am unable to identify the village of Bhima, nor can I suggest any i?.c=t:i:-r.t--r far th Maktula village group of Forty-twoor the Purnapathaka mandala. AmaresvarE, wlr.,^ in a copper-plate inscriptionof Arinr.ararmadevaa is called Amargsvaratxrtha, is nee:- t-v 
islaiid of Mandhata, on the southern bank of the Narmada.4 As regards the "Srilir: : : ? or t_r.< place, in whose favour the cmiit was made, I do not know the meaning of the word fitr^-'J which is compounded with the word' ^hmn^bhi'ahin line 14 and can only s^t^tthat. similarlyto Irahtnapurt,it may denote an establishment provided by the kings labour :;,-. leai'ned and pious Brahmans. 
The date of the- grant, which must of course be referred to the Vikrama era, u-f-r:~r:?.t:J;- does not admit of verification,3 and all that can be said with confidence about it, is, that for the expired Ohaitrddi year 1112, its European equivalent would fall in A.D. 1O55, and for the expired Zarltft&Zi year 1112, in A.D. 1O56. 
The importanceof this inscriptionlies in this, that, with the date A.D. 1055-56.. Sr gives us the name of the (Paramara) king who was then rulingat Dhara, and <*f^whomnu mention has yet been found in other inscriptions," and that, since this king Jaynsi^_2.^era was. the successor of Bhojadeva, it furnishes a sure and fairlydefinite limit beyond whiCat.Le reign of Bh&jadeva cannot have extended. Accordingto both the stone "V/l"^?".

No. 8. CHIPLUN COPPEE-PLATE GBANT OF PULIKESIF II. BY J. . FLEET, I.C.S., Pn.D., C.I.B. 
This inscription -was first brought to my notice in 1884, by Pandit Bhagwanlal Indraji, who then had the original plates in his possession. It was his intention to publish* it; and a paper on it, written by him, was sent to the Secretary of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society: but it was afterwards lost, without being utilised. The impressions taken by the Pandit were indifferent; and, though his reading of the text had passed through my hands, I had not kept a copy of it. In 1889, however, I found the original plates themselves in the Society's library. And, as it seems unlikely that, after so long a time, the Pandit's paper will ever be recovered and published, I now edit the inscription from them. 
The plates, which -were obtained from a cultivator at Chiplftn, the chief town of the ChiplunTaluka of the Batnagiri District, are two in number, each measuring about lOf by 4f*. The edges of them were turned up, so as to form raised rims ; and, except for some letters that are quite worn away in line 1, and a few that are rather illegible near the beginning of line 2, the writing is well preserved throughout. The ring, on which the plates were 
strung, was accidentally destroyed by che cultivator who found them, in trying to clean them by the action of fire. Any seal that there may have been on the rmg, was destroyed at the same time The weight o the two plates is about 1 Ib. 15 oz. The enaracter* belong to the southern class of alphabets, and are of the regular type of the period to which the record belongs. The average size of the letters is a little over"The engraving is good,,and fairly 
I!-^ ?late* k^i; r^er thick, the letters do not show through on the reverse sides at all.

The plates are t&r$e in number* each measuring about Ilf*by 8%*. The edges of them were fashioned aotnewhat thicker than th inscribed portions, BO as to serve as rims to protect the writing 5 atida though the plates have been a good deal corroded by rmst, there are but very few letters which are not in a' perfectstate of preservation.^ The plates are strung on two rings* One of them is about J" thick 5 and, though now bent out of shape, was probably originally circular* about 2|" in diameter: it has been severed; but it shews indications of having been soldered tap, to make an actual ring. The other is about f*thick : part of it is roughly oval, measuring about 3f"by 2|r/j and it ends in two straight, pointed extremities^ which were intended for solderinginto a seal: the total length is about 5|", The seal is not forthcoming.

VANAPALLI OF   
Ho, 10. TAFAPALL1 PLATES OF ANNA-VEMA, SAKA-SAMVAT 1300, 
BY B. H-CLTZSCH, Pn.D. 
The originalof this inscription was"found by a workman wlille 0^2?^?.ting some earth la 
old site" in the village of VaxLapaUi in the AmaMpnram taluka of the Godavari district. find came to the notice of Mr. P. V. S, Gopalam, Pleader., Cocanada, who reportedit to the 
So-jperintendent, Archaeological Survey, Madras, on the 23rd May 1892. The plates were sixfosequently presented to Government by their owners Vissapragada Krislanayya, and are no~w deposited in the Madras Museum, 
The inscriptionis engraved on three copper-platesof 10| by 5| inches. The rims are 
slilg-litly raised for the protection of the -writing. The preservationof the platesis fairly good ; on jplates i.5, ii.5, and iii.a, some letters are partially eaten aimy by verdigris, The three plates ajre strung on a copper ring, which measures about 3f inclies in diameter, and about T7g inch iix thickness. It is nofc soldered and can be detached from the plates by bendingit asunder. Ij3Lstiad of tlie usual seal, tlio ring bears a well-carved recumbent figure of the sacred bull Ifondi, 
vrlxich is about 1-| inch long, and placed on a plain pedestal, The alphabet of the inscription is 3?6lngu9 and the language Sanskrit. With the exceptionof a few words in lines 1, 49, 
5S& 57 f. and 65, the whole of tbe text is in verse. The signatureof the kingat the end of the document is in the Telugn language. As regards orthography, the writer of the inscription o!Llows the same system which is observed in other inscriptions from the Telugn and Kla/narese countries. Thns3 dJidJi is written instead of ddh, if the letter dh is doubled either airfcer r (e.gr. in ardhdha for ardha, L 47) or through samdhi (e.g. in sidkdha for siddha,, 1. 21 3 a:o.ci ndhdJiaran for ^iddJiaran^ 1, 1). Similarly,cJiJicJiJi takes the place of clicJih (e.g. in ckdmara 
GJ&J&c'hJiatTa for chdmara-chchhattra, L 35 f.). The letters &, gs d, t9 d^ dh, and v are sometimes <ioixbled after an anusvdra (e.g. in laJnkka, 11. 483 52 and 61 ; amggana, L 50; gamdd, 1. 27 ; 
wimddam1;te~9 L S?; bamdhdht^ "1 26; and samvoatsara^ L 41). A superfluous anusvdra is soxo.etinies inserted before double wi9 before double n9 or before n followed bya consonant (e.g* in. Jmmmadi, II 42 and 52; Amnna for Anna, L 40; and sdmdmnya for sdrndnya,.1. 58), irregularities are, "branihma for brahma (L 56)? dhatnrmma for dliarma (L 58)y 
or sihvdsana for simMsana (11. 29, 30 and 38)5 pdlaniyya tarpdlantya (1. 59)a and 
for ucliyate (L 57), The unaspiratedletter takes the placeof the aspirate {&$<> 
txx jpaZa&a for phalakaf L 31, and Mma for lMmas L 34) ;the sonant the placeof the surd (e.g. in a,cl/ia for atha, 11. 49 and 58), and vice versa (e.g. in _pM!afor Widla^ 1. 7) ; and the dental n the place of the lingual n after r (in varnna for ar?aa, L 9? arnnava for arnava, L 25$ and fZr^^r^ja^tt for nirnaya, 1. 49). 
The plates record a grant by a member of the so-called Beddi dynastyof SoadaYidti/ a/ Ihlll-fort in the Narasarirupeta taluka of the Kistna district..2 The inscription opens -with. i:n.-voeations of Vishnu in his Boar-incarnation (verse 1), (janapati (v. 2), and the moon on ifbe head of Siva (Y. 3). It then refers to the creation of the world by Brahma at the command o "Vishnu (Y. 4), and to the fourth, (or Sfldra) which, like the river G-ang4, was produced from, the foot of Vishnu (v. 5). A member of this caste was king Prola (v. 6)9 TV Ixo must not be confounded with the Kdkat$ya kingof the same name.s His son was 
" ^Mng (v. 7), who built a flight of steps and a hall at Srisc&aTEi (v. 10), the well-known Sarva

(V, 5.) In this (world'}is victorious the fourth, caste* which was produced from the lotus-foot of Sauri (Vishnu)9 (and) whose sister, the river (GtangsL), purifies the (three) worlds by (her) threefold conrse. 
(V. 6.) From this (caste), as the moon from the ocean, sprang king- 3E?r6Ia,, the only protector of the*earth9 a treasury of knowledge, whose appearance always satisfied learned men, as that of the moon does the gods (whom she supplies with nectar). 
(V. 7*) In consequence of the good deeds (in former births') of this king Pr61a9 there was born (to him) an excellent son, called king "Vema, the virtuous chief of princes* (V, S.) While this righteous prince was ruling, the goddess of the Earth, witnessed great festivals and suddenly forgot the pain of her separation from king Harischandra and other (virtuous ancient kings).

(V. 11.) King "Fema*s son was king Anna-Vota, the greatness of whose valour was 
unequalled, who was deToted to the gifts (described by) Hmdri9 who was the husband of fche goddess of heroes, who ruled the whole earth 7 by means of the sword in (his) arm, and who ccn-ertel the three worlds into a single ocean by the streams of the flood of (his) fame,

(V. 13.) His younger brother (was) king Airna-VSma* (surnamed) Jaganofobagapda/ who was beloved by (the goddess of) Fame, (and) whose conduct on earth became a standard for those who are engaged in the practice of virtue (dharma), wealth (artha), and pleasure (Mma). * J^14!.^51!-,^"** iS Seated n the ^-tfcttne in (his) capital, the prosperous city ofKbjdaTi^hostile kiags, out of jealousy as ifc were, migrate to mountains which bear the lairs of very temble lions.10

1PIGRAPHIA INDICA. [VOL.   
OF 
Saka-Samat 1403* 
This inscription1 is engraved on the north, wall of the second pr&kdra of"the Saiva temple of Jambukesrora on the island of Sriraiigam near Iricliinopoly. It is referred to in Mr* lloore's Trickinopoly Manual (p. 341) and in Mr. B. Sewell's Lists of Antiquities (Vol. I. p* 287) as the only inscriptionin the Jambukesvara temple^-which contains a date in the Saka era. It consists of eightlines in modern Tamil characters, intermixed with a few worda and syllables in the Granfha alphabet. The language is very faulty Tamil. 
The :-ceriptien records the grantof one veli of land in the village of Vadakarai- "enkonkudi~ to the god of Tiriiv&naxkka^ The date of the grant was the day of MaMmgha which fell on Sunday, the fall-moon tithi of the month of Kumbha of Saka-Saiiivat 1403 expired^ the Plava samvatsara* Mr. Dikshit kindly informed the Editor that the European equivalentof this date is Sunday, the 3rd February, A*D. 1483* The donor was the great proYineialchief {maJidmandaUfa&ray !T41aka-"Kniay% aZia^ Akkalaraja, who bore the titles ol "a BMma among the Chdlas/* "a Vishnu among the Cfaola** {S&la-Ndrdyan)^ and "the lord of Uraiytir* the best of cities*' (Uraiy$r-]pUTaar~ddM tiara")* Though it is very doubtful if he had any real connection with the ancient indigenous dynasty of the ChSlas* he claimed at any rate to be their rightful successor ; and his name has been accordingly included in Dr* Hultssseh's preliminary list of Chola kings.5 His title mahdmandaU^vam suggests that he was a dependant* probably of one of the last kings of the first Vijayanagara

An edition of this inscription, or rather, of tliese fragments of two - 
oi the B&na Mng Vikramaditya II. has already been published by tlie Rev- T. Po*lke* Iiw&a .dnfcgttartf, Tol. XIII. pp. 6 ff. and in the Manual of the Sale***J>***cf,Vol. IL pp. 388 ff. For my revised text I have used excellent impressions receive5L :**cxm -Ur- nultzsca, to -whom the original plates, which are at TTdaydndiram, in the GKidiy&**** talukft of the North Arcot district, were lent by the Acting Collector of the district!, UWC*"- JF. A. Nicholson, I.C.S. 
The copper-plates are four in number. Three of them, the first of which is inscribed on one side only, are the first, second, and third plates of a grant of whiolx -fcl* concluding part is missing. And the fourth plate, which, like the second and third plates, is inscribed on botk sides, is an odd, probablythe third, plate of another grant,of which botlx the "beginning and tb* end are missing. Each plate measures about 8f" broad by 3 Ty high,, and ail Bve raised tin* to protect the writing. The odd plate closely resembles the others, the only -difference being that the ring-hole is about \" nearer to the right margin than in the other jplffctes. The plates are held together by a ring, about 4J" in diameter. This ring, which. is CXL*, holds a circular seal, about 2* in diameter. The seal bears in relief a recumbent bull, wfaiola faoes the proper right, reclining on an ornamental pedestal, and having a lamp on each sicle. -At the topis a parasol between two clumiis. The engraving is good, and the writingT. almost throughout in a perfect state of preservation. The size of tHe letters is betrweexx -* and ^*. Ti* characters are Grantfaa, with the exception of the Tamii word pugafar&pj&a-var (Plate iii., 
line 39), which is written in Tamil characters.1 As a photo-lithograplx of fclie inscription * published herewiiih, I need not attempt a detailed description of the <3rsEtn.i;liJft. characters ; "bat I may state that I have found it difficult to distinguish between the stii>enrsoarpt* and I, wMci recognise in the impressions the superscript r of conjunct consonants.-Tbe language is Sa 
in the original are very similar to each other; and that also more than, onese I have failed to krit. Of the inscription on plates i-iii. lines 1-44, excepting the introdTiofcoary twuti M{$$t atfs in verse, and lines 45-51 in prose. lane 1 to nearly the middle of line 13 of the odd plt give the verses in lines 32-44 of the other plates, while the remaining' lines contain a pr passage which diiers from the corresponding passageat the end of ;pla/fce iii. As regnnl* orthography, attention may be drawn to the promiscuous use of the letters t and d, t being employed eighteen times instead of A, and A six times instead of t j to -fclie employment of tin conjunct tsh instead of Jcah, which occurs five times; to the incorrect -n.se of fche Grantlm flail m instead of the omndra at the end of words; and to the frequent omission of the s% d vuarga. In respect of grammar, it may be pointed out that line 5 of plate i. contains tfc wrong word matUtum-manas (for matWu-manas, which would not have suited the metre). i'iii> C0ntain ae ^amencement of an inscription which rocoaraed a

8* VijayabShu Vikramftditya H., who is stated to have been a friend .of a certain Epishnarftja (L 43). 
The odd plate contains part of an inscription which recorded a grant made by the same ifc favour of some Brahmana ; and this existing portion of it gives the genealogyof the commencing with Prabhumerudeva. 
These inscriptions are not dated, bnt they may be assigned with some confidence to about middle of the 12tb centary A.D. 5 for Dr. Hultzsch has shown that the king BaaavidyS of the above list probably lived during the first half of the llth century of our era, fcecause he married a grand-daughter of the Ganga king Srvamahar&ja, whom Dr. Hultzsch has to have reigned between AJX 1000 and 1016.2 
The place TTdayendTimangala, mentioned in the above, has already been identified by Mr. Ifaira3 with Udayendiram, where the plates are now preserved.

Hail ! Prosperity! 
(Terse 1.) May that 8iva promote your well-being, whose true nature even the cannot fully reveal, from whom the creation, the preservation, and the destruction^of the worlds proceed, on whom the devotees meditate, (and) whose two feet are tingedwith. collections of red rays of the rows of jewelsin the diadems of the crowds of the chiefs Of the gods who in person bow down before him ! 
(V. 2*) May that ET&rftya^a, whose body ever rests on the lord of serpents, (and) wto^e two feet are worshipped by crowds of gods, guard you! He, whom the gods and Asrus, desirous of churningthe matchless sea of milk, discarding the Mandara laid hold of,* it were, to obtain a second time the nectar of immortality, (and) who then shone, even more ordinarily, as if he were the Aftjana mountain !l 
(V. 3.) There was the regento the Asnras, named Bali, whose sole delightit engagein acfcs of .violence towards the gods, while his one vow was, to worshipthe two feet of iva. He/ after having presentedas an excellent sacrifice a respectful offering to primeval god, the enemy2 of the Daityas, with great joy (also) gave to him who bore form of a dwarf the earth with its islands and with all things movable and immovable. 
(V. 4.) From him spranga mighty son, a treasure-house of good qualities, whom was ever increasing the great pure favour of Sambhu on whose head are the lines of tl&e lustre of a portionof the moon, Bana, the foe of the gods, who with his sword struck the forces of his enemies* 
(V. 5*) As the cool-rayed moon rose from the sea of milk, so was born in his lineage BfinMMr&ja, who, possessedof never-failing might, with his sharp sword cut ttp His enemies in battle. 
(V. 6.) When Bfin&dliirja and many other B&na princes had passed away, there ^roas born in tMs (lineage), not the least (of Us members), Jayanandivarman, the fortune of viotcxry incarnate, and an abode of fortune. 
* 7.) This unique hero o great might ruled the land to the west of the country, like a bride sprung from a noble family unshared by others, having his feet ting-ed by the crest-jewels of princes. 
(V. 8.) From him was born his son Vijay&ditya, who scattered hosts of 
(and) before whom the enemies, seized vith great fear, did not stand on the field of battle. (V, 9.) From him sprang a son whose arm was skilled in cutting up all 
a source of never-waning merit and fame, who to womankind was like the god of love, illustrious MMLadSva, who was the uniquewrestler of the world (JagadfikamsUa). (V* 10.) As Ham begat the six-faced (K&rttikya) on P&rvati3 so he begat on his an incomparable, prosperous, and prudent son who completelyscattered multitudes of enemies*- the Illustrious Bnavidy&dham> whose pure fame became an excellent cTiawl for the ea:rs& the elephants of the quarters, (and) whose two feet were an object of adoration for princes,. 
1 The meaning apparently is, that KMyana (Visfcnu), when worshipped by tlie gods and Asuras, grant neetar of immortality even more readily and abundantly than was the case at the churning of the oeea*i. meaas of the nsoiiEtain Mandara. The words Ihfy&smritaty^&ptayS in the second half of the verse mast: In opinionbe connected with the words of the first half; compare the similar position of fr4&mana*r&piQ& irr uexfe verse.

(V, 11.) His son was Prablxiundruddva^ who drore away all enemies, whose mind was intent on the four branches of knowledge,1 who was refined, a source of the fame of irresistible valour, full of energy, and free from fault and sorrow. 
(V. 12*) From him sprang a son of matchless fortune, named VikramSditya^ "before whom the hosts of adversaries bowed down, (and) whose great renown waa widely spread ; a man of refinement, who was the chief of the families of princes, (and) whose .mind was fixed on the two lotus-feet of the lord of P&rvatl

These are two odd copper-plates, marked on their "first sides with, the Tamil 2 and 5, and inscribed on both sides. Each plate measures about 9f" broad by 2|-" high, ax*-*! lias on the proper right a ring-hole, about -/g-'' in diameter. There is neither a ring nor a sea.l a*nd fairly well, and the writing, with one or two insignificant exceptions, is well preserved.--Tlw 
the plates are now tied together with a string. The engraving, though not very regular, is clone size of the letters is between Ty and T%". .The characters are Grantha. The iang-ixaSis Sanskrit ; and the text on both plates is in verse. In respect of orthograptiy I need only notice the doublingof a consonant before y and v in vibftdttyai, plate ii. line 1, GarudaddhvajS, plate ii. line 9, and maddhyamd, platev. line 11. As- regards the language, the most note'woa.-tliy point is that the author in line 1 of plateii. undoubtedly wrote trai, instead of irayt-wlticlt does not suit the metre.

Plate T. records that, -when the lord of princes (ox- Icing) Vira-Ch6|a was ruling the earth, his spiritual guide Nila advised him to make a g-x-ant in favour of some Brahmans; that Vira-Ch&a then went to the Ohola rtder ParakSsarivajrnaan and asked leave to bestow on the Brahmans a village in his own territory which he pr-OJaaiHed to name after Parakesaiivarman ; and that, having got the necessary permission, lie garo the villageof Paxakeaarichaturvgdimangala, situated between the river KavSrl and a,xxot.li.er, small river, to a hundred and fifty (Brahmans). 
I cannot say anything definite about the Chola ruler BaraksaaAvarman axxa the subordinate prince Vira-CMla,2 mentioned in this inscription; nor am I able to identify the village of Parakesarichatarvedimangala.

By E. HULTZSCH, PH.D. 
TMs inscripfcion has been already drawn attention to by Mr.. G.. Mackenzie in his p. 214, and by Mr. R. Sewell in his Lists of Antiquities,Vol. I, p. 54. It is on three faces of a stone pillar in front of the Duxg&mbft temple at eanap6vexmin, a ne Talagada-Diyi in the Bandax (MasnHpatam) t&lokA of the Kistna district. Tho arae pillar bears four other, later inBcriptions, *fe. one at the bottom of the east 11,0**J dceaft the mscnption of Ganapati, and three others on the north face, which tad beam loft by the engraver of the Ganapati inscription.

Tailapadeva, and G^vinda-Daagul&ia, and re-instated Chddddaya (v* 6). 
The same four contemporaries of Prdla are referred to IB. the Aumakonda inscription, where* however, Mantena-Grurida is called Ghinda, the lord o tlie city of Maatarakiita. TailapadTa has been already identiEed by Dr. Fleet with, the Western Chalakya king Taila HI. 
Cti6d6dayais mentioned four times in the Anmakonda inscription. Line 32 f* of that inscription reads as follows :" Then he (Prola), who had easily plunderedhis (Udaya's) dominions in warfare, gave the kingdom (back) to king TJdaya.** Verse 6 of the Ganap&svaram inscription shows that TJdaya is here meant for Chodddaya. In lines 65 to 71 of the Anmakonda 
inscription, we are told that king Citododaya died oat of fear of Prola's successor* Budra. According to line 104 f. Budra burnt the city of Chddodaya* In line 107, Budra is called "the onlyresort of PadmS (or Lakshmi) who arose from the womb of the glittering milk ocean of the race of Kand.ur6daya-Ch6daJ" TJdaya-Ohidiia is evidently a transposed, but synonymousform of Chddodaya. Further, I suspect that PadmS has to be taken as the actual name of Chod6daya*s daughter, whom Budra married for political reasons, though ha 
* 
her father and destroyed his city. Finally, Kandiira appears to haTe been 
caused the death of 
the name of Chddddaya's capital. According to Dr. Oppert1 "there are in the Nizftm's territory and the neighbouringdistricts many placescalled Kandiiru." But I am mot in a position to say which of these is to be identified with Kaiidiira. 
By his wife MuppaladSvi, or, as she is called in the Anmakonda inscription, Muppamadevi, Prdla had two sons, Budra and MahMva (v. 7). Budra succeeded his father on the throne (v. 8). He is said to have settled the inhabitants of towns which he haddestroyed,^at drafigaXLtt2( Worangal) and to have established on the sites of those towns new colonies, in which he built templesof Rudrdsvara (v. 9). Bndra was sncceeded by (Ms brother) MaJbJtdeva (v. 11), whose son by BayyamfoiiA was Gtanapati (v. 12). 
Verses 15 to 43 describe the descent of one of Ganapati's officers, the general J&ya or Jayaaa. The first person named is Bhima (I.) of the race of Ayya (v. 16), who resided at Kroyytirus in the country of Velanandu* (v. 17). His three sons by BachylLmbika, Jiila, Nar%ana (L), and Sftraya, were in the service of king Chodi (v. 18).Jilla defeated a certain KannaradSva and received in acknowledgmentof this deed the dignityof general from the king (v. 19). At the command of king CJiddi, the second brother, Harayana (I.), 
fortified Dvlpa, i.e. Talagada-Divi, which is fabled to have been created by the god Knvem <V 20 L). He also constructed tanks and templesat Dvipa and at Vadlakurrn (vv. 23-25). He received from king CH6di the lordship over Dvipa and theGo^tm villasand the fatie of general (v. 26 1)- The foar sons of 3*4r%ana (I.) by KfaftmU (L) were GWtf Blnma (IL) Pinna-Chodi, and Bramma <v. 28). They served in the army of the kmg who was the lord of the CHoda country"(v. 30). This king appearsto be identical with, or a <^*>^previou8ly mentioned king Cfcodi (vv. 18, 20, 27). He may be also connected withChodo^m 
IKrAmU (EL) and Peram^mb4, and three sons, Prxtkva, Jajaor Jayana, a*d 
I identical with >. distaat Krtd^ which is the headquartersof a tilaM of the

(II*) (v. 32). At this time (the Kikatiya) king Gtanapati, who had defeated the of Chdla, Kaiifiga, Sevana,1 Elarn&ta, and LUts* conquered the country of Velan&ncht together with I>vipa (v, 34). Having taken to wife ISTarama and Perama (i.e. N&ramba II. and PemmamM of Terse 32),lie took their younger brother J&ya or Jayana into his service (Y* 36 f.) and appointed Mm general (v. 38). J&ya had, on a previous occasion, defeated a certain VaJiigodlilimsgliaratta (Y. 41). 
The immediate objectof the inscription is to record that the general J&ya btult at IMpa a templeof Siva, which he called Ganap&svara or Qranapatisvara in honour of his patron, ki^gf Ganapati (v. 44 f.), and tie name of which survives to the present day in the hamlet of G-axiapfisvaram* The date of the consecration of the temple was the tithi of Q-aurl in the bright fortnightof Vaisakiia of the S&ka year 1153, which corresponded to tlie cyclic year Khara (v. 45), I am obliged to Mr, DiksMt for the following remarks on this date : 
" The goddess Ganii is supposed to have "been born on the fonrth tithi of Jyaishtha, but is considered as the regent of the third tithi. Consequently, the"tifhi of G^nrf"might bemea( nt for the third or fourth tithi. Observances in honour of G-anr! are enjoined on both the third and the fourth tithi of some of the twelve months. One of these observances commences on tie Ctaitra Sukla tritiyd and ends on the Yaigakha uUa trirtyd. This tiiihi ended in Saka Samvat 1153 expired, the Khara samvatsara, on Monday, th.0 7th. April, A*D, 1281^ at 11 gK> IQp., and Vaisakha 4uO& chaturtht ended on Tuesday, the 8th April, at 7 gh. 13 p. Ujjain 22*caG-tiine.** 
The TelGgu portion of the inscription (lines 121 to 135)s records that certain dues had to be by every boat touching at K"angega4da to the temple of G-anapatisvara at Bivi,3 and that Jtyapa-lfyaS:a (i.e. J&ya or Jayana of the Sanskrit portion) assigned the revenue of a number of Tillages to the same temple, and granted twenty-five eows> the milk of which to fee used for supplying ghee to a perpetual lamp.

A*n abridged Englishtranslation of this Inscription based on a copy from the collection of Colonel Colin Mackenzie,1 was published by Mra Gordon Mackenzie in the Manual of the District, p* 13 f. The originalis engraved on four faces of a pillar in the village of Yersniadtele. in the Gnnt&r talnka. of the Kistna district** The pillar is now lying1 in tlie of Yeniigdpala. Before its removal to this place of comparative safety* tie villagers it for grinding ehtmnam on it. This objectionable practice lias led to the destruction of a considerable portion of the inscription. Th first and second faces, which. Tbear an insertion in the Telngu alphabet and the Sanskrit langtiaga, are somewhat worn* but still Of the third face, however, which, as the published vevsion of Colonel Maoken2sie's sii0wst formerly contained the first half of a long passage in the Telugu alphabet and only the first seven lines are now visible* while tfaa remaining lines are worn sraootlij the exceptionof one, two, or three letters at the beginning* aiad at the encl, of esaelx line* The fourth ace3 which contains the end of the Telugn portion^ and three other Telngu irs^rlpticns o slightly later dat% is again in tolerably good preservation. .

After fihe death of B&ta (v. 16), Ms widow devoted herself to pious works. She placed golden pinnacles on the shrine of Amaafdsva^ra at 3rf-DMny&iikapura (Amar&vati) and built "in this city/* *.. probably at Yenauaadala, a temple of Siva, which she called Btfcgsvsra after her deceased husband (w. 17 to 19), and to which she allotted the revenue of the village of BenadaTl (v. 20), At Sri-DhanyaAkapura (v. 21), she built another temple of Siva, whfeh she called <^ap6svam after her father, king Ganapa (v* 23), and granted to 
this temple the village of CMntapMu (v. 24). Of the three temples which are mentioned in connection with Gaoap&mb&, the first, Amarsvara, still exists at Amar&vatl2 The second, B6tgvara9 cannot now be traced at Yenamadala* I do not know if the third, GanapSSvara, still exists at Amar&vati, 
As regards, the Telugn inscription on the pillar, the first of them, which occupies parts of the third and the fourth faces/ is a continuation of the Sanskrit inscription on the two preceding faces. This follows from the contents of the preserved portion on the fourth face, and from the abridged English translation of the third face in the Kistna Manual. At the topof the mutilated third face, some of the titles of the queen are still preserved. The only remarkable on among these titles, which the queen appears to have inherited from her deceased husband Bta and Ms ancestors, and are accordinglyin the masculine gender, is : 8rimat-Trinayana*PalUm^ vQ{?y&ty&^&&%-da1t8lw ;"the lord of a district of six thousand (villages) on the southern (bank) of the river obtained through the favour* of the glorious Tri^ayanarallaVa,w The abridged translation supplies the date 
the sa&vatwra, wMch is now lost In the original, but wMch there Is no reason to distrust, as fie cyclic year Saumya actually corresponds to the year 1172 (A.D. 1249-50). It follows from this date that Gana,p&mb& erected the pillar during the lifetime of her father Gautapati, whose inscription in the :kftmxanftfha temple afe is dated on he 8th Jane, A.D, 1249, and who appears to have in Saka-Samvat 118X4 On the fourth face wo are told, IB Telngu, that, "having set up the god (the queen) granted, in order to procure prosperity to her father, 
for the requirements {angarangabhoga) of that god, for as long as the moon and the SUB endure, the Tillage of Cftintapalli." The insertion of ends with a lists of the /**. ^ Vol. XXL p. 107. Mr. BeweflM ZM, of 4M&tte, Voi L p. 6S f. toad &adiia-Xri*&v<i> 4 Ins9^^Vole XXI-^ *Iffl

servants of the temple of Ganap^Faraf and of the extent of the stares of the Yillag-e were allotted to each of them, ChimtapalH is evidently another form, of ChiatapSdu, the Tillage whicii was granted to the G&smp&ivam temple accordingto Terse 24 of the Sanskrit portion. It may be identified with the modem CMatapaUe in the Sattenapaile tiluM,1 which is about 16 miles distant to the W.J5T.-W. from AmarHvati, the residence of GanapatnMs and which accordingly may have been included in her dominions. 
The four remaining Tolmgu inscriptions which the pillar contains^ are the following : 
A* On tJie fourth face. 
Kb* 1. An undated grant of 25 cows by K6tadd]varajn* The milk of these cows was to be used for the preparation of ghee for a lamp in the temple of Bdtdsvaara, No. 2* A grant of a herd of sheep for a lamp in the temple of Betd^vam, Date: SakaYarsha 1192 [expired] ,the PramSda mmvatsara,, Pnshya Buddha 13, Friday, 
B. On the fourth and first faces. 
3. -A grant of 2[5] Buffalo-cows to the temple of BStSsvara. Date : Sakavarsha 11[9]6 [ezpired]s the Bhava mmvatsara,} Asvaynja ^IddhaJ 1. 
O. On the second face. 
4* An undated, apparently recent inscription, which records that in Enumancial&~ stfaala (i.e, ihe village of Tenamadala) and in ihe sixty villages connected with Banroandala, temples and BrShmanas are exempt from taxes (sunkfya). 
The last of these fonr inscriptions supplies an earlier form of the modern name Tenamadala ; and ihe three former ones, whadh record gifts to the local Saiva temple of BetSsvaara, suggest that this temple originally contained the pillar on which they and the inscription of Ganap&mM are engraved* As previously remarked, the B&tegvara temple, which was founded by Ga^ap&mM, cannot at present be traced in the vfllage of Tenamadala. Another possibility remains, e&. that the words "in this city** in verse 17 refer to the preceding word rf DMny&okapTtra. In this case the temple of BStSsvara would have to be looked for at Amarivati ; and it would have ta be ass-omed tihat the pillar was removed from Amaravat! to Tenamadala at any time between the date of the Telngu inscription No. 3, and the date of the modern Telugu inscription Mb. 4. As, however, it is extremely unlikely that anybody should have conceived the -idea of transporting a heavy stone piilar all the way from Amaravati to Tenamadala, 1 prefer to adopt the previous alternative, vfa. that the temple of B&tesvara* originally contained the pillar, was located at Tenamadala*

No. 17. PAITHAN PLATES OF GOVINDA III. 
SAEA-SAMVAT 716. 
BY F. KIELHOBK, PE,D., C.I.E. ; GOTTINGEN. 
This record is now brought to notice for the first time. I edit it from excellent ink-impressions, made by Dr. Fleet from the original plates, which belong to Tifkam Eai T&tyi K&sar Set, a resident of the well-known Paithfin, the ancient Pratishthana, on the GodAvarS, in the Nizam's DominionB, lat. 19 29' N., long. 75 28' E. 
The plates are three in number, each measuring from 13^* to 13" long, by from 8* to 81" broad at the ends, and somewhat less in the middle. The edges of them were fashioned thicker, so as to serve as rims to protect the writing ; and the inscriptionis mostly in a state of excellent preservation. But the surface of the second side of plateii. was not made properly smooth for engraving,as the other surfaces were. The result is a good deal of confusion, caused by numerous markings in the copperitself. And the difficulty of dealing with this part of the inscription is enhanced by the fact that, in the lower lines of this plate and in ihe first line of plate iii., the record has been seriously tempered with, for the purposeof reducing the number of grantees from seven to four. The ring on which the plates are strung is circular, 
about JJ' thick and 3* in diameter. It had not been cut when the grant came into Dr. Fleet's hands. The seal (see the Plate at page 104), into the socket of which the ring is soldered, is roughly circular, about If"in diameter. In, relief on a countersunk surface, it has a representation, of Garuda, squatting, and facingfnll-front ; his hands are joined, palm to palm, on the chest, and are turned upwards ;his feet are joinedsole to sole, and are turned downwards ; and the marks at each side denote his wings. The seal is practically identical with the seals of the Samangad grantof Dantidurga (Ind. Ant. Vol. XL p. 112, Plate), and of the Old-Kanarese grantof Govinda III. (ibid, p. 126, Plate). But it is a much better specimen, and shows the details far more clearly. Below the Garuda there is a floral device, apparently an expanded water-lily; he is probably supposed to be seated on it. The weight of the three platesis 357* tolas, and of the ring and seal, 55i ; total, 413 tolas. The engraving is good, bold, and fairly deep; but, the plates being substantial, the letters do not show through on the reverse eides. The interiors of them show, as usual, marks of the working of tne engraver'stool. The characters are Nagar!. Here and there they are drawn rather carelessly, so that, especially in the case of proper names, it is not always possible to say what exactly may be intended. In general, the forms of the letters are the ordinary ones of the periodto which the inscription belongs; but the signfor the conjunct ry, which occurs in the word Ttdryd in line 64, is -quite unusual, and is apparently a remnant of an earlier form of the Nagarl alphabet.* The averagesize of the letters is a little less than

seve^bat, as stated before, the inscription has here been seriously i^pered with ITSpurpose of reducing tins number to four, aad, perhaps, in order to substitute, at least in one 
was 
case, another name for the one which was originally engraved. Of each of the grantee* the mscnption gave not only, the father's name and the gtora and Tedic school which he belonged but also the place of resxdence. Bnt, with the exception of Pratishth^a which occurs in line 48, the names of these places are either altogether illegible, or so i*c*i-c*that thev mnot be read withcadence.The gtora. mentioned are those of Vatsa, Par^ra, Vasiahtha, Saiteha (?), Harlta (?), .and K&iyapa; the Vedic schools those of the Y4iins or Va^asanerin* Bahvrichas, Taittirlyas, and Mfidhyamdinas. Lines 63-72 contain the usual afco^-'rt to 
protect the donees in the enjoyment of this grant, and quote fire of the customary beaedictive and imprecatory verses; and the concluding line 73 gives the names of the dtitaka and of the writer of the grant, both of which are so carelessly written thai I am unable to say what they are. The date of the inscription- the new-moon titM of the dark half of Taisakha of Saka- Samvat 716 corresponds, .for Saka-Samvat 716 expired and the am&nta Taisakha, to the 4th May, A.D. 794, when there was a total eclipse of the sun which was visiMe in India, at 3 h 48 m. after mean snnriae. It is, so far as I know, the earliesfc date from a genuine inser^cs of India proper whieh shows the amdnta scheme of the lunar farinigiis : and it is ten y^rs earlier than the oldest date3 which has been hitherto available for the reign of Gcrindara'a in. With the exception of Prai^hthana, itself, I am unable to identify any of the places mentioned in i/his inscription.

The inscription,after the words'Oih, om, adoration to the Dv&rajV a verse glorifying Bfiavftn^ who is here named Dviraja; and Its proper is, to (in Terse 17) tlie foundation of a temple of that goddess % AnaTitaieTO, the chief of the Mng Simlia (or Smghana). It clearly*divides Itself Into two parts : 2-7 give an accoiint of Anantadeva and Ms ancestors, which Is Interesting from a point of -view, while verses 8-15 glorify th king Simha and Ms father and grandfather. 
belonged to a family which, traced its origin to the Sandilya (v. 2). ID that family the:re was bora, as a son of a certain Mandratli&j the learned MalTesvara (V. S) who (in v. 4)is stated to liave composed a Karana of the planets, entitled Gkhara, a called PraUsTitJidvidhi-dipaka^ another work described as PJiala-grantha^ a brief commen tary on the IjaffTiujdtaka* His son was Sripati (v* 5) ; tod Ms son3 (v. 6). And Ganapatl's son was the founder of the temple, (v* 7), a scholar versed in the three branches of the Jyotfsha-tdstra, who expounded the 20th Adtyayaf called ChJtandafcJritv uttar-ddhydya,1 of Brahmagnpta's Brahma-SphutasiddJidnta^ also the great JETord (Ce. the Brihajjdtaka) of Varahamihira. The family here treated of was already known to us from the Patna inscriptionof Singhana,2 which also mentions Mao^6ratha and his son MahSvara, the fatter of tlie astronomer Bhaskara, wlio must have been a brother of the Sripati of this inscription. Of tlie literary works enumerated above, tlie published catalogues of Indian libraries actually mention, as still existing, MahdSvara's Xtaghujdtzka-tlkdi and probably also his 
The descriptionof the king Simha (SingTiana) and of bis father and grandfather,, Jaitrapfila and BMUamaj in verses 8-15 of our inscription,is in general purely conventional, and the only historical facts recorded of tbem are, that Jaitrap&a,& an ocean of compassion, made Ganapati^ whose life bad been preservedin battle,4 lord of the Amdlira country*(v. 12), and that Simha defeated the powerful Arjims (v. 14). BotK evente are mentioned* partlyin the same words, also in tbe Paithan copper-platesof Ramacliandra5 of Saka-Samvafe 1103, from which we learm that Jaitngi (JaitrapMa)?*an ocean of compassion/ led Ganapati oai of prison and made him lord of the land, meaniBgs apparently, the land of Tnkaliiigu. The prince Arjiroa, spoken of in connection with Sixziha, Dr. Bhandarkar 6 would identify with Arjuna[varmadeva] of Malava, whose published copper-plate grantsare dated in the Vikrama years 1267, 127O and 1272.? 
Verses 16-18 state that, duringthe reignof Simlia, Ansntad^ra* who had obtained the post of chief astrologerof the king, founded the temple,at or sear which this inscription was afterwards put up ; and that he received pecuniaryassistance in this work from his younger brother Mah&fivara, who composedthis Pratasti* Verse 19 contains the usual prayerfor the preservation of the temple, and the poem closes (inr v. 20) with the data, the first day of Chsitra of tlie expired Saka year IM45 the year A line in prose adds that the inscription was written by the N%ara Brahmana and that the B&radhdra or architect (probatly of the whole temple) was ThaljL 
The date does not admit of exact verification; hut the expired Saka year 1144 (==A.D. 1222-23), by the southern lani-solar system, was the Jovian year CMtrabhinn, as in the inscription,

.? and wMch is dated in Saka-Samyat 1261, the Vikrama samvatsar (~ A.D. 1340).1 Of Mm the Bitragunta grant of Samgama II, says that he defeateds *tke Sulf&a^2 In his Lists of Antiquitiest VoL II. p. 161, Mr Sewell refers to a Hindu confederation, of which the Baya of Vijayanagara formed a party, and which<c with an immense force drove the Muhammadans out of Orangal*' in A.D. 1344, Though we hare no inscription of Harihara I. as late as A.D. 1344, it is not impossible that he was the R&ya of Vijayanagara who joined the confederation, because the earliest inscription of his younger brother Bukka I. is dated in Saka-Samvat 1276s( A.D. 1355). BAkka I. is representedin two inscriptions as a Mahdmandalegvara ruling in the BCoysana country. 4 Perhaps this statement furnishes a cine to the origin of the Vijayanagara kings.It may be that they were originally feudatories of the Hoysala Mugs. After the utter defeat of the Hoysala king BalMla HE. and the demolition of his capital Dvarasamudra by the Muhammadans in the year 1327 A.D.5 he evidently continued the semblance of a kingdom,; for there are inscriptions dated in Saka-Samvat 1262 (= A.D, 1340) 9 which refer themselves to his reign,at Erode in the Coimbatore district6 and at Tiruvannamalai in the South Arcot district/ and one dated as late as Saka-Samvat 1265 (= A.D* 1342) at WMtefield in the Bangalore district.8 It would therefore appear that BaMla III. left Harihara I. in the north as a check to the Muhammadan invaders, who had ousted him in A.D. 1327, His subordinate evidently took advantage of the opportunity to create a principalityfor himself and eventuallyto assert his independence. The only epigraphical record of Harihara I. makes no reference to Ballakt IEL as overlord, nor does it furnish any cine as to the extent of the dominions owned by Harihara I* It is during the time of Bukka I* that the capital Vijayanagara first makes its appearance.9 There is reason to believe that the Muhammadans continued to be troublesome duringthe reign of Bukka I* as well.10 It was during the time of Bukka's son Hariliara H. that the kingdom became firmly established. This is shown by the fact that he could turn his energiesto extend his dominions in the south, or rather to recover possessionof the provinces which were probably once subjectto BalMla III. 
The exact date of the accession of Hari3iaa?a n.f in whose reign the subjoined inscription is dated, is not known. He must have ascended the throne between Saka-Samvat 1293 and ISO!*11 From this as well as from other inscriptions12 we learn that he was the son of Bukka I. by his queen Gtaurl. In the Satyamangalam platesof Dvaraya II. we are told that Harihara's queen was HaiamMk.13 His inscriptions have been found at Hampe or Vijayanagarain the Bellary district ;14 at Belurs15 Chitaldroog,16 Harihar r and Hassan 1S in the

10 According to Mr. Sewell (.Lists of Antiquities, YoL II. p. 163), two attacks were made by the Muhammadans about this time on Vijayanagara,the first ia 1&S5-66 and the second in 1378 AJD. The first attack was successful, but in the second the leader was eventually compelled to retire.

Gold and copper coins, apparently issued duringthe reignof Harihara II., still exist. In Ms paper on the Qoin$ of the Kings of Yyayanagara,1 Dr. Hultasch describes a half-pagoda and a copper coin. A second copper coin is described in his paper on South-Indian Copper Coins? On all of them the legend reads Pratdpa-JSarihara* 
Of the birudas of the king mentioned in lines 38 to 50 of the subjoined inscription, the most important are : KarndtaTGa-lakshm%-karn-dva&ayhsa9 Sdrdula-mada-b7ia7ijawa,s YedtA'hAshya'pra'kdSaka and Vaidika~mdrga~sthdpan-dchdrya. The first shows that lie was ruling over the Karnta country^ and the second that he professed to have conquered the Cli61ass who had the tigerfor their emblem. The biruda VedabJidshya-pvaJcdsaka clearly refers to the commentaries on the VMas, which were published under the king's authority by SyanacMrya. This celebrated Vedic scholar professes to have been the minister of Samgama II. and of Harihara, ILS The biruda Vaidika-mdrga-stfidpan-dchdrya of the inscription correspondsto Vatdfika-mdrga-pravartaka,, which is attributed to Hariliara (II.) ixi tlie colophon of 3%"ana's commentary on the SatapatTiabrdhmana^ In his Oxford Caf,a,logue Professor Aufrecht describes a manuscript of the TarkabhdsJid-prakd&kd. From its coloph.cn we leam that the work was composed by a certain Chinnabhatta, who was the son of Vislmiidevaradliya, the younger brother of Sarvajfia, and a dependant of 
Professor Aufrecht tells us elsewhere that Sayana's teacher was Visfantx-Sarvajfia.6 This SarvajBa was very probably identical with the elder brother of Chinnabhatta, and tte Harihara-Mah^raja of the colophon of the Tarka&hdshd-prdkdiikd with Harihara II.'Some of the details furnished by Madhava's and Sayaiia's works 7 regarding their relations and con temporaries are corroborated by a mutilated Grantha inscription of the AraI,la-PerTiKia|. temple at Conjeeveram,8 which, with the permission of Dr. Hultzsch, I subjoin,9"as far as it* can be made out :

The date of the subjoined inscription (verse 18) is not quite intelligible. The meaning of the syllables gotradtacha (1. 51) is not apparent ; nor can the occurrence of the word tidhau (i.e- *t&a) in the same line after PramAdini be explained, as the word occurs afterwards (L 5^ in its proper place. Leaving these two obscure words aside, the date is Wednesday the day of a lunar eclipse in the month of of the cyclic year JPramMin, which wal current after the Sliv,Im S&ka year 18L Mr. BiksMt, to whom I subletted tMs date for 
calculation, has favoured me with the following remarks : The pdrnimd of adluka (into*- calary) Klrttika of Saka-Sainvat 1321 expired, ended on a Wednesday'at 27 gh. 20 p. Ujjain mean-time. Its European equivalent is the 15th October^ AJD. There was a lunar eclipse on tMs day, as mentioned in the inscription, and, consequently, the above date must be intended in it, though the word adhfka (intercalary) does not occur. There is a method by the application of which and by making calculations from the First AryorSiddhdnta, this month is likely to prove an ordinary (not intercalary) month. The eclipse mentioned was visible for a short time after sunset over almost the whole of India*" 
According to verse 19, the place at wMch the grant was made by the king, was the shrine of the god Virupakeha on the Bhaskara-ksh^tra at a quarter of the city of Vljayana gara. Pampa is the Sanskrit equivalent of Hampes the Kanarese name of one of the villages which now occupy the site of the ruins of Vijayanagara, The shrine of Viriipaksha, r Fampa pati, is even now situated in the centre of the village of Hampe? Prom the present inscription we learn that that portion of Pampa or Hampe, on which the temple of Virfipaksha is built, bore the name Bhaskara-kshStra. 
The donees of the subjoined inscription were two Brahmana brothers? [Aujbhala and Jfrisiiiiha, who belonged to the Bharadvaja gotra and appear to have studied the Yajurveda. The object of the grant was the village of Kallfixi (r. 23) or Brinalliir (v. 29), wHch was also called Savanarajiyap-firain (v. 25), The village was situated in Megim-*valaaifidns which was also called H"alatiiriplem-sim and formed part of Paiyiiri-kotta^ a district of the Chandragm-malirjya. Chandragiri is now the head-quarters of a taluka in the North Areot district. According to Mr. Crole*s Chinglejput Manual (p. 438),se Peiyur-kottam"formed part of the modern Poim&ri t&luka. Meguna-valanadu is probably a corruption of the Tamil name M0ykunra-valandns which occurs in two of the copper-plate inscriptions preserved in the Madras Museum*, According to these two grants Meykunra-valanadu was another name of Paiyfir-kottam*4 Kalaturipalem may be connected with Nellatuii, which is mentioned in a copper-plate grant of the third Vijayanagara dynasty5 Tondira-mandaia/ which occurs in verse 20 o the subjoined inscription immediately before the boundaries of the granted village^

BY E. HULTZSCH, PH.D. 
The copper-plates which, bear the subjoined inscription, belong to Mal!arr?mda Surya, Prakasa Rao of Achyntapiiram, near Mukhalmgam, In the Ganjam district. They -were brought to my notice by Mr. GK V. Ramamnrti of Parli-KImedl, and forwarded to me at my request by the Collector of G-ailjam. The owner has consented to lei me deposit the platesIn the Madras Museum. The plates are three in number and measure 5|by 2 inches. Their rims are not raised. The second plate hears writing on both sides. The plates are in a state of nearly perfect preservation. The ring on which they were strung, and which tad not yet cut when I received the plates, is about T5 "thick and about 3J'X in diameter. The small ova! seal, in the lower partof which, the ends of the ring are secured, measures about f*"by flf. It bears^ on a slightly countersunk surface, some indistinct emblem or emblems. The weight of the three platesis 15J oz, and that of tlie ring and seal 6 os. 3 total I ft 5} %* 
The alphabet of the inscription, resembles the alphabetsof the two published grantsof Indravarman II.1 The language Is nearlycorrect Sanskrit. With the exceptionof three imprecatoryverses (lines 19 -22) and one concluding verse (1, 28 f.), the inscriptionis written in prose.s 
The plates record a gift of land, which was made at KMiiigaiiagara (1. 1) by one of the kings of Kalinga (1.4) of the GSnga family (1. 6), the MaidrdjaIndravarmatt (1.8), alias Rajasimlia (1. 24), during (the sun's) progress to the north (udag-ayana, L 13),i.e. during the half-year between the -winter and summer solstices. Near the end of the inscription, there is a second date -which is prohahlyintended for the day on which the edict was engrossed and issued.3 This second date isss the eighty-seventh year (in words and numeric&l symbols) of the reign, on the new-moon of Chaitra" (L 23), Dr. Fleet has published another 
copper-plate grant of the Mahdrdja Indravarman, alias Rajasimha,3 which is dated in"the ninety-first year (in words and numerical symbols)of the reign/1 The proximityof this date (91) to that of the subjoined inscription (87) snggests that both inscriptions belong to one and the same king, Indravarmaa I. alias Bajasimha* This view is further corroborated by the concluding verse of the present grant, which is identical with that o the other grant, and shows that both inscriptions were drafted by the same person, t. Vinayachanctra,the^son of BMnuchandra, Besides, the introductory passage which celebrates the Tirtues of the fang, is literally the same in both inscriptions* and styles the Mug the establisher of thespotless family of the Otogas,* an epithet which, as noticed by Dr. Fleet, doee not occur in other grants of the Gangas of Kalinga. 
The objectof the grant was a portion of a field in the villageof 81(1^1^in the district of Va^vartSi* (L8), which wa, givento .

THe second date is subsequent to the first by at least several months. TTnfortanately, neither of the two dates contains any elements which admit of verification, and which might thus helpto fix the initial point of the Gr&ng-aera. The second date is preceded by the names of the writer of the edict and of an official witness (I. 24 f.), and followed by the name of the engraver (1. 27). 
Owing to the uncertainty in which the Ganga era is still involved, nothing can at present be said about Devendravarman, the son of Grunarnava, but that he must be distinct from DSvSndravarman, the son of Anantavarxnan,3 and that the name Chmamava occurs twice in the list of the ancestors of Chddaganga of Kalinga.4

On their exact positio^size/Md state of preservation see Mr. Sice's Eeport, pp. 1-3. respeet to their paleography 1 make the following additions to his remarks (op. eit. p, 3) : 
1. The tjrpe of the letters comes nearest to those of the version of the Edicts; where, in particular, we have the same wavy ra, and the same contrivances for expressing groups with r&9 which appear in prdnew dralyitavyam (Wo. 1. 1.<)), as well as pta* which be read tpa. And it may b noted that, in later times too, a connection is observable between the letters of the epigraphies! documents from or KathiavM, and those from the south of India. The land-grants of the of and of the rulers of VaLabM all show characters of the Southern type." 
2. The particular uncouth form of ma, with its abnormally large upper limbs, In the inscriptionsera the crystal prism from the Sttpa 
3. Th ^stroke, turned upwards,to which Mr. Bice attention, occurs also in the version o the Bock-Edicts and elsewhere. ID addition, the curious ^stroke, beet downwards at the end, in ndtthesi* (Ho. I. L 11) deserves to be mentioned. I do not remember any other sign exactly like it in the old inscriptions,, There are also a few other resembling those in the later inscriptions* e.jr. the a in (No. I. L 3), the tu in No. I. L 4. With respectto the e of ekam (Wo, I. L 2), consists of two only, I should say that it has been left incomplete by accident^ it is the only of its kind. Every other e has three strokes, 
4. The first numeral signis Irideed, as Mr. Eice states^ partly from in the and Hfkpnftth versions, and this difference further proof for the assertion that local varieties of the Somfchero alphabet in the of AsSk% hence this alpJhabet must have had a longer history, 
Finally^ I Ixave to point out tkat the Worthera or letters exactly those of the lEanseto?a and SMlib&ssgarlii inscriptions,. The colophons of of tie three inscriptions prove "beyond doubt -that the manuscripts of all three were written Tby the same scribe3 3?a4&. Nevertheless, there are some verbal differences in the tezts^ as well as omissions and erroneous repetitions. The latter two kinds of mistakes occur excliairelv in Nos. IIa and III. and are more numerous in No* HI. than in Wo* H. It almost looks as if Pada had written STo. I. first and then had become tired of the dc^uments, Tlie verfe^ differences lite hewam dha (HTo II. L3) instead of dnapayatt (No* I. L 1), and te (No. II. L 11) instead of $vdpite (ISTo*I* 1. 5) ar% just euch as the clerks and copyistsof modem India are very apt fco Introduce* The use of the two alphabets pi^obably that PadawaspTOtici of, and wislied fco exhibit* his accomplishments. In fact, his winding up with liptksr&nm in Northern characters reminds one of a trick of sehoolboysf who sometimes signtheir in Greek or otter foreign characters* The use of the Northern character may farther be to indicate that Pada once served isx Northern India, where the Khardshtr! alphabet ; for it is even now most turtisual to find professional who know other alphabets those used in their native districts, while the epigraphical evidence available at presentis mot favourable to the assumption that the Khar6shtri alphabet was commonly known all over 
The of the inscriptions offers., it would seem? a mixtmr of Worth-Eastern and Southern forias. To the dialect of Hagadiia belong the substitution of e for Sanskrit a* (* g. in and jp*&e), tte word munisd, amd perhaps also cku. With tie of the

tiae ironl utafc&p^, and perhaps the frequent change of the dental no, I suffixes to na e dgvdn&m^ maMm&t&nam, pakamdminena, sdvane. The mixing of the two dialects is probkhT im@ to the fact that the edicts were drafted in axt office where a royal prince and H#h offi*1 fern Magmiha prided over a number of subordinates who were natives of the South. The feuf Hittfc Pda uses in No. I. (L 9) sacham, and in the corresponding passage of Ho. IL (L 17) ^ocAa" m y epmon coirreys the lesson that in ASdka'g times, just as now, most, if not all, Prakrit Amtecfc possessed two sibilants, which the uneducated and the half-educated classes f,n wiriAi -w*.ivinbyv/Oj WS WrJHCH. latter the professional writers belonged and still belong, used promiscuously in the sam words. The vacillation is Just tie same as when the inhabitants of Gujarat say in one sentence I fern Jutte eKh ("what does he say ?"), and in the next tam& aum fathyum (* what did yoa wy ?")- Similar instances of laxness in the use of the palatal and dental sibilants may be observed in most partsof India, and this laxness is at the bottom of the frequent interdfeage el the signs for the sibilants in some versions of AS&ka's Edicts, where, of course, ska and S both be taken to mark the palatal sibilant. 
The dictionary of the Asoka inscriptions receives quite a number of additions throngh the second part of these inscriptions and through the sentence which serves as introduction t both. It most be noted that the introduction certainly did not come from the Imperial Secretariat at Pataliputra.It is jost possible -that the second portion, too, which as yet has not toe* discovered elwmhere, may have been drafted at Suraii^agiil nd may furnish the Ay^wtas view of the essentials of Asoka's maiStwa. The difference in the orijrin would xftlly account for the difference in the lugoage. 
Irrespective of the fact that the &dd4jmra inscriptions wiih their summary of the -Bown Dtemma make the position of those ****difficult, wfeo contend that ASoka- fcrfm o* *fce author of the New Edicts,- their great valt !** therein that they aporfaon of the Dektan teble-laud to have MUmed to the M*** M***y eme emperor.

The SiddApura edicts were sent to Isila from an office, presided over by an Ayaputa and Mahmatas* This scheme of government corresponds exactly to that, which, as the second Separate Edict of Dhauli teaches us, was adopted in Tosali, where a Kumia and Mah.am&tas ruled, to all of whom the edict is addressed. The natural inference is, therefore, that of Mr. Bice, who takes Ayaputa to be an equivalent of KumfUa* while M- Senart's supposition that the Ayaputa is a local chief (op.cit. p. 494- Notes, p. 27) appears more far-fetched. And it is not difficult to show that ayaputa may be used in the sense which Mr. Rice attributes to it; for the St. Petersburg Dictionaries adduce passagesin which the corresponding Sanskrit word dryaputra means*a prince.* Moreover, in Dr. BhagvanlaUs Katak inscriptions,1 Nos. I. and 
III., the kings IQiarsvela and Vakadepa receive the epithet aira? i.e. drya (ajr&), and in the STasik cave-Inscription]$To. 15,s king Pulumsiyi is indicated by the word maha-airaka, i.e. mahdrya. Hence airaputa or ayaputa might indeed be used forca king's son/ It may also be ixrged that, if the Ayaputa had been a mdndalika or padesikas as Asoka himself calls the local oMefs, the ministers would not be mentioned as sending their orders together with .Ms. Such ;a proceeding would be againstall etiquette. On the other hand, the position of a prince, sent out as a viceroy, was probablynot an independent one. The distrusf and the jealousyof the father and sovereign no doubt surrounded him with Mgli officials, possessing almost, if not quite, the same powers,in order to watch, and, if necessary, to check Mm. Finally,- we also quote the circumstance that Pada, one of the writers in the Ayaputa's office, presumably had acquired his knowledge of the Kharoshtri characters while serving in As6ka*s northern 
possessions. 
The extent of Asoka's possessionsin the Dekhan cannot as yet be ascertained. But ifc may foe considered as certain that they included more than the northern extremity of Mysore, and I believe we may venture on the guessthat they extended into the Bombay presidency and that the conquest of the Dekhan had been made by governors of the Konkan, after the annexation of the latter district* In the direction of the Western. Ghats I would also look for Suvamnagiri, the head-quartersof the viceroyof the DekKan. If it still exists, it will now go by a name like Songiror Songadh, Sondurg, Savarndurg, or the like. 
The three versions furnish in my opinion no great assistance for finally settling the most difficult problems connected with the New Edicts, They confirm, it is true, the view of ^Professor Oldenberg who, years ago,4 contended that, in the Rfipnath. Edict, adhatiy&ni ought to Ij8 read, instead of adhitisdni, as 1 had done. But this is also highly probable according to a mew impressionof the Rupn&th version, made over to me by Dr. Fleet, according to which I shall publish a new transcriptin the Indian Antiquary^ The readiiig adhatiydni, as a matter of course, makes it necessary to give up the assumptionthat the statements of the inscription regardingthe time of ASoka's conversion to Buddhism agree with those of 'the Buddhist tradition. The Beloved of the gods says, not that he was a lay-hearer for more than thirty years and a half, but for two years and a half. Again, and this is a point not yet recognised, he 
does not say that he"approachedor entered the Samgha" more than a year ago, but more than six years ago* When I wrote my first articles, I had not seen that the apparent i above va Is the upper partof a da, and hence read in the Sahasram version savimcJihale, instead of #a$vachhale, i.e. shadvatsaram. Moreover, misled by tlxe imperfect facsimiles, I believed that mistakes like ch"ha for sa were common in As6ka*s Edicts. Hence, I unhesitatingly corrected in fclie Rupn&th. Edict the inconvenient chhavachhare, i.e. stiadvatsaram, *a period of six years/ to

e9 *xie year/ The onect total of the period during which the Beloved of the gods himself to have been connected with the Buddhists, is thus about nine years. With respect to the other, equallyor perhags more important question, who the VyHtha or Vivutha was and to what the numerals refer, the Sldd&piira inscriptions yield, as far as I can see, no positive I shall discuss these problems againin the Zeitschrift der UeuUchen Morgenlandischm and will note here onlythis much, that I still take the Vivutha to he tie Tbtbfigata, and still refer the numerals to tie number of years elapsed since the HirvlLna.

REUABKS* 
1. Possibly the termination te (tost) has here the sense of the locative, in accordance with the maxim of the Sanskrit grammarians, declaring the affix tasi may serve to express any ease relation. If so, the translation has to be altered slightly. In addition to the parallel passages mentioned by Mr. Bice and M. Senart, the second line of the Kasifc inscription No. XL B (Rep. Arch. Surv. West. India, p. 106) ought to be compared, where we read: rano Gotamftputasa8dtaJcani$a mahddeviya cJia jivasutdya r&jamdtuya vachanena Gfovadhane Sdmako droga vatavo tato eva vatavo. Regarding the meaning of ayajputa see the introductory remarks. 2. The second version has :" The Beloved of the gods speaks thus." 
3. Adfiatiya is, in Sanskrit, not ardhatritiya,, as Mr. Cbilders asserts, but ardhatr&ya* 4. So.vacliliara or samvactihara, would have to be translated by*a year/ but for the varim lectiones of SahasrSra, safyvaoMiale (formerly misread savfohc&hale) ,and of R&pnath, chhavacTihare, which both correspondto the Sanskrit shadvatsaram* Instead of sad (compare also saduvbsati, Pillar-Edicts I-VI.), sa or sam may, of course, be used, the following consonant being doubled ; compare sapandlain the Sahasram Edict, and d-sam-mas^ke^ Pillar-Edict V. 5. TJpayite, upayite,or up . te9 i.e. upetah,is the reading of all the versions. Up. te is plain in the facsimile of the Bupr^th version, where formerlyI read wrongly papite. As AS6ka contrasts here the period- yam mayd samghe upayite with that when he was vpdsaket*a lay worshipper/it appearsthat the phrase means that he had entered the Samgha, and had become, at least nominally, a monk ; compare the Sanskrit phrases yajnam, vratam, or Irahmachary&m upa-i. The Sanskrit translation of the passageis : yan mayo, samgJia upet6 Mdham cka mayd prakrdntam. The prothesisof y in ytt&for Ua, i.e. itay may be compared with that of v before u in vwJichati, vutta (upta), and so forth. It is common before e in Marathl words, e.g. yck for Ska,^ yeranda for eranda, etc. 
6. I do not think it either permissibleor necessary to change, as M. Senart does, the word devehi, which occurs in two versions ;for the passage givesa good sense if devehi is taken a equivalentto dvvaih saha, as certainly may be done. With this esplanationa the transliteration into Sanskrit would be": l8t&na tu kdlendinrishd santd maniisfiyd mrisM \Terit&'$] devaifo [sahd]* The general meaning is that those men who were considered to be true, i+e. true prophet and instructors, like the ascetics and Brahmarias teaching the Vaishnavas, Saivas, and other sects, were deprived of their high position by the efforts of ASdka and lost the confidence of the people, and that their gods fell with them. The EupnathEdict says, L 2 : Yi imdyo, Mldya Jambndipasi amisd devd husu te ddni masd Jcafd3 and distinctlyasserts the overthrow of the Brahmanical deities. Here we have the verynatural assertion that the prophets and teachers fell in the estimation of the people together with their gods* The question whether the Sahasram

Edict with, the R&pBithTersion or with, that of SiddHpura, or if It tells us something*still different* as M. Senart thinks, will be discussed on another occasion, I, of conrsdy admifc -that M. Sensrfc is right in rejecting Dr. Bhagv&nl&rs conjectural emendation Jinsam te for #cz.m*a&j 
which, in 1877.* I inserted in my text. I now beliere that samta does not require any* alteration. 7. Kdwrnm** in any case/ may also "be translated by*at his desire/ 
8. The sermon which is spokenof here and at the end of this section? consists only of the six beginning with Kkudakd c~ha and ending with pakameyw ti9 &nd its does nots fibs I thought formerly, go as far as diyadMyam vadhisiti. The ti after pakameyit, provestlie correctness of the former statement. The use of an additional pleonastic yathdin No. II. arfc tie beginningo the sentence is in accordance with Classical Sanskrit usage ; see the examples qmoteci in the larger8t. Petersburg dictionary under yatfad* 
9* The correct explanationof amtd has first "been given. by M. Senart* If further jpsroof were needed^ it is furnished by the additional mai, i,e. me, of our version. 
10. JLB stated alreadyin the introductory remarks? I still believe the word Vy$>tTia to refer to Gantama-Buddliaj and the figure to the number of years elapsed since the Mirvina But 1 mow admit that Vy&tha-Viwtha may be derived from vivas? and I take it as representative of Fywfcfa. The verb vivas occurs indeed not rarely in the sense of'to elapses to pass areray ;* 
*g*$ Gfibhila's GriTiyasHtra,ii." 8, janandd dafardtre vynshte, which Professor OIdexil>erg raiders correctly:** When ten nights have elapsed after (the child's) birth ;** and fancha.tct^mfr^ ii. p"255 L 11 (Bomhay S. Ser.), anena vdvttdvyati&arena rajani vyushfd. 
11. The correct begiiming of the second edict has "been first recognized by M, Senarfc* 12. Garutva, which (if the correct reading) is analogous to the form tadatva (Hock-EdLlcts, KMsis Xw) s can of course be used like gaurava1 in the sense of6respect for/ Drahyttavyam IB tlie future pa^ive participle formed from the stem of the piresent drahyati^ which corresponds to "the Sanskrit drikyati. It may^be noted that the PML dictionary does not grre any represezLtaiti4vp o o the Sanskrit verb driJi^ though tie participle dalha and its derivatives show that one mxist tsave existed* 
13, If the readingfat is Hie correct one, the word must b taken as a representative o or iio ; the ShfihUtagaarhi version of the Bock-Edicts, IV, 9, etc. 
14 has here either the meaning of svar&pa or of yini, which the Sansfait has so often* Dtarmasya or tfchdraaya must be understood.

The plates are held together Tby a rings 3" an diameter and about f"thick, which is now cut* It holds a circular seal, 2|^ in diameter^ which contains IB bas-relief a standrng bull, facing the proper left* and a much, worn and illegible inscription round the margin. The engraving is goods amd the writing is well preserved. Of the inscription proper (on plates 16, il and iiia) the of tlie letters Is between"and f". The characters belong to the southern class of alphabets. They closely resemble the characters of what the late Dr. Burnell has termed fhe Eastern ChSlukya alphabet of about A.D. 680 (Elements of South-Indian Paleographyt seeozicl edition, Plat v.) aiad differ1 therefore decidedly from those of the TJruvnpalii grant of {he PaHaTO dynasty (JR&cL J-w, Vol. V. p. 51, Plate), with which the present inscription otherwise has much in commona The language is Sanskrit, and, excepting two imprecatory Yerses in lines 17 and 18, the wliole is in prose. The text has been drawn up most carelessly, as may be seen from the omission of single syllables and whole words, as well as from the repeated occrareiice of groups of aJksJiaTt&s that are deroid of meaning. In respectof orthography also, the inscriptionis fall of faults, Bo:me of which may he accounted for by the influence of the writer's vernacular* Thus, 
the sign. of *visarga>is throughout omitted ; and similarly the sign of annsvdra or of the final m is omitted, everywhere exceptin the- word Pallav[_d*"]ndm9 in line 10* We have a instead of final & in jpTapautra, L 2, pautra,*1. 4, -dfflcsJiita, L 8 ; &nd instead of final & in -rdshffra, L 11* The palcvtcbl sibilant is used sis times for the dental sibilant, and the dental five times for the palatal. Unaspirated letters are employedinstead of aspirates in VaMJsa {for Vaif&Kka), L 19, lavcla, (for laMha), L 8, and lakti (for Wuiktf), 1 6 ; and sonant consonants instead of surd ones in. bTitzffdrago (for bhattdrahd), 1. 9, and Daitriya (for TaittMya)9 1. 12. Besides, we find ch for ^ in KulacharmmanS, L 13 ; ttli for ddh in -dttJiarana, (for -odd'havana), L 9; dh for d in -ddM-pr&d,7idna'i (for -ddi-praddnaiJi), L 5;and for <id& in rfdW, 1. 3, and samtadM, L 9 ; 6 for 11 in &rato, 1, 7; and v for jp in uvanata, 1. 3 ; and for & in ^aZa, lines 1 and 14, lvdas 1. 8, and t?ajppa, 1. 9. In lines 17 and 18 a final m has been five times left unchanged before a consonant, where it slbould liave been changed to anusvdra ; and m is inregnlarly doubled in the body of a word in c&^czgammya^ L 14, and at the end of a word before a following Towel in at* (for ^ohchJidsanam^ati ) and sdrfoamm^avuha (for gdr$ram=arha), in L 16. Instead of the conjunct JA we hsw ny3 in rdnya (for rdj^a^nd rdjna$), in lines 1 and 2 5 and, to facilitate the pronunciation, a -vowel has been inserted or y vocalised in a eonjauct in vdsJifira (for rdshfrS) L 11, arvbhaU (for arliati'),1. 16, saZofca (for ^Zofc^),1. 16, -mariyMasya, mariyddeyd, mariyddayd (for -wiavyddasya, and maryddayd'),lines 2, 11, and 13, and aiwariy (for aUvarya), 1. 14.

Lastly, tie short vowel e, which is unknown to Sanskrit, but common in Tamil, is improperly used, partly trough the influence of a following^, in maryddeyd (for maryddayti), L 11, tj6ytf and ^ej^a (for vyayd), in lines 8* 14, and 19, and wneya (for vinaya), L 4.

EPIGEAPHIA INDICA.   
The inscription professes to be one of the devout worshipperof Bhagavat (Vl^lmu), the wr-aKdis* of the Pallavas, the illustrious Ifandivarman (L 10), a member of the who is described as the son of the Maharaja Skimdavaarmao. O- b son's ion of the HaJiwrdja Simhavarman (L 4), and the great-grandson of the ^andlEvaraiaai (L 2).It informs us (in 11. 11-14) that, from the victorious KaSch (i L), Nandivarman gavethe Tillage o Eaftchivftyil and four pieces of forest-land, situated la the district {rdshtra)of Adeyra, to a Brahinana inhabitant of KaficMvayiX. Darned who belongedto the Kansika gitra and to the VSdic school of the Talttdx-iyas, and was the Pravaehana.3 The inscription further (in 11. 15-18) contains auxi admo nition mot to levjtaxes on the land so granted, threatens with corporal punishmenttliose -wlio transgress the king's commands, and cites two of the ordinary imprecatoryverseH ; and it clo^s(ia L 19) -with the statement that this document (jpaffika) was issixecl on tlie (lunar day) of the bright half of Vaisakha, in the first year of the -v^etorlo-os reign (apparentlyof Kandivarman)* 
The Tamil endorsement on plate La runs thus :"In the twenty-sixth year (of t7ie reign) of Jl^dirai-kOQ4^ we, (the members of) the assembly of K^iioliivayil* Igacmaraisnaxigaiairi* and we, (the members of) the assembly of TJdayac1iaiidxH.i3Ci,o-iiLgaIaxn,,| (have agreedas follows): We, (the inhabitants of) these two villages, having jolxxod (twcf) having' Income one, shall prosperas one village from this (date)** 
Without the endorsement, this inscriptionis very similar to the Uruvupalli gfrx*rtt> of the Paltava Yuvamah&rdja VishnugopavarmaB, published by Dr. Fleet in the Indian Ancgi4>&ry9 Vol. V, pp. 50 L Indeed, bixfc for the circumstance that our grant was issued (not from. ^f^Iakkndajf but) from KaBehtpura, and that the rulers mentioned in it are Skandavarman, Sixixlaauvarmanf Skndamrman9 and Fandivarman (instead of Skandavarmau, Vlravaramn, Skaxx5la.varmsun, 
Viahaiig6|,varmaii), lines 1-10 of it read much like a mutilated copy of liziea 1-16 of the IJravapalli grant; and in a similar, though perhaps less striking manner,4 linesi 15-18 of Kandwoman's grant m^y be said to resemble Hues 28-32 of the grant of Vishnng-6p&varmaxi* This frefc has sot escaped the EeT, T, Foulkes, and the conclusion which he has felt inclitOLeel to dra,w 
from ifcf apparently is, that both grants were issued by the same prince, and that, axseordrngty* the YimTamian and Vishnugopavarman8 of the one grant are identical with the Siiixhtwarman aacl Hmniivarman of the other, I myself am of opinion that the present inscription must, 
on j!ieograpMcal grounds, be -assigned to a later period than the Unxvupalli grab ; anct[ consideringit g&spieious that, at different periods, there should have been two Palla^a, princtm and great-grandfathers were called Skandavarman, and that, moreover, two sets of four consecutive princes should have been described in almost identical terms, and fcakine also into the extreme slovenliness of the 
thewording of Nandivarman's grant, I cannot, auppWHS thai this grant may be a spnrions document,6 the writer of which took foir His model eitier the Urnvnpali grant of Vishnugopavarman itself or some other inscription of t&a same prince. 
The Tamil endorsement of this inscription is practically identical with the endorse^xont at end of the graut of yandiTarman Pallavamalla. published by the Rev. T. Foulkes i i>lxo t^^^J^^-fofthegrantof Simbarannan in Jrf.^Vol V n 156 s^sasaL*----K ;s^

Aehyu.t&ndra in the ordinary conventional manner. Verses 33-37 give a stringof birudas of Ms which are not new to us,1 and record (as the Hampe inscription does of Krishnaraya) that he was waited upon by the kingsof Anga, Vanga,and Kalinga. And this part of the inscription ends with another verse in praise of Achyntendra, which is merely an imitation of verse 24 of this same inscription. 
According to verses 39-53 (in lines 91-115) the Mahdrdya Achyutendra, being on the hank of the river TungaDhadra,on the 12th lunar day of the bright half of ESrttlka the day when the god. Vishnu rises from his sleep of the year 1462 of the era of galivaha, -which was the (Jovian) year arvari, in the presenceof the god Vitthalesvara,2 and surrounded by many holy men, grantedthe village of TThinai, which (apparentlyin consequenceof this grant) was also called' Achyutendramaharayapura,to a number of Brahmanas learned in the Vedas and famo-as for their knowledge of the Sustras ; the king having been requestedto do so byhis trusted minister 3 the chief of the Ndyaleas Virftpaksha, who was born in the family of Ananta and is described as the moon of the sea of the tlQdiyappendra Ndyakas* The village of TThinai, thus granted "by Achyut&ndra (in terms which are common to the copper-plate grantsof the Vijayanagara kings), was situated in the Senkalanirpattu stond of the Kumup nddu of the Kandayira-mahaveH paffnof the Amuru Uta of the Padavidu maUr&jya.of the Jayankonda Chtoia ma,ndcLU-,and layto the east of the villageof Ayyafieheri, to the south of the village of KTiJappaka, to the west of the villages of Nallampaka and Venkampaka, and to the north, of the villageof Arunkal. 
The date, givenin the preceding paragraph, does not admit of verification ;but the fact that it fell in the Jovian yearSArvari shows the yearto have been Saka-Samvat 1462 expired, and for this year the 12th of the brighthalf of Karttika would correspondto the 12th October, A.D. 154O. 
As regards the localities, TThinai, accordingto Dr. Haltzsch, must be the former name of the very trruamanjeri where the plates were found; for by the GhingleputTaluls Map this village lies to the east of Ayyanjeri, to the south of Kolappakkam, to the north-west of Nallam-paiiaoam, and to the north of Ariagal, four of the very places which, under shghtly 
different names, are mentioned in this inscription in the same (or almost exactlythe same) positions with reference to Uhinai. eBk4amrpattu,the name of the swa, to J^Dte

To proceed with our analysis of the inscription,tlie village of Uhinai (or rather -fclxe income from it)f according to verse 54 (11. 115-117), was divided into 60 vrittis, or stares*1 Of these, one vritti and a quarter were set aside for the benefit of the god Raghunfttha ( Vislirra-) ; andthe 
amount was reserved for the worship of the god Chandisvara (Siva ;vv. 55 a/nd 56).s Tie bulk was distributed, in amounts ranging from a quarter of a vritti to five vrft t&9 among forty-eight Brlhmanas who are named in the verses 57-104 (11 120-179). Each of tlxese verses 3 gives, in addition to the exact'amount allotted to each person, also the name of the a.tlier of tie recipient, and specifies the gotra or anvaya of the latter, and the Vedic texts studioci by him.

The plates are five in number, eacln measuring about 9-f" by 41* The edges of tliem, were fasMoned slightly thicker than the inscribed surfaces,, so as to serve as rims to protect the writing; and, though the plates are in many places a good deal corroded by rust, there are "but the plates are strung,is about^thick, and circular in shape, about Sf" in diameter.

grant,it may be added that portionsof the text arc bodily misplaced j and the contest is so np that, -without the other records as a guide, most of It would be hopelessly unintelligible* The next pointto command attention is the paleography of the gmntss as far as jsublished lithographsare available. 
The Tanjore grant purportsto have been issued in A JD. 248. But every character in it l>etrays a far later date ; and, taken all together, they point to tlie tenth centiary AJX as the possible period for the fabrication of the record. This was recognised by Dr. {South"Indian Palaeography, pp. 34, 35, and Plate xi.} 5 who classed the alphabet the Grantha-Tamil alphabets, and expressedtie opinionthat the document, distinctly "by him**a forgery/' shews the condition of the northern Chera characters shout the century. A most tell-tale character in this record is the I : It is 'distinctly a of a late type | and the only approximationto it, that I can find, is in the exhibited hy Dr, Bnrnall in his Plate xiv., and allotted hy lam to A. D. 1383.
EPIGRAPHIA IFDIOA. [VOL. III.   
The extraordinary Harihar grant, -which, as Mr. Bice Mmself has said, includes certainly . if not three alphabets, or, rather, attempts at alphabets,is made up of characters which, for the most part,baffle any attempt at serious criticism. It is sufficient to say that among them there are some of the most modern Kagari or Balfoodn forms, note particularly the Is andy, mud the p and TO in one of their varieties ; and that the fabrication of the record, must be placed even later than that of the Tanjore grant. So clumsily dense was the ignorance of the man -who concocted it, that the Teh and nd of Tcfidndita, line 3, are actually formed backwards. And the nature of the whole document is such that, but for the previously published records, the greater partof it could not have been decipheredat all.1 
The earlier Mallohalli grant, TSo. 3, aim's throughout at an old type of characters. But they are so indifferently formed, all through, that, taking this feature in connection with, the "rr-.ttres- of the orthography.the spurious nature of the record, and its late origin, cannot be cbabted for a moment. I am not at present prepared to fix the earliest date possible for the ?br>rt:or of it. Bat I do not doubt that it was concocted at least as late as the Merkara grant and the other grant from Mallohalli. 
The Merkara grant, purporting to have been issued in A.D. 466, was considered by Dr. Barnell to beK the earliest unquestionable inscription as yet known"(loc. cit. p. 34) ; and from it he framed what he called a Chera alphabet of A.D. 467 (see his Plate ii.). But, when Dr. Bsrnell wrote, comparatively little was known about the palaeography of southern and western India. Any practised eye will now see, at a glance, that the record is of much later date than that to which it pretends. And, on closer inspection, it is definitely betrayed by a character wMch furnishes a leading test in dealing with southern records. The letter Teh occurs in it six tnnes, in Uajga and Manjita, line 2, in mukhade, lines 24, 26-27, and 29, and in Ukhitam, at the end; and, in each case, the form that is used is the later or cursive form, which, elsewhere, in Dr. Bnrnell's tables, appears first in his Plate vi., the alphabet in which is taken front a copper-plate grant of the Eastern Chalukya king Amma II., issued in or soon after A.D. 945 ! i"1 -,'P' 15' and Hth SraPh> for tte **, see khalu, line 24, dMyah, Hue 25, and Ifttoa*, toe 64). As a matter of fact, this later form of the Jch is carried back to the time of the lasarrazuia king Amoghavarsha I. (A.D. 814-15 and 876-78) : for, though only the Prnm ^iDSCription f the same kinS> dated in A.D. 865, at MantrawME near fw f Tnot seem at a11 possible that t can be carried back to before'

In the same way, tlie later MaUolxalli grant* So, 6f the characters of which are all suspicious enough, even at first sight,is conclusively "betrayed by another tell-tale letter, The form of the b used in it (see labdha-bala, line 23 and other words all through the record) is the later, one, which, also, in Dr. Burnett's Tables, appearsfirst in his Plate vi, of the alphabetof A,D, 945 or thereabouts (in the lithographof the grant of Amma II., on which charter the plate is based, for the 6, see, for instance, labdha, line 2, bdlam, line 17, and bandhujanfyKILO 29). Like the later form of the Jch, and bj precisely the same records, the later form of the I is carried back to the time of Amoghavarsha I.1 And, in the same way, it cannot be carried back to an earlier date than A.D. 804 : for, the earlier form alone occurs in the Kanarese grantof Govinda III., dated in that year (see the words brihaspcM,line 3, gdmundabbe,line 5, fcottrfaZW, line 8, and all the other words in the record that include a &)> and throughout the WokkaJSri grant of Klrtivarman II., of A.D. 757. So, here, again, we have the beginning of th ninth century AJD., as tlie earnest possible period for tlie concoction of the record. 
The characters of the Nagamangala grant follow the early forms almost thro^ghont. They are mostly of very good and uniform execution, considerablymore- so than would be thought from the lithograph published with Mr. Bice's paper on this record; and, to shew his and to illustrate my other remarks, I now give a lithographof platesi. and iii. &, from my own ink-impressionsof the original plates, the opportunityof seeing which I owe to Mr. Bice. And, being of an almost isolated type, they might,at first sight, be easily acceptedas belonging really to the time to which they refer themselves. But they, again,are betrayed by the way in which the writer dealt with the letters kh and &. Of the Kh, the old form appears in Khnfga and khandita, line 2, dkhyas, line 26, and probably mJchydta,line 38 ; but in mnkJiK-makka, line 15, mukhah, line 16, dhanushkJianda and nakka, line 30, akUlam, line 38, mukhartta,, line 40, akhandita, line 52, khanda, line 58, ckkakhyath and duhkhain, line 75, and likhtiam, line 79, the writer" forgot himself, and lapsedinto the later form which is subsequentto AJD. 804. So ajso with the & : the old type is followed in labdha-bala, line 2, and in varioiis otlier words all through the record; but the writer forgot himself, and gavethe later form, mjbwqpsatto A.D. 804, in baTiala, lines 28-29, dmbara, line 34, baldrir (and in the first 6 of bb&k^ Ene 87, mbudha, line 45, budTia, line 48, bdna, line 51, labhfaa, line 56, baliubMr=bi>awMd, line 76, and braTimadSyam, line 80. And so, here, again, the beginning of tlie ninth, cautery AJ>; is fixed as the earliest possible date for the fabrication of the record; a time which is later "by at any rate twenty-seven years than the given date of it,2 
Finally, the British Muse-am grant aims at producing the old typ$ of characters throughout ; including even the kh and 6. But the execution of them is vefy indifferent all through ; and, with the very marked corruptnessof the orthography, and the displacingof portions of the text, which has already been noted, it proves, beyond any possibility of doubt, the sptirlotts 
1 In the Sir&r inscription of A.1X 866, onlythe older form of tlie 5 is used. In- the Mantraw^i inscription of A,D. 865, only the later form occurs. In an undated inscription of tlie same kingat Nidaguudi near Shiggaoss, the two forms are mixed : the older form occurs mostly ; but the later form is found once. 
a I have said, above, that the characters of this grant are of an almost isolated type. Among published instances, I koow none that exactly match them, exceptthose of the spurious grant of Ravidatt* from the Coimbatore district (2nd. Ant. Vol. XVIIL p. 36S, and lithograph). And the resemblance is so marked, that it seems very likely that the two records were written, for reproduction by the engraver, by the aie hand. There is also a close verbal connection between the sparions Coimbatore grant and the spurious Western GaBga, records; the former gives some actual phrases from the latter. In editing the Counbatore grant> I expressed the opiniou that the date of its concoction might perhapsbe placed about the commencement of the eighth century A.D., but certainly no earlier. As, however, it includes the later form of the &h (in m&ha> line 4* and ohha&hyam and d^Jikham, line 32),it cannot be placedbefore A.D. 804. As in the case of the Merkara grant (ae pug* 16& abov* note 5), the means of determining the exact date of the fabrication of the N4gama%aU grant may exist i* the names, mentioned in it, of some Jam teachers in the Pallkml^aciichha of the Eregittto-Onsjain the Baud* Samgh in the M&la-Gan.a.T 2

the supple sword wMch he held in his hand." In connection with the banner thus mentioned, it may be noted that the family crest was an elephant, which appears on the seals of the grants, and is also mentioned in line 7 of the Harihar grant* The Udayendiram grant further states that the Ganga lineage originated from a saint named Kanvas born in the race of Kasyapa, and owed its gki*eatiiess to a certain Siihhanandin. Here Mr. Foulkes read maJii\jpa>']j'king.* And Mr. Rice,- on tjhe strength of the mention, elsewhere^ and in no connection with the Gangas," of a Jain teacher named Simhanandin, who, in a rather obscure passage, appears to be described as giving to Samantabhadra, while the latter was still a disciple, the sharp sword of meditation on the divine Arhat which breaks, like a line of stone pillars, the army of destructive sins, whereby Samamtabhadra broke with Ms sword the solid stone pillar that barred the road to the acquisition of the goddess of sovereignty,3 has altered mahipa into muwipa,'saint, or leader of saints,* and has arrived at the conclusion that Konganivamian"was aided, in establishing his kingdom^ by his ec Guru Simlianamdiri." He has found some apparentcorroboration in the Humcha inscription* And lie has finally developed all this into the assertion that Simhanandin presentedto 
Koi*ga^Iva2m.a:n a miraculous sword, with which^ at one blow, lie cut through the stone pillar ^wMcli was the chief obstacle in the way of Ms securing the throne,4 But the pixrely conjectural alteration of mahipa into muwipa is rather a violent step. And, whatever 
the A.cTidrya> Simhanandin of the Humcha inscription may have done, the Udayendiram record distinctly implies an interval, of unspecified but appreciable duration, between the SixialianarZidixi, who is mentioned in it, and Konganivarman. 
His son was M&dlaavaI-9 who in the Humcha inscriptionis called Kitiya-M^dhava^ the younger or lesser M&dhava.' His title appearsas Mah&rdjddJwrdjain the Tanjore grant ;as j&dhivaja, -which, like the preceding,is a genuine title, in the Mallohalli grant No. 3; and as MaTiddhtrdja in all the others. No historical facts are stated in connection with him. But he is said to have "been the author of a commentary on the Datta!kasutra9 a -work on. the law of adoption. 
His son -was Harivarmanf who in the Tanjore grantis called Arivarman. His title appears as MaJidrdjdd'hirdja in tlie Tanjore grant ; in the Mallohalli grant No. 3, as Mdrdja9 which is a corrupt fonn.3 and a very suspicious and instructive one, of the genuinetitle MaJidrdja ; and as Mahddhirdja in all the others. In connection with him, again, no historical facts are stated. But. the Tanjore grant indicates that his capital was Talavanapura, which Mr. Bice has identified with Talakad on the K&veri? about thirty miles east by south from the town of Mysore j5 and Mr. Bice Considers that this town continued to be the royal residence from that time onwards : before that time, he says,* on the authorityof the KongudSsa-Rdjd&kal,the

His son was Visiu^iigdpa, whose title appearsas Mahdrdjddhirdja in the Harihar grant ; in the MaUohalli grant No. 3, as Mdjaywhich is a genuine title, but not one of paramount sovereignty; and as Maliddkirdjain all the osiers. The Harihar grant either omits two generations altogether, and makes Mm the eon of Konganivarman ; or else it calls Harrearman Konganivarman5 and transfers to him the feat of severing the stone pillar,, which elsewhere is always attributed to Konganivarman. 
His son was M&dliava Hos who in the Humcha inscriptionis called Ang&la-Madhava.s Assuming that he is the Mng referred to in the Harihar grant, his title appears there as Hdja ; in all the subsequent records, it is MaJiddhirdja. He is said to" have married a sister of the Kadamba MahddMrdja Krishnavarman ; a,nd we now know three Kadamba kings of that name, referable to approximately the sixth century A.D.: but none of the Kadamba records mention such an alliance : and a note "which Mr. Bice has given,3 to the effect that there is a grant of D6vavarman, son of the Kadamba Makdrdja Krishnavarman, which would place the latter about AJD. 438-89, is altogether misleading; in the record in question,.4 there is no statement of any date, and not even anything that helpsto fix its specific period \ and the date of A.D. 438-39 for Ejrishnavarman was arrived at by myself,5 from the spurious Gang-a records, and before I recognised their true nature. The Harihar grant gives this Madhava the hereditary title of "supreme lord of Kol&la, the best of towns,** and describes him as"having' acquired the excellent favour of the goddess Padm&vati;" and it also mentions him, or another person, as I&jamaEla. On these points Mr. Rice himself has remarked :6 * c No other inscription mentions "him" [e. B&jaxnalla], "and it is doubtful whether this name was used so early. The forns "Kolala, too, is more modern ; and the reference to Padmlivati seems to connect him with the tt later kings.9 *It is really remarkable that Mr. Rice should recognise so much, and yet fail to arrive afe the proper ultimate conclusions. 
His son was Avinlta-Kongani* whose title appears in the MaUohalli grant No. 3 both a& Sdja and as Mahdvdja, and in the subsequent records as Mahddhirdja. He is said to have lammed a daughter of the Punn&fcaraja Skandavarman ; and corroboration of this statement is supposed to be furnished by the fact that the K6maralingam grant of Bavidatta mentions a Skandavanmm, whose son was named Punnatar&ja.7 But the K6maralingam record contains no mention of any intermarriage with the Gangas ; and it is itself a spurious record, of certainly no earlier date than the commencement of the ninth century A*D,8 
His son was -Dtirvinita--Konga.ni. The Hosur and F4gamangala grants give him no title ; in the Bangalore grant, he is styled MaJidrdja ; and, in the MallohalJI grant No. 6 and the British Museum grants either Raja or Vriddhardja, the latter of which titles is unknown except for these^spuriousrecords. The MaUohalli grant No. 6 styles him"lord of the whole of Panada or P&nn&da, and Punn&da/' He is said to have been victorious in battle at Andari, llattur, Pondare, and Pelnagara, Pernagara, or Pennagara ;9 and to have composed a commentary on

(A.D. 014-15 to 876*78) says that among previous-writers there were Vimala, Udaya3 lf%&cjuiifl J ayafcandlra, and Dnrvinita ; from which Mr. Bice derives corroTborative evidence of the existence of the Western Ganga king Dnrvinita.1 But, grantingthat the Nripatmnga in question is Am6ghavarsha I., the statement only provesthat there was an anthor named Dnrvinita at some time "before about A. D. 850 ; and there is nothing in it, either to establish any particular date for kirn, or even to shew that he was a Ganga. An^ unpublished grant from Hebbftr states that Dxtrvinita was taught by the author of the Sabddvatdra^ i.e., Mr. Eic says, by 
Pnjyapada, -whose date, he holds, is thus established,2 Whether this author was the celebrated Piijyapada, what the date of that Piijyapada was, and what, if anything,it a.y prove in connection with Durvinita,* I am not at present preparedto consider. But, at any rate, the date winch is to be deduced for Durvmita from, these spurious records, has no weight of any kind in determining the date of Piijyapada. 
His son was Mtishkara, whose name appearsin the British Museum grunt in. the form of Mokkara. The same record styles Mm either Xtdja or Vriddhardjd ; but the Hosftr and N&gamaiigala grants do not give Km any title. The British Museum grant says that he married s. clang-liter of Sindhuraja, or of the ting of Sindhn. The Lakshraeshwar inscription mentions 
a Jam temple called Mukkaravasati :3 this may possibly be taken as shewing that, at some time before A.D. 978, there really was a Ganga king or prince named Mushkara, Mukkara, or JMokkara : but it fixes no specific date for Mm; and it can bardly be said to suffice to prove the genealogy given in the spurious records. 
His BOH was Vikrama or SriviJurama,4 -with whose name, again, the British Museum, grant connects tlie title of Bdja or VriddJiardja ; tlie Hosur and Nagamangala grants do not give him any title* No historical facts are stated in connection with "him. His son was BhiivUEcama, -with whose name the British Museum grant connects the title of 
^MahddTifrdja ; the Hosftr and N&gamangala grants do not give him any title. He seems to have liad tlie ttiruda of Srfvallahha. And he is said to have defeated an unnamed Palla.va Mng, in battle at a place named Vilanda or Vilandha* The British Museum grant says also that he STibJTLga.ted the whole of the Pallava dominions. 
His younger brother was Sivamfira, to whose name the Hosur and Nagamaiigala grants attacli the genuine title of MaMrdja. He had the. Uruda of Uava-Kama. Also, from a copper-plate grant from Suradhenupura, Mr. Rice gives him the Itiruda of Nava~Ch&fca.5 And he fnrtliei!' suggests that he may be the Kambayya* supposedto be also called Nava-L6ka, -who is 
mentioned In one of the Sravana-Belgola inscriptionsas the son of a king named Srivallabha :ft Iynt9 from ink-impressions received from Dr. Hultzsch, I am able to say that the true Tyirwda in the Inscription In question is Ranllvaloka ; and this, compared with Ejbadg&valolsra In the ease of Dantidorga., Is suggestive of a Bashtrakuta king or prince.

The Hosiir and U^gamaiigala grantsboth' give Mm the title of Mahdrdja. Mr. Rice says that liis wife was Srtj&; but the passage,in the N"%amangala grant, on wMch this is based, says in reality that the

The Hog-fir and H%amangula grants both describe him as having Ms victorious camp at the town of Manyapura; which place, whatever it may bas is certainly not the MS-nyakhfeta of the EaslitraMtas, And 
they givefor Mm dates in AJD. 762 and 776-77; the later record also stating that A.D, 776-77 was the fiftieth year of Ms reign. The Fday&ndiram grant, however, which can only be interpretedas naming Mm as M&rasimlia (or else as not mentioning him at all) 9 establishes a considerablylater date ; it makes Mm (or else some otherwise unknown brother or cousin-) the father of ESJasimha, otherwise called Hastimalla, who received the Bana territory from the Chela king Parintaka I. ; and it thus places Mm (from either point of view) only one generation before A, D. 920 or closely thereabouts.1 
1 will take next certain internal evidence In the Merkara record. It mentions, without naming Mm, the minister of a king JJkfilavar^Ti ss and says, as far as the text can be properly construed at all, that in A.IX 466 he acquired from Avinita-Kongani a grant for a Jain temple 
t the city of Talavanagara ; at any rate, it asserts that there was a king named AMlavarsha in or shortly before A.D. 466. Mr. Bice says that no doubt a B&shtrakftta king is intended ;s and in this I quite agree. But, on the assumption that every Krishna of the REshtrakuta family nrast have borne the biruda Ak&laYaxshas he goes on to identify this Ak&lavarsha with a R&shtrakiita king Kjislupa, whose son Indra is said, in the Western CMlukya traditions of the eleventh century A,D., to have been conquered by Jayasimha I., the progenitor of tlie whole Chalukya stock,4 and who, in accordance with this statement, is to be allotted to abont the end of the fifth or the beginning of the Birth century, A.D., i.e. to a period that approximates to the date put forward in the Merkara grant ; and here it is impossible to endorse Ms views. In the first place, the existence of this early BftahtrakfLta king Krishna is purely legendary, and is 
undotibtedly imaginary. The Western Chalukya records themselves contain no mention of Mm; and they do not record any specific victories at all by Jayasimha I,, who seems, in fact, to have not enjoyed any regal power, and to be quoted simply as the grandfather of Pnlikdgin L, the founder of the dynasty. The EAshtrakiita records do not mention him. And, though certain coins have been obtained from the N&sik District, which do give the name of a king Krishna,6 and may be allotted to the period in question just as well as to a somewhat later one, still they contain nothingthat refers them to the K&shtrak'u.ta dynasty ; and my opinion now is that, in aE probability, theyare coins of king Krishna, father of Sainkaragana, whose existence Las j^eeiatly been brought to notice bya copper-plate grant from S&nkhd& in the Baroda State/ and that this personis an early Kalaekuri king. The existence of an early RS,slitmkuta king* Krishna, referable to approximately the period to which the Merkara grant pretends to belong, depends upon notMng butr the tradition which first appeal's in the eleventh century A.D., after

the overthrow of the Bltslitrakutas by the Western Ch&lukya Taila IL And I am certain tliat the origin of the statement is to be found in the facts that, almost at the end of the Rashtrat&ta period* there was a powerful R&shtrakuta king Krishna III., and that he left a grandson, Indra W.? by crowning whom the Western Ganga prince M&rasimha attempted to continue the Bashtrakuta sovereignty after the overthrow of Kakka II.1 And in the second place, even granting, for the sake of argument, thai there was an early Rashtrafciata king Krishna, belonging to the same period with the Western Chalnkya Jayasimha I., and approximatingto the date put forward in the Merkara grant ; and also that the Mrudas of the B^shtratiitas were as constant as Mr. Rice would have them to bes there must have been a time when each Iriruda, was first devised \ and the only sound course in respect of any particular"biruda, is to take the earliest instance that is actually proved for it. The biruda Akalavarsha appearsfirst in connection with the R&shtrakiita king Krishna I.9 It belonged subsequently to Ms descendants Krishna II. and Krishna III. And, intrinsically^ any one of these three kings might be the person referred to in the Merkara grant.If that person, however, is Krishna I., who came shortly after A.D. 754, then at the best, the record was written close upon three centuries after the date to which it refers itself ; but this identification is rendered impossible by the palseographic evidence, noted above, which fixes about half a century later, and the third generation after Krishna I., as the earliest possible periodfor the concoction of the record. The date of Krishna II., just after A.D. 878, fits in sufficiently with the pale&ographic evidence, and, going slightly farther, establishes the last quarter, instead o the beginning* of tlie ninth century A.D., as the earliest possible period to which the fabrication of the Merkara grant cam be referred. I think, however, that the mention of a king Akalavarsha in this record is in reality to be atttributed to the fact that the l^iruda belonged also to Krishna III., whose period was about A.D, &40 to 956, and who had some very special relations with the Western Gangas : by This fatter Amdghavarsha-Vaddiga, a sister of his was givenin marriageto Permanadi-Butnga^ with, as her dowry, the districts known as the Puligere Three-hundred, the Belvola Three hundred, the Kisuk&d Seventy, and the B%e or Bagen&d Seventy ;3 he himself confirmed Biituga, probably as governor,in the possessionof the same districts, a& a reward for killing the Chola king R&jftditya ;4 a son of his own married a daughter of Ganga-Q-ang&ya;i.e. BAtuga ;5 and Indra IV., by crowning whom M&rasiihha sought to continue the R&shtrakiita sovereignty after the downfall of Kakka II,, was the offspringof that marriage.6 And if this view is accepted, fhe earliest possible period for the fabrication, of the Markara grant is pushed still further on9 to about the middle of the tenth century A.D. 
There is also similar evidence in the British Museum, grant. In line 56 it 'gives the name of KBlivallabhaf which, there can be little doubt, either denotes the R&shtrakftta king Kali vallabha-Dhruva (just before AJ>. 782-84), or else owes its originto the fact of his having had that Tyiruda

Here, again the use of ^soutHera lum-solal- system of the cycle is itself evidence of a comparatively late date And so also is the fact that the Saka year is expressed by numerical words ;3 for the earliest genuine epigraphic instance of this, in India, is the record which gives the date of the 
coronation of Amma H. in A.D. 945, and the earliest absolutelyreliable instance m Western India, known to me, is an inscription of the time of the Western Chaiukya king Somesvara II. at Annigerein the Dharwar district, dated.in A.D. 1071.4

It is necessary now to saya few words about the Tamil chronicle, the Kongudesa-B&jald^ which has already teen incidentally mentioned.

In many respectsit agrees with the grants: so much so that it and they plainly have some Tery close connection; though, whether the grants were fabricated from the chronicle, or wkether the grants having been first concocted, the chronicle, which mentions charters of A.D. 82-Sd, 178-79, 288-89, 746-47, and 878-89, was put together, with additions from them, or whether ail

were taken from some common source whicli remains to be discovered, it seems impossible to decide. But it adds some farther details,1 wMch. are sufficiently instructive, According' to the grants, the founder of tlie family was Konganivarman* The clironicle mentions this person ; ^ith the date of A.D. 189-90 or 190-91 for his installation., at Skandajrara. But it also gives 
the names of seven preirious rulers of the same kingdom, of a different family ; and it tells us that they were of the Ueddi or Batta trtfoe9 and belonged to the Suryavamsa or Solar Race.3 And, not only does it make this pointed statement, but, of these persons, five are distinctly to foe identified with members of the Kashtarafcnta dynasty of Malkhed, whose dates, far from lying before A.D. 189, fall between about A.D. 675 and 956. The names and relationshipsof the seven mlers, as given in the chronicle, are VirurS,]a-Chakravartin, who was born in the city of Skandapnra ; his son Govindaraya ; his son Krishaaraya;his son Kalavallabharaya ; his son Govindaraya, with the date of A.D. 82-83; hia son Chatnrbhuja-Kanna^ad^va-Chalcravartiii; and his son TirtL-Vikramad^va-Chakravartin^ who Is said to have been installed at Skandap-ora in A.D. 178-79, and to have been converted from Jainism to Saivism by the celebrated Saadakarach&rya. And the second to the sixth of them are plainly .Govinda L of the Rashta^^fc&t^ dynasty (three generationsbefore A,D. 754) ; Ms grandson Krishna I, ; the latter's soil Kalivallabha-Dhrava ; Dhmva's son Govinda III, (A.D. 782-84 and 814-15) ; "and either Govinda's grandson Kannam-Krishna IL (A.D, 888 and 911-12), or the latter's great-grandson Kannara-Krishna III. (A.D. 940 and 956) ,3 The placing of these kings before the supposedfounder of the Western Ganga family, and in the first and second centimes A.D,, establishes at once the utter worthlessness of the chronicle for any historical purposes, whether it is a composition, of recent date, or whether it can pretendto any age.4 
It is hardly possible, after this detailed exposition, that any genuine dtfnbt can remain as to the spurious nature of the grants, and as to the complete futility, and worse, of placingreliance on either them or the chronicle .for any historical or antiquarian -purposes. But the question may very reasonably present itself, "What was the object of the invention of the genealogy 
that is exhibited in these spurious records? And I think that even this can be satis factorily answered. There are plainindications that, just about the period, the last quarter of the ninth century A.D.? that has been established above as the earliest possible one for the fabrication of the Merkara grant,all the reigning families of Southern India were beginning to look up tb.eir pedigrees and devise more or less fabialons genealogies The Puranic genealogy of the BAshtrakiitas makes its first appearancein the Sangli grantof A.D. 933.5 The Puranic genealogy* of the Chaliokyas presentsitself first in the Korameffi grant of shortly 
* Seethe extracts from Prof. Dowsou's abstract (Jour. M. JLs. 800., P. S., Vol. VIII, p. 1 ff.), whicli are attached to the first account of the Merkara grant (Ind. Ant. Vol. I. p. 360). 
3 Even this detail is wrong ; for the R^shtrakiitas (Rattas)attributed themselves to the Sdmavamsa or Lunar Race. 
3 The wrong statements o relationship, by which each personis made the son of his predecessor, and the perversion of Kalivallabha into KMavallabiia, are thoroughly typical features of such a document,-- It has been suggested (Ind. Jint. Vol. XIV. p. 124) that the first G6vindar&ya represents Gdvinda IL, soe of Krishna I.; and that the proper .order of these two names has been transposed. But 1 see no reason for adopting this suggestion. The composer of the chronicle evidently got hold of some R^htrakilta record which as several of them do, started the genealogy with 06vinda I., and omitted Gdvinda IL, who did not reign.- ChBtarbhnja KanBa^va-Cbakravartin may be, as has previously been assumed, Kannam-Krishna II But, for the reasons given above in connection with the mention of a king AkMavarsha in the Merkara grant, I think that he is more probably Kannara-Krishna III*, , , , , , . - .

after A.D. 1G22.1 The Glx61a Pur4nic genealogy Is, apparently,first met with in tha Paranis which, was composed in the reign of the Eastern Cialiilkya king Kulottunga-Cla6dad&va I. (AJX 1068 to 1112).* And the Pnranlc genealogy of the Eastern G-angas of Kalinganagara is first made known Tby a grant of A.D. 11 18-1 9.3 The Western Ganga prince Marasimta, who lias been already mentioned, and who was a feudatory. probablyhalf independent,of the last three Rashtrakiita kings, Krishna III., Khottlga5 and Kakka II., was a person of no small rank and power. Nothing Is more likely than that lie should follow the general example that was then prevailing. And I tMnk thai the lakslundshwar inscriptions dated in A.B. 968-8994 -wMcla actually represents Mm as the younger brother of a HariYarman -who is plainly the person of thai name -who stands in the third generationin the Table on page 161 above, indicates that lie did so, and fixes very closely the time wlien the Western G-anga geneaJtogy* exMibited in the spurious reeords9 was invented ; the inscription in question seems to me to represent, in a rudimentary form^ the beginning*of a longer genealogy which was elaborated subsequently.5 
I will, in conclusion, state the exact position which. I tafce up in respect of tliese spurious 'Western Qanga records, sad of Mr." Bleeps writings in epnmection with, tbenu I believe tliat any critical mind will admit that my positionis the only sound and logical one. 
And I lay stress on the matter, because, though Mr. Rice lias an opportunityin Mysore,sucli as few people can enjoy, of turning out most vataable Mstorical and antiquarian results, lie is spoiling everything that lie produces, bearing upon early times, "by the manner in which he makes all Ms results conform to the statements of the spuriousrecords and mistaken traditions that abound in that part of the country ; if Ms writings are to meet with the appreciation and cany the weight that they might easily deserve and bear, it is necessaryfor him to discard these spurious records and false traditions altogether, and strike out everythingthat is based on them, and to put forward as history nothing but what rests on authorities that cannot be questioned.6

Certain statements in the records of the KadamTba Mug Mrig6savarmans and of the "Western Chahzkya kings Mangalesa, Pulikesin II., and Vinay&ditya,do provethat in early times9 -during at leaSt the sixth and seventli centnsles A.IX, there really wae a reigning Ganga family in Western India. But the references are all impersonal ; they do not give the names of any individual Gatigas. And3 -while I am ready and eagerto accept any such names, for the period in questioit and for any earlier one, as, may be proved "by authentic evidence, I cannot fall ia with Mr, Bice's view of the matter, wMcii is that, unless I can uslighteu Wm- * to who the real Gangas of the period were,, I am bound to accept those whom lie names from the spurious records that lie has produced.1 I do not demy the possibility of those records containing here,, and there a germ of truth ; in fact, as I will shew,- two instances in point can now "be quoted to that effect. But the records themselves &re spurious3 and were not even concocted in the early times to which they refer themselves. The simple contrast, with, each otter, of the dates wMcJi they purport to fiirnish for Harivaramn and Avinita-Konganij and still more the con trast of those dates with the period which they assert for Sriptorasha-Pritliuvi-Kongani^is sufficient to prove,either that those dates are false, or else that the pedigreeis imperfect;, and, consequently, that we are not even in possessionof veracious facts recited in spurious documents* And I protest against the fabrication of imaginary history by adopting, wholesale, statements which rest solely upon such utterly unauthentic bases ; against draggingin similar spurious records to substantiate them ;a and against complicatingreal Mstory, by? for instance^3 taking tte undoubted fact that there was an early Krishnavarman in the Kadamba family, and then using the assertion of the spurious grantsthat Madhava II., referable, according to them, to about A.D. 400 to 425, married a daughterof a Kadamba Krislinavarmans to establish for the genuine Krishnavarman a date which is considerably too early, and is misleading in a variety of connected matters. 
As matters stand at present, out of the names mentioned in the spurious records, the earliest authentic one* in respect o which we have certainty* is that of flripiinisha Pirithiivi-Konganis or, as he may be more appropriately and shortly called, Srlpiirusha-Miitta^ rasa9 who is referable, no doubt, to -what is to be called the Western Ga&ga lineage, and who is to

His existence and period are proved, not by tte spurious grants, but by stone inscriptionsat Talakad, Sivara, and Sivarpatna, unquestionably genuine, bat unfortunatelynot dated, of which Mr. Bice sent me photographs with the object of inducing my admission, wHclx I give without hesitation, of the genuine existence of afc any rate one of the "persons named in the spuriousrecords. The Talakad inscription, -which speaks of rfenraslia-Muttarasa as the Mahdrdja Prithuvi-Kongani-Muttarasa-Sripurusha, axid describes Mm as reigningas paramount sovereign, would have been, in itself, quite sufficient to establish Mm as a historical personage. And, being- engraved in remarkably fine characters which are fttTJbutaHe to any period about A.D, 800,1 it" makes it quite possible that the fabricator of the Haste and "Nagamaiig&la grants had available* or hit off, true dates for him. But it contains no hint of the genealogythat is given in the copper-plafce grants; nor do the others; andso, of course, these records do not substantiate either that genealogy, or any of the supposed facts that are stated in the course of it. There is, indeed, one other nanie3 which may- perhaps be placedbefore that of Snpurasha-Muttarasa: for, a genuine but undated stone inscription at Debtor in the Naiijangud taiuka, Mysore, engraved in well-formed characters of jjtist about the same period, mentions a iYam&ra, and, without connecting1any title with. ILIS name, describes him, also, as reigningas paramount sovereign ;3 and the existence of a iking1 named SIvamAra, either just before or just after Sripurasha-Muttarasa, and referable to the same lineage with him, is, therefore, also proved. But this record, again, contains no g-enealogic'al information j and so it does not help us to decide whether this Sivamara is the person who accordingto the Sfldi grant3 was the father, and according to the Hos&r and Ifag-amangala grants was the grandfather, of Srlpurusha-Muttarasa, or whether he is the person whom the Sftdi grant represents as a son of Sripurusha-Muttarasa.4 Thus, the existence of one at least, and perhaps two, of the persons named in the spurious charters purporting to belong- to the earlier period, and referable approximately to the period that is made out for one of tliem by those charters, is BOW established. And, taking the later period as represented by tlae spnriotis SidI gr&nt, a genuine but undated stone inscription from Daddahiindi in Mysore, now in the Bangalore Museum,5 establishes the existence, in just abaut the same period, Tbn.fc probably 
1 It includes the old form of the b; as also does one of the Sivarpatna records. I do not find the later form 
of the M or theft in any of the records in question, four in number. I would mnk here a remark on an Incidental point of some importance. The photographs suffice to shew the general standard of these records well enough. But thej do not represent the originals faithfully aud intelligibly ; the reason being that, for photography, the letters were filled in, either with paint or with whitewash, by hand. This practice cannot be too atrongiy condemned; it distorts the characters, introduces mistakes, and frequently renders it quite impossible to decide what the original, really contain. The ancient records, when studied from reproduetiobs, can be properly appreciated and understood only from reproductions which are purely mechanical. 
s Here I write on the authority of an ink-impression, which Mr. JS,ice kinelly sent for my inspecfctou The L, not very clear ; but the record appears not to include the letters Jch and b in either form

after the two persons mentioned above, of a king named Mtimarga- Kongnnivarma- Perm&nadis with tlie title of Mahdrdjddhirdja, and Ms son. Satyavakya-Permanadi, wlio are undoubtedly referable to tte same lineage, and ma*y perhaps be identified with the Ereganga-jSTJtim&rga Kongunivarman and his son Rajamalla-Satyavakya-Kongunivarinan who are mentioned in th continuation of the genealogy as given in the Sudi grant. So, also, the existence of a person named Bfttuga, who is to be identified with the Jayaduttaranga-Bfttuga of the Sfcdi grant, is a fact ; and we have for him an authentic date, A.D. 949-50, which approximates closely to the date given for him by that grant. And very possibly some other authentic naines, "with dates, may be identified with names mentioned in that grant. But further inquiries in this direction would be beyond the scope of the present paper. We are dealing now with the spurious charters which purport to belongto the earlier period. And the point with which we are concerned here, is simplythat the existence of one at least, and perhaps two, of the persons named in those records, viz* Sripurusha-Muttarasa and Sivamstra, is now established, and that to the first-mentioned of them there may quite possibly belong the actual dates that are given for him by two of those records. But we have still to bear in mind that even this does not suffice to establish the truth of anything else that is stated in the records in question ; the records themselves are so clearly spurious, that nothing at all, put forward in them, can be accepted without similar corroboration from extraneous sources. If similar authentic evidence, establishing any other portionsof the alleged earlier history, can be produced,, by all means let it be produced ;no one will welcome it more than I shalL But the spurious records -will remain spurious. And of one thing I am sure, that, unless it upsetsin some -way or other the genealogy that is asserted in those records, nothing will ever be obtained to establish, the dates of A.D. 248 and 466, which they give for Harivarman and Avinita-Kongani 
It only remains to say a few final words about the contents and nature of the spurious Sudi grant, which is now published. 
The genealogy given in it agrees with the Taxrjore and other grants, up to the mention of Bhuvikrama. The continuation of it, from him onwards, is shewn in the Table on page 177 below; together with tlie historical itemss real or fictitious, which it connects with some of the names. It is to be noted that this record differs from the .others, in making Sivam&ra the son, instead of the younger brother, of Bhuvikrama ; and in representing Sripnmsha as the son, instead of the grandson^ of Sivamara. As, however, the grants from which it differs are all spurious, and it is also itself spurious,it would be superfluous to do more than simply draw attention to the discrepancies. Erom Sripurasha onwards, the genealogy, with most of the historical statements, remains to be verified or disproved. At present,I can only say that the genealogy does not seem to agree with that furnished by some records for the same period? which Mr. Bice lias had under examination j1 that the Bashtrakixta records give no indication of an intermarriage with the Gangas in the time of Anaoghavarsha I., who is plainly the king whose daughter Gunaduttaranga-Butuga is said to have married ; and that it is curious that the record* makes no mention of Ereyappa and his son Rachamalla, though it was by . killiog the last-mentioned that Jayadnttaranga-JButuga, otherwise called Permanadi-Butuga, secured tlie Gang-av&di province.2 
The record does contain references to two real Mstorieal events : tbe marriage of Jayaduttaranga-Bfttuga with a daughter of Baddega, i.e. the Bashtrakuta king Amoghavamba Vaddiga (between A.D, 912 and 940) ;and the victory over the Chola king Rjaditya, And it gives a perfectly possible date for Jayaduttaranga-Butuga* in A.D. 938.3

,No. 26.] SRAVANA-BELGOLA EPITAPH OF MALLISHEFA. 185   
Among Professor Eaelhoriiss contributions are* various readings*from, a manuscript copy of the present inscription. This copy was made from a palm-leaf MS. at Madras foi Professor B5hler, by whom it was presented to the India Office Library*1 After the publication of Mr. Rice's Inscriptionsat Sravana-Belgbla, Professor Kielhorn recognised at once that the Madras MS. 
contains a copy of the Mallishena epitaph, and proposeda number of improvements in Mr. Bice's text on the basis of Professor Buhler's copy.3 It appears from Professor Kielhora's* various reading's*either that the Madras MS. was copied from the pillar while the latter was still in a state of more perfect preservation than at present, or that the MS, was based on an independent duplicateof the Mallishena epitaph. 
The alphabet of the inscriptionis Kanarese. The upper and lower portions of some letters o the first and last lines, respectively, on each face of the pillar are drawn out into ornamental flourishes. The language is Sanskrit, verse and prose ; only the two last lines are in the ICanarese language. The only orthographical peculiarities which deserve to be noted, are that dh and 6&, when doubled, are sometimes written as dlidJi and bhbh, and that rnna is written as rnna,$ The object for which the inscription was composed, and the pillar containingit set up,is to per petuate the memory of the Jaina preceptor Mallishena-Maladliarideva (verse 64), who commit ted religioussuicide by sallekhand (line 211) or samddM (L 212), i.e. by prolonged fasting, which, in his case, lasted three days, at Svetasarovara (v* 72} or Dhavalasarasatirtha (v* 70), i.e. at Sravana-Belgola.4 The date of his death wag the day of Svati, Sunday, the third dayof the dark fortnight of Phalguna of the (expired) Saka year 1O5O, which^ corresponded to the cyclic year Kilaka (v. 72). According to Professor Kielhorn's calculation^6 the European equivalent of this date is Sunday, the lOth. March, A.D. lisa. The date of the inscription Itself is not stated ; but the -record cannot have been composed more than a generationafter Mallish6na?s death, because the composer, Mallinatha, was a lay-disciple of the deceased preceptor (1, 222). 
The account of Mallish&na's suicide is preceded by a sort of historical sketch of the Srava:na-Belgola branch of the Digambara sect of the Jainas. It is not a connected and complete account, and cannot even be proved to be in strictly chronological order. The names of some selected Digambara preceptorsare mentioned with much stale and extravagant praise, but not without valuable allusions to contemporary persons and incidents. 
1. The list naturally opens with Vardhamana of the ISTStlia race, the founder of the Jaina religion (v, 1). 
2. Of the three Kfevalins6 the- inscription mentions only G^utamasvamioL, surnamed Indrabkiiti (v. 2). 
3. The SrutakSvalins (v, 3). 
4. Btkadrabfihu^ whose disciple was 5. Chandragupta (v. 4) ; and 6. B^Tindakunda7 (v. 5). In two other Sravana-Belgola inscriptions (Nbs.40 and 108 of Mr. Bice's volume), these three names are mentioned in the same order, amd Bhadrab&hu whose pupil was Chandragupta, is called the last of the Srutakevalins.8

7* Samantablaadra1(v. 6), The composer quotes two verses (7 and 8) which this preceptoris representedto have addressed to an unnamed king, probably of Karalbtataka (Karh&d),* and in the first of which he professes to have undertaken, a missionary tour to Ffitaliputra (Patna), Malava9 Sindliti* Ttiakka (the Panjab), K&fichipiira, and "Vaidisa 
(Besxiagar), 
8. Verse 9 speaksof a person who"broke by Ms sword the solid stone pillar, which, barred the road to the acquisition of the fortune of the kingdom,*' and states that this unnamed person was assisted by the sag-e SimhanSrndixie As noticed by Mr. Rice,3 a similar feat is attributed in the Uday&adiram platesof the Qanga-Bana king Rajasimha, alias Hastinaalla, to the first Granga king, Koiigani,,"who, in his youth, resembling the powerful Sisn (Karttikeya) in gracefulness, cut in two a huge stone pillar with the sword in his hand at a single stroke."* The same plates appear to connect Simhanandin with the mythical founder of the Granga dynasty in stating that"the Ganga race obtained prosperity through the power of Simhanandin/'& I cannot follow Mr. Bice in considering this coincidence between the MallishSna epitaph, and the Hastimalla plates "a most important identification/* but would only conclude from it that the same legendary traditions were known to the composers of both documents. 9.

value is said to record that"many Jainas came from the Nerth. to the Kftficht district In the Kaliyng*a 1451, Sallv^hana-Saka 710,1 in the reignof"Himaaitola-MahAr&ia."It was then a forest, which they cleared and cultivated. In Ms time a schism arose between the Jalnas and tte Bauddhas. Akalankadfeva overcame the Bauddhas. Some o the Baaddhas were intended to be put to death in large stone oil-mills ; but, instead of that, were embarked on ships and sent to Ceylon."2 The manuscript subsequentlytreats o"revenue matters in the time of the Honourable Company"(!). These two accounts and verses 20 to 23 of the Mallish&aa epitaph are clearly borrowed from the same source. I would, however, entirely ignore king Himasltala of Kanctipura for historical purposesas long aa no contemporaneous epigraphical records, bat only legends,are available as proofsof his existence.

30. Srlvijaya,1 was worshipped by an unnamed G-anga king (v. 45). The author quotes verse (46) which, is said to be composed by Vadiraja, and according to which Srivijaya was the successor of H&nasena.

32. Dayapala pi.] (v. 49 f.). 
33. Santideva, was worshipped by the Poysala king Vinayaditya (v. 51). This is tfo only royal personagein the whole inscription, about the identity of which, no doubt remains. Yir-^MitTa,the first of the Hoysalas, ruled about the middle of the llth century of oar era.- 
34. The next verse (52) introduces a preceptor on whom an unnamed IPandya king conferred the title 'Lord'(Svdmtn), and who was known in the court of a king- JLhavamalla under the name Sabdaehaturmnkha. Possibly, this preceptor is identical -with Santideva, to whom the precedingverse refers. If this is really the case, or if, at least, the names of Jaina *ji?V=rsTS e===erated in chronological order in'this portion of the inscription, the time of,king Ahavamalia in verse 52 would be limited by the date of the Hoysala king "Vinayaditya (v. 51) and the date of Mallishena's death (A.D. 1129). Under these conditions, this Ahavamalla may fee identified with the Western Chalukya king Ahavamalla II. or S&mSgvara I. The Pandya I-ing with whom the name of the preceptoris associated, was probably not one of the Madhnti Pandyas, hut one of the Pandya feudatories of the Western Ohalukya kings.3 35.

least we have hitherto found the title only within the current millenary. Among the SvgtSmfoaras it is bonne by several members of the Earshapiirlya-gadbiolilia.* Later OB there appears a separate Maladhaxi-gaehoMiag which must be derived from some eminent Syfet^mbara, named Maladharin ; e.g. two representativesof this gachckha, Gunatilaka and Kshaml^imdam, 
are quoted in Samayastnidam's Sdmdchw^ataka. Tie earliest mention of a Maladh&rra. would be found among the IKgambaraa, if the date Saka-Samvat 975 for Maladh&ri-H&machandra (Mr. Bice's Inscriptionsat Sravana-Belgola, 'No. 55, pp.49, 50, 141, and p. 37 of the Introduc tion) is correct. IB the eleventh eentmry of the Saka era, several Digambaras of the name Maladh&ciddva appear to have lived at Sravana-Belgola. One is mentioned in the Hampe inscription discovered by Mr. Sewell ; and Mr. Bice's book refers to one who was a pupilof Div&karanandi and preceptor of Subhachandrad^va (Saka-Saihvat1041 ;I G. No. 139, pp. 110 and 185), another in Saka-Samvat 1099 (No. 42, pp. 13 and 123) who was a pupil of Damanandin {Saka-Samvat 1040 ?), and a third in Saka-Samvat 1045 (No. 435 pp. 17 and 124). 
[Tliere is a Digambara author called three of whose works are named in Mr. Rice's Skt MS8. in Mysore and Ooorg,the NdgaJcumAra-kdvya (p. 302), the Prdbhritakatraycwyak'hy&na (p- 310), and the Mantravdda (p. 316). TMs author might be considered distinct from the MallisMna of the inscription, wMcii does not refer to any literary products of tlie latter. An argumentnm e& silentio is, however^ out of place tere ; for Mallinathas the composer of tiie inscription, appearsto have been a professional panegyrist,"who knew little of the.ecclesiastical tradition and might Lave easily overlooked eventual works of MaHishSna on theological matters.] 
[I have derived the above information on Maladharin and MallisMna from Dr. Klatt's Jaina-Onoma&ticon, a "book which contains an enormous amount o references, but requires thorough revision and condensation before it can be presentedto the public. Only a specimen of the work was especially preparedfor the press and printedin the Transactions of $ke Berlin Academy for 1892 (14 pages, 4), E.L.]

(V. 9.) The sharp sword of the meditation on the blessed Arliat, which breaks, as a line of stone pillars, the hostile array of destructive sins/ was conferred as a boon on him,5 thought he was a (mere) disciple. Otherwise, how could he, together with "the sage Simha nandin, have broken by (his) sword6 the solid stone pillar, which barred the road to the acquisition of the fortune of the kingdom ? 
CV. 10*) Could the king of serpents, though he possesses ten hundred throats, adequately praise the power of speech, which overcame the crowd of orators, of the great saga Takragrlvaj who, respected by the Ssanadevat&, while the necks of the devils, (0&. all) the disputants in this (world*), were bent with shame, briefly discussed the meaning of the word atha^ during six months.

At first sight this pronoun would appear to refer to Samantabhadra, whose name was mentioned in the pre ceding verse. But, as noticed by Mr. Bice, it is more probable that the pronoun points to the mythical Gang* king Kongaaji ; see p, 186 above. 6 The only possible way in which I can explain the second half of this difficult .verse, is to assume that la meant for ^Rj ^f^cT*

Tiie inscription contains 31 lines of writing- -which covers a space of about 2' 3^ broad by 2r1 high, and is in a perfectstate of preservation. Above tTbte writing are some scralptttres: in the centre, a seated Jaina figure facingfall front, on its proper right a cow with a, caulf,and on tie left a crooked sword or dagger ;and above tkese, on the light the moon, and on. the left tie BUIL_ The averagesisse of the letters is about ^. The characters are Old-BZaxiarese 1^ 
1 angnag03 up to the middle of L 28, is Sanskrit; the remaining lines consist of a, -verse inQld Kamarese. The Sanskrit portionis in prose, excepting that lines 1-3 contain two verses in the Anushtobli metre. In respect of ortliograpliyf I need only" state that the rules o samdhi kave been frequently disregarded, and that the sign of the upadhmdrilya (which does not differ from the sign for r) has been employed in arhataA=Purtt4d@vasya, at the coBmaenceoxent of 1. 3, As regards the languageof the Sanskrit part, L 18 contains the word Jiadapavala (deiaoting perltaps a dependent) wHch is not Sanskrit, and a few other terms which are not Sanskrit occur in tie list of Urudas in lines 10-12. 
The inscription records a grant of land by the Mafodma,ndal$vara, Vijay&clityadLeva of the Sil&Mxa family*1 Opening with two verses3 which glorify the Jaina faith, it gives in lines 8-15 the following genealogy and description of the "donor : In the Silfihftra Kslaatrlya lineage was a prince Jatiga, who had four sons, Gonkala9 G-frrala, KXrtir&ja, and Chandrfiditya. Of 'these, the prince Gonkala had a son named Ml&rasimlia.

'The lord Jina, himself the abode of the sentiment of quietism, (tV> his god- the austere Maghanandin, the saiddMntika, the yogin, himself the abode of the virtue of unweariedness (is or was) his preceptor; the lord Kmad6va, the Sdmanta, () his ruler (or master) ; this (fc) the excellence', this (is) the religious merit, this (is} the advancement of Vasudlva If 
As regards the date of this grant, the year Dandubhi is Saka-Samvat 1065 as a current* (not, as stated erroneously in the text, as an expired) year; anG for Saka-Samvat 1065 current the given day corresponds to Monday, the 1st February, A.D. 1143, when there was a total lunar eclipse 17 h. 23 m. after mean sunrise, which of course was visible in India. 
Of the localities mentioned, Valavada, the place of residence of Yijayadityadeva. had been suggested by Sir W. Elliot to be probably the modern WMwa, about sixteen miles to the south of Kolh&pur ; but Dr. Fleet now suggests that it may be in reality the village of W&lwa (Yalavem) on the Krishn&, abont twenty-four miles north by east from Kolhapur, which gave the name to the "Wllwa t&hik& of the Satar& district. The village of Havina-Heriiage and the place Ajirage, which gave the name to the district in which the village was situated, I am unable to identify.3Lastly, Kshiillakapura clearly is another name of the town of Kolh&pnr (or Kollapura^ itself, where, as we know from an inscriptionat Trd&l and from another inscription at Sravana-Belgola, there was a temple of the holy Eupanarayana, the priest of which was the same M&ghanandisiddh&ntadeva who is mentioned in this inscription as well as in the next.4

No. 28~ INSCRIPTION OF SILAHAEA TIJATADITTA; SAKA-SAMVAT 1073, 
BY B1 . KIEI.HOEN, PH.D., CXE.; GOTTOTGBN. 
This inscription is on a stone which, stands "by the door of a Jaina temple at the Tillage of five miles south-west of K%al, the chief town of the- Klgal State in the K51h&ptur Territory. An account of its contents and a kind of transcript of the text are giyen in Major Graham's Statistical Report of the Principality of Eolhapoor? p. 381, I edit it BOW from a good impression, supplied to me by Dr Fleet 
T-Iie inscription contains 44 lines of writing which covers a spacffle of about 2' I0|*" high by 1' 4f broad. At the end of each of the lines 1-3 and 13 one akshara^ which in each, case can be easily supplied,is effaced* and one or two a^sharas, -which cannot be restored,, are broken away at the end of each of the lines 14 and 15 ; otherwise the mitingis well preserved* At the top of the stome ar some sculptures : immediately above the writing1,in the centre^ a seated Jaina figure, facing full front, cross-legged^ with, the liands joined in the laps and sixtrmcranted by a serpent coiled up behind and displaying seven hoods ; to the proper left of this figure, a crooked sword or dagger and a cow with a calf ; and above these, again, on the righttilts sun, and on the left tike moon. The average size of the letters is about fv. The characters are OldKanarese. The language is Sanskrit* excepting part of line 43 and line 44 wMck are in Old-Kauarese. The main part of the text is in prose., but nine verses occur in lines 1-2, 26-31, and 34-4*3, As regards Ortti0grap!iy9 the sign of the upadkmdntya (which, is like the signfor r) has been employed "before the word Pwrud$vasya in 1. 1, and before jpatydin I, 16 and pitra, in L 17; and instead of the conjunct ddh we find dhdh in the words sidhdhi in I, 10 and udhdhdra in U 19. 
This inscription records another grant of land by the MaMmandaUdvarcs, VijayS-dityaddva of the Sil&lifira family. Opening with a verse glorifying the Jaina faith, which is already fcnown to us from lines 2-3 of the preceding inscription, it gives in lines 2-10 the genealogy and description of the donor as they are given by that other inscription^ only omitting the names of six of Ids more distant relatives (Ktrtirftja, GkandrMitya, Gftrala II., Gungadeva, Ballladva s^id Bhoj&d&va) and nine of Ms less important birudas.1 Lines 11-34 then record that Viiayfidityad.6vas ruling at Ms residence of "Falav&das at the request of Ms maternal uncle, the Sdmanta Iiakshma^a, and for the spiritual benefit of his family/ on the occasion of a lunar eclipse onFriday9 the full-moon tithi of the month. BhMrapada of the IPramddayea^ when 1O73 Saka years had elapsed, granted a field which "by the measure of the Eiandi coimtzy measured one quarter of a nivartana,, a flower-garden measuring 30 stambhas, and a dwelling- homs measuring 12 hastas, all belonging to the villageoi Madapjiira in the district of , naTn[kB;ige^o|las for the eightfold worship of P&i^vaiiathad^va at a shrine which had Been established at the village by Ohodhore-Kamag&vniida3 (the SOB of Sanagaxnayya and Chaih[dha] . . TT^, hnsl>and of Punnakabb&, and father o Jentagavunda and HemmagS-vnnda), and for the purposes of keeping the shrine in proper repair and of proTiding food for the ascetics of the 
shrines having washed the feet of ArhaTiandisiddh&itadftva (probably the superintendent of the shrine), a disciple of Mftghanandisiddh&ntad&va who, in addition to what is stated of him in the preceding inscription is described hero as a pupltx^f Kulachandramuni and ase a sim of the

Linos 3441 coBtain five imprecatoryverses;these are followed in lines 42-43 by another -well kn.O'wn verse in 6praise of the Jaina doctrine ; and lines 43-44 add, in Old-Kanarese, that tliis inscription "wag engraved "by G6vy6ja,the son of the goldsmith Bammy&ja,s and lay~disciples of ATbti r.3.r^adeva. 
As regards the date of this grant, the year Prafh&da is Saka-Samvat 1073, here too as a current (not, as stated erroneously in th text, as an expired) year; and for Saka-Ssbxii-vat 1073 current the given day corresponds to Jfriday, the 8th September, A.D. 115O, when there -was a total lunar eclipse 20 h* 6 m. after mean sunrise, which of course -was visible in In.c3Lia%* 
Of the localities mentioned, in addition to those which have already been spoken, of in the preceding inscription, I am nnable to identify the village of HadafT]ura; and I can only hesi tatingly suggestthat the concluding part of the mutilated name of the district, . . 3pLa/v-U[ka]-< gegolla, may perhaps survive in the name of the town of KHgal, in the neighbourhood of which 
the inscriptionis still preserved.

have Buffered considerably, from exposureto the weatlier or other causes, BO that in several places it Is impossibleto make out the exa'ct wording of the text*1 At the top of the stone are same scnlptore3: immediately above the -writing1,on i>he proper right a cow with a calf, and on the left a crooked sword or dagger ; and above these, again, on the right the moon, and on the left the sun. The average size of the is about !". The chaxaotors are N"S,gari. The 
language is Sanskrit ;and the whole inscriptionis in prose. Both the style and the language are Yery simple ; but ibis record contains several words which apparently are not Sanskrit, the exact meaning of which I do not understand- In respect of orthography^ it need only be stated that the rules of samdki are frequently disregarded. 
The inscription divides itself into three parts. The first part., from line 1 to the "beginning of line 13, records that the MaJidmaqfalSivara V^a~Blidjadevs9 ruling- at his residence of tie 
fort of rraaalaka9 on tlia occasion of the sun's entrance upon MB northern eouxsa9 on Tuesday, the twelfth, Itnmr day of the dark of Pusliya (or PauaiiB) of the y08F9 when 1112 years had elapsed since the time of the Saka king granted a fdlikhaUa* field, wMeh by the Bdenada measure measured 550 vapyak&sfi and in connection with it a dwelling-house measuring 12 hastds, and connected with this again a JchadavalaJka,,4all belonging to, and the field lying1 on tie eastern side of, the village of Kopparavlida in ISdenids* * ^ke four Bi*ahrtianas Adityabiatta, Lakshmidharabhatta, Prabh&karaghaisasa of Ejamiata,5 and Yasiyanagliais&sa, who were settled at a mafha (i.e. a temple or other religions establishment) founded by the Ndyaka Lokana, for performing the fivefold worship of the god Umamahesvara^ a form o Amritesvara (Siva)5 and for the purposes of feeding* the .Br&hmanas dwellingat the matha^ of offering eatables three times a day to the goddess MahMakBhml, and of keepingthe niatha in proper repair. And the inscription adds that the land so granted layto the east of a fearotZa6 field which was to the east of the road from TlravfidablcjA to the fort of Baimale, to tie north of the edge of an empty tank marked by a field-deitys to the west of a ^aranja^ field (or i?ood)? and to the south of two other fields belonging to DSsileya and Cfaendi keya (?). 
On the Mahdman$al&vara Vlffe-BlidjadSva, otherwise known to us as Bhdja II* of tic SllaMra family, it will suffice to refer the ieader to Dr, Fleet's Dynasties of the XEanarew Districts, p. 105, and Dr. Btandarkar's Early History of the JJekkan, p. 95. The date of this grant of Ms corresponds, for Saka-Samvat 1112 expired which was the Jovian year Sadltarana, to Tuesday, the 26th December, AIX U90f when the iitta^ayana-samkranti took place 14 h. "2 m. after njean sunrise, daring the 12th tithi of the dark half of Pausha which ended 19 h. 7m. after mean sunrise of the same day. Of the localities mentioned, Pranaiaka-durga or Pannaie durga the residence of Vtra-BhojadeYa, ie the well-known fort of Pannftla (or PanhSla), about 11 miles Dorth-west of K61hapm% The villageof Kopparav4a I am unable to identify with confidence. The district of Sdenada, to which that village belonged, is mentioned also in a ecpper-plato grant of the SilaMra GandarMityadeFa8 of Saka-Samvat 1032, and in an unpublished stone inscription of Saka-Samvat 1161; and the former of these inscriptions states

that Tlravftda in TSdrn:l<?a, wlucli most probably is the Tiravadabida of this inscription,1 was the residence of GandarMityadova. 
The second part of our inscription (lines 13*19) records that, on Friday, the first of the bright of (or Asvina) of the Paridh&via year, when 1114 years had elapsed elnee the the kingt the NdyaTca Kaliyana, a, son of the above-mentioned Nayoka L6ka$u, gave to the same lour Briiihmanas sorao land and other properly at the agraJidra village 
of Paiiva9 situated in ^ilxizagokhollft* for the purpose of feeding the Br&hmanas at a sattra or alms-house established by [ Ms mother Pftm&kativ& ?]. The property so granted is described as * OBO largest (uttama) nivcvrttana (and) one smallest (JtanisJitha) nivarttana, making thus half a writti (of land) 5 connected with it, half of a first-rate ^uttama) house and one middle-sized 
(madh't/ama) house, and a Mtadawlalca connected with them ;' and, so far as I can make out from the text, this property he,4originally belonged to one Lakhumanaghaisasa,2 -who had sold it to the traders of the Tillage,, of whom it was afterwards ^purchased by Kaliya-na, 
The data of this donation does not work out satisfactorily ; for the first of the bright half of Asvina of joakaSaxhvat 1114, whiqh was the year Paridhavin, corresponds to the 9th September^8 A.D. 1192, which was a Wednesday, not a Friday. The localities I am unable to identify. 
Finally, our inscription (in lines 19*23) records that, on Friday, the fifth lunar day of the "bright half of Pliglgirna of the Pramdiia year9 the same Ndyaka Kaliyana gave to the same four Br&hma#as some land,vwliicli ho had purchased of Mayimkauva, the daughter's daughter of 36m^varabbatta9 a Btudcnfc of the S4mav6da, for the purpose of feeding the pupilsat a school4 established for tlie tttady of the Vodas 
The- year Pram&din of this dat should be Saka*Sazhvat 1115 expired, and for this year the given elate corresponds fco Friday^ fhe 28th. February, AJ>. 11949 when the 5th tithi of the bright half ended 21 h. 44 m. after moan sunrise.

No, 30.] G-AD1G- INSCRIPTION" OF BHILLAMA. 217   
Wo. 30. GADAG- INSCRIPTION OF THE YADAVA BHILLAMA; SAKA-SAMVAT 1113. 
BY F. KIELHOSN, Ps*D.s CXE.; GOTTIHGEN. 
TMs inscriptionis on a stone at the temple of Trikutvara (Siva) at O-adag, the chief town of the Gadag fcaluka in the Dh&rw&r district of the Bombay Presidency.Its existence was indicated, twenty yeara ago, by Dr. Fleet in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. II. p. 298, and I now edit it from an excellent impression, suppliedto me by the same scholar. 
The inscription contains 21 lines of writing which covers a space of about I7 7" broad by 1; 11" high. Excepting that in line 12 three ofe&zro* have been intentionally effaced, lines 1-19 are in a fair state of preservation and may be read with confidence through out ; but the greater partof lines 20 and 21 is broken away, and so is the end of the inscrip tion, probably one or two more lines, of no particular importance* At the topof the stone are, in the centre, a linga aixd a priest ; to the right, a cow and calf witl* the sun or moon above them ; and to -the left, a bull with the moon or sun above it. The size of the letters is between f" and f". Tlie oliaracters are TTagari. The language is Sanskrit,' SpeaMng generally,lines 1-9 are iii verse, and lines 10-20 in prose ; and the inscription apparently ended with other (benedictive and imprecatory) verses. The orthography calls for no remarks* 
The inscription records a grantof land by the YMava, king BMllainadSva (of Dvagri) Opening -with, a verse which invokes the protectionof' Kamsa's foe'(Vishnu),it givesin seven verses the following genealogyof the donor: In Yadu's familythere was a king named S&ronad&va. His son. was the prince MailugidSva. His son, again, was the prince Amaraga&ga. After him his youngerbrother Karnadva became king. And Ms son was the king BMllamadeva, an incarnation as it were of Krishna, who, conquering many countries and acquiring much wealth, rendered the rale of the familyof Hug Svana (or of the Sevana kings) highly prosperous.After this, the inscription in another verse (in Hne 9)states that BMllamadSva had a minister, named Jaitasimlia, who was endowed with the three constituent elements1 of regal power, whose prowess' was surpassing thought, and who was a very scorpion to rulers of districts. 
Lines 10-19 then record that, at the representationof this Jaitasimha, His Majesty Bhillamadeva, adorned with such titles- as< the refogeof the whole world, the lilnsteons 
ofjf'**
favourite of the earth, Mahdrdjddhirdja, Paraw&vara, Paromofciaff**, the ornament of

inscription ended with aa appeal to future rulers to respect this grant, and witli one or m the customary benedictive a,nd imprecatory verses, 
According* to tbe above, the genealogy3 furnished Tby this record of Bhillama,1 is tins:- 1. 
2. Mallugid&a3 son of 1, 
3. AmaragaBga,, son of 2. 4. Karnad&va, younger brother of 3. 
5* BMilaxnad&va, son o-f 4. 
Of these princes or kings, Sevanadeva clearly is the S&ana or Settnachandra of possess two inscriptionsof Saka-Samvat 991 ;s and Amaraganga is the Amaraganggya Hem&dri's VratdkhanifaP also is stated to have been bora from Mallugi, while in the Haral 
ccprer-plates4 of Sing-hanaII. of Saka-Samvat 1160 his name is given before that of Ma ills exact relationship to this prince being*left undefined. Quite new to us are the nai Karaadeira and the statement that he was Bhillaxna's father. The Paitlian copper-plat< Htinacliaiidra of Saka-Samvat 1193 only record in a general way that Bhillama came llallugi ; but the Haralahalli plates distinctly assert that Bhillama "was born from Haling this, too, is the conclusion i^hich. Professor Bhandarkar has drawn from the account c Yadava family given by HemadrL To reconcile these different statements is impossible obliged to choose between them, I would unhesitatingly adopt tiie account givsn "by the pj inscription, because I do not believe that its author could have made a mistake ahoi name of the father of the sovereign whose grant lie was recording-, 
The name of the minister at whose representation this grant was made-, accordingi text, ^ss Jaitasiihha. He of course is the Jaitrasimha who, in line 30 of the Gadag inscri] ^of the Hoysala Vira-Ball&la of Saka-Samvat 1114, is described as the right arm of Bhil and whose defeat by Vira-Ball&Ja is spoken of in thai; inscription. With great probabil has been suggested that this Jaitasimha or Jaitrasimha must be identical with Bhillama' and successor^ Jaitugi or Jaitrapala; but it is somewhat strange that our inscriptionshot silent about the close relationship of both. 
The prose part of this inscription has much in common with, the corresponding porti tie inscription of Vira-Ballala which has just been mentioned. It records a grantma< favour of tie same temple, and mentions the same ascetic as the personagewhose fe< supposed to have been washed by the donor. Tlie date of our ^inscription corresponds fraka-Samvat 1113 expired which was the Virodtakrit year, to Sunday* the SSrd JBH0Sj 11915 when there was a solar eclipse which was visible in India, 10 h. 29 m. after mean sui and the date of Yira-BallMa's inscription is Saturday, the 2 1st November, A.D* 1192. Bet tLese two dates, therefore, Jaitasimha must liave been defeated by Vlia-BallftJa, and mu eouatry Gadag have passed from tibe possession of Bhillama into that of the Ho f rince, a circumstance wldoh imdoubtedly caused somebody to efface BHllama's name ID 1 ^ of this record.

No. 3L PABLA-KIMEDI PLATES OF THE TIME OF VAJRAHA3TA. BY F. KIELHOE^ PB.D., O.LB. ; GOTTINGEK* 
These plates were first brought to Dr. Hultzscli's notice by Mr. G. V. Ramamurti of Kimedi, tlie c^iof town of the ParM-Eamedi ZamJad&rt in, the G-anjam district of the Madras 
Presidency, and were afterwards sent to Mm for examination Tby the Collector of Gafij&ra. They have now "been presented to the Madras Museum by Sri Padmanabha Deo, brother of the Zamindar of Parla-KimedL I edit the inscription which they contain from excellent impres sions, supplied to me by Dr. Huitzsehu 
These are three well preserved copper-plates, each of which measures 9". Jong by from 2f"to 2|" broad. About lTy from the proper right margin, each plate has a round hole, about H" in diameter. The ring which passes through these holes .had not been cut when the plates were received by Dr. Eultzsch. It is 3f" in diameter and f" thick, and -has its ends secured in a slightly oval seal which measures about 1|" by If" in diameter, TJils seal bears in relief a bull couchant, facing the proper left, with the moon's crescent above it, and placed on a plain pedestal which is supported by a lotus flower. Between this flower and the pedestal is the N&gart legend &$-I)[d*]raparano. Esieh of the three plates is inscribed on both sides, but the writing which we now find on the first side of the first plate, and, with the exception of four akshams, all the writing on the second side of the third plate, are apparently later additions, and the inscription proper which these plates contain begins therefore on the 'second side of the first plate and ends at the top of the second side of the third plafce. Of the %vriting within these limits the average size of the letters is about ". The characters, perhaps the most interest ing* feature of this inscription, present a curious mixture** of the N%ari alphabet, as written iu Southern India, and of several southern alphabets, properly so called. Speaking generally,of about 730 aksJiaras which the inscription contains, 320 are written in N"%arS and 410 in southern characters; and the writer has not merely shown his familiarity with several kinds of writing, but has also displayed some skill in the arrangement of the different characters. To show this, it will suffice to draw attention to the manner in which he has written, e.g. y the word parama- mdhesvard in 1. 7, and the same word in 1. 9; GangdmalaJculatilako in L 8, .and Gathgdmala- kulatilakah in L 9 ; stitradhdra in 1. 3, and the same word in L 28; guna and gana in lines 10 and 11; vaJiubhir in 1. 25, and bahulhis in lines. 25-26; yasya yasya and tasya, tasya in 1. 26, etc. As regards the southern alphabets put under contribution by him/ the majority of the characters used is found in the Chera copper-plates of which a photo-lithograph is publishedin the Indian Antiquary, Vol. V. p. 138 ; but some of the characters employed also are peculiarto ^hat Dr. Buraell has called the Western CMIukya alphabet of A.D, .$08, the Eastern (Kalinga) Chalukya alphabets, and even the Chola-Grantha alphabet. It thus happens that, excepting the letters ? (in Erayamardja ii. 1. 13),I (in GJtdla in L 10), I (in Selu$eldga$4% in I. 18, and lomJca in 1. 20), and a few others which would not be expected to occur frequently, every letter At the commencement of this line, about twelve aJcsharas are almost entirely broken awar More than half of thU line is broken away.

another verse giving' -the name of the dutdka (here called djnaptt) in lines 27-28, the whole is in prose.In respect 'of ,ortliOjgrap1iy I have only to state that the consonant b is four times denoted bythe sign for t?

The inscriptionis of the reig-a of a, Gangs king Vajrattastej and it begins, similarlyto the grantsof the Ganga Mahdrdj&s Inclravarman, Dev^ndravarman, and Satyavarman,1just as if it were meant to record a grant "by tli^tt king himself, thus : 
"Om! Hail! From -his vietorioTxs residence of ICalinganagara which, charming -with the delights of all seasons, resembles -tlie town of the immortals, the devout worshipperof ilah&ivara (Siva), who .meditates on tlxe feet of his parents, the ornament of the spotless family of the Gangas, the Mahdrdjddhirdja 3?a,rame$vqra, the illustrious VajrahastadSva, who is freed from the stains of tho Kali ago by his obeisance to the two lotus-feet of the holy GokamasvamiD, the parentof the movable 'and immovable, the unique architect who has constructed, the whole world, -(the god) with -the moon for his crest-jewel who is installed on the spotless aammit of mount Mahtodra ; who by his onslaughtin many battles has roused the shouts of victory; wjiose blessed 'feet are tinged ^ith thick clusters of the lustre of the crest-Jewels of the circle of all chieftains, bowed down fcyhis prowess; and whose fame is purelike the white 
ter-lily, the jasmine, and the moon, and diffused in all quarters".... Then, instead of recording some command of the- kiwg- so described, the inscription in lines 9-15 tells us that "in the reigu of this (Vajrahastad^a),.the devout worshipperof Mahesvara, the ornamentcu_tHe 
Dtoparaja, a dear BOIL of the illustrious CUd^Kamadirajaand a home of ^ ^l 
spotless family of the Gangss, the regentof five districts (jpancha-mshaya),the illustrious qualities, issued the following command to all cultivators or householders (kutumbin)inhabit ing Lankfikd^a; Bo it known to you that, on the occasion of giving (our.) dangater i Mm) in marriage, we have given the village named Hossandi, exemptingit from all taxes, 10 the ornament of the Naggari-Salnkisfamily, the SOB of the illustrious 
Rdjapntra marked with the name of (i.e., probably, named after) the HI 
he has
has illumined the quartersof the compass with the banner of the renown by his victories in xnany battles." 
Lines 16-21 then give an aecotoit of the boundaries^ofthe villag

EPIGRAPHI A IKDICA.   
BIT inabilityof. identifying any of the localities mentioned, I do not fully understand. To the east of Hossandi was G-ula-dda^ and to the south-east Knravagaddas apparently two Tilla^ To tie south and south-west -were a -water-pond and the triangular (?) "boundary-line of (the villages?) Vapavata, CMtragummi, and Hommandl. To the west lay (theTillage?) SSlusel&saddi* thePaliinga hill, and two boulders described as aramgath-patthara and bkaduval&, pattJiara.1 On the north-western corner was the Kanra river and 'S'uliijd (?) rock as far as (the village ?) Asuravli To the north lay the village of Wannnich,addas and a rook in the middle of a Falley f and to the north-east (the village ?) KliandadcM as far as Quladdfi, which must to the Giiladda previously mentioned. This account of the boundaries is followed, in lines21-22, by the statement that the official in charge or headman (? pdlaka) of the village, sogranted, (at the time) was the illusfcrious Ugrakhediraja^3 born in the Nidusanti clan, and called 'the ornament of the spotless family of the Kadamfoas/ 
Lines 23-26 contain the usual admonition not to interfere "with this donation, and cite two of the ordinary imprecatory verses, here ascribed to Vy&sa. Line 27 records^ in anotherverse, that the Ajnapti41(or d&taka) of this grant ^dliarma,') was VachcHbapayya of the K%astha family, a minister of DUraparaja. And the inscription ends -with the statement that it was written by the MaTidsamdhivigrakin DronaeMrya, and engraved by the artimn Namkanchy6m&chari, 
The inscription contains no date, but it would in my opinion^ on mere palosographical grounds, have to he assigned to about the llth century A.D. . Now the Viz&gapatam copper-plate grantsof Anantavarma-Ghodagang-adeva5 mention five Gang-a kings named Vajrahasta ; and since the latest of them, "Vajrattastadeva V.9 the grandfather of Anantavarma Chodaganga who was anointed king on the 17th February, A.D. 1078, must have ruled about A.D. 1035-1070, it does not seem to me at all improbable that he may he the "Vajrahastadeva in whose reign was made the donation which is recorded in our inscription. 
Of the localities mentioned in this inscription, the townKaliAg&oagara (or Kalinganagara)6 and the mountain MaliSndra are often spoken of in other inscriptions of the same family, and well known to nSo The other localities referred to I have not been able to identify. 
I have already stated that these copper-plates contain some additional writing, apparently of a later date, on the first side of the first plate and on the second side of the third plate. On the properleft half of the second side of the third plate there are four lines of incorrect Sanskrit, in southern Nagari characters, which evidently have not been- written by the writer of the inscription described above. The exact meaning of these lines I cannot make out, bufc it would seem to me that they record a donatioai, by means of a copper-plate grant, of the village Homandi (called Hommandt in L 17 of the preceding inscription) by a Rdnaka Udayakhedin, A transcript of the four lines would be as follows : Banaka^ri-TJdaya(?)kMdi k&m[& ?]k[6 ?]- 
mandi ya(?)vad(?)vada grama Homandi 
pravesa t&mvra-s;asana(?) datah chatur-a 
ghata-simasandhi-pray^ntah. 
Begarding the endorsement of four lines on the first side of the first plate, nothing can be said but that it is not in Sanskrit and that, in line 3, it refers to Homandi. 
Pafthara would of course be the Sanskrit prastara,< a stone, rock/

No. 32. ALAMPUKDI PLATE OF VIRUPAKSHA;   
SAKA-SAMVAT 1305. 
Br V. VBNKATYA, M.A. 
A tentative English translation of the subjoined inscription was published in 187 mthe Manual ofthe South Arcot District (page 2, note^), and Mr. Sewell has drawn attention to this translation in his Lists of Antiquities, Volume I. page 207* The original consists of a (single plate which is now in the possession of N&r&yana Sastti of Alampundi,6 a village in the Sefiji (Gingee) division of the Tindivanam t&luk&' of the South Arcot district, and was obtained by Dr. Hultzsch on loan through the Mnd offices of the Collector of the district. The plate measures about 11|;" in height and 6f* in breadth, and is rounded' at the top. Both sides of the plate have raised rims to protect the -writing* -which is in fairly good preservation. There is a hole at the top 'of the plate ; but the ring for which the hole was made, and the seal which that ring may have carried, are not forthcoming. 
With the exception of the colophon Sr^rHarihara, which js in Kanarese characters, the alphabet employed in the inscriptionis G-mntha, which differs very little from its modern form. As in other Grantha and Tamil inscriptions,if a 'group consistingof a consonant and of the secondary form of a vowel stands at the end of a line, the second element of the group is occasionally placed at the beginning of the next following line if no room is left for it at the end of the preceding line. Thus, of d$ of d@uydm (L 9 f.), the ^ iS at the end of line 9 and tbe<2 at the beginning of line 10. Similar instances occur in sau (1. 12 ) and bhyo (L 20 f.). Again, of may& (1. 21 f.) the y is found in line 21 and the A in the following line- Another instance of the same peculiarity occurs in kk6 (L 15 1). Such a separation is impossible in the Tebgu or Kanarese alphabets, because the secondary form of a vowel is there attached to the consonant itself and constitutes along with it a single complex symbol* In the Grmntha, Tamil, and MalayMam alphabets, the secondary vowel forms are distinct symbols which are written either before or after the consonant. Irregularities similar to those pointed out above are thus

raridered possible In theae alphabets, and are of frequent occurrence in Grantlia and Tamil inscrip tions.1 Another graphical peculiarity of the Alampundi plate deserves to be noted. The consonant group &r of the Tamil names Palaknmra, (L 15) and tdnri (I 23) is, in the absence of Orantha letters to represent it, denoted by the group nr9 as It would be vulgarly pronouncedeven BO*W. The laughs6 of the subjoined inscription is incorrect verse (11. 1 to 22, and 26 to 33) and prose (U. 1, 22 to 26, and 34), 
Tke first and second verses of {he inscription contain invocations addressed to the Boar incaffnatioiL of Vishnu and to the goddess of tine Eai*th, respectively. The third verse refers to Bi^karaja (I.), who belonged to the race of th.e Moon* and who was the son of Samgama (I.) by K&mSksIil* Bukta's son was king Harihara (U.) who, as in other inscriptions,2 is said to 
have performed"the sixteen great giftstf(verse 4). Harihara (II.) married Maliadevij who belonged to the family of Bamadeva ; and their son was Virftpfikslia (v* 5), who conquered the kings of Timdlra s Ofaola and P&ndya^ and the SimJmlas, and presentedthe booty of his wars to Ws father (v. 6), OiTthe day of the Pnshya-Baiiikr&iiti of the year BaktaksMn (v. 8), which corresponded to tie aka year 13O594 king VirftpSkslia (v, 7) grantedto certain unnamed Br&hmarias of various gatras the village of Jlampii^di (v, 9). This village had been the object of a previous grant by Harihara (U.) (v. 9) and had then received the surname Jannam toifcafodM (v* 10). Th pronouns mama and maya, in limes 17 and 21 show that both Harihara's previous grant and the present donation of Virftp&ksha were made at the instance of a princess who was the sister of Harihara (II.) (v. 9 ) aiid, consequently, the paternal aunt of Virftpaksha, and itfiiGse name must have been Jann&mbik&s because the village of Alampundi received the surname Jannambik&bdM (i.e. JanBi,m.bika"-Bam.udrani)6 after her awn name* The description of the boundaries of the granted villageis contained in lines 22 to 26. Then follow iihree of the customary imprecatory verses. The inscription ends with the name Sr$-Harihara. 
The Alamp&ndi plate -would add considerably to OUT knowledge of the history of the first Vijayanagara dynasty if we could be quite sure of the genuinenessof the plate. As in other inscriptions of this dynasty, the first historical personis said to have been Samgama (!.) The Alampandi plate is the only inscription which informs us of the name of Samgama's queen ,ms. 
According to the same plate the queen of Harihara II. was MaAlftddvi. The Satyamaiigalam platesof D&var&ya II. give the name of Hariliara's queenas Maiambika* As the two names MalBd&vi and Malambika aare very similar, we may, for the present, consider them as identical. The llampftndi plate adds that Mall8dvi belongedto the family of Hamsideva. It is not impossible that MaH&d&rf was related to the Yftdava Mug Bamachandra^ who was also called Ramadva9 and who reigned from Saka-Samvat 1193 to 1230.7 It is from the present inscription that we first learnt that Harihara II. had a sister called JannSmMka and a son called Virupfcsliaf wlio is reported to have made extensive conquestsin the south5 and wtom bis fatlier appears to have placedin charge of at least a portionof the South Arcot district. The date of the grant of Yirfipakslia (Safca-Samvat 1305 for 1307, the BaktaksM samvatsara) is a few years later than the accession of Horibora II.8 In referring to a previous grant of tbe village of Alampiindi Tby Haribara II iumself5 the inscription implies that the latter "was ruling over a portionof the modern South Arcofc district even before Saka-Samvafc

226 EPIGRAFHIA INDICA.[VOL.HI   
1307, We do not know from other sources that, at this time, lie had already extended H dominions to that partof the country. The earliest inscriptions of Harihara II. that hav^ hitherto heen discovered in the south? are dated in Saka-Samvat 1315.1Consequently, itisat least doubtful if the date of the Alampundi plate can be looked upon as gexraine. If the week day Trere mentioned in the date, it could be verified "by an expert, and the result of such verification would help considerably in deciding whether the .grantis genuine or not. The omission of the -week-day and of the names of the donees may also be urged against the genuineness of the rlocuTnen*. The orthographicalas well as calligraphical mistakes in winch this small in scription abounds, and the uncouth language and construction which., to a, casual reader, render it difficult to say who the actual donor was3 Harihara., Viriipakslia^ or Jaunaxabili are other facts which may be urged against the genuineness of the plate. On the otter hand, we cannot definitely pronouncethe inscription, to "be a forgery, because the date, Saka-Saniyatl3Q5 (for 1307), actuallyfalls into the reign of Harihara II., who, in verse 4, is spoken of as if he ms living' at the time of the grant.s Iii spite of the doubts -which may thus "be reasonably enter tained as to its genuineness^ the grant is interesting as the first known, copper-plate inscrip tion in Grantha characters^ professingto belong to the Vrjayauagara dynasty. 
The objectof the grant, Alampundis is identical with the village in -which, the plate is still preserved. Alampundi was situated in the district of CliencM, which, formed part of tie country of Palakunrakk6ttam9 which was also called after Chixhkapura (V. 9). According to Mr. Grole's Qhingleput Manual, page 438, Palakunrakkottam was situated In the North Arcofc district. But tlie present inscription shows that a portion of the South A.rcot district was also included in this Mttam. Chimkapura is probably the same as SiXtgavaram xiear Gingee in the Tindivanam taluM (No. 146 of the Taluk Hap), and Chenchi is a SartskiHttised form of Sefiji, Tulgo Gingee, the site of a well-known hill-fort. The boundaries of Alampxlndi were: In the east, T^nrientala ; in the noi*th? the Vdganadl (river) ;in the west., Safcti:maiigala ; and in the south, Mafohuvillienatala, Of these, Saktimangala has to be identified with Sattiyamangalam (No. 84 OB the Taluk Map), which is situated to the south-west of Alampiindi. The northern boundary, the Veganadi, does not retain its old name. On the Tindivana*m Taluk Map tiereis a river marked as flowing to the north of Alampundi, but its name is g*Iven as Varh.anadL The same river is mentioned in the Manual of the South Arcot District., where another name of the river is also given, v&. the Gingee5 which is evidently derived from, the town of Gingee, close to Tdaich the river flows in its lower course. Consequently, the V"6g-anadl of the inscription has to be identified with the Var&hanadl of the Taluk Map. T&nrientala ia a Sanskritised form 
of the Tamil name Tanri-endal, which means*a hill on which tdnri trees grow/ The last portion of the name of the southern boundary, &natala, is also a corruption of the Tamil word endal, a MIL' But neither T&nri-^ndal nor Mabhuvilli-endal can be traced on the Taluk Map, 
In the Manual oj the South Arcot District, the colophon J^r^Sariha^a is explainedas the signature of king Harihara II. As, however, all other Vijayanagara grants conclude with the name of some god as Virupdhsha, Vemkafesa or Edma, it is preferable to explainthe coloplon Sr^Earzkara as denoting the tutelar deity of king Virup^ksha, who made the grant, TEXT.3

No. 33. A STOFE INSCRIPTION OF THE SINDA FAMILT AT BHAIBANMATTI. 
BY J. F. FLEET, I.O.S., PH.D., C.I.B. 
Blaairanmatti1 is a village ten miles east o Bag-alkot, the chief town of the tahikaiu the Bijapur district, Bombay Presidency, The inscription is on a stone tablet, 7' high, which stands near a modern and insignificant shrine of the g-od Hamimaiita, outside the village and towards the south, 
The writing covers a space of ahont 2' Of" broad by 5' 6" high near tiie top of the tablet, and, except towards the end, is in an excellent state of preservation. The jSCTtlptnres above it, at the topof tlie tablet, are in the centre, a lingo, ; on the proper right, a seated fignre, and a cobra standing on the tip of its tail, and, above them, a cobra coiled in a spiral, and the sun; and on the proper left, the hull Nandi, and, above it, a cow and calf,' a "crooked sword or dagger? and the moon. Tte characters are Old-Kanarese ; and, as may be seen from the photograph of this record, from an estampage, published in my Pdli, Sanskrit, and Old-Canarese Inscriptions-, No. 865 they furnish, a fine specimen of rather ornate writing of the eleventh century AJX The average size of the letters ranges from f"to f". The language is 'Old-Kanarese, There are two invocatory verses in the first two lines, and an imprecatory verse in line 56-57; and the record itself is in verse from line 10 to line 29. In respect of orthography, the following points may be noticed : (1) the vowel ri is represented by ri almost throughout ; (2) the visarga has become s7i, by samdhi, in sirasli-'karamndan^ line 27-28, and dmtashfcarana, line 32 ; (3) bh is wrongly doubled3 after r, by bfa, instead of by 6, in garbhbham, line 1Z j and (4) there is much confusion between the sibilants, s is constantly used for s$ & occurs for sh in msay-ddhirdja.r L 35; and s7i occurs for s in stiambhavtf, line 1, and in two oth.er words in lines 8, IS. 
The inscription is a record of a branch of the feudatory Sinda family, the members of which are called in it the Sindas of Bagadage9 i.e. of B^galkot ;3 evidently, just before the time of the Sinda Afahdmandal^svaras of Erambarage, i.e. Yelburga, 'some of whose records have already been published,3 they held the subordinate government of much the same tract of country. The inscription was plainly written all at one and tlie same time. But it divides itself naturallyinto two parts, 
As regards historical names3 the first parts lines 1 to 50? tells lis that in the time of the "Western O&aliikya Mng Taila II.*4 and in the Vikrita samvatsara,=A.D. 99O-01S coupled with

. 33.] SINDA INSCRIPTION AT BHAIRANMATTI. 231   
Safca-Samvat 911 "by mistake for 912 (expired),3 there was a Sinda prince named son of Kammara or Kammayyarasa and Sagarabbarasi ;to Pulikala and Revakabbe tliere was bora, the Mahdedittanta Hagditya3 M"agtya9 ,or N&gatiyarasa ; to Nagaditya and Poleyabbarasi there i^a& bom Polasinda ; and to Polasinda and Bijjaladevi, daughter of the KMndava Mandaltlfoara^ tliere was born the Mahdmandalesrara Svyarasaa This latter person is mentioned as a vassal of tlie Western Chalukya king Somesvara II. And this fixes the period A.IX 1069 to 1O76 as the time when the inscription was put on the stone. But the antique 
expression raji/am-gei/ye, in line 43 shews that the opening part of It was taken from some record which had been drawn up more or less synchronously with the date that is givenin connection with Talla II. and Pulikala* "This partof the record registers the fact that in some unspecified year, on a, Sunday combining the uttardyana-samkrdnti or winter solstice with the Vyatipata yoga, 
the Mahdsdmanta N&gaditya had granted to a priest named Paratraya-Siihharagibhatta afield, measuring one thousand mattars by the measuring-rod of Pattiya-Mattaiira,4 at the villageof Koriya-Siriiiray5 and that th0 aruvana, or tax on the field, was twelve gadydnas. 
The second part of the inscription, from line 50 to the end, registers a grant,at a village named Pnradakeri,6 which the same Mahdsdmanta Nagditya had made to a priest named T&jorasipandita in the time of the Western ChSinkya king Jayasimha U., when the latter 
was reigning at Kollipake, in the Srimukha samvatsara, Saka-Samvat 955 (expired), = A.ZD. 1Q33-34: ;7 and it adds that this priest3 who was the AcJidrya of the god Sind7ara, eSected some repairsto the temple of that god. 
A special point of interest in this record is the legendary account as to the origin of the Sinda family, and of its name. These Sindas claimed to belong to the IBTagavamsa or race ojf liooded, serpents, to carry the ndga-dhvaja or phani-patdkd, i.e. the banner which line 41 of tlie text explains as bearing representations of the Haga kings Ananta, Vasugi (more properly Vasiiki), and Takshaka, to use the vydgJwa-ldnchTianaor tiger-crest, and to lia-ve the hereditary title of"lord of BhoggLvatij the best of towns/9 -which place,in Hindu mythology, -was the capitalof the ISTaga king Vasuld in Rasatala, one of the seven divisions of PlLtala or the subterranean regions- And, by way of accounting for all these attributes, and for tlie family-name, the record tells us that the eponymous founder of tlie family was a, eeTtaixL** long-armed" Sinda9 a human son of the serpent-king Dharanendra, bom at j^lilclxclxb.atra. in tlie region of the river Sindlrag i.e. the Indus, and reared by a tiger Tliis Sinda is said to have married the daughter of a Kadamba prince,8 and to have had by her thtree sons, who established the family of the kings of the Sinda race. They appearto have been the first of a li;ne of thirty-one successive rulers. And after them, at unspecified intervals, there came another prince named Sinda, and then Kammara or Kammayyarasa,the father of Pulikala, 
The eponymous**long-armed Sinda5?figures in records of also another branch, of the Sinda famaily ; for instance,, in an inscription of about A.D, 1165 at Harihar (Pali, Sanskrit, and Old

But that system bad then gone out of use in the part of the country to which this record belongs, and had^heen superseded by the southern luni-solar system, according to which the sariwatsara in questioncoincided with Suka Samvat 913 current ( 912 expired). Further details of the date, the month, etc. are not given* 
s This name seems to represent the Kanarese Tiuli>*tiger/ and fcdlti,* foot or leg.'~ * This seems to be a family or territorial designation, rather tban a personal name, And, in fact, the dictionaries give the word Jchdndava as the name of a region.

There is then introduced Pulik&la's genealogy : Saying : I will behold the region of the earth which is so belauded by the sons of men," there came {from tTie lower regions) Bh.aranndrat the serpent-king (L 10), leaving his army behind him out of respect, both he and his wife, through the affection that existed between them ; and then, on her becoming pregnant, there was born to Ms lady, at Ahiokchliatra (L 11-12) in the region of the river Sindhu, a prince named Sind.a (1. 12), resplendent with lustrous glory. Being much perplexed {at the birth of a son in human form), the serpent-king said to a tiger :"Carefully preservethis child in safety* 3(L 13). Thereupon the tiger, preferring in turn his own request to the lord of snakes, said :M Cause him. to become a great lord of the earth" (L 14). And so the boy was nourished, and, becoming the lord of the Sinda country (L 15) and practising exalted and brave precepts, 
developed long arms of prowess which surpassed everythingelse on the earth. When the lon^-armed. lord Binda joined his hands and closed his eyes {in respectful request}, the lord of tke Itadamfoas (1. 16) through affection gave him his daughter ; and, he having taken her, during the time that he lived in dalliance with that charming woman, there were bom three sons (1. 17), from whom there sprang those who were born as kings in the most exalted race of the Sindas (1. 18). 
Wliile they, tliirfcy-one {in succession),1 were governing the BSgadage district with freedom from anxiety, there was born {another) prince named Sinda (L 19). Glorious on the earth, through the Sindas of Bagadage (L 20), is the lineage of the Sindas, -which came without a break from the long-armed Sinda ; and famous was he who \viis named Kammara (L 21). Amidst the praises of the world, to Kammayyarasa and to hia wife Sagarabbarasi (L 22) there was born Pulikala (L 23). To the king PtOikSla and to R&valtatobe (1. 24) there was born king N&gsttya (L 24). To the brave king Hagatya and to IPoleyafoto&rasi (L 25) there was bora Polasinda (1. 26), an ornament of the Sinda race. ^Ar&cl Jiis sow is) king &vya (L 28-29), pure by both lines of descent; for, his mother was BijjalacL^irl (1.27), daughter of th.eKhan.dava MandalSsvara (1. 26), and his father was that STIZL of tlie SiudaSj who had tlie banner of the hooded serpents.

BY H, KRISHNA SASTBI ; BANGALORE. 
The copper-plates -which bear this inscription, belong to a Brahmana resident of the village of Kuniylir in tlie AmMsamtidraia taluka of tte Tinnevelly district^ and were sent to Dr* Hultzscli for examination by Mr. T. Yarada Bao5 Acting Head Assistant Collector of Tinnevelly, in December 1890, I edit the inscription from two sets of ink-impressions, whioh 
were iindly made over to me by Dr. Hnltzsch, who has already noticed it briefly in Ms Progress Report for October 1890 to March 1891J* 
The original consists of seven plates, measuring 8| inches in height from the middle of the bottom to the middle of the semi-circular top, and 6| inches in breadth between the two parallel sides, the height of which approaches to 5f inches. The ring-hole, which is a little more than %* in diameter, is bored just f" below the rounded top." The plates are strung on a ring witli the seal which contains the figure of a boar facing the left, the legend Sr%- VemJcatgfa, and representations of the sun and the moon"(loo. dt.). The first and last of the seven plates bear writing only on the inner side, while the rest are written on both sides. The second side of the first plate, where the inscription begins,is marked with the Telngu numeral*one' to the proper rightof the ring-hole, while the remaining plates are similarly and regularly numbered on their first sides. From the appearance of the impressions I infer that the original plates have raised rims, and that those letters at the beginning and end of lines, which are indistinct on the impressions, may be quite clear in tlie original.

No. 34] KtJNXYUR PLATES OF VEKKATA II. 237   
As otter grants of the third Vijayanag-ara dynasty,the present grantis written in the HaBdin&garl alphabet. The writer has been very careless and quick,so much so5 that the letters ya, t;a da and ta assume various forms and that, in conjunct consonants, the several parts are often not easily distinguishable. Several erasures and insertions are made, the most import 
ant of which are pointed out in the foot-notes* The writing on the whole of the first side of the sixth plate and on the latter part of the seventh is very small, evidently owing to want of space. A graphical peculiarity which I have noticed in this and in the Vil&paka grantof Venkata I.,1 an impressionof which Dr. Hultzsch has kindly given me, is that the group rya 
is expressed "by combining the full form of r with the secondary form of ya ; hut in four cases (in lines 9 and 15, and twice in line 255), the r is, as usual, written over the line. Other consonants following r are written in the usual style, with the exceptionof rma in line 170, where the secondary form of m is affixed to the full form of r. The vowel n is never used at the beginning of words, but is then expressed by rt, rw, and even r*(lines 176, 182, 184 and 241). Ma is written as gjna in two cases (lines 11 and 143). The prefixingof y and * to 
certain vowels, the interchangeof the dental and palatal sibilants, the insertion of superfluous anvtsvdra*, wisargas and punctuation-marks,the assimilation of consonant-groups, and similar vulgarisms are not uncommon in this and other grantsof the third Vijayanagara dynasty. Comparatively speaking, the present inscriptionis on the whole correct. 
The language is Sanskrit verse in various metres. The poetryis of the poorest possible kind and deserves that name oniy because it conforms to the laws of metrics. Line 249, which is in Telngti prose, is engraved on the upper margin of plate vii and was evidentlyinserted after the engs^avirigof the whole grant liad been finished. 
The composer of this inscription and of the VilapS&a, Xondyata,* and Kallakursi4grants of Verikata I., Venkata IL, and Banga VI. is stated to have been one and the same person,.m*. Rama, the son of Kftmakoti and grandsonof SabMpati;while the engraversof these TOUT grants were Kamay^charya (the son of Ganapaya and youngerbrother of Virana), Achyutary (the son of Ganapaiya and grandsonof Vlran&chArya), and SdmanfctMrya (the son of ****** 
aixd grandson of Ganapayarya).It thus appearsthat Achyutfcrya, Tirana and Kamayaonary were brothers. The engraverof the DevanaHalli grantof Banga II.' was Ganaparyatoe son of Viraria. Evidently the descendants of Vlran&cMrya ^ere the hereditary engraversat^n grants of the Mngs of the third Vijayanagara dynasty. Their relations are shown in tne following

The inscription, ends with some additional clauses regarding the grant5 three verses (124*126) referring to Venkata II., the composer and the engraver, five of the usual imprecatory verses, and the name of the god $r$-Vemkatsa.1 
The first partof the inscription opens with invocations of the god Venkat&sa (line 1) } the feet of K&ma (verse 1), and the god VIshvaksena (verse 2). The genealogy begins with the .Moon (verse 3) and some of his mythical descendants (verse 4) The next verse contains a number of royal names which the composer appearsto have introduced in order to connect his patron witk certain well-known ancient dynasties. Thus Wanda is the representative of the dynasty wMtsh was subverted by the Mauryas ;Olmlikka and Itajanardndiray of the Chalukyas ; and Bijjal^n dra, of the Kalachnris. Vira-H0mmali3*aya9 the lord of May&puri9 is probably identical with., the Kalachuri king Perm&di (Saka-Samvat 105 O).3 The fourth after HemmMi is reported to have been T&ta-Pinnama (verse 6), with whom the regular genealogy begins- The only difficult point in this long list of kings is the relation of Baxiga, the father of Venkata II., to his pre decessors. Dr. Hultzsch has conclusively shown3 that th word pwrvam, formerly9* in verse 24 of the subjoined inscription refers to Bama H.f and that Dr. Oppert's arrangement of the third Vijayanagara dynasty4 is opposed to facts. One alteration has to be made in Dr. HtdtJBseli'fi table ;5 as recognised by Dr. Oppert,6 Raiiga VI. was not the son of G&p&la, but the son of China- or Pina-Venkata? and the adopted son of Gdp&la.? In the annexed genealogical table, the Arabic figures prefixedto names show the order in which the latter are mentioned in the copper-plate grants. 
The second of the kings of the accompanying table, S6mid6va, is said to have taken seven forts in a single day from an unnamed enemy ( verse 6 )* Pinnama II. is styled theu lord of the city of Araviti"( verse 7 ). His son, Bukka, is said to have"firmly established even the king dom of S^l.uira-H'risimlia.319 From this statement we may conclude that he was the minister of the third king of the second. Vijayanagara dynasty,, Nrisimha or ISTarasimlia, whose inscrip tions are dated in Saka-Samvat 1404 and 1418,8 and -who bore the surname S&luva.9 BegardiDg Bukka's son, Hama I., we learn from two other grants10 that he took the fort of Avanigirifrom Sapada or Sapata, whose army consisted of seventy thousand horse, drove away K&sappodayaor Kasapudaya, and captured the fort of Kandanav61i. Both Muhammadan historians and European travellers inform us that Kma H. was the powerful minister of the puppet king Sadsiva, the last representative of the second Vijayanagara dynasty^ whose sister he took in marriage as we learn from an inscription of Sadasiva.11 BlLuaa II. and his youngest brother Vexikatsidtri lost their lives in the famous battle of Tallkota on the 23rd January, A.D* 1565. The second brother, Tinimala I., continues to acknowledge the nominal authority of Sad&siva in four inscriptions near V&Mr in the North Arcot district^ which are dated on the 5th February, A3). 1567.13 He is said to have transferred the seat of government to Pennals:ori.da in that very

year.1 His second son, Banga II., is actually called Hug of Benugonda (verse 19). The same town was the residence of Venkata II., to whose time the subjoined inscription belongs (verse 32) The description of the reign of Venkata II. and the list of his birudas (verses 33-37)are altogether devoid of historical value, because they have beon copied over from theinscriptions of fcis predecessors. Thus, verse 33 of the Kuniyur grant (= verse 36 of the Zondyata grant), which records that Venkata II. was anointed by his family preceptor Tatayarya and that he destroyed the Tavanas (i.e. the Muhammadans), is already appliedto Venkata I. in the "Vilapaka grant. 
The third partof the inscription (verses 49-54) supplies the following genealogy of Tiramala ISf&yaka (of Madhura), who is well-known on account of the magnificient buildings with which he adorned his capital.

Tillage of Kftniyfir (verse 46), which was surnamed Muddi?k?islinapirram (Terse 45) OTideatlyafter Muddukrishna, the father of the donor, Tiramala. The village was situated in the ViravanaUiiru-magMBi, in MiOJi-na^Ti,in Tinradi-rajya (verse 41), to the south of tfae Taniraparai river and of Bhrantamangala, to the east of BSrisJrareM, and to the west of SeravanmaMdevi (verse 42 f.)- According to verse 119, it was situated on the bank of the Kttrnatoka (i.e. Karnataka) canal, and accordingto verse 122,"on the western "baxtk of the canal -which flows to the south." The Map which accompaniesthe Twmevelly Manual, shows two of the boundaries of Kuniyur,viz. Shtemfiddvi (S6ravanmahd6vi) and, to the west of it, KaraikurieM (? Karakurchi), both situated in the Ambasamudram taluM and to the south of' the Tamraparnl river, The mdgMni in which Kiiniyiiris stated to have "been situated, was evidently named after Viravanalliir^ a villageto the west of KaraLkmichi- The term Tlrvadi-r&jyais perhapsderived from the Tamil tiruvadi, "the sacred feet"(of the king). The Karnataka canal on which Kuniyiir was situated, reminds of the"Kannadiyan channel ;"* but the two can hardly be identical as the"Kannadiyan channel"does not appear to extend as far east as KaraikurieM and Shermadevi. 
In the list of donees occur many names of Tamil origin. Most of these are derived from the designationsof certain templesof Vishnu and Siva in Southern India* Thus, Alagadri is called after the sacred hill of Alagarin the Madura district; Yenkatadri,* Veitkatapati, Ve%adatt-appa, Tixnm-arasu, Tirumala, Tiruv^ngada, Vadamala and SesMdri are derived from different names of the temple on the hill at Tirupatiin the North Arcot district; Yaradabhatta owes his name to the Varadar&ja (Arul&la-Peramal) templeat^Little KSnchi in the Chingleput district; Ranga. and Bangar^jarefer to the templeat Srimngmn in the TricMnopolydistrict ; and Ahdbala is the Bame of a village in the Kanml district, "which contains a famous shrine of Narasimha. Among the Barnes connected with Saiva temples, Arura is derived from Tiruv^rur in the Tanjore district., andis^ commonly applied in Tamil literature to Snndaramurti? one of the sixty-three Tiruttondar or Saiva devotees ; Kanakasabhfipati is a name of the god at Chidambaram in the South Arcot district, and Chidambar&vadh&nin is called after the same place; Chokkanllthamakhin and Chokkavadhanm are derived from Ctokkan^thasvamin, one of the names of the god at Madhura ; K&lahasti is the name of a famous place of pilgrimagein the North Arcot district ; and Arunagiri and Arun&dri are Sanskrit names of Tirnvannamalai in the South Arcot district. Among the remaining Tamil names, Perlyatiruvadi is synonymous with Periy&foar, the name of one of the twelve principalsaints of the Vaishnavas. JLlvar (i.e. dlvdr in Tamil) is an epithet which the Vaishnavas add to 
the names of their gurus, and ndyandr, the first member of 15fain&rbhatta? is an honorific title affixed to the names of Saiva devotees.

In the Indian Antiquary,, Vol. XIX. p 2S, I have already had occasion to shew that the date of this inscription, for the expired Vikrama year 1016, correspondsto Saturday, the 14& January, AJD. 960. This date enables us to prove, -with a fair amount of certainty, thafc the sovereign Vijayapaiadgva* to whose reign the inscription professesto "belong, was a Mug of Kanauj. In the Spigraphia Indicia, Vol. II. p. 235, 1 have attempted to shew that the three kings Vijayapaladeva,, Rajyap&ladeva and Tril&chaBapalad^va, who are mentioned in the Bengal Asiatic Society's plate of TriI6ciaiiap&la, edited by me in the Indian Antiquary, ToL XVIII. p. 33 fL were rulers of Kanauj ; and as that plate, for Triioohanapalad^a, gives us a date correspond!ng> to the 26th June, AJX 1027, there would, so far as regards the two dates, 'be no objection to identifying the Vijayap&ladeva of the plate with the YijayapaladSva of the present inscription (of the year A.D. 960). And such an identification is supported "by the fact that the Vijayapaladeva of this inscription is here stated to have been preceded "by KsMtip&Iaclm* For we know that a king of this name, also called Mahipala and Herambapala, was actually ruling at Kanauj in A.D. 917-18, forty-two years before the date of our inscription.* It is true that, according to the large Siyadoni inscription,3 Ksfaitipa!adva of Kanaiij in A*D* 948 had been succeeded (not by Vijayap&ladSva, but) by Devapaladeva ; but this would seem to be no very formidable objection to the proposed identification. For it might either be said that Tijayapaladeva was a younger brother of Devapaladeva, in which case the omission of the elder brother's name from the ptseut inscription would nofc be without precedeot ; or we might assume that Dvap&ladva and Vijayapalad^va are two names of one and the same Mng3 an assumption in favour of which it might be urged that eacls of the three predecessors of Devapaladeva Bhoja, MahSndrapala, and Kshitipala also bore each at least one other name. For the present, then, I do identify the Kshitipaladva and Vljayapaladeva of this inscription with the sovereigns of the same names, known to us from the SijadSnt inscription and the plate of Trilochanapala ; and consider the MahdrdjddMrdjti Paramesvara ICathaxiadeva, who made the grant here recorded, to have been a feudatory or subordinate of the kings of Kanauj.4 Of this Matnanadeva and his predecessor 8&vata nothing is known to me from other inscriptions ; and I have not found elsewhere any mention of the Qurjara-prstiiifira elan or family, to which they are stated to have belonged* The clan perhapsis identical with the Vafag&jcHra-va&fa (* the Bargujar tribe of Rajputs ')* mentioned in line 8 of an inscription at M&ehftdt, of, Vikrama- Samvat 1439,6 of which a rough photo-lithograph was publishedin the Arch<& logical Survey of India, Vol. VI* Plate xi. 
Of the localities mentioned, B&jyap-ura, apparently MathanadSva's capital,is of course K&j6r or R&j6rgadh^ or rather P&ranagars close to the modern village of Bajfir, where the inscription has been found ; and the village of Vy&gliraptaka Is said to exist still, near Kajor, under the name of Baghor*6 The place Vaiixsapdtafca* which gavethe name to the bhdga or district to which the Tillage belonged,I am unable to identify. Nor can I Identify the places Amardaka and Clih&ttarasiTa, which are mentioned in connection with the ascetics

268 EPIGRAPHIA IN DIGA.[Toiu ni really is in a state o excellent preservation. The plates are held together by a circular ring about y thick and 2f in diameter, which had not been cut when this record came into Dr. Fleets hands. The ends of the ring are socketed in a seal, of which the surface is circular, about 2$* in diameter. This seal has, in high relief on a counterscmk surface a representation of Garuda, with the body of a man and the face of a bird, squatting full-front with the hands clasped on the breast. The weight of the three plates is 224 tolas, and of the rmg and seal, 32J tolas ; total, 256| tolas. The engraving is bold and good. The plates being suhstential, the letters, though fairly deep, do not shew through on the reverse sides at all the   
interiors of some of them shew marks of the working of the engraver's tool._The size of the letters is about &. The characters are Nagarl, and the language is Sanskrit. Up to nearly the end of line 39 the inscription, after the introductory 6m 3m namd VindyaTsdya, has 24 verses chiefly containing genealogical matter. The rest, being the formal part of the grant, is in prose' but includes, in lines 49-50 and 74-82, a well-known verse on the vanity of this life and seven of the ordinary benedictive and imprecatory verses. As may be seen from the occasional omission of single aksharas and groups of akskaras (e.g. in lines 38 and 54) and from the frequent occurrence of wrong letters, the writer has done his work in a rather slovenly manner As regards orttiograpljy, the letter b is throughout denoted by the sign for v; the dental sibilant is frequently used for the palatal, and the palatal three times for the dental (in atid 
I. 3, tekala, 1. 37, and Jamvatsara, 1. 54) ; and the dental nasal is employed instead of the guttural in the words anka, 11. 5, 32, 54 and 89, and Konkana, 1. 56, and instead of the palatal in Jednchanam, I. 78. In respectof the language, it may be noted that the text in line 45 offers two U-rudas, Malagalaganda, 'a conqueror of mountains (?)/ aud Nannisamudra, 'a sea of truth,' which are not Sanskrit, and that it also contains some proper names with Kanarese endings, in lines 64 and 85-86. The word dramma, abbreviated to dra, which occurs in lines 
88-89, is often met with in cognate inscriptions. 
The inscription is one of the Silara1 MahdmandaU^vara AparajitadSva. It clearly divides itself into two parts. The first part, up to line 39, gives the genealogy of Aparajita himself and of the Batta (or Rashtrakuta) kings, to whom the earlier Stlara chiefs owed allegiance;2 and the second part records the grant of the village of Bh&dana, made by Aparajitain Saka-Samvat 919 in favour of (the temple of) the god (Surya under the name) Lonaditya, at I>avanetata.' 
Opening with the words '6m, 6m, adoration to Vinayaka/ the inscription first has two verses (oneof which is well known to us from Rashtrakuta inscriptions) invoking the protection of the gods Vishnu, Siva, and Brahman. It then gives, in verses 3-12, the following complete list of the seventeen Bashtrakuta kings from Q6vinda I. to Kakkala -.* I, Odvindaraja ; 2 Karkaraja; 3, Indraraja; 4, his son Dantivarman ; 5, Karkaraja's son Krishnaraja'; 6 Oovindaraja; 7, his younger brother Dhruva; 8, his son Jagattunga ; 9 Burlabha Amdghavarsha ; 10, his son Krisanaraja; 11, Jagattunga's son Ii^draddva Wityanivarslia" 12, his son AmSghavarsha, who is said to have ruled for one year; 13, his younger brother

'yen in Dr. Bhandarkar's J3ct<rly History ofthe Dekkan, p. 57, as amended by the same scholar fa the Journ. Bo. As. Soc. Vol. XVIII. p. 240 ft.; and the only points new to us are the name Dnrlablia for the first Amoghavarsha (No. 9), and the remark that the second Amoghavaraha (No 12) ruled for one year only/1 This account of the Rashtrakutas, in verse 13, closes with the statement that (whenthe granthere recorded was made) the last king Kakkala had been overthrown by (the Western Chalukya) Tailappa, as a lightis extinguished by a fierce wind, 
and that of the once flourishing Batta rule there remained only the memory. Verses 14-24 then givethe following genealogyof Aparajita himself, already known to us from other inscriptions: the mythical beings JimiitakStu and his son Jimutavahana,' the ornament of the iilra family ;* Kapardin; Pulasakti; his son Kapardia; Vappuvanna;* hi. son Jhafijha ; his brother aoggiraja 5 his son VajjadadSva ; and his son Aparajita. What is new here, is, that Aparajita, accordingto verse 20, also bore the name Mriganka.s After these verses, the proper objectof the inscriptionis stated in prose,in lines 39-66 : 'After the down-fall of the Batta rule,4 consequenton the extinction of the Paramathaftdraka MMdjctdMrdjaParamMeara, the glorious Kakkaladera, who had meditated on the feet of thT P M P., the- glorious KhottigadSva, who in turn had meditated on the feet of the PUP, the glorious Krishnarajadeva, (kings) who formerlyresided at the famous ManyakhStaka,-- the Mahdsdm,,ntddhipati MaMmandalMvara, the glorions AparajxtadeTBi&ja, who by virtue of his might has attained the pafchamahMabda,and is adorned with such titles as "the supreme lord of Tagarapttra, the Silara prince, he who is begotten, in the lineageof JimMaTanana, who has a golden Garuda in his ensign, a great ocean of pnde a conqueror of mountains (?),B a god of love among heroes,* the possessorof annate knowledge,? the^frontal ornament of the Western Region, a sea of truth, a sun of fierce sp^^ Santvtra^aya, .to., ..... informs all personsas they may be concerned the future occupant*, of the village (to be mentioned below), feudatories, rdjaputras and heads of towns, and the chief and

The villageof BMdanas so granted, (according to lines 57-62) was bounded on the north "by a bMnndra (?)field of the villageof Padigah.af on the west by (the village of) ABaehcliliadi, oa the south by the great river Murula, and on the east by the river Kizmfolxtoi ; and was given with its rows of trees, up to its proper boundaries, with the udranga and parikara,1 with the exceptionof what had been previously givento gods and Br&hmaz^as, but together with (the fines imposed for the commission of) certain great and lesser offences,3 and with, the privilege that it was not to be entered by the irregular or regular troops. 
Lines 66-82 contain the usual injunction to preserve this grant intact, threaten with spiritual punishment those who might interfere with its provisions, and quote seven of the ordinary benedictive and imprecatory verses* The inscription then (in line 82) continues time : * In confirmation of the above, the MaJidmandalevar&9 tie glorious* Apa^jitedvar&j tas it put down (here) by the writer's hand that this is his decree, (in the words)"such is my decree, that of the glorious Apar&jitad^varja/f(issued) while by the glorious king's8 appointment the illustrious Sa&galaaya is MaJtdmdtya41 and the illustrious Sihappaiya Mahdsdndhivigrahikaf This charter6 has been written at the direction of Sangalaiya (?) by Ms son and deputy Annappaiya. It is deposited at Sthfinaka, Everything without exception that is written here, be it right or wrong, should be regardedas authoritative/ 
Lines 87-89 then record an additional settlement by which the town (itis not clear which. town?) was to give every year 260 dramnias, I do not understand for wLat exact purpose. And the inscription ends with the vordfl&bliss, great fortune/

Judging "by a large number of other dates, any rite specially connected with the Samkranti shcrald in this case have "been performed on the 25th June, and this day should have Inaen described in the text as the second of the dark half, both hecanse the second tftJiA ended on its S h. 7 XD. after -mean 8-mm.m, and because the Saodar&ati took place during' that tithi* As no

Of the localities and rivers mentioned in the inscription, BMdana-grama clearly is the Tillage of* Bhadanah*or* Badana*of the maps, about mine miles east by north from Bhiwandi. Two miles north of it is the Tillageof*Padg&a* orePadghe*or*Padgieli,* the IPadigatta grSma of the grant ; and east of it is a small river, the6 Knmbari5orfKontbaree,*tie Kum tohfirl of the inscription. This river flows into tie UlMs, which, flowing generally from north east to south-west, might fairly be called tie southern boundary of BMd&aa, and is BO donM the greatriver Mumia of the grant.

No. 38. FOUR ANCIENT TAMIL INSCRIPTIONS 
AT TIRTJKKALUKKUNRAM. 
BY V. VJSNKAYYA, M.A. 
Tirukkalukkunyam, or Pakshitirtham as it is called in Sanskrit, is a large Tillage in the Chingleput district on the road from Ohingleput to the port of Sadras, about half-way between both. There are two temples, one in the village of Tirukkalukkunram, called VMagirisvara, and another, named Bhaktavatsala, on a neighbouring hill. Of the fora- subjoined inscriptions, which are engraved on the wall of the strong-room (tiruv-dbharana-1cotta&) of the VSdagirfsvara temple, three were already published in the Madras Christian College Magazine? frompenciltranscripts prepared by myself on the spot. At the suggestion of the Editor, I BOW republisb, from inked estampages, these three inscriptions, along with a fourth, which was not yet published, but only referred to in one of my former articles.8 
That part of the wall where these inscriptions are found, is disfigured by a number of mason's marks, which are noticed in the footnotes to the texts. These marks consist, in most cases, of Tamil numerals, engraved probably before attempting to pull down the wall with a view to repair the temple. The numerals would indicate the order in which the stones had to be arranged while rebuilding the wall. This custom of marking is still prevalent in Southern India, as may be seen on the walls of the temples at Madura and Chidambaram, which have been lately repaired, and of the Ekamranatha temple at Conjeeveram, which is now undergoing repair. In these places the numerals are not cut with the chisel as at Tirukkajukkunram, but painted on the stones with tar or chunnam. The alphabet and language of the four subjoined inscriptions is Tamil; but a number of words of Sanskrit origin are written either wholly or partially in Grantlia characters. The following is a list of such words and syllables, with the exception of the two words svasti M, which occur at the beginning of every one of these inscriptions and are, as a matter of course, written in the Grantha alphabet. e lf Uv=ird3a> sa of Msa > aDd farmrna (for varma) ; 1. 3, Srl-M&lasthdna ; L 4,

This inscriptionis dated in the 27th yearof the reignof Eajakesarivarman, and records the renewal of a grant which had been made by a king called Skandasishya and confirmed by another king, VStapi konda Narasimgappottaradyar. Skandaishya is probably synonymous with Skandavarman, a name -which occurs repeatedlyin the genealogyof an early branch of the Pallavas,1 whose grantsare dated from Palakkada, Dasanapnra and Kanchlpnra.8 Though we have no materials for identifyingthis king, yetit is certain that hejwasone o the predecessorsof the other Pallava king who is mentioned in the inscription. This^IB Naragimgappottaraiyar.3 which is a Tamil form of the Sanskrit name of the Pallara king Narasimhavarman. The epithet Vatapi konda, 'wfco took Vatapi,' which is givento the king, enables ns to identify him with certainty with the Pallava king UTaraaimhavarmaii I. who is described both in the Kurarn plates of Paramelvaravarman I. and in the TTdayendiram platesof Nandivarman Pallavamalla* as the destroyerof Tatapi and as the enemy of Pulikesin (H.) alias VaUabharaja. The Singhalesechronicle Mahdvamsa also refers to this war between Karasimha and Vallabha, in which Manavamma, one of the claimants to the kingdom of Ceylon, who was then residing in India, rendered substantial service to the Pallava king6 The Periyapurdnam,a Tamil work which narrates the lives of the sixty-three devotees of liva, and some of the statements made in which have been confirmed by recent epigrapbical discoveries7 refers to the destruction of Vatapiin the account of the life of one of the devotees, via Siruttonda-Hayaear. It is reportedthat this devotee, who was originally a military man, 
reduced to dust the old cityof Vatspi for his master, whose name is not given, but who must undoubtedly have been the PaJJava king Narasimhavarman I. who destroyed Vatap* according to the Pallaya inscriptions. 
According to the PeriyapvrdpHn, Siruttonda-iraya3ar was visited at his own vfflage by the great Saiva devotee TiruMnasambandar,' and the latter mentionsSirutto^by name mf AePaUav*

atttmmmate date derived from tMs synchronismfor the great devotee is confirmed by the fir, 7 that he was a younger contemporaryof another devotee, called Tirunavukfcaraiyar or App^r, who was firsb persecuted and then patronised by an unnamed Pallava king. One of this k^ ... surnames appears tohavebeen Gurtadhara, because a feudatory of his is said to have boilt ^ female of Siva, and called it Gunadaraviehcharam, ^.e. Gunadhara-Isvara, probably after K* overlordi In an archaic inBcription in the cave at Vallam near Chingleput, which will y^ tmblisbed in South-Indian Inscriptions, Vol. II. Part III., reference is made to a king call Mafcendrapdtaraja alias GunaTbHara, whom Dr. Hnltzsch has identified with either of the t-r : Maheadravarman's mentioned in the TJdayendiram platesof Nandivarman Pallavamalla.* A . the difference between the names Gunadhara and Gunabhara is very slight, Mahendrap&taaA; n alias Gunabhara of the Vallam inscription maybe identified with Gunadhara, who, aceordfc ^ to the Periyapurdnam,first persecuted and then patronised Tirunavakkaraiyar. As this devoir was an elder contemporaryof Tirunanasambandar, who, as I have shown, lived during the time of the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I., it is clear that the Mahendrapdtarija oWa* Gunabhara of the Vallam inscription, whom I proposeto identify with the Gunadhara of tfc ^ P^napurdnam, could only be MahSadravarmanl., the father of Ifarasimhavarman L Thus we arrive at the conclusion that the two great Saiva devotees Tirunavukkaraiyar and Tirunanasambandar, whose time has been the subject of controversy for a long time,* weirc contemporariesof the two Pallava kings Mahendravarman I. and Narasimhavarman I.. respectively This result is importantfor the history of Tamil literature, as it fixes the date of two thirds of the collection of Saiva hymns, which goes by the name of Dtodram and which i* ascribed to Tirnt^vukltaraiyaT, Tirufianasambandaar, and Sundaramurti-Nayanar. The date of the last of the three authors cannot yet be settled ; but he must have been later thaa the two others, because he refers to them by name in the hymn which is knowa as the Tiruttondattogai* 
As regards the king RajafcSsarivarman during whose reign the subjoined inscription was ensraved, we do not possesssufficient data for his identification. The name Rajak&arivarmac giuUets that the king was a Ch6Ja, because the Barnes Bajakeaarm and Parakesarin are said to have been borne alternately by the Ohola kings* and are actually appliedto a large number of them in their inscriptions.? The archaic characters in which the subjoined inscription is engraved, show that, if the king was a Chdla, he waS probablynot a successor but an ancestor of Parantaka I. This conclusion is supported by the comparatively frequentoccurrence of fee 
virdma or, as it is called in Tamil, tfcejpttZZ*, which is marked in no less than twenty cases mthis short inscription, while in a pretty long inscriptionof Madirai kondaParak6sanyarman,j.e. Parantaka I., the pftt occurs only five times.8 The occasional occurrence of the pullthas been noticed also in two other archaic inscriptions,* 3jttt this ,signis Dver met with in the inscription**

o BAjarAjaddva &nd in all subsequent Tamil Inscriptions. Assuming that the cessation of tie employmentof the pidli was gradual, the comparative frequency of its occurrence may be usei as an argument to establish the priority of the present inscription to the time of Parintaka I Again,in the subjoined inscription, the upper horizontal strokes peculiar to certain Tamil letters are represented by slight curves opening upwards, which remind of similar corves in the corresponding letters of the Sanskrit inscriptions of the Pallaya kings R&jasimlia and Mahdndrayarman at Coirjeeveram. On palasogra'phical grounds we must, therefore, conclude that this is one of the oldest Tamil inscriptions yet discovered, though we cannot" ascertain even 
its approximate^date.The contents of the inscription do not furnish any materials for this purpose. R&jakesarivarman renewed, at the request of a certain Puttan (Le. Buddha), a grant which had "been Dsade by Skandasishya and confirmed by ISTarasimhavarmaB7 both*of whom are spoken of as;c former kings"(pwva^akkal), It is not said what the nature of the grant was that had originally been made by Skandasishya, nor do we learn the circumstances that led to the petition (vmnappam) af Puttan for a renewal of the grant. But so much is certain that, at the time of BajakesarivarmsB, a portion of the Pallava dominions had passed into the hands of the Cholas* 
In this and in the following three inscriptions, Tirnkkalukkunrani is said to have been situated in Kalattur-kottam and "in the subdivision (k&ru) called after itself."1 In the Appendix to his Manual of the Chingleput District, Mr. Grole gives a list of JsCtfams <sritfc the subdivisions contained in some of them.

This inscriptionis now publishedfor the first time. It is dated during the 13th year of the trim of Madirai Itonda Parakesad-varmau, and records the gift of a perpetual lamp to the 
Tirnkkalukkunraoi temple. Madirai ko*da means who- took Madirai (**. UadbuzftV and b synonymous with the Sanskrit Madhurantaka, a name which is Appliedin the large Leyden anmt to two of the successors of Parantaka I* Several inscriptions of Madirai konda Krak^saiivarman hare already been published, three from the Kailasan&tha temple at Conjee verams and one from Tirapp4ndurutti near Tanjore.* The endorsement on the TTday&idiram rfates of IfandiTarniaiiS and on those of Nandivarinan PallavamallaS are dated during the reign of the same kin^. The Tamil portionof the TTdayndiram plates of the Ganga-Bana king PrithiTtpati II alias Hastimalla belongs to the reignof the same Madirai konda ParaksariYar m'an? and impliesthat he bore the surname Viraii6ryana.8 In the Sanskrit portionof the same grant, the two names Viran&riyaiia^ and POrifettka1 * are used- for the Ch&la king. In the larve Iieyden grantthe name Parantaka alone appears 11 In both of these qopper-plate grants, he is said to have been the son of the Chola king Aditya (I.) and the grandson of Vijaylaya, From the Udayndiram plates we learn that he uprooted the B,na king*2 and gave the B&na territory to his Gangs feudatory PritMvipati H^ He conquered the P^ndya kinglRajasiihha1* and defeated the army of the king of Ceylon.15 This event appearsto be referred to in the Mah&vamsa when it says that the Singhalese king Kassapa V. sent an array to aid the Pandya Mug against the Chola, but that the expedition was not successful- Kassapa V. is supposed to have reigned from A.D. 929 to 939.1? If the chronology of this portion of the MaMv&msa can be relied upon,1* we can getto a nearer approximation-with regard to the date of Par&ntaka I. than what is furnished by the JLtakur inscription, from which it appearsthat this king'seldesc son B&j&ditya had been killed before A.D. 950, In the verse which refers to Par&niaka I. the KaUngattu-Paranimentions the conquest of Ceylon and Madhtir,.19 The large 
Leyden grant says that Parantaka I. covered with gold the Siva temple at Vyaghragrahara,2<> which is a Sanskrit rendering of Puliyur, one of the Tamil names of CMdambaram. This evidently means that he built the so-called KaixakasabhS or Golden Hall at Chidambaram. In the collection of Saiva hymns known as TiruvifaippA, there is a poem composed by Kandaradittar,

282 EPIGEAPHIA INDICA. [ToL. IH,   
0. AND D. INSCRIPTIONS OF 
These two inscriptions are written in bold archaic characters which rasemble vary closely those of another inscription of KannaradSva near Vfilte (Vellore),* but are tnore rounded than those of other ancient Tamil inscriptions. Both inscriptions: ate dated during the mgft of KsnnaxadSTa the first in the 17th and the second in the 19th year. To the naoje of the king" is prefixed in both of them the epithet KachcMyTirL-Tsfijaiyiin-konda, *wlio tdofc KaekcM and Tafijai.* Kachchi is the ancient Tamil name of KaficMpura (Conjeeveram), the capital o the Pallavas, and Tafijaiis a shorter form of TBUJ&VUT (Tanjore), the Chdla capital, The actual meaning of the attribute appearsto b that the king conquered the Faffltava and the Chola countries. 
The inscription near Wftr is dated during the 26th year, but here there is no reference to the conquestof Kachchi and Taujai. The ArnnachaMsvara temple at TiruvannamaaM in the South Arcot district contains two fragmentary inscriptions of Kairaaradvan.3 As the dig. tinguishing epithefcis missing,it is not absolutely certain if the Vlur and Timvamt&malai records befong to the same reignas the two Tirukkalukkunram ones: Even if tbis should not be the case, the fact that the two subjoined inscriptions are found at Tirukkalukkunram, which is within the Pallava dominions, testifies to the correctness of the statement that the king conqueredthe Pallava country* The name Kannara, which is a vulgar form of the Sanskrit KrislitL03 does not occur among the members of any of the dynasties of the South. Nor is it found among those northern dynasties which are known to have invaded the South, except among the Bashtraklitas. That this dynastyexercised a considerable influence over the historyof Southern India, is established by the following facts. 
1. In an inscriptionof Govinda EEL*3 this Rashtrakiita king claims to have conquered, and levied tribute from, Dantiga9 the Pallava ruler of Kafichi* 
2. The Udayendiram plates of the Grange king PWLtMvipati IL, who was a tributary of the Chola king Partntaka I., appear to refer to an invasion of Amoghavarslia (I.) and its repulsion by the Ganga king's grandfather, PritMvipati I> 
3. The Atakur inscription of Saka-Saiirvat 872 reports that Bfttuga, a Ganga feudatory of the Rashtrakuta king Krishna (HE.) alias Kannaraddva, treacherously killed the Chdl-a king B&jditya in a battle at TaTdtola.5 The D61i plates of Krishna III*, dated Saka-Samvat 862, report that the kingkilled Dantiga and BappiaiEBy and tha4 he transferred -Hie Ganga territory fr@m Kachhy&mallathe B&ehamaila of the Atakur inscription. to Bhtitarya.6 This is evidently the Butnga of the Atakur inscription. In hie remarks on the DS&li plates, DR Bhaindarkar suggests that Bappuka might be identical with the Ch&la king R&jMitya,7 who is mentioned in the Atakur inscription. But no connection can, be established between tla two names Bappukaand EajMitya, and the war with the latter need not yet have taken place in the aka year 862, the date of the Be6lt plates. 
4. The statement of the Atakto inscription that Krislma III, fought against BAjAditya,is confirmed by the large Leyden grant, which reports that the Ch&la king Bjadityas the son of IPsr&atisfea I.9 died in bsettle with Krishnai^ja*8

in which, the grants dated during the reignof Parantaka I. are recorded. R&jar&jadSva wss one of the most powerful of the Chola kings, as is shown by the fact thafc Ms iziBcriptions are found on the walls of almost every ancient temple in the Tamil coutsfcry. Consequently^ it is very improbable that KairaaradSva's invasion toot place during his reign. Again, the three inscriptions of Parantaka I. found in a Pallava temple at KiScMpnram,1 which was the Paliava capital, and the above published inscription from Tirukkalnkkniiram, which must also have been situated in the Pallava territory, show either that Parantaka conquered the Pallavas himself,, or* if the conquest had been effected by one of his predecessors, that he continued to keep them under subjection. The two subjoined inscriptions say that Kannara took Kaehchi and TaS|ai5 and imply that he enjoyed undisturbed possession of the country for a considerable length of time ; fors otherwise grants would not have been issued in his name. It is very unlikely that a 
king like Par&ntaka, whose military resources were enough to keep the Pallavas under subjection and at the same time to conquer the Pandya and other kings, would hare allowed a town like Tanjai, situated as it is in the heart of the Chola country, to be occupied by a ^notorious invader* Thus palseographical and historical considerations combine togetherin fixing the period of these grants between the death of Par&ntaka I. and the accession of I&jax&jadgm This period was occupied, according to the large Leyden grant, by the reignso sis: ClaSla Mugs.2 Of the military achievements of none of then* has it much to say. The Ealingattu Parani leaves out these six kings entirely in the account which it gives of the ancestors of the reigning king* Kuldttunga I.,* and inscriptions dated during their reignsare conspicuous by their 
absence even in the heart of the Ch61a country. Of course, some of those which begin either with &<J RdjakSsarivarman or fed Parakesarivarman alone, may have to be referred to the reigns of two or more of these kings. But the fact that these contain no historical introduction is significant and would imply that fcheir military achievements were not worthy o record. These considerations naturally lead to the inference that, during the reignsof these sir kings, the Cholas occupied quite an inferior position and "were probably feudatories of some foreign king.It was just during this period that the invasion and the considerably long occupationof the. Chola dominions by Kannarad&va was possible. Wot long after the death of Paraniaka L, Bfttnga* a 
Ganga feudatory of the R4shtrakuta king Krishna III. alias Kannarad&va^ foughta battle at Takkdla^ ~ a place which has not yet been identified, againstthe Ch61a king R&j&ditya, who was defeated and killed in the battle. Commenting on the unreliable nature of most of the statements made in the spurious Sudi platesof Bfttuga, Dr. Fleet remarks that there ar references to two real historical events in the inscription.4 There is5 I think, a third historical event when they say that, after defeatingthe Chdla king BajMitya, the Ganga Mug Butugs, undex* orders from Krislma HL, besieged Tanj&purl* *.e. Tanjore.6 As has been pointed out above,, the Chdla power was very weak after the death of Parantaka I., and nothingcould stand in the way of the victor at Takkdla proceeding straightto Tanjore, which appearsto have been the. CMla capital during the time of RajMitya's successor GandarMityararman/and capturing it. It was also stated that palseograpMcalconsiderations point to the interval between the death of the Ch61a king Parantaka I. and the accession of R&jarajadevaas the approximate periodof the subjoined inscriptions^ which are dated duringthe reignof Kaxmarad&va*; that, about the commencement of this interval^ the RMitraktta Mug Krishna IIL

alias Kannaradeva actually killed the reigning Chola king ; and that the name Kannara does not occur either among the southern dynasties, or among the occasional conquerors of the South except among the Rashtrakutas. From these facts the conclusion seems to he irresistible that the KannaradeVa of the subjoined inscriptions, who took K&fiohS and Tanjavur, -was no other than the Rashtrakuta king Krishna HE. who was also called XannaradSva. The donor in ^inscriptionB. was Hedumal Sattan Sennipperayan of Karaikkattur, and in the inscription D. Sattan Sennipp&raiyan of Kami. As pointed out to me by the" Editor, the names of these two donors are very similar, and the name Karai, which occurs in D may only be a shorter form of Karaikkattur in B. It is, therefore, not improbable that the donors in B and D., which belong to the reigns of Parantaka I. and of Xannarac^va, respectively were 
identical. If they were the same, the identity of the Kannaradeva of the two subjoined inscriptions with the Bashtrakuta king Krishna m. would receive some support- for we would then have direct evidence to show that B. and B. were engraved within the life-time of the same man. thil*WO B"**oi d fPtioils> 0. records the grant of a perpetual lamp to the T- ? i

The- originalof this inscription belonged to the late Sir Walter Elliot. I edit it from two of impressions, prepared for Sir Walter Elliot, and kindly made over to me "by Djpcr Fleet,

has noted the following details on the cover containing* the impressions:~-"Three copper plates, lOf by4| inches; in fair order if cleaned, The edges are slightly raised into rims. The ring has been cut ; it is about f"thick and 4f* in diameter, and has a kneeling bull spidered on to it. The plates are markedc 21*in white paint 5 to* there is BO label to say wlwre they come from/' The second sides of the three plates are numbered with the Tatagu numerals 1, 2, 3, respectively, between the ring-hole and the edge. 
The alphabet is Telugu. Of orthograplwal peculiarities the following deserve to be noted. The letter J>Ji is not distinguished from 6 if the vowels tf, 6, au and i are attached to it or if it forms the second consonant of a group (as inSfJifF,line 11, and ^wffrflnrf%9nj 1. 54), and if, consequently,the right top-stroke which distinguishesITi from &, disappears ; only in two cases (bhi of ^snrfOTTO, 1- 2* a:Qd *Tif*r, L 3), the aspirationis then denoted by a vertical line below the letter. In the aksharas rya (11. 33 to 39) and rri (1. 44), the letter r is written in frill, and the secondary forms of ya, and ri are attached to it. The group tfh is thronghout written as fat, and similarly the group ddJia of ?r^rre^SW (1- 24) is represented by dhta. 
The languages of the inscription are S&ns&yit and Telugu. It opens with nineteen Sanskrit verses, which are followed hy a list of the twenty donees in Sanskrit prose (1 32 ff,). The boundaries of the granted village are specified in Telugu prose (1, 39 ffcY). Then follow five imprecatory verses in Sanskrit (L 47 ff.), and the inscription ends with a short sentence in Telugu (L 55 f.). 
As the TanapalH platesof Saka-Samvat 1300 (No. 10 above), the present inscription records & grant of land by Anna-VSma of Kondavlti (verse 15), i.e. of Kondavtdu in the Kistm district. It opens with a genealogy which contains tke same proper names as that of the other inscription- After an invocation of the Bo^r-Inoarnation of Vishnu (y. 1)5 it refers to the (Sftdra) oa-sta (v. 3), a member of which was IPrdla, (v. 3)* whose son V&ma (v. 4) built a flight of steps at Srisaila (v. 6), Vema's two sons, Anxu^Vdta and Anna-"V"6ma (v. 7), successively occupied the throne after him (vv. 8 and 10). Aroaa-VSma or Ana-VSma (L 55) bore the surnames Vas^ntaraya (v. 18) and Pallava-Trin^tra (v. 15). The first of these two epithets, which, meansc the kmg of spring,* he owed to his participation in the spring festival 
(vas&ntQtscwdf) v, 14) . l The surname PallavaF-Trin^tra 10 boirowed from a mythical MiPg of the Telugu country, who appearsas Tril&ohana^Pallav& in the inscriptionsof the Eastern Chalukya dynasty^3 as Trinayana-Pallava in the TeBarasddala inscription of Ganap&ml>&

^ana-lTema's sister, Vemasiiii, is stated to have beei* the queen of a certain IfsIIanunka (v. 16), whose name I have not found elsewhere. For her spiritual benefit^ Airaa"V>6ms grantedto twenty Brahm^nas the Tillageof Hadupiifu (v. 18), which received the surname 
in commemoration of V&masani's own name (v. 19). The grant was made in tie templeof VijayeSvara on the bank of the G-autami (i.e. Godavari) rlTer(y. 18), The temple of TrayeSTsr^-Is probably Identical with the Tillageof Vijayfegvaramin tie Taauku t-Mnta of the Gedavari district, which is situated"close to the west end of the Gddavan ameutM and contains "rwo old temples, held very sacred/'1 The village granted, NadupAm. was situated on tie eastern bank of tie G-odaTari (1. 43 f.). A 11111111561 of ofchei Tillages, which I am unable to 
Identify, are mentioned in the description of its boundaries (11. 39 to 46)- The Madras Surrey Map of the G&davarf district shows a village named NadnpMl in tie Karsaparon the right bank of the G6davari^ and another village, named Vemavaram^ about 5| miles^S.-S.-YSr. of yadnuftdi. I hardly think that one of these two villages can be identical with Kadnpiirit alias VimaOT-am, which must be looked for on the opposite Bank of the rhrer. The country or district; *to -which Nadupurn belonged, was called Konastiiala (v. 18). This may be the same as the Konamandals* which had been ruled over before the time of Anna-V^ma by a 
dynasty of chiefs whose names are givenin the second inscription on tie Pitfaipwam pillar and in inscriptions at Palakol, and with Kdnasima, a local name of the GodaTari delta.' The date of the grant (v. 18) was the day o a lunAf eclipse on Krttikl (*.e. the fell moon tithi of tie month of K^rttika) in tHe year 1298 (in numerical words and in figures) Saka-Sam^at 1296 as a current year would correspondto A.D. 1373-'/*, aad asim expired year to A D. 1374-75, Mr. Dikshit kindly informs me that both in 13^3 and in 13*4 A.D. there was a lunar eclipse in BhAdrapada,tat not in Ztttika, and that no liinar eclijwc in KArttiia is possiHe in the years 1375 to 1370 amd 1362 to 1369; but that then were tamr eeliBses in KArttika of A.D. 1370 and 1371, and that a Ye*ysmall lunar eckpae, not TimWe anyVnere in India, is possiblein Isrina (tie month preceding KrtHka) on tte 13th October, A.D. 1372.

These plates were found, rather more than fifty years ago, by a Brahmana of a town in the Dgvagad taluklt of the Eatnagiri district of the Bombay Presidency ; and the inscription which they contain has been already published, by Bal Grangadhar Sastri,, in the Joturnal, Bombay Branch, R. A. 8. 9 Vol. L p. 209 ff. I now re-edit it from an excellent impression, prepared by I>r. Fleet. 
These are four copper-platess the Becond and third of which are engraved OB both sides, while the others are so on one side only. They are marked with the Nagari numeral figures from 1 to 4, which are engraved on the right margin of the second side of the first, second and third plates, and of the first side of -the last. Each plate measures from 7f*to 7|-'' broad by about 4f*high. The plates are strung on a circular riags about J* thick and 2$* in diameter, which had not been cut when this record came into Dr. Fleet's hands. As wall be seen from the accompanying photo-lithograph, this ring has soldered on to it an image of the mythical

H is represented as a man, with wings, squatting full front, with the clasped on the breast, and under the wing on his left shoulder is seen a hooded serpent^ its head projecting from behind. The total height of the image and ring is about 4*. ^Th weight of the four plates is 4 Ibs. 8 ozz., and of the ring and image, 9foz.; total, 5 Ibs. Ifos, The engraving is good, and* with the exceptionof one or two akshar&s which are partly the writing is well preserved throughout* The siso of tlie letters is about y3/*- characters are Nagari, and the language is Sanskrit. Up to about the middle of line 33 h inscriptionafter the introductory 6m 6m namah Sivdya9 has 21 verses (interrnpted by a short prose passage between verses 10 and 11), chiefly containing genealogical matter. The reats being the formal part of the grant, is in prose, but includes, in lines 38-40, 62-675 and 69-71, seven benedictive and imprecatory verses, and, in Kns ?4-753 another verse on the requisites of a faultless charter. As regards orthography* the letter 6 is everywhere denoted by the sign for v 5 the dental sibilant is ten times used for the palatal,1 and the palatal twice for the dental (in dit9 lines 11 and 21) ;the consonant m has been retaineds instead of being changed to anusv&ra9 in the word samvatsara, twice in L 41, and in paradattdm&Bd, L 60 ; and *& is wrongly doubled after r in AkdlavarsJishdt L 9, and probably was so doubled by the writer also in lines 8 and 10, where the engraver has put =mdghai}^rshyo and =m%&at?ar#%aA (instead of varsh8ho and ^varsfishaK). The signof avagra&a is employed six times. In respect of the language, it may be mentioned that the text offers two words which are Dravidian : in, 1. 21, and the first member of the compound name AmSfocnra IB L 42; and that it contains some words the meaning of which is not apparent (notably jivalSkn, in L 49S chdkdntaw and jGhafat, in 1. 50, aod jagatlpura,in L 59). A wrong verse we find in line 29 j and another verse, in line 27, contains a passage which, as it stands, does not seem to yield any satisfactory meaning.   
The inscriptionis one of the Siira* Mantjalika BattErjs. Like the BMdtna grant of the Sil&ra Aparijita,*it divides itself into two parts. The first parfe, up to line 33? given tha genealogyof Bstterfija, and of the BsHtrakuta and (Western) OMliikya kingsto whom he and his ancestors* were subordinate ; and the second partrecords various donations, made by him in Saka-Samvat 930, in favour of some learned men connected with a temple of the god (Siv% under the name) AwSsvara.4

How nmch value should be attached to this statement, It 'la difficult to decide. In making it, the author perhaps only wished to give expression to the prevalentbelief that the family had come from the South ; but it also seems possible that the word has been broughtin here merely on account of its resemblance to the word Of the ten chiefs enumerated, none, so far as 1 know, is mentioned in other* iascriptiomit is true that in the KMrepltaigi plates of the ilam Anantad&vaa a prince*

Aiyspaddva Is said to have been kept on the throne by the aid of AnantadSva'B ancestor Aparajita; butsas was reigning in Saka-SamTat 9I9,1 that Aijapadem must have lived about 200 jearsafter the Aiyspar&ja of tie present inscription. Considering that our 
grant is dated la Saka-Samvat 930=A.D. 1008-0, and that the succession of the ten in every ease was from father to son, it Ms been yightly assumed that the founder of this family, [Sa]:aaplroHas who first took possession of the country "between the sea and the range* lived in the second half of the 8th century A.D., and that, therefore, the Mug Kjisli^m whose favour he enjoyed, can only have been the Sashtrak-fita Krislma- I. who ruled In the third quarterof the same century. Of tie places mentioned, Valipattaa% Chajidmpiira and Ghdmiklya* the last has Tbeea identified with GhenTOi .(OhSol or Chaul), an ancient town on the coast, about thirty miles south of Bombay-, of which a fall account is given in the IferoS&y 
Ga%etteery Vol. XL p. 269 JL Here it will be sufficient to state that Gh&mfilya is mentioned IB the KMr^pate^ platesof Anantadeva,3 aa belonging to the KonkacL group of 1400 [villages] which was held by the Northern SflSras ; and that, accordingto Mas'fidSj who "visited the town 
called Saimur by Mm early in the 10th centurys it was then under the government of a prince Djamdja^i.a* Jliafijlia* one of the Silaras of the Northern Koiikaiu These references show thmfe the rulers of Cbemulya, -who in omr inscription are reported to have "been aided by Avasam PZJ most probably were Silarae of the northern branch of the family. Valipattsaa is showu by the passage,, quoted on page 294 aboves note 6> to have been situated, like O]ieiaMy% on the coast ; and the prominent manner in which it is mentioned in this inscription would seem to indicate that it was the capitalat any rate of the earlier Sil&ras. The late Mr. Telang felt inclined to identifyit with the Baifcipatna of Ptolemy and Palaipatmai of the PeripM; bat this, eren supposing it to b correct, would not help n& to identify the place. I myself cannot suggest any probable identification*4 laor can I identify C&&ndrap'ara9 which also was situated near the sea, as is shown by line 57 of our inscription* and was apparently the principal town of the Chmidra-maiidals, conquered by the chief Bblma*

BTo. 41. VBBAWAL IMAGE INSCRIPTION; 
VALABHt SAMVAT 927. 
By F, KisfcHORtf, PH.D., LL.D., C.I.E.; GOTTTOGEN. 
This inscription, wtlch was discovered by tlie . ate Dr. Bhag^ranlal Indraji, is on ilie pedestal of an old iiaage, built into a Trail of the modern . temple of the goddess Harsatadevi, at Vdrfiwal, the ancient Somanatliadevapattana, in Kathiaw^d.6 It has been already published in Archaeological Survey of Western India, No. II (List of Antiquarian Remains, hombay Presidency*), p. 1$5. I now re-edit it from an im-inked paper eatampage, kindly procured by Mr. Haridas Yiharidas, Diwan of Jtm%adh, which"has been placed at my disposal by Dr. 
' 
FleetJ 
The inscription contains five lines o writing which covers a space of exactly1' broad by 2F high, and is well preserved throughout. The size of the letters is about f" The characters are the kind of Nagarl which we find in the Jaina palm-leaf MSS. of the 12th and 13th centuries. The language is Sanskrit, rendered incorrect by the influence of Prakrit, which shows itself in the spelling of names, in the absence of the jJroper case-terminations, and 
in the employment of the form kdrdpitd,for kdritd, in line 5 ; and the whole text is in prose. The object of the inscription is, to record that, on a date which will be given below, the Sr&hthm Mftlajdga, a member of the Gallaka8 caste (or clan), and Ms wife, tie Sr&hftint Mddhl; their son, the seller of perfumes Joja, and his wife SMvada ; and their sons Jayatl

The only poiLt of general interest in. this Inscription is the date in Hue 1, srimacl VaiabM-sapiijvat 927 varslie Phalguna-sudi 2 Some i.e.*on Monday, tl*e 2nd of the bright half of Phaiguna, in the 3"ear 027 of the era of the famous Val- >M.* Ttia ctote lias "been alreaoy fully discussed "by Dr. Fleet, la his Gupta Inscrtptrns, Introduction, pp. 90-93. The readingof it, "which, 'was adopted by Dr. Fleet, is now by the paper estampage proved to be the true reading, and, with this reading, the European equivalent of the date -uidoubtedly is3 as Dr. Fleet gave it, Monday, the loth February, A.D. 1246. The only difficulty presented by this equivalent is, that Monday the 19th February, A.D. 1246, falls in 
Baka-Samvat 1167 expired (=Vikrama-Samvat 1S02 expired), aud that thus there is here a rliiference of only 240 years between the VaJabM year (927) and the corresponding expired Saka year (1167), while in th*j case of some other Gtipta[-Talabhl]dates this difference amounts to 241 years. To explain this discrepancy,it might be said that the years of those otliei Gupta[-Valabhi] dates are expired years, and that- the writer of ibis date, exceptionally* quoted a current year ; and such an explanation would no doubt accord well with the practice of other eras. Yet, in the present Instance, I would rather suggest a different explanation,I 
find it somewhat difficult to believe that in the 13th century AD. the peopleof KatM&wM should have possessed a true knowledge of the exact epoch of the original Gupta era. The era, then in common use among them was the Vikrama era, and what men knew or belieTed was, that ValabhS had been destroyed 375 years after the commencement of the Vikrama era, and that an era had once been in use which dated from that event. 3Sbw the meaning* of the traditional rerses about the destruction of Valabhi having taken place 375 years after Vikrama can in my opinion only have "been thiss that, to convert a Yikrazna yearinto the corresponding Valabhi year,it was necessary to deduct 375 from the Vikrama year. This I helieve to have actually been done in the date of the Vr&wal stone inscription of ArJTznadSva, where the ValabM year 945 is quoted by the side of the Vikrama year 1320 ; and this I believe to have been done also in the presentdate- In other words, I l^elieve thai the year of this date is really Vikrama-Samvat 1302 expired (and must be treated as such for the purposeof calculation), and that the writer, desirous of quotingthe obsolete era, attained his purpose by putting down in the date the year ValabM-Samvat 1302 375=927.4

BY IP, KIELHOBIS, PH.D.J LIilD., G.I.E.; GSTTINGBV. 
This inscriptionIs on an elaborately sculptured pillar which was found Ijy the late General Sir A. Chmningham at Sitabaldi? near N&gpiir5 In the Central Provinces, and is now in* the CJoYemmemt Museum at N&gpur*7 To judge from the photograph before me, the sculptured part of the pillar measures about 5f high by 2|' "broad, of -which the inscription occupies the middle portion. Above the inscription is a row of small figures, and above these are, in the centre a linya^ and on tie two sides of it representationsof the gods Brahman, and Vishnu ; below the inscription are some cows and calves, and below these there is again a row of small figures, 
apparently fighting. I edit the inscription from an estampage, supplied to me some years ago by Dr. Fleet. 
The Inscription contains 11 lines of writing which covers a space of about 2' broHd by IF high, and is fairly"well preserved. The size of the letters Is about I'7 In the upper lines, and ratter less tban ff/ in the lower ones. The characters ar N&garL The language is very Incorrect Sanskrit, and the whole is in prose* In respectof ortliograpliy. It will be sufficient to note that the consonant &3 with perhaps one exception,8 Is expressed by the sign for v, and that tie dental sibilant is generally employed for tlie palata!3 and the palatal once for the dental (in gahasravdhu, 1. 6). As regards grammar and Iexicograpliy3 attention may especially be drawn to the Pr&krit termination9it, in saku, L 1, ddsu, 1. 8, tatpavu and dhavalu, 1. 9? and dvddasu? L 10 ; to the employment of the words Ghaddka, 1. 5? and panat%yc a gsreat-grandson3* and mti3 6 a grandson/ L 8S -which must have been taken from the authors vernacular ; and to the peculiar construction of tlie numerals In line 10. 
Opening with the words* 6m? may It be well/ and a date which will be considered below, the Inscription (in lines 2-4) refers itself to the reign of -victory of* the refuge of the universe, the favourite of Fortune and of the Earth./ the Mahdrdjddhirdja Paramedvara ParamabJiattdralta, the glorious TrifohuvanamaUad&vas the frontal ornament of the family of Satyasraya and

yi|hapax, 
god Vishnu,* who had obtained favour by a boon of (the god) ISTarasimha (Vishnu) gave 12 Hwartanas of land, which had been purchased by him, for the grazing of cattle; also 7 nfeor. tanas for daily food given to cattle ;.and 5 ntoartana* for vdhaka, (P), apparently to a temple at which the inscription was put up. The concluding line 11 states that, whosoever appropriates the land so given, robs the gods Brahman, Vishnu and Mah&irara (Siva)- and 
that, who steals the cows from it? falls into hell.* The inscription is dated, in lines 1-2, in Saka-Sarhvat 1OO8, on FWLday, the third lunar day of the bright'lmlf of VaisSkha of the year Frabhava. By the southern luni-solar system tneyear Prabhava would be Saka-Samyat 1009, not 1008, expired; but the date does not work out satisfactorily for either year, nor for the four surrounding years.

In my opinioil, the day intended by the date is really Thursday, the 8th April, A.D. 1087, and the writer made a mistake in regard to the week-day. The jplace Latalaiira, which is twice mentioned in this inscription, I am unable to identify. TEXT.8

I Originallyardjg$Ji appears toliave been engraved. The following sign of punctuationis superfluous. 3 Head ~vinirggat6 and -$ra$nt6. 
8 This word eha&akct is not Sanskrit ; it probably is connected with the root chat,* to break/ and apparently the whole 5*>wZai& equivalentto ari%alan4$h4dan&. Compare also the Mar&th! ckacLaJca^*a slap, a stroke/ 4 Wdm&n is quite superfl.uous here ; its sense is contained in the following1 $&ma$tar$j&v&l$* 5 Bead ~*r$n&kaJtz hut the words in the whole phrase, beginning- with tatpddapadm^pajtvj, in line 4, should really have been put in the Ikocative.

This is a single plate which measures about 10" broad by 5|" high, and is engraved on one aide only. It contains ten lines of writing- written across the breadth of it, and another line, which merely contains the name of the donor, on the proper right margin. The writing'is in a perfect state of preservation. The size of the letters in the body of the inscriptionis between Ty and *, and of those on the right margin, about ^.'. The characters are N"agari,as written in Orissa or neighbouring parts of Eastern India probably in the llth or 12th century A.D. The language is very incorrect Sanskrit prose, greatly influenced by the Prakrit or vernacular of the author. In some places the case terminations are altogether omitted; in others we have wrong cases, false genders, and inappropriate or incorrect verbal derivatives. The influence of the Prakrit is shown by the substitution of singlefor conjunct consonants (as in Vigahapdla for Vigrahapdla, U. 2 and 7, saddtUtyd for sadtistMt-yd, 11. 4 and 5, and saJutsta for twaJiasta, 1. 5), the use of the lingual for the dental nasal (as in na for na, L 3, and kuttumvikdndm for Mndm, 1. 7), the substitution of sfor^andsfc (as in sSsam for Usham, 1. 8), and the omiasion of medial y and final consonants (as in -vtdhSdndm for -vidhSydnam, 1. 9, and kasyachi for hit, 11. 5 and 7).i That the author's vernacular was'closely related to, or was a kind of, MagadM Prakrit, appears to be particularly proved by the occurrence of the word ostd for avasthd in-line 5; by the use of the conjuncts sp, sm and sy instead of shp, shm and shy in chatuspada, L 6, tusmd (for yushmat-), 1. 4, and nirvvahisyati, 1. 9 ; and (if my interpretation of the text be right) by the Nom. sing. masc. yS in line 3.8'In respect of ortho graphy it may be noted that t is everywhere doubled before r (as in -puttra, 1 2) that 6 is written by a sign of its own in kufjumUkd, 1. 3, and bal-ddhikrittna, 1. 4, but by the sign for in kutfumvikdn.dm, I. 6 ; and that the writer 
mthroughout has written ft instead of the single f (as -karate,1. 1). The style and phraseology of the inscription are very peculiar, and I know of no other inscription which is similar to it in this respect. A territorial term which I have not mrt-with elsewhere, is paribMga in line 3, used apparently in the sense of bkukU or bhoqa,< a district.* 9 The inscription described in line 2 as a prasdda-paffaka or< document of favour,'* is one at m PamffoUoffon*.

Dr* ECultzsch by Mr. Consens, and two by Dr. Fleet, for whom they had been prepared by Shaikh. Karim. Bach, set of impressions consists of five pieces, The contest suggested to me fcl&at the first and second pieces should form the front5 and the third and fourth pieces the "baclsz^ of a slab wMch. is broken in the middle, and that the fifth pieceis probably engraTed on 05ae of the sides o the same slab. To settle this point. Dr. Hulfasseh forwarded one s et of tix<e impressionsto Mr. R. S. Joshis Curator of the Central Museum* N&gpur, who readily supplied the following information. The first and second, third and fourth pieces are actually engpcanrecUon the front and back, respectively, of a slab which is broken across the middle. Tlie fifth pieceis on the right-hand side of the upper half of the slab* and the lower half contains* four lines in continuation, of which Mr. Joshi kindly sent a pencil-rubbing and an impr-essioiu He added that "the stone was brought to the Museum in the year 1861 from SiroxxelLa, about 160 miles from Nagpur, by Colonel G-lasford, the then Deputy Commissioner of tOh.e then Upper Gr&d&vari district, who found the same servingthe purposeof a tombstone and zmGTinted at the head of an innumerable number of curious sarcophagi at the of a raiag-e of hills in the insignificant villageof Kowtslis some 6 miles from Sironcka tahsil." Siroxieiia is situated on the left bank of the Q-M&Yari, in about 19 latitude and SO5longitude, The slab itself is noticed as"said to have come from Sironeha" in Sir A. Cunningham's Beports, Vol. "VII. p. 115. 
A.t the topof the front of the slab are drawn some rude figures : a dagger between a tiger- facing it from the left and a lingo, on the right. Below the tigeris the sum, and below the li-Aga, a crescent, with a doubtful figure (a bowl ?) between the two. 
Tlie alphabet of the inscription is Telugn, and its language Teliigm prose. The characters on the front and back of the slab are much larger than those on its rightside. A few letters at the "beginning of lines 38 to 40 and at the end of line 56 are lost altogether; a number of other letters are indistinct and doubtful, especially on the rightside of the slab and about the end of 
the inscription on the back. I am unable to give a complete transcript and translation of the damaged portionsof the inscription. Of orthographical peculiarities I need onlynote that the -vowel ri is represented by n in praJcaUknta (L 6f.) and SaJ&anripa (L 26). 
Lines 18 to 35 of the inscription record that GimgamaJiMevi* the chief queen of Soxmasvaradeva, gave a village, named KSmmaruks (L 35)or K^ramarka (L 55), to two temples of Siva, both of which she had built. The first was called Vira-S6m6svara after her hnsbcuod, and the other Gangdliarsvara after herself- The date of the consecration of the two -temples and of the grant of the village was Sunday, the twelfth titM of the bright fort nigh.* of Phaiguna in the Saka year USD. The next few lines (35 to 42) appearto contain the king's sanction of the grant. Lines 42 to 55 specify the names of a number of royal officers who were witnesses of the transaction. Lines 57 to 79 I have not teen able to make oufc satisfactorily. They appear to record that both and performed libations of water; but it is not clear if theydid this in connection with tbe same /fc that was referred to before, or with some additional donations. 
I laare no means for identifying the village of Keramamka which was the object of the The date of the granthas been Kndly calculated by Mr. Dikahit, who remarks on it as follows:- -In Saka-Samvat 1129 expired, Phalgnna MOa 12 ended on Satoday, me 1st Marob, A.D, 1208, at 13 gh. 59 patos.

He claims to be a descendant of the race of the N&ga with thousand hoods, ie. of the serpenfe Sesha, to be the lord of the city of Bh.6gvati, to have for his crest a tiger witti a calf* to belong to the Kasyaps gStre, and to be a worshipper of the god MaMsvaraTand of the goddess Manikyadevi. In his Dynasties ofthe Kanarese Districts (p. 95 &) and in this Journal (p 230 ff.) ? Dr. Fleet has givendetails of two branches of the Sinda famiiy, which were established at Bagadage and at Erambarage, and which were tributary to the Western CMlukya and Kalaclmrf dynasties.1 In the Bhairanmatti inscription (No. 33 above), the members of the B&gadt|?o branch of the Sinda familyare stated to be descendants of the race of serpents {Ndga^am^J^to use tie crest of a tiger, and to be the lords of the city of JBhdgAvatl. As three similar biruda.8 are appliedto S6m6svara? during whose reign the subjoined inscription is dated, it is clear tlmfc lie must hara been connected with the Sinda family. But as theinscription does not mention cmy 
of his ancestors, it is vain to conjecture whether he was a direct descendant of the B&gwju^e branch, or of Vikrama, the last representative of the Erambarage branch who is noticed by Dr. Fleet, and whose latest inscriptionis dated in the Safe*year Il02, twenty-eight before the subjoined inscription.

The copper plates which bear the 
msubjoined inscription, were found in a field at Ganesad the Damnagar taluka of the Baroda State. In March 1894, Major W. B. Ferris, then. Assistant Agent to the Governor-General, Baroda, sent them to Dr. Fleet, who very kindlv placed them at my disposal for publication. They have now been returned to, Baroda. 
The plates are two in number and measure about 11 by 7| inches. The edgea of their .miwr, mscnbed side3 are raised into rims to protect the writing. When the plates reached me they were covered with a thick layer of rust. Ifeving been immersed for a,

the lower end of a well-preservedoval seal, which measures about 2| by 1| inch. The back of the seal is of convex shape. On the front of the seal, a plain oval border, measuring If by If inch, is divided by a pairof horizontal lines into two compartments,of which the upper one contains, in bas-relief, a recumbent bull which faces the proper right, and the lower one, in raised letters, the usual legend *ftaz$:. The weightof the two platesis 3 Ibs. 7 oz. and that of the two rings and the seal 7|oz. ; total, 3 Ibs. 15 oz. 
The date at the end of the inscription furnishes instances of the numerical symbols for 
5, 7, 10 and 200, and the symbolfor 300 occurs in line 14. The languageis tolerably correct Sanskrit The proper name Mataklta (for Shal&rJta)in line 3 and on the seal,1 and the adjective jamala (for y amulet)in line 14 are two instances in which the writer of the inscription relapsed from. Sanskrit into his Prakrit vernacular. 
The plates record an order, issued from (his capital) Valabhi (line 1) by Dhruyaseaa [L] 
(1 10) and conferring on a Brahmana eight measures Qihanda}of land and two cisterns in the village of Hariyanaka, which belongedto Akshasarakaprapa, a subdivision of Hastavapraharani (1. 12).I am unable to identify the village of Hariyfaaka and the subdivision in which it was included. The district of Hastavapraharani, Eastakavapraharani, or Hastavapraharais mentioned in three other Valabhi grants." HastarapraorHastekayapra, 
to which it owes its name, has been identified with Hathab, six m:les south of Gogha in the BhUvnagar State, and with the'Astakapra'of Ptolemy and of the PjpJfo.- 
The Vtaaka, of the grant was the door-keeper Mammaka, and the writer of the edict was 
Kifekaka (1. 28). The latter also wrote the three other published grantsof Dkuvasena I. and the former acted as IMtaka, of one of te three grants.* The date of the subjoined grant Tas the 15th *KoE the dark fortnightof Vais*kha of the (Gup a) year 207 1 29 f. ,,.

Of the latter, the first tbat wag brought %o notice is B*f on of set of three eliartars by Mahfi*Bhsv&giipta I* in MB thirty-first year* It was edited in 18765 in the Iud~ JLnt. Vol. V* p. 55 ff., by Babm Rangalala Banerjea, who propounded the views (1) that MaM-Bimvagnpta I. IbeloBgedto the dynasty of"the great Guptas,**meaning, apparently, tie Early Guptas,or to some branch of it established in the Kalinga country 5 (2) that EL, 'which reoordy though not then published, had been examined by hint* proves that a king named YayUfci reignedin Orissa when Halia-JSivagnpta,1 the son of Maha-Bhamgnpta I., was the king of the three Kalingas; (3) that the Mugs of Orissa were feudatories of the Guptas, and made all their grantsin the names of their parstnor.nt masters 5 (4) that Yay&tl is to be identified with, a certain Tayti-B[8sarI3 who, according to a (supposed) historical account of Orissa, compiled "by Mr* Andrew Stirling from two local vamMvalis or genealogical lists of kings and from the Sdjc&Gritra chapterof the MddldPdn,ji or archives preserved in the temple of Jagannatliaais PnrS, and publishedin the Asiatic Mesearefaes, VoL XT* (1825), pp. 254 to 3053 was the founder of the Kesari dynasty of Orissa^ and reigned from A.D. 473 to 520 ;2 and (5) that the periodo Maha-Sivagnptas and of the record itself.

He again accepted the period of A.B. 474 to 5264 for Yayiti* taking Janamejaya to be simply an"ancestor'*of Tay4tis~not MB father ; though is the relationship which ^distinctly stated in the recorci, and which was acknowledged Tby the Babrn Mmseliin Ms translation of it, he identiied Janam^jaya with a person of the same name who, aeeoriiingto tradition3 fcranded the city of Katak-01iandw4r |5 and h placed him seven

And he simplyattached to the annals of Orissa a, valixe wMch neither they, nor any other Hindu records of the same Mnd that tare ever yet come to light, can possibly possess. It is almost needless to saythat the annals in question<io xaot iaclndLe any such names at all as Sivagupta and Bhavagupta ; these being real Mstorical Bames3 it Is not 
to be expectedthat they would be found in sueh. documents- They undoubtedly do preservea* reminiscence of Jaaam^jaya-MahA-Bhavagupta I. and Yay&ti-Mahft-iTO^aptaf in the names of Yay&ii-Kesari, and of Janazn^jaya-KSsari which also occurs in the list of the Kl^sari ting's ; for* 0therwlsesthere is no reason why such purely Pur&nic names should crop up In. sb aeries ox mostly quite ordinary names. But they do so under completely erroneous and anaeHiwalstlcr 
circ-amsfcaiices. Accordingto the annals,, Yayati-K^sari was the first of Ms dynasty* and waa succeeded bysSnrajs - or*Surjya '-, i.e. Sftrya-K&sati* and Janam&jaya-K&sari cama lor^g after Mm, in the period A.D. 754 to 763 ; whereas, the ciopper-plate charters shew that Ya.yliti~Malisl~ 
Slvagupfca was the third Hug of Ms line, that Janam&jaya-Malia-BhaYagiipta I. was his predecessor and father, and that lie was succeeded by BMmaratha-Malifir-Bliavagixpta II.^ ^f whom we possibly have a perverted reminiscence in the name of tile alleged BJaaraita-K^BarJ who is placed next "after Janam6jaya~K&sarL, in the period A.D. 763 to 778, A.zid,~ eva-n. 
apart from what I shall shew below, as to the periodto which, the real Yay&ti-Mali&r- Sivago.pta. must be. referred,- the annals nnconsciomsly betray themselves, by connecting witlbL the aMae of Yayati-K^sarievents winch, can hare happened only several centuries at least after the period wMch they would establish for him. They say that, just before him, some people Yavanas mled over Orissa for a tnndred and forty-aix years, and that lie established Jbtis dynasty by expelling the Yavanas (fbid. pp 264, 265, and Orissa^ Vol. II. Appendix: p. 185) : as I will shew further on, though the Yavanas here are the Early Gupta Jklngs* tlie term elsewtere means, all through, the annals, the Musalmans,3 and the statements ooroaectad with Tayati-K^sari mix up the Early Gupta rule with the Musalm&n conquests: if tliezi* tlia statements are based on no actual fact, but simply on what took place generally in Northern Indiaj they cannot refer truly to any time anterior to the period of Mahmud of Q-haasui (AJD. 1001 to 1080), who, moreover,, did not penetrate as far as Orissa ; -while, if they* commemorate an actual conquest of Orissa, they tsannot possibly refer to any time a/nterior* to A.D. 1567-68, -when Sulaiman3 king of Bengal, defeated the last independent Mug- of Orisaa and practically subjugated the province,4 
As regards the second mistakej whatever the SSstras may say, or seem to say, tiia assertion that none "but paramount sovereigns could make grants of land is without any "basis- o fact : any number of epigraphic instances to the contrary could be quoted ; and, though there aro instances enough of feudatories md officials making grants with the permissionof their sttpr-orao MngSj yet even then the grants were always made by them in their own names, a*xd mofc a single authentic ease can be quoted of a feudatory or official assuming the namo of his Mug- or other superior authority for the purpose of issuing a charter.

of 'STary&ti, to 'whose name there are here attached the paramount titles, justas in the case of Matlb-Sivagupta,, and who, like Maha-Sivagnpta,is here described as "belongingto the family of tlie Moonj and as "being the lord of tlie three Kallngas. And 3?., after mentioning in the opening verses three kings named Janam6jayas Yay,ti9 and BMmazaiha, names, in the formal partof the record, the paramount king Malia-Sivsgiipta9 and his s accessor Mab&- mxavagupta (II.) who made the grant ; and it is dated in the third year of BMrnarafcha, to whose ame there are here attached just the same paramount titles which are attached to the name of Maiia-Bhavagtipta (II.)* ad who, justlike Mahft-Bhavagapta (II.) in this record and Maha Slvagnpta In B., is here described as "belonging to tlie family of tlie Moon, and as being the lord Of tlie three Kaliiigas. It is true that the fact is not specificallystated. But it is self-evident that we have the names of four kings, Sivagnpta, KCahA-BhavBgapta I.9 Sivag-irpta, and Mlalia-Bhavagiipta U., each the father of his successor, and that Jaaamejata, Tay&tI9 and Bhlmaratlia were simply fanciful names of the second, tMrd* aad fanrfih of {beza.

to the OP the Race* Their dynastic name properlias not yet come to fight. But their paramount titles, Paramdb&attdraka, 3aJidrdjddMrdJa9 and Pora^iefoarfl,* were not the exclusive attributes of the Gruptas, as Babu Raugalala Banerjesi thought. Ands even apart from the fact that their period is plainly too late, the termination of their names does not require us to allot them to the lineage of the Early Gtaptas, or even of the later Guptas of Ifagadha ; and there appears no reason whatever for our doing so. 
There remains for consideration the period to which, these kings be allotted,* And9 as their records are not dated in any era3 and their names have not been met with, in any other records so dated or capable of assigned to an exact date by means of a record so dated, this question can only be dealt with. mpp:r0ximatelyf on Tlie results, however, are sufficientlydefinites within certain limits* 
The characters used in these charters are Partly because of the locality to wMct the charters belongs and partly because of certain unique forms of the vowels es aj amd &n$ which will be noticed again farther on and which. are radicallydifferent from any forme to be found in records from Southern and Western Indias they must unquestionably be allotted. to the northern of N&gari alphabets* And they exhibit more or less of a tendency towards a particular type of that class of ISTagari alphabets, to which, rightly or wrongly? the 
special name of Kutila has come to be attached*1 A comparison of the recordss one with, each others shews this peculiarity most plainly in B, O., D.f and E* And characters of apparently much the same type with the present oneB5 as exhibited in th.es four records* are carried "back to about the middle of the seYenth century A.D. by the Aphsad inscription (Beh&r) of AdityasSna, {Gupta Inscriptions^ p. 2049 Plate). But closer inspection, shews that the present characters are very much later than those of the Aphsad record 5 contrast* for instance^ the initial & of the -Aphsad inscription, in dsid, line 1, and theft,.;",?, m, r, and s9 in feafa&d, jayind? uuutdndha, ^iAyM'har^ mhasra in the same lines with the initial d in dkshfytd, line 20^ and 
the &3 j9 fy ms T9 and ^ in kafafedt, samdvdsita, vijaya* and paramaf line 1, of B,s and still more with the same characters as exhibited in the same words in A* lines 1 and 27* From these letters alone* it is evident that a very considerable interval must have elapsed from, the period of the Aphsad record to tibia time when these charters were engraved. Audi, reverting further on to a few individual letters-, 1 will deal first with some other features which, endorsing* the above result, help better to fix the approximate period of these charters. In making compariU SQBS3 1 staU quote records^, with published facsimiles* which come from the nearest possible localities to the part of the country to which the charters under consideration belong.

compelledto place the record, on this account, before A,D. 794-95 5 for, the same system used in the grant (r<?m somewhere in Bengal) of the MaMrdja Vlnayatapala, the date of falls in that year (JnA. Ant. Vol. XV. p. 140, Plate). And the force of this feature is the fact that decimal figures also occtir in all the six. charters. This latter feature, ed, does not oblige us to place these records after A.D. 862*; for, decimal figures occur in *3a.e D&dgadh inscription (Central India) of Bh6jadeva of Kanauj, of that year {Archil. Sum. Vol. X. Plate xxxilL No. 2). But it points to about AJX 800, as the eatliest possible for these charters. 
The next pointto which attention may be given, is the use of the virama, in eozHi the full form of t in B. to B1.,and once in conjunction with the full form of n in B. ; this , however, being qualified by the use also of final* forms of t, ny and i, more or less *lxx-cragliOTit the wlj.ola series. The virama perhaps occurs with t in samvat, line 63 in the 
#-a, complete t* except for the absence of the mdtrd or horizontal top-stroke, in. paftchdf&f, 
31>^6gadh inscriptioii of A.D. 862.1 It certainly occurs, in conjunction with a half final form of 
llx&e 20-(twiee), in the G-wftlior inscription (Central India) of the same Mug, of A.D. 875-7S Xnd. Vol. I. p. 160, Plate). It appears in conjunction with the full forms of t and in the Pehoa inscription (Panj&b) of MaMndrapala, of about A.D. 900 (ibid* p* 244 see, for instance* SdrngabTirit^line 23 and tdpam, line 3. And it occurs in conjunction the fuU forms of $3 n* and m in the Khajnr&hd inscription (Bondelkhand) of YasovarmaBj of A.D. 953-54 {ibid* p. 124 Plate) ; see, for instance, t>ar# line 1, tydgamn, line 3, and r--yt7ri^i'm? line 28* So far? therefore, as the use of the vir&ma is concerned, the present charters xae^d not be placedafter A.D. 900. And the use of final forms also might seem to necessitate c>a.:r placing them before that date. But, though the records mentioned aTboYe shew no final 02?Tns at all, a final form of t occurs in the word samvat, lines 32 and 33? of the Harslm inscription (Rajputan&)of Vigrahar&ja,of A.D. 973 (id. Vol. II. p. 120, Plate) ; and the I>^wal inscription (North-West Provinces) of the Chhinda prince Lalla^ of A.D. (id. "Vol. I. p. 76, Plate), shews, e.g.in bhuvam, line 83 a half final form of m3 a complete my except f0-3? the mdtrd, with a vir&ma attached to it. And therefore, in spite of the use of final foams, charters may also, without objection^ he placedas late as A.D. 973. 
Another instructive feature is tlie use of the aYagraha in E. and F. ; properly^ in E. 38, to denote the elision of an initial a after an o, and incorrectly, in E. line 29, and F. line 35, to mark the absorptionof an initial a into a preceding A. This sign does not occur in 
ajny of the other records mentioned above. And the earliest other Instances of the use of It* isfasat I can quote,are vd$num6d&a in line 43 of the Bardda grant (Gujarat) of DMravarsha* :Ni~rapama-Dhruvarsja? of A.D. 834 or 835 (In*. Ant. Vol. XIV. p. 200, Plate), and <3<mad in line 25 of the Ujjain grant (MMwa) of Vakpatirajaof Dhir&, of A.D. 974' or 975 (L Vol. VI. p. 52, Plate),in both of which placesit is nsed, improperly,to mark the absorption of 
"initial* a into a preceding 4 and Hlp^ntar&yah,line 43 dadhe&asMam, line 13, and JZohhitd&ir, line 18, where it is used correctly, and frutodsnyathd, line 19, where it is used toorrectly in the*Deopara'inscription of Vijayaa&m,attribatable to the end of the eleventh 
^t 
A.D. (tip. Ind. Vol. I. p. 308, Plate). It is a sign which is emphatically opposed to 
particular amount of antiquity. 
Still more instructive is the UBB of the fully developed or horizontal top of the letters, almost all throughthese charters. In A and F tMn feat M veiy kable,-. plain straightlines beingused. In BO, and D., the npiaghtstrokes are with triangular tops, cloven on the upper side; the mdtras were formed waj as to avoid botli the mtdma and final forms ; except 
the following m* ^

these topsinto each other ; and the result was, that the mdtrds here are not always perfect: "but the intention is evident. In B., in v7hich the uprightstrokes were cappedin the same way, many of the letters present a still more disjointed appearance ; bufc there can be little dou>t that this was induced largelyin the preparationof the liihograph, which is plainly not altogether a mechanical one, and that the intended general style was precisely the same as in B., C-, and D. There ia^indeed, one letter, ph,in respectof which a distinction has to be drawn between A* and F. on the one side, and B., 0., D., and E. on the other : for some reason or other, in the latter four charters, probably from aiming generally at copying a more antique style, y~b~ is exceptionally formed, throughout,witll onlythe half mdtrd, over the left-hand part of the letter;1see, for instance, phatamand dspUtayanti,B. lines 18, 23, and muJetdphala and sp1idr$~ bhavach, E. lines 19, 1, and contrast these words with aphala and dsphotayanti, A. Hues 25, 29, and aphala and dattdt=phalam, F. lines 49, 50. .In other respects, the charters are all in unison : and the facts are as follows, jh does not occur, and fh occurs only subjoined ; tlie M, g3 n, n, fh, and 4 are what may be called round-topletters ; the f and dh have no mdtrd J the 2 has a 'half 'mdtrd, over the uprightstroke on the right hand, rather than a full one ; and all the other consonants have the full mdtrd : among the initial vowels, e, ai, 6, and au. are T-oiind top letters, and a, d, i, ?, and have the mdtrd ; & does not occur. In dealing with the question of the mdtrds, the instructive letters are p, m, y, sb, and s. In the Aphsad inacription of abcmt A.D. 650, the grantof Tinayakapalaof AJ). T94--&5, the Dedgadh. inscription of A.D. 862, the Gwalior inscriptionof A.D. 876-76, and even the Harsha inscription of A.D. 973, these five letters are without the complete mdtrd, having tops on only the left-hand part of them. But the Khajuraho inscription of A.D. 953-54 presents the fally developed m&tr&s in the five letters in question, as well as in all "the others which admit of it ; and they appear also in the Dewal in scriptionof A.D. 99S-93,8 in the Nsnyaur& copper-plate grant (North-West Provinces) of Dhanga deva, of A.D. 998 (Ind. Ant. Yol. XVI. p. 202, Plate), and in the Jhusi grant (North-West Provfeces) of Trildehanapala,of AJ5. 1027 (id. Vol. XVIII. p. 34, Plate). The transitional period appearsto be illustrated by the Pehoa inscription of about A.D. 900, where, for Instance, in patau,line I, ekatdm, line 1, odayah,line 6, gatSshu, Hne 1, and sadvritta, line 11, the pt im3 y, sh, and s distinctly have only the half mdtra over the left partof the letter, though in the majorityof cases the mdtrds of even these five letters are complete ; and still more pointedly by the Asni inscription (North-West Provinces) of Mahipala,of A.D. 916-17 (.Ind. Ant. Vol. IXVI. p. 174, Plate); which very clearly shews the letters in question both with, and without the completemdtrd. And the result from this feature is, that the presentcharters need not toe placed after A.D. 950, but can hardly be placedbefore A.D. 900. 
An examination of iiidiTridusl dharaeters leads to much the same result j except tirat the forms of fc and pJi, which represent almost the last stage before the development of the modern forms, seem to necessitate an appreciablylater period. A similar instance of the k with the markedly round shapeof the left-hand partof it which is exhibited in these charters9 - sees e.g., katak&t* A. linel, and paramabhajtdralca, B. lines 1, 2, occurs, by some chance or other, in the word drka, line 21, of the Gwalior inscription of A.D. 875-76 ; and this instance ucrast probably b taken as stewing that the form was known thei^ though it tad not Tbeem duced into eplgraptic use : but, in the remainder of that record, in the D^Sgadt Asni imscriptiOBSj and even in the Hcrsha and De^ra! iis3cript?ons, the k is decidedly of the pointed, typo* the round typeis followed first in the Pahoa Inscription of about A.D. 900 ; and it re-appears im the KhajuT&hft inscription, and in the Nanyaurft and grants.

the complete mdtrd, as exhibited in aphala, A. line 25, (the same word in F. lines 49S 50 shews essentially the same t^pe, but a later form in which the right-hand, stroke is continued down to the bottom line of the writing),1 the same typea and almost the same form, occurs in the Pehoa inscription of about AJ>. 900S in mt~phald, line 15, and dvirepho* line 10 : the only clear difference in form is, that in the present charters the stroke to the right and 'downwards, which turns p into ph, is left open, whereas in the Pehoa inscriptionit is turned back on to the upright stroke from which, it starts, as also, for instance, in the word pJialam*lines 26, 29, in the grant of "ikpatirjaof A.D, 974 or 975 ; but perhaps the Pehoa inscription stews alsoa especially in the word dvirSphd, in a rudimentary shape, the continnaiion of this stroke, downwards in a slanting direction to the right, which produced the next form of this letter before the final development o the modern form, and which is illustrated Tery plainly in the Ujjain grant of Bh6jadva of Dhar^ of AJX 1021 or 1022, in the word phalam, line 14 ( Ind. Ant. VoL VI. p. 549 and Plate). The other records, quoted above5 however^ shew the antique pfo of the Aphsad inseripti on and earlier records, which is of a very different type ; and so does even the Pehoa inscription, when the pJi is in conjunction with s? see sphnrita^ lin 2, splid/r^m, line 8, $pTtar%~ &faava,$9 line 9, splmran, line 11, and spkurj&t, line 14. The antique pfo appears again in the Nanyanrft grant (North-West Provinces) of Devavarmsd^Fa, of about AJX 1050 (Ind. Ant. Vol. XVI. p. 202, Plate), in phalam, line 16. But the grant of Chamdrad^va and Madana pftladfiva, of AJX 1097 (Ind. Ant. VoL XVIIL p. 12, Plate), reverting, in the word pJialmm, line 20, to the later type, shews also a form which is later than the form of that type used in the Pehoa inscription, and which was arrived at by making the stroke to the right aad then downwards start, not from the top, but frou^ the side of the p, and also by continuing it markedly still further down in a slanting direction to the right, without closingit in at all oss the side- stroke from which it starts. This last form, evidently the latest stage before tlie final development of the modern form, appears also in the grant of Madanavarmad^va, of A.D. 1134 (Ind. Ant. VoL XVI. p. 208* Plate), in phalam, line 19 ; and in all the later records which. I have examined. And the transitional period, whep it was developed, seems to "be marked 
by the GwMior inscription of MaMpala, of A.D. 1093 (Ind. Ant. Vol. XV. p. 36, Plate), which shews the antique type in otpJiulla, line I, and p*hala*&, line 11, bat the later type, and the later form o that type, in sphura^iy line 2, spJiufayline 12, and spJiatika, lines 38 and 39. This third form of the later type is undoubtedly of later origin than the form which appears in the present charters. But the form of the later type which we have in the Pehoa inscription of about A.D* 900 seems to be as certainly of earlier origin than the form used in the presentcharters ; for we have it in Western India in records 4f A.D. 754 and 807 (Ind. Ant. VoL XI. p* 112 and Plate, gulpha, text line 12 ; and p, 160 and Plate phalamy test line 57). 
Of the vowels, a, d, u (& does not occur) s and 6 do not present any matter for special com ment; they are simply developments of the types which occur through .all the .records mentioned above. The form of ?*, which, with an addition, makes also,is a very peculiar one. In A, lines 11, 22, 37, 89, 42, the short i is denoted by a straightline (in fact a mdtrd) with two circles }>elow it ; in B. line 325 the straight line is turned into a wavy line (and so also in 0. line S3f and IX line 36)j in E. lines 39, 57, the circles are still preserved, but (if the lithograph shews the letter completely)the straight line or mdtrd is broken up into two disconnected points ; and in F. line 64, the top of the letter is a wayy line of another shapes and there are semi-circles, instead of circles, below it : the long1 # occurs only by mistake for *; iti A. lines 16, 21, it is the short i of that record, with, below it, a twirl from the left to the right, then downwards, and theft upwardsto the left ; in F. line 44, it is made by a wavy line, two circles below it, and, below

them, a short line slightly curved downwards from left to right* Probably, the standard forms, of "both, the short and the long Towel, are those which we have In A.? and tike others are only fancy modifications of them. But the typeIB essentially the same throughout. It differs totally from the type followed in all the other records quoted aboTe, and exhibited in them by the short i^ which consists of two circles with a twirl, of irarying shapes^ below them,1 I do not find any close resemblance to it anywhere else.3 But it may have 
been developed from the short i of the earlier Eastern Chalnkya records, which was formed by a wavy line or two semicircles joined (easily capableof being developed into the straightline of A,)^ with two dots or circles below it (see, for instance, Ind. Ant. VoL XIII. p. 214 and Plate* i~k=aijat ^nAi^-dtiputam^ text Ene 40) ; the long and the short n, however, have no connection at all with the long % and the uy long or short, of the earlier Eastern Chalnkya records (see, for instance, uL Vol. VII. p. 17, and Plate, $4dnafa$ and uttaratak, text lines 54, 55S and VoL XIII. p. 186, and Plate, 4ri and uru9 text lines 179 18, 20, 24), The initial <?, wMch, with an addition, forms af (see eka9 @t@bhy8, and aivuli, A* lines 10, 12, 18), is a still mozse remarkable letter* It has no connection with the original triangular character, with the apex placed downwards, from which were derived the forms wMch appear In the Gw&lior, Pehoa, Asni, Khajur&hS, Harsha5 Dwal, and Nanyanrii records ;3 nor with the g of the earlier Eastern Chalukya records (see, for instance, Ind. Ant. VoL VII. p. 17, and Plate, 0tad, line 55, and VoL XIII. p. 214, and Plate, ekdda$a> line 27) : and it can hardly have been^developed from even another form of the e which we meet with In Girjar&t {id. Vol; XII. p. 159, and Plate, eldpur, line 14). In Prinsep's Antiquities, VoL II. pp. 40, 41, Plate xxxix., Mr* Thomas has given both the e and the ai, as we have them in A., as Bengali characters of the tenth century A.D., meaning really the eleventh century, as is evident from the fuller heading of his eighthline of alphabets in the first half of Ms Table. But I have not been able to verifyhis authority for this, an inscription from6 Adisur3* supposed to be dated A.D. 1065. As far as my knowledge goes, the forms of ^ and a% used in A*, are unique in epigraphic rebords* And* by Mr, Thomas himself in another Table (loc. $it. p. 53), and by a work entitled Qramm&tography41(see page 45 of it), forms which are practicallyidentical with these, are given as the modern Bengfi.ll forms. The initial au9 which Is but very seldom met with, occurs in aud&tya, P. line 40* It is different IB form from, but it may possibly he a development (and^ If so, It is certainly a later form) of, the au which we have in auttareSvarah in line 22 of the Harsha inscription of A.D. 973. As in the case of the $ and the ai? the form which we have here is, as far as my knowledge goes, unique in epigraphicrecords. And, while, as In the case of the ^ and the ai, Mr. Thomas has in*his first Table allotted this form to the tenth century A.D., meaning really the eleventh century, in his second Table he has given a practically identical form as the modern Bengali form ; and the Qrammatografhy does the same. 
1 Curiously enough, if we remove the straight line which forms the top of the long* as exhibited in A.s we have, exactly, the short I of the D6ga$h; Gw&lior, Harsha, D&waJ, Hanyaar^ and Jhftsi records. Bat this caa be only a chance coincidence. 
* The Chicacole Ganga grant of SatyavarmaB (Ind. Ant. Vol. XIV. p. 10, and Plate ; the genuineness of tins record is open to question) presents an equally peculiar form of the short n\ exactly an inversion of the * 
exhibited in A> two circles at the top, nd a straightor slightly curved line below them (see M9 line 20, and iddntm, line 22). The only ^approximation that I can find to this, is the i of iva in line la of the Kadi gprant (Gujarat)of Hftlaraja I., of AJX 986, where the vowel is formed by two semicircles, with a wavy line below them (Ind. Ant, Vol. VI. p. 192, Plate) ; but throughout the rest of that; record the form is the usual one, two semicircles, with a twirl below them. 
3 The Chicacole Ganga grant of D&vendravaromn (Ind, Ani. VoL XIII. p. 274, and Plate; the genuineness of this record, also, is open to question.) shews an sct inversion of this original form, a. triangle with the apex placed upwards (see Svamt line 23).

The general result of the palasograpfale consideration taken altogether, is, that these records cannot possibly be placed before AJX 000. They may belong to any later period But, on the whole, I should say that the characters are of the eleventh century, and that the kings mentioned in them are to b placed somewhere between A.D. lOOO^and I1OO. # % * * 
The pal&ographic considerations compel us to discard a somewhat tempting identification which was made by General Sir Alexander Onnningham, and the adoption of which was contemplated bj myself before I came to look fully Into the matter. A copper-plate grant from Rajim in the Raypur District., Central Fwvinces (Gupta Inscriptions^ p. 291), gives us the Barnes of Indrabala, of the P&nduvamsa or race of Pandit, his son XansLadSva, and NannadeFa's adopted son, the Bdja Tivaradeva OP MaMiva-Tivarar&ja, a feudatory prince of the Kosala country. An inscriptionat Sirpurin the same district (Ind. Ant. Vol. XVIII p. 179), which -supplies the name of Indrabala's father^ Udayana, and tells us that lie was of the lineage of the Moon, (to which the race of Pandu did belong),carries the genealogy two steps farther^ through Chandragapta, son of Nannaddva, and through Chaadragupta's son Harshagrtpta, to a prince named Balarjuna-SiTagnpta, son of Harshagupta, who evidently held the feudatory government of the territory round Sirpur* And Sir Alexander Curnlnghani (ArchtBol. Surv. Ind. Vol. XVII. pp 17, 853 87) identified this Balarjuna-SiTagupta with Sivagupta, father of Maha-Bhavagapta I. ; and also, accepting^like 'the other Trriters who aare been mentioned above, the local annals, and failing^ like them, to see that Janain^jaya and Yayati 
were, not feudatories of Maha-Bhavagupta I- and Mah&-Sivagnpta9 bac those persons themselves, he arrived* from the date which the local annals purportto givefor Yayati- Kesari, at the dates of A.D* 319 or 325 for Indrabala, A.D. 350 for ^annadera, A.D. 3J5 for Tivaraddva and Chandragnpta, A.D, 400 for Harstagupta,A.D. 425 for Sivagapta, A.D. 450 for Maha-Bhavagupta I, and his supposed contemporary Janamejaya* and A.D* 475 for Mata-Sivagapta and his supposed contemporary Yayati. The erroneous nature of the dates thus arrived at has already "been shewn, so far as the Siragnpia of the presentcharters and Ms successors are concerned. We are dealing now onlywith, the identification of the two Sivagnptas. It appeared to be a very plausible one ; for, Maha-Bhavagnpta 1, 3 and MB son and gmndson, also possessed the K6sala country ; and the absence of the prefix mah&9 and of a second fanciful name* IB the designationof his father, seems to suggestthat a sudden rise in the status of tie family occurred just then, in short* that Sivagnpta, having been at first only a feudatory princeof KSsala like Tivarad&Ta, subsequently became powerful enough to 
seize the paramount sovereigntyof that country^ and perhapsalso of the Ealinga territories. But, though I fully agree with Professor Kielhorn (In& Ant. Vol. XVIII. p. 179) that the Eajim grant is at any rate not older than A.D. 700, and that the Sirpur inscriptions may be placed in the eighth or ninth century, still, the pateograpMcevidence seems to render irapsssible the identification that was made by Sir Alexander Cunningham, Lithographs hare been published of the edited inscriptionof Sivagupta*the son of Harslisgapta, and of other records which mention him and Ms father (ArchasoL Sun. Ind. VoL XVII. Plates xviiL A. and B., and six. O.)- The original records evidently have the p5 m, y, sh9 and s with only the half mdfod, throughout. The & is of the pointed type. And another feature stamps them as 
belonging to even an- earlier period than that which may be estaMshed by these two characteristics ; the m has, not onlythe half m&trd, but also the straight arm to the leit, instead of the loop which appearsin the presentcharters and in all the records which have been quoted above, from the Deogadli inscription of A.I). 862 onwards,1 and which is carried 
In the Gwailor inscription of A,D. 875-76, indeed, the exact forro of this feature is rather that of a than of a loop with a bolksw centre ; but the type is the same, In the lithographs of theSirporJnicrtptK m appears with the loop twise, IQ A.

reignis made to cover the period B.C. 1037 to 822 ; but the annals say that he founded the city of B&jamahendri,i*e* R&jamandrior R&jamahMdrapiiraniIn the G4d&yari district, Madras Presidency ; and, though there may have been a city on the spot in earlier times, still (see Ind. Ant. Vol. XX* pp. 94, 266) there can be but little doubt, if any, that the name R&jamahndra pura was givento it by, or on account of,the Eastern Ohalukya king Amma I*, who had the Mruda of Baja-MaMndra,and whose period was A.D. 918 to 925 : consequently,at the best, with the name of Mah^ndradeva *there is coupledthe reminiscence of an event which took plabq some eighteen hundred yearslater. After Bfa6jadevathere reigned, according to Mr. Stirling's version, Vikram^ditya alone, and accordingto the other version Vikramaditya and his brother Sakaditya,for 185 years, from B.* 57 to AJD. 78, The objectof thia statement is simplyto fill the interval from the commencement of the Vikrama era (really in B.O. 58) to the commencement of the Saka era (really in AJD. 77). We know now (see Ind. Ant. Vol. XX. pp. 405S 409) that it was not till about the ninth century A.D. that the word vikrama began to be connected with the Tikrama era \ that most probably the appellation * Tikrama yearor time*simplydenotes the -poets9 *war-time,' the autumn, and was transferred from the autumn to the whole yearitself ; that the era did not derive its present name from any real king Vikrama or Vikram&ditya9 synchronous with the initial point of it ; and consequently, that this statement of the annals, though correct from the traditional point of view, is intrinsically as purely fictitious as the matter that precedes it. The period from A.D. 78 to 328 is filled by the reignsof Karmajit (65 years),* Hatkesvara'(51 years), Virabhuvaua (43 years)s NirmaladSva (45 years), Bhima (37 years), Sfibhanadeva (4 years), and Chandrad&va (5 years),1 Then, we are told, the Yavanas, who had invaded Orissain the time of S^bhanadSva and had put Ohandradeva to death, held the countryfor 146 years, from AJD. 328 to 4^4 Then, the annals say, Yay&ti-Kesari expelled the Yavtoas, and founded the K&sari dynasty ; he reigned for 52 years, and was succeeded by forty-three members of his dynasty, whose reigns varied from 2 to 54 years ; .and thus is filled the period from A.D, 474 to 1132. And then, it IB said, a king from the south, named Ohddaganga, obtained the throne of Orissa and established the Oangfivamsa. dynastyf he himself reigningfor 20 years, from A.D. 1132 to 1152* Except in the cases of Yay&ti-Ksari and Janamjaya Kesari, from Karmajit ( A.D. 78 to 143 ) to Suvama-KSsari, the last of the Kfesari dynasty ( A*D. 1123 to 1132 )? the names are so utterly unknown that they do not present material for individual criticism of the same kind : in respectof most of them, it can only be said that the terminations Sdifiya and varman9 or any of the other endings which were so much affected in early times, do not occur anywhere among thems and that not one of them has any ringof antiquity in the sound of it : they may possibly be real names of later rulers, misplacedin order to make out a consecutive chronological series; this, however, is the utmost that can be said for them. But I would draw special attention to the names of Narasimha-K^sari, K&rma-K&sarij Hatsya-KSsari, Varaha-E&sari, V&mana-^esari^ and Parasa-Kfesari, which are placed one after the other in the period A.D. 1013 to 1080 ; in respectof these, nothing could be plainer than the eviden t fact that the inventive faculty and other resources of the persons irho concocted the annals failed. them, and that they here drew on the incarnations of Vishnu as the man-lion, the tortoise, the fish, the boar, and the dwarf, and as Parasur&ma, the destroyerof the Kshatriyas. Other clear indications of a recourse to mythology present themselves in the names of Padma-K6sari (A.D. 701 to 706), Q-andharva-K^sari (A.D. 740 to 754), Kali-X&sari. (A..D. 778 to 792), MadhusManaK6sari (A.D. 904 to 920), and Tripura Kfesari (A.D. 961 to 971). And the name of Alabu-K6sari (A.D, 623 to 677) distinctly suggestsa Musalman with some such appellation as( Aiap Kh&n.* But the cases of Yay&ti and Jaiaamjaya-K^sari are, even alone, amply sufficient to upsetthe whole list.

As we have already seen, Yayati-Ke'sari, representing Yayati-Maha-Sivagupta,is mistakenly described as the first of his dynasty, and is placed at least five centuries before the earliest date to which he can possibly belong ; and Janamejaya-E&sari, representinghis father and predecessor Janamfejaya-Maha-Bhavagupta I., is placed nearly three centuries after him, in the period A.D. 
754to 763. Chddaganga ( A.D. 1132 to 1152 )is possibly a historical person, placed not very far from the period to which he really belonged ; he may be identified with Anantavarma Chddagangadeva of the family of the later Eastern Gangas, lords of Trikalingaor the three Kalingas, who was anointed to the succession in A.D. 1078, and for whom we have also the date of A.D. 1118-19 (Ind. Ant. Vol. XVIII. pp. 162, 166) : one of the records^ofthis king tells ns that he replaced the fallen lord of TTtkala, i.e. Orissa, in his kingdom (W3. p. 171) j and he seems, therefore, to have played some important part in the local history. Bat all that precedes, resolves itself into simply this : The objectin view was the magnifyingof the antiquity and importance of the temple of Jagannathaat Purl, and of all its surroundings and connections. The persons who set about doing this, by concocting the annals, could not well go back to before the commencement of the Kaliyuga,the present age. But they felt bound to go back as far as that point. And they had before them two other well-known epochs, the initial pointsof the Vikrama and the Saka eras, and, apparently, the date, not much displaced,of a fairly recent king, Anantavarma-ChSdagangadeva.1 They thus had three periodsto fill np with names, B.C. 3102 or 3101 to B.o'. 58 or57j B.C. 58 or 57 to A.D. 77 or 78; and A.D. 77 or 78 to A.D. 1100 or thereabouts. The last of these periods, being the best filled one, seems to have been taken in hand by them first ; and, except for the alleged occupation by the Yavanas for a hundred and forty-six years, from A.D. 328 to 474, as regardsthe real meaning of which see further on, they filled it, partly with a few names which are obviously inventions, and partly with a number of names, connected mostly with reigns of reasonable and admissible duration, which present no appearanceof antiquity and cannot by any means be acceptedfor the period to which they are allotted, but may very possibly be names of real rulers of later date, say of the twelfth century and onwards, probably many of them petty princes contemporaneous with each other. But the accounts for this period do not even agree with each other ; for ( see page 340 below ), another compilation makes the KSsari dynasty beginin B.O. 144 or 132 and end in A.D. 553 or 565, places next an isolated: Hag of the 'Chourang dynasty' named Udi Patehourang,' who reigned for ninety years, and then a line of kings belongingto the Solar Baoe, which lasted till A.D. 1324, and makes the Gangavamsa dynasty begin only then. The interval from the commencement of the Vikrama era to the commencement of the Saka era was accounted for in the customary traditional manner, with the reignsof a purely fictitious king Vikram&ditya and his brother akaditya. On the earliest period,less- trouble was expended. The list was openedwith three well-knowa Puranio names, which were made to account for 1,294 years ; and it was imperfectly eked out with only nine names, which were made to fill the remaining 1,750 years with reignsof almost equallyfabulous duration : of these nine names, seven may possibly, like some of the names of the third period, be real names of rulers of the twelfth century and onwards, or, as already suggested, one of these seven may contain an anachronistic and otherwise erroneous reminiscence of the great Buddhist king AiSka; but one, that of Mahendradlva, seems to be a pure invention, to account for the name of a city which is to be allotted to a period about eighteencenturies later; and the ninth, that of Bh6iadeva, is the name of a real kingantedated by about twelve centuries. In the whole account, from B.O. 3101 up to the mention of Chddagaaga with the date of A.D. 1132 to 1152, tli only historical gleams which can be detected are that (1) the openingof the list

with three Pnranic kings of the Lunar Sace* to which race the copper-plate charters refer Sivagupta and his successors, suggests a knowledge of the fact that there really had been kings of Orissa who claimed to belong to that lineage j (2) there certainly is preserved a reminiscence, but a completely erroneous and anachronistic one, of two of those real kings, Janamejaya-Maha-BhavaguptaI. and Yayati-Maha-Sivagupta ; and (3) the alleged occupation by the Yavanas for a hundred and forty-sis years, from. A.D. 328 to 474, plainly embodies a vague memory of the Early Gupta kings,for whom, as far as their unbroken lineal succession goes, we have dates (see Oupta Inscriptions, Introd. p. 17) ranging from the year 82 to the year 147 or 149 of an era commencing A.D. 320,1 and whose power, extending from Kathiawad rightacross India to Lower Bengal, formed a barrier between Orissa or any part of Southern India and the' Yavanas'of that period, viz. the Indo-Scythians of the Panjab.3 And, with such results as these before us, it is evident that everything relating to ancient times, which has been written on the unsupported authority of these annals, has to be expunged bodily from the pages of history. 
It only remains to say a few more precise words about the 'Yavanas* who are mentioned in these annals : it is obvious that, whoever they may be, no real history connected with them is preserved in the annals ; but it is also as well to shew clearly who they really were. They are first brought to notice in connection with Vajrad6va (allotted to the period B.C. 538 to 421), in whose reign, we are told, they invaded Orissa from Marwar, Delhi, Babul Dg'(supposed to be Iran, t,e. Persia, and so explained to Mr. Stirling), and Kabul, but were repulsed; and, Mr Stirling says (Asiatic Besearches, Vol. XV. p. 258),"then follows an 
" incomprehensible story, "involving some strange anachronism, about Imarut or Himarat Khan, who comes from Delhi with a large army and attacks the Raja." They are not specifically named in connection with Narasimhadeva (B.C. 421 to 306 ; he is called< Sarsankh Deo'by Mr. Stirling) ; but they seem to be meant in the statement that"another chief from the far north invaded the country during this reign, but he was defeated, and the Orissa prince reduced a great part of the Delhi "kingdom" (Orfcw, Tol. II. Appendix VII. p. 184), or, as 'Mr. Stirling aays," 
" Sarsankh Deo, a warlike prince, is attacked by another Khan, whose name is variously written, and is always "so incorrectly spelt that ifc is "impossible to unravel it; the Baja defeats the invader and emboldened by Ms success, advances upon Delhi, and reduces a great part of the country"In the time of Manakrishnadeva (B.C. 306 to 184; he is called 'Hans or Hangsha Deo' by Mr Stirling), the Ya-vanas again invaded the country, from Kashmir, but were driven back after many battles. Bhdjadeva also (B.C. 184 to 57) is said to have repulsed a Yavana invasion from Sindh, according to Mr. Stirling's account. And finally, in the time of SdbhanadeVa (A.D. 319 to 323) the Yavanas invaded Orissa by sea, under the leadership of a person named Eafctabahu, t.. Bed-arm'or'Bloody-arm,' and on this occasion with success :' the Yavana force indeed, after effecting a landing and plundering the town of Purl, was overwhelmed by the sea - but the Yavanas remained masters of the country; gdbhanadeva, who had fled before their

After wliat lias Ibeen shewn alx>ve as to the valueless nature o their contents, there is* perhaps, not much to be gained from any consideration of the time when tlao annals may have been commenced. Still, a few words on this point may be not amiss. Of the two 
am$dvalis used by Mr. Stirling for his article in the Asiatic Researches, "Vol. XV., one was obtained from a Br&hmag. of Purf, and the other from a Brahman living in the family of the R&ja of *Puttia Sarengerh/ "one of the branches of the royal house of Orissa.9? In respect of the former, he was told that it was originally composed' by some of that Brahman*s ancestors, three or four centuries ago, and had been continued up to date (loc.cit. p, 256). No information is given as to the time when the compilation of the second tfamSdvali may have been started ; but there can be no reasons for attributing real antiquity to this, any more than to the other.1 The M&dld-Pdnji pretends to greater age. According to the article in the AsiatiG Researches^ the compilation of it was commenced in the time oftfGhdrang'' or Sarong- Deo *(loc. ait. p. 268) ; i.e. in the time of Chddaganga, 0r5 according to the annals themselves* in the period A.D. 1132 to 1152. And another compilation, or a different recension of the annal% woald invest it with eyen much greater antiquity: the Jour. Beng. A&+ Soc. Vol. VI. (1837) p. 756 ff.j contains another account of the kings of Orissa, taken from a manuscript by Mr. Stirling, found after Ms death, in respect of which we are told that it is- the source whence the materials for Ms article In the Asiatic Researches was taken, but which really gives a very different account, both in names and in dates ; according to this compilation, the Kesari dynasty was established by Chandra-K&sari, Yay&ti-K6sari being here represented as the second king of that line, in B.C. 144 or 132,3 and lasted till A.D. 553 or 565 ; then came Udi Patchourang' of the 'Chourang* dynasty3 reigning for ninety years, from A.D. 553 or 565 ; and he started the compilation of the Hddld-Pdftji, in the period^ thus made out, A.D. 553 to 643, or 565 to 655. This is altogetherincredible. The period A.D. 1132 to 1152 is, perhaps, a possible one; though not very probable, because the statements which follow the mention of Chddaganga are not suggestiveof any true history having been preserved even from that point- But this much is certain, whatever may be the date when the compilation of the annals was commenced, tlie stories about the Tavanas shew that they cannot have been finally reduced to their present form till the sixteenth century AJX Sir William Hunter has said (Om*a, Vol. I. p. 286) that the vamMvali on which Mr. Stirling's posthumous article was based, is"a subsequently compiled list." But, as far as the published account goes, it makes no mention at all of the Tavanas ; unless this expression is used in the original where in Mr* Stirling's render ing we have* Musalm&n* and 'Moghal,' in the account of T61inga-Mukundad6va (A.D. 1512 to 1534, or thereabouts) and onwards. And if this be the case, it seems rather to be a rudi mentary compilation, of earlier date, from which the fuller annals were afterwards elaborated.

. 47.] BEOOBDS OF THE SOMAVAMSI KINGS OF KATAK. 345   
*s O.f and D. Katak Copper-plate Grants of the thirty-first 
of Maha-BhaTagupta I. 
These three records form what is called in line 46 of B., line 48 of C. and Hue m of D.< a, triphLall-tamra-sasana or set of three connected charters. The object of WHA to register the fact that Maha-BhaTagupta I. granted to a Brahman named Siibir*-* Apparently the person who is mentioned In them as bis chief minister* -the of and. AlSndaia in the P6v, vishaya (B, lines 4, 5), ArMgr,m& in the Tulamvft (C. Hoes 4, 5), and TulSndfi,, or perhaps TrulSndg,, in the Sandn& ishaya (D. line 5), in th 
XCdsaLa dsa or country (B. line 4, 0. line 4, D. line 5). The charters were all by one sand the same person, M&huka, on Marga gukla 13 in the thirty first year of the of Bliavagnpta I. ;and they were all engraved "by one and the same person, MiihaYa* Wlr trie grants were not all recorded in one and the same charter,,, is not; except on hypothesis that, the villages conveyed by each charter beingIn different territorial divisions, separate deeds were requiredfor exhibition to the different local authorities of the three divisions. 
As the plates are not all of the same size, and so the forty-nine lines of which B* 3rn.ii out Into fifty-onelines in O. and fifty-threelines in D., the records do not He trail armiJ on the three sets of plates. But* with the exception that* for the words jEofa{ta)?od&r P'/tu wia{8ha}yiya-Ran4(i-grdm& \ tatJid Mdndald-grdme of B. lines 4, 5, we have STVi'/- !ifrA1 Tulumva-Jchandtya-Arkigrdmd-grdmein C, lines 4, 5, and T&fatsafla-deti Sz^d3-l-r*fj.' rlj ; :^r,- irl(? trtf)Und&-grdmein D.

The interiors of some of the letters shew the usual marks of the working of the engraver's tool. And the way in which the soft copper was pressed up in the process of engraving, has rendered the lithograph rather Indistinct in some places ; especially in plateiL 6. The language is Sanskrit. There are the customary benedictive and imprecatoryverses in lines 17 to 84 ; and three ordinary verses in lines 37-42 and 48* 49. In respect of orthography^ the only points that call for special notice are (1) the use of the guttural nasal, instead of the anusvdra, in triniattimS, line 44 ; and (2) the use of t? for 6 throughout. / 
The inBC^?iptionf which is styledin line 46, a triplialt-t&mra-S&s&iia or one copper charter of a connected set of three, the others being C. and D., is one of Haha-Bhavagnpta I., who in line 48 is called Kosal-endra^ orc< lord of Kdsala." The charter contained in it was isaued from the city of Katafcas while the king was in residence at the &rma or pleasiixe~gardeiu And the object of it was to register the grant, to a Br&htaan, of two villages named Ran.d, and 
in the P6v& vishaya in Kosala* The charter was written by a clerk attached to the office of the MahAsa^md'hivigrakin Hallsdatta* on Margasirsha s-ukla 13 in the thirty-first year of the reign of Maht-Bhavagupta I, 
O. 
This record is now brought to notice for' the first time, I believe* I edit it from the original plates, which I obtained for examination from Mr. Beames in 1883. I have no precise information as to -where they were found ; but it appears to have been somewhere at, or closely in the neighbourhood ofs Katak* 
The plates are three in number, each measuring* about 9* by 5J*. The edges of them were fashioned slightly thicker than the inscribed portions, so as to sei*ve as rims to- protect the writing ; and the inscriptionis in a state of perfect preservation, exceptin a few places in the lavfc lines of plateii. 6. The ring* on which the plates are strung, is about f"thick and 41^ iii diameter. It had not been cut when the grant came under my notice- The seals in which the ends of the ring are secured, is circular, about If*in diameter. In relief on a slightly counter* sunk surface, it has the goddess LakshmJ, seated on a throne, with, on each side of her, an elephant, with its trunk lifted up over her head ; and, below this, a legead* of which, the first letter and the last four are rather indistinct, but which is plainly 4&Mahd*Bhavayuptarfy'adfaa. The weight of the three platesis 4 Ibs. 4 oz.? and of the ring and seal 1 Ib. 15| 025, ; total .6 Ibs. 3f oj& The characters are of precisely the same type with those of B.; the t>3r$m<&5 and the final forms of, n, and m, are used almost exactlyas in B. The average siase of the letters is about TV^ The engraving is good and deep; but, the plates being substantial, the letters do not show through on the reverse sides. The interiors of same of them shew the usual marks of the working of the engraver's tool. There are the same peculiarities of ortliogs?aplxy as in B.

This record was originally brought to notice in 1882, in the Jour. B&ng. As. 8oe. Vol. LI. Part I. Proceedings, p.9, fL, by Dr. Bajendralala Mitra3 according to whose account the plates were found at Katak. I notice it from the original plates, which I examined in 1884 ; they were then in the collection of the Bengal Asiatic Society, having been presented by Mr! Winterscale. 
The plates ate three in number, each -measuring about 8-fT by' 5-f*. The edg-aa of them were fashioned glightly thicker than the inscribed porfekmB9 so as to serr as- rims to protect the

It is perhaps another form of the name of the Uofja-Tiflageio the Madhyadeia or Middle Conntry, which is called Takk&rikA in tlie Kalas-BtiarAkh grant of Bhillama III. of A.D. 1025 (ft* Ant.

I re-edlt it from the lithograph, with tit BabuWrticle on it winch, though It is OB a veiy small scale, and tltoLgh li Is pki% no! a purely mechanical reproduction,' suffices to make the text clear all through, except for 
some four or five letters in line 86. 
The plates are three in number, each measuring about 8* by 6** ; it would appear that the first plate is engraved on one side only, and the third on both sides. The ring, oa which the plates were strung, with any seal that there may have teen OB it, is reported to have "been lost. The characters are N&garl, of the northern class ; they are rexy to the characters of B., 0.5 and D., and were possibly written, for reproduction by tie engrfcver, by the same person who wrote those records. They Include forms of the decimal 1 to 7 In lines 7 to 20, and of the figure 9 in line 65; and also forms of the numerical for 3 and 10m line 65.s The avagraha occurs twice; in yatM&mSbhir, Hue 29, where it is not really required, and in yasosbhivriddhaye, line 38, where the use of it is quite correct. The vwdma occurs with t, In drdt, line 11, tasmdt &ndpwd s line 125 and anwSdMt, line 42* forms occur, of n, in yasmin, line 11 ? rfrtma-n, line 14, sarvvdn, line 293 and priy&nf line 61, and of tn 9 (1) resembling an anusvdra with a vir&ma "below it, in mbJi4^Mfam^ line 16, and line 51, and (2) in a more elaborate shape, in drtham, lines 375 383 and probably in &&arafdm, line 29. The language is Sanskrit. And, in addition to the customary benedictive and impre catory verses in lines 42 to 59* there are ordinary Terses in lines 1 to 20 and 60 to 2* In respect of orthography, the only points that call for special notice are (1) the use of tie 
guttural nasal ny instead of the anusvdra, before ^ in dhvan^ana, by mistake for <&& 2, line 8 j (2) the use of for &, throughout ; and (3) the use of j for j? in jaydti,line 64* The inscription is one of Maha-Sivagupta, otherwise called Tsyti. The clmrter COB lained in it was issued from a town named Vinitspiam, on the bank of the irrer Ajod the object of it was to register a grant, to a Br&hman, of a YiUsg Hamad gr&ma in the Maarada visliaya or district in BaksMua-Ko&aia.4 At the end is recorded the date, apparentlyfor the -writing of the charter, of Jy&htha 13 in the yew of tbe reign of Yayati, \e.of
