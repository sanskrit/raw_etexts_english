228 WEST 39TH STREET,  
NEW YORK,  
*8th December, 1895*.

DEAR FRIEND (Mr. E. T. Sturdy),

After ten days of a most tedious and rough voyage I safely arrived in
New York. My friends had already engaged some rooms at the above where I
am living now and intend to hold classes ere long. In the meanwhile the
Theosophists have been alarmed very much and are trying their best to
hurt me; but they and their followers are of no consequence whatever.

I went to see Mrs. Leggett and other friends, and they are as kind and
enthusiastic as ever.

Did you hear anything from India about the coming Sannyasin?

I will write later fuller particulars of the work here.

Kindly convey my best love to Miss Müller and to Mrs. Sturdy and all the
other friends and kiss baby for me. 

Yours ever in the *Sat*,

VIVEKANANDA.
