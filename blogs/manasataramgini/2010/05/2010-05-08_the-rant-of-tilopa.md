title = "The rant of tilopA"

+++
The nAstika tilopA from the va\~Nga country is highly regarded among
Tibetans. He was an aggressive subversionist of his former dharma. He
says in apabhraMsha:  
bamhA vihNu mahesura devA | bohisattva ma karahu seva | deva ma pUjahu
titya Na jAvA | devapUjAhi Na mokkha pAvA ||

Here tilopA says: bodhisattva, do not worship the deva-s brahmA, viShNu
and maheshvara; do not do pUjA to deva-s do not go to tIrtha-s. One does
not get mokSha by doing pUjA to deva-s. Earlier, the sthaviravAdin
buddhaghosha (born a brAhmaNa in magadha) who calls upon the nAstika-s
to desist from hearing the rAmAyaNa or the bhArata. Actually, this
strain is an original aspect of the tAthagata-s that passed unchanged
through the transition of the yAna-s. Umakant Mishra points to a li\~Nga
in the Soro village of Orissa that has been defaced by the carving of a
nAstika dharaNi on it. So the pAShaNDa-s were ready to put these words
into practice. Yet we are repeatedly told that it is the Astika-s who
were the buddha-busters (to borrow a favorite term of the Mohammedan:
bhut-shikhan).
