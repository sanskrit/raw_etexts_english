तु॒रीयं॒ नाम॑ य॒ज्ञियं॑ य॒दा कर॒स्तदु॑श्मसिआदित्पति॑र्न ओहसे

“We desire, when thy take the fourth sacrifical name. Then only you are
proclaimed as our lord”

Here we can see, the fourth name was called a sacrifical name. Or one
related to the sacrifice according to Sāyāṇā (yajñasaṃbandhi). Sāyāṇā
further comments and says there are four names – “nakṣatranāma guhyaṃ
nāma prakāśaṃ nāmeti trīṇī nāmāni somayāji iti turīyaṃ nāma tañca
yajñiyam“  
  
First Name – Star Name/Constellation Name (nakṣatranāma)  
Second Name – Secret Name (guhyaṃ)  
Third Name – Public Name (prakāśa)  
Fourth Name – Sacrifical/Noteworthy Name (yajñiya)  
  
This system of four names reminds one of the Ancient Roman pagan system
of four names.  
  
Praenomen – Personal Name  
Nomen – Genus Name, that of your wider tribe  
Cognomen – Family Name, that of your narrower family group within the
tribe (think of it like the modern surname)  
Agnomen – Noteworthy Name (a name given due to heroic valorous acts),
cognomen ex virtue.

Specifically the correspondence between the Agnomen and the Yajñiya
nāma. Both being derived and given to individuals who had performed
noteworthy acts. The remnant of it in India seems to be names like
Agnihotṛi or Chaturvedi (titular names given to individuals who were
agnihotrin-s or chatush-vedin-s). In Ancient Rome, this is something
like Creticanus or Africanus for being a General with a military victory
in Crete or Africa. The star constellation name is unique to India and I
don’t recall any equivalent.

note:  
  
turīyaṃ – fourth, nāma – name, yajñiya – sacrifical, karaḥ – you take,
tad – that, aśumasi – we desire, āt – then, it – only, patiḥ – lord, naḥ
– ours, aohase – you recognized
