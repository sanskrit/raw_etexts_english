We invoke the fierce jha\~NkAra-bhairava. We had worshipped the terrible
god with the great litany, the mahAnyAsa on the great night that he may
be pacified.

Having worshipped the great god we were reminded of the intriguing words
of the illustrious Kashmirian Tantric abhinavagupta of shrinagara in his
great work the tantrAloka (TA 15.264b-15.266):

na khalveSha shivaH shAnto nAma kashcidvibhedavAn // 264  
sarvetarAdhvavyAvR^itto ghaTatulyo.asti kutracit /  
mahAprakAsharUpA hi yeyaM saMvidvijR^imbhate // 265  
sa shivaH shivataivAsya vaishvarUpyAvabhAsitA /  
tathAbhAsanayogo .ataH svarasenAsya jR^imbhate// 266

The shiva which they imagine, completely pacified, differentiated from
all other things, transcendent to all other paths, similar therefore to
something inert, inert like glass does not exist anywhere at all. shiva
in effect is nothing more than this “state of being”, which unfolds its
in the form a great light. Its very condition as shiva indeed consists
in the fact that the all the varied forms of the universe appear. This
process of manifestation into all the form of the universe produces
itself completely freely within him.
