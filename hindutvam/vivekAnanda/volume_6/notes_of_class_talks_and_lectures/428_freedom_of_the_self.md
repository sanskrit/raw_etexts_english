## FREEDOM OF THE SELF

As we cannot know except through effects that we have eyes, so we cannot
see the Self except by Its effects. It cannot be brought down to the low
plane of sense-perception. It is the condition of everything in the
universe, though Itself unconditioned. When we know that we are the
Self, then we are free. The Self can never change. It cannot be acted on
by a cause, because It is Itself the cause. It is self-caused. If we can
find in ourself something that is not acted on by any cause, then we
have known the Self.

Freedom is inseparably connected with immortality. To be free one must
be above the laws of nature. Law exists so long as we are ignorant. When
knowledge comes, then we find that law nothing but freedom in ourselves.
The will can never be free, because it is the slave of cause and effect.
But the "I" behind the will is free; and this is the Self. "I am free" —
that is the basis on which to build and live. And freedom means
immortality.
