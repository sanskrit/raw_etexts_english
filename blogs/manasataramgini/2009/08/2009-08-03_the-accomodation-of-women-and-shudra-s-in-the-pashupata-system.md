title = "The accomodation of women and shUdra-s in the pAshupata system"

+++
As we noted before the pAshupata tradition was originally strictly
restricted to brAhmaNa males who were educated in the veda-s. They were
celibate ascetics who kept away from regular social interaction. But by
the time of the vAmana purANa we note that the pAshupata-s were
accommodating shUdra-s (VaP 6.92). This is suggested by the mahAvratin
dhanada having the shUdra arNodara as a disciple. From inscriptional
evidence in the southern country we note that women and shUdra-s are
included amongst patrons of the pAshupata maTha-s. Is there any other
evidence for their accommodation? It is seen that secondary shloka
texts, resembling the vedic texts to which the shUdra-s had no adhikAra,
were composed in the paurANic period when the shUdra-s were being
accommodated. These texts provide the same material as the vedic
mantra-s on which they are modeled making their purport accessible to
the 4th varNa. Let us consider some examples briefly that are provided
by lakShmIdhara and the li\~Nga purANa.. The first of this is a stand in
for the pa\~nchabrahma-mantra-s. Only 3 brahma mantra-s are represented
here. I discussed this with R1â€™s father. He speculated that perhaps the
bahurUpI and rudra-gayatrI are genuinely vaidika and cannot be
paraphrased as paurAnic shloka-s. Alternatively, their paraphrase has
been lost.

Similarly the following shloka-s attributed to brahmA are a shatarudrIya
substitute for the 4th varNa to use. It has high frequency of overlap
with the names of rudra in the shatrarudrIya and also includes an
abbreviated paraphrase of the pa\~nchabrahma:

This strange mantra is believed to be a rudra gAyatrI substitute
althought it does not retain meter and has a grammatically strange form
as it stands:  
* IshAnAya kadrudrAya prachetase tryaMbakAya sharvAya tanno rudraH
prachodayAt ||*
