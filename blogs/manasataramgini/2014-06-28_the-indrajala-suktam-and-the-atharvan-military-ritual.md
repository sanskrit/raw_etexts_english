title = "The indrajAla-sUktaM and the atharvan military ritual"

+++
An atharvan military ritual for kShatriya-s headed to war involves
deployment of AV-vulgate 8.8 or its cognate AV-P 16.29. The ritual is
specified by the kaushika sUtra 16.9-20 and some details are provided by
the atharvan commentators dArila and keshava.

The atharvan purohita uses a fire drill with an ashvattha (Pipal) plank
and a badhaka drill-bit (One tradition holds that this plant is Taxus
baccata) and generates fire via friction using the below churning
mantra:

indro manthatu manthitA shakraH shUraH puraMdaraH |  
yathA hanAma senA amitrANAM sahasrashaH ||1||  
indra the shaker, shake up the enemies, the mighty hero, the breaker of
forts, so that we might slaughter the armies of our enemies by the
thousands.

When he sees the sparks he places an old rope with the incantation (in
place of amUm he may use the name of the enemy army throughout this
deployment):  
pUtirajjur upadhmAnI pUtiM senAM kR^iNotv amUm |

When he sees the rope smoking he utters the incantation:  
dhUmam parAdR^ishyA .amitrA hR^itsu A dadhatAM bhayam |

When the rope catches fire he recites the mantra:  
agnim parAdR^ishyA .amitrA hR^itsu A dadhatAM bhayam |

These are derived from the R^ik  
pUtirajjur upadhmAnI pUtiM senAM kR^iNotv amUm |  
dhUmam agnim parAdR^ishyA .amitrA hR^itsv A dadhatAM bhayam ||2||  
Let the putrid rope, blowing forth make that army putrid; let fear be in
our enemies hearts seeing the smoke and fire from afar.

Then he places samidh-s of the ashvattha, badhaka, tAjadbha\~Nga
(castor), Ahva (palAsha= Butea monosperma), khadira (Acacia) and shara
(arrow-grass) with the below mantras:

amUn ashvattha niH shR^iNIhi khAdAmUn khadirAjiram |  
tAjadbha\~Nga iva bhajantAM hantv enAn vadhako vadhaiH ||3||  
O pipal, pound those forces, devour them O khadira, break them O castor
plant, kill them with weapons, O vadhaka\!

paruShAn amUn paruShAhvaH kR^iNotu hantv enAn vadhako vadhaiH |  
kShipraM shara iva bhajantAM bR^ihajjAlena saMditAH ||4||  
O piercing plant make those of the enemy army pierced, may the vadhaka
plant slay them weapons\! Quickly like a reed may they be broken and
entrapped in the great snare.

Then the objects of war invoked in the rest of the sUktaM are serially
offered dual offerings by the atharvan ritualist: with his right hand he
makes a ghee oblation with his darvi ladle ending with svAhA for objects
of war of his side and to gods for his side; e.g. jAlAya svAhA |
jAladaNDAya svAhA | indrAya svAhA | idam indrAya na mama | etc  
With his left hand he makes oblations of i\~NgiDa oil to the same fire
on the badhaka wood with a deprecation for this foes; e.g. dasyUnAM
senAyai durAhA | na mama idam |

antarikShaM jAlam AsIj jAladaNDA disho mahIH |  
tenAbhidhAya dasyUnAM shakraH senAm apAvapat ||5||  
The atmosphere was the net, the great directions were were the net-rods;
entrapping them therewith indra uprooted the army of the dasyu-s.

bR^ihad dhi jAlaM bR^ihataH shakrasya vAjinIvataH |  
tena shatrUn abhi sarvAn ny ubja yathA na muchyAtai katamash chanaiShAm
||6||  
Great indeed is the web of the mighty indra, of the vigorous one;
therewith may you swoop upon all enemies, such that no one of them may
escape.

senayA ||7||  
Great, O indra the valiant, is the web of yours, which is great worth a
thousand, with hundred-fold powers; therewith entrapping the army of the
dasyu-s, indra slew a hundred, a thousand, a ten thousand and a hundred
million\!

This great world itself was the web of the great indra; with that web I

mantras, toil, lassitude, and delusion with these I entrap the enemy
army.

army is bound, having bound them I take them to meet the funereal
messengers of death\!

Here are spread out the nooses of death, if you step into which you are

bhavash cha pR^ishni-bAhush cha sharva senAm amUM hatam ||17||  
The gharma is offered via the kindled fire as this thousand-slaying
oblation; bhava, one having pR^iShni in his arms, sharva (all names of
rudra) slay that enemy army\!

||21||  
The heaven and earth roar at them together; let the atmosphere together
with the deities roar at them; let them not have a knowledgeable one in
their midst, let them not find a foundation; mutually striking each
other may they go unto death\!

dishash chatasro .ashvataryo deva-rathasya purodAshAH shaphA antarikSham

parirathyam ||22||  
The 4 directions are the mules of the god-chariot; the ritual cakes are
hoofs; the atmosphere the seat; heaven and earth the two sides; the
seasons the reins; the intermediate directions the attendants and speech
the chariot armor.

indraH savyaShThAsh chandramAH sArathiH ||23||  
The year is the chariot; the parivatsara year the chariot base; virAT
the pole; agni the mouth of the chariot; indra the one standing to the
left on the chariot; moon the charioteer.

ito jayeto vi jaya saM jaya jaya svAhA |  
Conquer here, conquer the foes here, conquer completely, conquer; hail\!

ime jayantu parAmI jayantAM svAhaibhyo durAhAmIbhyaH |  
nIlalohitenAmUn abhyavatanomi ||24||  
Let those enemies be conquered; hail to these; wail to the enemies; with
the aid of the blue-red rudra (nilalohita) I stretch the web out upon
those enemies\!

After the last svAhA and durAhA he takes a red shoot of the ashvattha
tree and entwines it with red and blue threads. Then he sticks it into
the north of the fire and uttering the incantation nilalohitena… he
pulls out the shoot towards the right with the threads.

While the ritual itself is symbolic, the traps and the web alluded to in
the sUktaM is hardly symbolic and represent real snares that are likely
to be poisoned with castor. This is also likely to be combined with fire
and smoke.
