*To the Hale Sisters*

DETROIT,  
*12th March, 1894*.

DEAR SISTERS,

I am now living with Mr. Palmer. He is a very nice gentleman. He gave a
dinner the night before last to a group of his old friends, each more
than 60 years of age, which he calls his "old boys' club". I spoke at an
opera house for two hours and a half. People were very much pleased. I
am going to Boston and New York. I will get here sufficient to cover my
expenses there. I have forgotten the addresses of both Flagg and Prof.
Wright. I am not going to lecture in Michigan, Mr. Holden tried to
persuade me this morning to lecture in Michigan but I am quite bent upon
seeing a little of Boston and New York. To tell you the truth, the more
I am getting popularity and facility in speaking, the more I am getting
fed up. My last address was the best I ever delivered. Mr. Palmer was in
ecstasies and the audience remained almost spellbound, so much so that
it was after the lecture that I found I had spoken so long. A speaker
always feels the uneasiness or inattention of the audience. Lord save me
from such nonsense, I am fed up. I would take rest in Boston or New York
if the Lord permits. My love to you all. May you ever be happy!

Your affectionate brother,

VIVEKANANDA.
