## XCVI

124 E. 44TH STREET, NEW YORK,  
*14th April, 1896*.

DEAR MRS. BULL,

... Here is a curious person who comes to me with a letter from Bombay.
He is a practical mechanic and his one idea is to see cutlery and other
iron manufactories in this country.... I do not know anything about him,
but even if he be a rogue, I like very much to foster this sort of
adventurous spirit among my countrymen. He has money enough to pay his
way.

Now, if with all caution testing of his genuineness of spirit, you feel
satisfied, all he wants is to get some opportunities of seeing these
manufactories. I hope he is true and that you can manage to help him in
this. 

Yours with kind regards,

VIVEKANANDA.
