bANa’s kAdambari mentions ShaShThI and skanda being painted on the walls
of the birthing room of the heroine, and he also alludes to her in the
harShacharita. This shows that the worship of ShaShThI was prevalent in
North India at least till the first quarter of the 600s of the CE. A
long history of ShaShThI worship can be established through much of
northern Indian: For example both bauddha and jaina sources mention
shrine of devI ShaShThI being present at vishAla at the time of two
nAstIka founders. The archaeological studies by NP Joshi ( Hindi essay:
devI ShaNmukhI yA ShaShThI), PK Agrawala (mathura nAgI=ShaShThI), VS
Agrawala (ShaShThI-devasenA on yaudheya coins) have recovered
considerable iconographic material of ShaShThi from kushAna and yaudheya
sites, especially the early shrines of the deity in mathura.

Today the worship of ShaShThI has faded away in most of India except in
the va\~Nga country (and amongst knowers of the archaic kaumAra path).
Interestingly, even in the late medieval period the worship of ShaShThI
remained vigorous in Bengal and surrounding areas (also probably Nepal)
as suggested by the Bengali poem ShaShThI ma\~Ngal composed in the
mid-1600s of CE. Of course the tradition of ShaShThI worship is rather
ancient. Attempts to trace it take one back to the late Vedic period,
where she appears just like her mate skanda. Interestingly, the
upAkhyAna of ShaShThI in the devI bhAgavataM mentions that her rite is
connected with the [kauthuma school of the
sAmaveda](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/01/vrata-of-our-dear-goddess.html).
The meaning of this allusion becomes clear when one searches for the
earliest surviving traces of ShaShThI worship.

We first encounter ShaShThI in rites associated with the kR^iShNa
yajurvedic tradition of the taittirIyaka-s. The AyuShya sUkta, which is
deployed among other purposes, for the first year rite of a child has
the formula:  
shriyaM lakShmIM-aupalAMbikAM gAM ShaShThIM cha yAM indrasenetyudAhuH
|  
tAM vidyAM brahmayoniGM sarUpAm ihAyuShe tarpayAmo ghR^itena ||

With this formula shrI-lakShmI, ambikA associated with the aniconic
stone and the heavenly cow (as in rudra’s wife; cf. the shUlagava
ritual), ShaShTI and indrasenA are invoked as the manifestations of the
knowledge of the brahma, and for the sake of long life are pacified with
offerings of ghee.

This old formula appears to have been a popular, as it was reused in at
least two later tantric upaniShad-s to identify shrI the shakti of
nR^isimha and vinAyakI the shakti of gaNapati with all the primary
goddess.

nR^isiMha pUrva tApanIya states:  
sa IM pAhi ya R^ijIShI tarutraH sa shriyaM lakShmIM-aupalAMbikAM gAM
ShaShThIM cha yAM indrasenetyudAhuH | tAM vidyAM brahmayoniM sarUpAm
ihAyuShe sharaNamahaM prapadye ||

varada-pUrva-tApanI 2.2 (a tantric upaniShad of the gANapatya school
describing the valagahan anuShTubh of gaNesha):  
sa IM pAhi ya R^ijIShI tarutraH sa shriyaM lakShmIM-aupalAM aMbikAM gAM
ShaShThIM cha yAM indrasenetyuta Ahus-tAM vidyAM brahmayoni-svarUpAM |
tAMihAyuShe sharaNaM prapadye ||

The medieval upaniShadic commentator nArAyaNa explains that this formula
equates the shakti of the primary deity of the tantric upaniShad with
shrI-lakShmI the shakti of nArAyaNa, aMbikA the shakti of rudra,
kAmadhenu, ShaShThI the shakti of skanda and indrasenA, who is indrANI.

This transfunctional equation of the goddesses also plays out in the
most definitive early source on the worship of ShaShThI from the
kR^iShNa yajurvedic tradition of the maitrAyaNIya-s. The mAnava gR^ihya
sUtra 2.13, termed the ShaShThI kalpa records a rite performed over 6
shulka ShaShThI-s in 6 months or in 3 months on both ShaShThI-s. The
rite involves a day of sexual abstinence and homa offering of a
sthAlIpAka to ShaShThI with a hymn termed the ShaShThI sUkta, followed
by individual Ajya oblations.

mAnava gR^ihya sUtra 2.13

The parallels between the ShaShThI sUktaM and the shrI-sUktaM from the
khila of the RV or the bodhAyana tradition of the taittirIyaka-s cannot
be missed. This transfunctional association between ShaShThI and
shrI-lakshmI is explicitly stated in the skandopAkhyAna of mArkaNDeya
from the mahAbhArata:  
evam skandasya mahiShIM devasenAM vidurbudhAH |  
ShaShThIM yAM brAhmaNAH prAhur lakShmIm AshAM sukhapradAm |  
sinIvAlIM kuhUM chaiva sadvR^ittim aparAjitAm || (Mbh 3.218.47 )

Here the queen of skanda devasenA or ShaShThI is explicitly identified
with lakShmI, as well as as the other lunar goddesses such as [sinIvAlI
and
kuhU.](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/10/ekanamsha-in-nastika-myth-making-and.html)
Thus, the link with lakShmI is not a mere innovation of the mAnava GS of
the maitrAyaNIya-s but appear to be a well-established facet of the
goddess ShaShThI in that period. Another point to note is the presence
of the name manasA in the ShaShThI sUktaM. This archaic element appears
to have remarkably survived in Bengal, where a goddess manasA is
commonly associated with ShaShThI, and corresponds to the cobra-headed
goddess associated with kumAra. This suggests that the devI bhAgavataM’s
upAkhyAna of ShaShThI is recording the presence of a rite similar to
that of the maitrAyaNIya-s of the kR^iShNa yajur veda amongst the
kauthuma-s. It would be of interest to see if any of the surviving
gR^ihya parishiShTha of the kauthuma-s records such a tradition.
