## CLXXV

*To Mrs. Alice (Shanti) Hansbrough*

THE VEDANTA SOCIETY,  
102 EAST 58TH STREET, NEW YORK, N.Y.  
\[*End of June 1900*\]

DEAR MRS. HANSBROUGH —

I have not written you a line since you left San Francisco. I am well
and things are going on well with me.

I am in New York once more, where they have got now a home for the
Society and their headquarters. I and the other Swamis also live there.

A San Francisco lady \[Miss Minnie C. Boock\] now here owns a plot of
land near Mt. Hamilton, 12 miles east of Lick observatory — 160 acres in
area. She is going to make us a present of it. It would be nice for a
summer gathering for us in California. If friends like to go there
*now*, I will send them the written authority. Will you write to Mrs.
Aspinall and Miss Bell etc., about it? I am rather desirous it should be
occupied this summer as soon as possible. There is only a log cabin on
the land; for the rest they must have tents.

I am sorry I can not spare a Swami yet.

With all love to you and Mrs. \[Carrie Mead\] Wyckoff and the baby of
the family.

Ever yours in the Truth,  
VIVEKANANDA

P.S. Tell Helen \[the youngest Mead sister\] — I thank her for her kind
invitation, but \[am\] so sorry \[I\] can not accept it now. After all,
you three sisters have become a part of my mind forever. What about the
club?

V.
