## CLXV

*To Sister Christine*

1719 TURK STREET,  
SAN FRANCISCO,  
\[*April 9, 1900*\]

Hello! What's the matter with you — gone to sleep? Have not had any news
of you for a long time.

I am getting better every day, and one of these days — say in a few
weeks — I am coming straight to say how-d'you-do. Well, I will be here
two weeks more, then to a place called Stockton — thence to the East. I
may stop a few days in Chicago. I may not.

Beginning of May, I come \[for\] sure to Detroit. I will, of course,
write to you. How is life going on with you — grinding, as usual? Any
improvements? Write a chatty letter if you feel like. I am dying to get
news.

Ever yours in the Truth,  
VIVEKANANDA.
