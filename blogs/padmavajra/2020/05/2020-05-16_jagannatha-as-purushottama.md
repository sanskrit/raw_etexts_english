This article is to be read in conjunction with the previous article on
how the wooden God was initially considered as
[narasiMha](https://padmavajra.net/2019/09/24/on-the-next-stage-of-evolution-of-the-deity-of-puri-jagannatha-as-narasimha/).

In quite a few Sanskrit works on the temple,we find the Lord of Puri
being referred to as *puruShottama.*One might ask,what is the origin
behind this name and why this particular name has been linked with
jagannAtha historically? I am summarizing GC Tripathi’s work here

#### Early sAtavata conception

The early sAtavata conception of this term is noted in the 15th chapter
of the Gita embedded in the Mahabharata,where kR^iShNa is identified as
puruShottama,as beyond the kShara and akShara puruSha,and having an
identity with them. Also the shloka that goes “…atō.smi lōkē vēdē ca
prathitaḥ puruṣōttamaḥ৷” is indicative of Krishna-Vishnu being
identified with the puruSha concept*even in vaidika terms*. In ritual
that is extant even today,the puruSha sukta is used for worshipping
viShNu in pUjAs that require 16 upAchAras(each of the mantras of the
sukta being used for a particular upAchAra). That the fact this ritual
is old is attested in the Bombay recension of the Skanda Purana.

### puruShottama as used in early literary records and epigraphy of the Jagannath temple

1.  anargharAghava of murAri(circa 900s CE):puruShottama is described as
    being on the salt ocean and drawing patterns on the breasts of
    kamalA with paste of musk and His yAtrA.
2.  prabodhachandrodaya of kR^iShNamishra(was written between 1060-70CE)
    where the kShetra of puruShottama is referred to
3.  puruShottama mAhAtmya of the skanda purANa(1300s CE)
4.  mahApuruShavidyA(1600s CE?)
5.  Maihar inscription at a sarasvatI temple(middle of the 10th century)
6.  Dasgoba Copper plate grant of Rajarajadeva,recording the
    construction of the new temple of Jagannath Chodagangadeva.



### puruShottama in tAntrika literature

Now that we have noted the earliest literary and epigraphical references
to that term puruShottama,we should now turn to the tAntrika literature
which has been influential in the usage of this term(and which has
influenced the ritualism of the shrImandira) to understand what did the
people in those eras mean when they said puruShottama(as already noticed
in the anargharAghava,the deity is already alluded to as having an
erotic component and is in play with lakShmI)

The aspects of puruShottama can be noted under the following headings in
the shAradAtIlaka according to Tripathi

1.  puruShottama-trailokyamohana
2.  shrIkara-puruShottama
3.  kAma-puruShottama
4.  kR^iShNa gopijanavallabha

In later works like kramadIpikA of keshavabhaTTa(which has been
influential on most of the existing pUjAvidhis of jagannAtha) and the
gautamIya-tantra(one of the most influential Agamika texts on the
worship of kR^iShNa) puruShottama is noted as
puruShottama-bhuvanamohana and puruShottama-trailokyamohana and invoked
in the former in a highly erotic form with the yonI of lakShmI getting
wet due to amorous excitement and the divine couple being surrounded by
thousands of damsels of devas,nAgas etc intoxicated and languid due to
the effect of love,and the gautamIyatantra’s description of the couple
has shrI embracing Him tightly seducing Him with amorous
gestures(sakAmalIlAya devam mohayantI). In these texts,it is
puruShottama *alone* who is referred to as*jagannAtha,*which
facilitated the name interchangeability. Whereas,in earlier texts like
the shAradAtIlaka,trialokyamohanA whose link with kAma is obvious in His
gAyatrI,and the dhyAna as elaborated by rAghavabhaTTa who notes that
lakShmI embraces(dakShiNena Ali\~Nganam) Him,and His eyes are enlarged
and languid,due to the effect of liquor:And worshipping Him grants the 4
puruShArthas of life;in the later two texts,kR^iShNa becomes prominent
and the puruShottama aspect becomes reduced to usages in special
rites,while the jagannAtha epithet of puruShottama acquired more and
more popularity amongst even literature in the vernacular and the
masses.

### The testimony of the skandapurANa’s puruShottama mAhAtmya

The puruShottama mAhAtmya refers to subhadrA as lakShmI at three
incidents(two of which are being cited here),and interestingly,when
referring to events cited as happening in the hoary past.

1.  The incident of puNDarIka and ambarISha;two mahApApIs who could
    visualize jagannAtha as being with lakShmI who is offering Him a
    betel-leaf(5th adhyaya). Later too SHe is described as shrI standing
    between viShNu and shesha
2.  The 19th adhyaya explicitly pleads for the identification of the
    female deity as shrI(lakShmI),and not any fraternal identity

### The testimony of the mahApuruShavidyA

This mahApuruShavidyA(also called puruShottama mAhAtmya) is a text
which,according to Tripathi has been composed by shAkta brAhmaNas of the
Sasana villages near Puri,who are also with a great affinity towards the
Jagannath cult sometime around the 1500s. In this text,the female deity
is almost invariably identified as lakShmI even under the mere name of
subhadrA

vAmA\~NgarUpiNIM lakShmIM tasya dakShiNapArShvagam\|  
apashyad divyayA dR^iShTyA subhadrArUpadhAriNIM\|\|

And She sports with Her lord like an ordinary human being in the cave of
the nIlAchala mountain(nIlAchalaguhAmadhye naralIlAvihAravAn…)

### The actual temple layout and aspects of ritual

1.  The garbhagR^iha has space for two(and only two) deities\[implying
    that yes,balabhadra was added later,this is a matter that will be
    dealt with in a future article\] representing puruShottama and
    lakShmI
2.  These two deities were represented by (kAma)-puruShottama and
    lakShmI
3.  In existing ritual at the shrImandira:the pIThashaktis of
    kAma-puruShottama reappear as the mates of bhUvaneshvarI(the current
    identity of the deity known as ‘subhadrA’). The artificial form of
    the names of these deities signify that these were originally meant
    for the worship of kAma-puruShottama and not bhuvaneshvarI
    initially,and were readapted into Her yantra here at a later date.
    Also when lakShmI is considered to be of golden complexion when She
    is in union with puruShottama in the shAradAtIlaka,the same bodily
    complexion of the deity identified as subhadrA today,the possibility
    of the female deity having being considered as the *sister* of
    viShNu is unlikely to have been the historical conception of the
    deity initially.
4.  The yantra for pUjA for jagannAtha Himself is a mixture of the
    yantras of trailokyamohana-puruShottama and shrIkR^iShNa
    gopijanavallabha in the sense that a sexagon is central,but an
    8-petalled lotus is involved,rather than the standard 10 petalled
    lotus for shrIkR^iShNa.
