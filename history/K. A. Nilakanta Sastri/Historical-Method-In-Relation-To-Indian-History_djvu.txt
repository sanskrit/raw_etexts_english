PREFACE 


This book is a revised and amplifed version of my Historical 
Method in Relation to Problems of South Indian History published in 
1941 by the University of Madras. The revision has been 
undertaken with a view to include a brief consideration of the 
whole ground of Indian History and to meet the requirements of 
the syllabus in the subject prescribed for the M.A. in Indology of 
the University of Mysore. The revision has been very largely the 
work of Sri H. S. Ramanna carried out in consultation with me; the 
brief chapter on Philosophy of History has been specially written 
by me for this edition. Though intended primarily for the students 
of Mysore, I venture to hope that the book may be of some use to 
others as well. 

My thanks are due to Sri S. Vis wana than. Proprietor, 
Central Art Press, for the readiness with which he undertook 
the publication and for the excellent production of the book in a 
short time.

CHAPTER 1 

GENERAL PRINCIPLES 


Before we consider the different types of historical evidence 
■hearing on the specific problems of Indian History, some space 
must be devoted to the study of a few general considerations. 
"Modern historical method in the sense in which we are concerned 
with it is altogether a creation of the last century and a half. In 
making this statement we do not mean to deny the existence of 
historians at an earlier time. It would be untrue to do it. In 
Tact, western historical writing may be traced back to the Greek 
genius. As Thomson says c The Greeks wrote history of all charac- 
ters and of all dimensions. The history of men or things, of great 
nations and small cities, universal annals and local chronicles, 
political, literary and military memoirs. There is nothing which 
they forgot or ignored* Yet to the end of Greek literature the 
prevailing purpose of Greek historians remained constant — to give 
information. The Greeks first learned the art of writing .real 
history, and perceived its purposes, its duties, its laws. The Greeks 
■were the originators of history as they were of science and philo- 
sophy. European historiography need go no further back. 5 * 

But the Greeks showed little interest in their past history, 
though they were deeply engaged in contemporary affairs. They 
had very little interest hr their origins. History was conceived 
•as; the : narration of memorable events. As the authors of the 
Introduction to the Study of History say : 4 To preserve the memory 
and propagate the knowledge of glorious deeds, or of events 
•which were of importance to a man,, a family, or a people; 
rsuch was the aim of history in the time of Thucydides and Livy A 
(p. 297) Herodotus, who is regarded, as. the Father of History* 
-chose the, .. Eejman . .wars . as* , hj$.. theme * Thucydides: selected the 
Peloponnesian war ; Polybius, the Punic wars. They were Prag- 
matic historians. They have , given expression to the dictttm that 
history is philosophy teaching by example. ; 

This belief in the Pragmatic value of history was not; peculiar 
to classical. historians. Instruction, whether moral or political, was 
considere^ thrpighpnt t]re;Middle Ages, and also in the Renaissance 
ns the main function of history. Even in Modern times, historians

have emphasised the instructional value of history. Lord* 
Acton declared that History was a great moral teacher. But by 
far the most illustrious historian to support this time-honoured 
function of history is Mr. G. M. Trevelyan : 4 The truth about 
the past, if taught and read with broad human sympathy can give 
a noble education to the mind of the student not only in politics 
but in all kinds of civic and social relationships, and even in the 
domain of personal, religious, and ethical ideals/ Ahd when 
dealing with the meaning of history he says, £ It is the tale of the 
thing done, even more than its causes and effects, which trains 
political judgement by widening the range of political sympathy,, 
and deepening the approval of conscience, that stimulates by 
example youth to aspire and age to endure, by the light of what 
men once have been, to see the things we are and dimly to describe 
the form of what we should be/* This Pragmatic character of' 
History necessitated the historians conceiving history as a branch . 
of literature. Historical truth was subordinated to style. Form 
was more important than matter. 

The nineteenth century has indeed been par excellence the- 
centuryTTf greafhistorical writing. Many large works of permanent 
value have been written by scholars of different nations and they 
cover various aspects of human history. Read a comprehensive 
book like Gooch : History and Historians in the Nineteenth Century • 
and you will see clearly that that century may well be called the 
Golden Age of historical thinking. Niebuhr and Von Ranke 
laboured hard to free themselves of the implication that History 
was an art, an edifying branch of literature, and as such could . 
not give results of scientific value. They insisted on attaching 
importance j to documentary evidence. They attempted to get 
historical knowledge by applying scientific criticism to the evidence * 
that is supplied by available documents Which have satisfactorily 
been found valid. Moreover, towards the middle of the nineteenth 
century, Geology, Archaeology, and other auxiliary sciences came- 
to the aid and altered the conception of human history. * With the - 
extension of the general scope of historical studies 5 says Prof. Cohen, . 

* there naturally came a widening of the conception of the proper 
subject matter of history. Instead of the old restriction to the- 
study of kings and dynasties, warriors and the like, there came- 
also a more human conception of the proper province of history, .

to include ordinary social functions, such as games, social manners,, 
everyday business transactions, all the things which constitute the 
substance of the daily life of men, women and children.’* 

Towards the latter half of 19th century, Edward Freeman 
gave a definition of history that is far too narrow. He said that: 

* History is past politics and politics are present history.’ Following; 
him, Seeley, another English historian of the same time declared 
that the interest of history lay in its application to contemporary 
politics. He proposed a school of statesmanship, * by giving due 
precedence in the teaching of history to the present over the past 
politics, he declared, were vulgar, when they were not liberalised 
by history, and history faded into mere literature when it lost 
sight of its relation to practical politics. ‘ It was a lofty ambition, 
but didactic history, however scientific in intention and stimulating, 
has its pit-falls. Moreover, his emphasis on the superior utility 
of the study of recent times ignores the truth that to-day is not only 
the child of yesterday but the heir of all the ages.’ (Gooch). 

The above definitions are one-sided and narrow. History 
is no longer a chronicle of kings and wars. It is at least as much 
interested in the life and doings of common men, and the scope 
of modem historical writing has broadened so as to include alL 
aspects of social life. Seeley himself, iij his Life of Stein, had to take 
into account sociological questions ; and of late a vast n um ber- 
of sciences and arts have come under the historical purview- 
Religion, philosophy, economic factors cannot be neglected. As; 
Prof. Kellet rightly says ‘Thus we have what may be calle d; 
almost without exaggeration, in mathematical language, an infinite 
divergent series of histories, ever increasing in magnitude and 
with an incalculable remainder. It is impossible to limi t such a 
series to one particular class. 

‘ With all this and much more to consider, it has- become 
increasingly plain that history is no longer an affair for a single 
man, even if, like Macaulay, he deals, in a thousand pages, with 
but a dozen years, or if like Orme, he gives two pages to the events 
of every twenty-four hours over a very short period of British 
Indian History. If is for speehdistS.,' and the lessons each specialist 
implicidy teaches will vary with the man and his theme. With 
politics, he will show himself political, with economics he will be 
a guide to econ omists, with religion he will instruct the religious,

with education he will be educational. 5 * To Lord Acton (1834* 
1902), the least voluminous, but the most brilliant of all the writers 
of the nineteenth century, History was, as already noted, the record 
ofman’s moral progress. Being a staunch Catholic and one who had 
indulged in the papal controversies, of the 19th century, he believed 
in the immanence of moral law. In his opening paragraphs of the 
inaugural address, he declares : c Politics and History are inter- 
woven but are not commensurate. Ours is a 'domain that reaches 
farther than affairs of state. It is our function to keep in view &n$ 
to command the movement of ideas, which are not the effect 
but the cause of public events. 5 The first of human concern was 
religion, the second liberty, and their fortunes were intertwined. 
Passing from the scope of history to the spirit which should govern 
its study he emphasised the sanctity of the moral code; f 1 exhort 
you never to, debase the moral currency, but to trymthers by the 
final maxim that governs your own lives, and to suffer no man and 
no cause to escape the undying penalty which history, has the 
power to inflict on wrong. 5 f In judging men and things 5 , he had 
written to Creighton, c ethics go before dogma, politics and national- 
ity. 5 The historian, in his view, was not only the interpreter of 
events and ideologies but the guardianofmorafity. ‘The inflexible 
integrity of the moral code, 5 he declared, ‘is, to me the secret of 
the authority, the dignity and the utility of history, 5 Facts were 
for him, he said, ‘ not a burden on the memory, but an illumina- 
tion of the soul- 5 With regard to his knowledge, Herbert Paul has 
said : ‘ To be in his company was like being in the best of historical 
libraries with the best of historical catalogues. 5 

Groce declares in History > Its Theory and Practice that all history 
is contemporary history in the sense that we can only think of the 
past with the mind of our own day. The notion of sequence, 
indispensable : for the practical purposes of life, fails to provide us 
with objective reality. To? Croce the average historian is a mere 
chronicler, for facts only become history when they have passed 
through the crucible of an individual mind-. ; No historian can 
forecast the future i since history never repeats itself, Croce rejects 
determinism as decisively as Toynbee, and salutes the cbnception 
of liberty as fervently as Acton himself. ■ ' v « ; u; 

Another, and perhaps stricter, T view of the role of History is 
possible and has often fbeen hzMii ! It is that History is jUsfc know*

ledge of the past c as it is really happened/ irrespective of its 
influence 6n the present or future. This was Ranke’s view. On 
this view it is the function of history not so much to illuminate the 
present or furnish lessons for its guidance* as to satisfy oiir natural 
curiosity about the thoughts and deeds of our ancestors. Only 
our interest in the past is the limiting factor in the choice and 
portrayal of data ; present needs should have no part in governing: 
their selection or interpretation. 

Whatever view we adopt, the fact will remain that each genera- 
tion ha$dts bwn outlook . on history and this will be governed willy- 
nilly by the pressure of current situations. Accordingly its selec- 
tion and interpretation of occurrences of the past will also differ,, 
and this* is the reason, why History is being re-written from one 
generation to another and each version differs in its colour and 
texture from those which preceded and from others likely to follow 
it. This raises a question of importance in the archival policy of 
modern states. While so far as the past is concerned we have to 
tyork with what evidence has survived, we have to exercise very 
great care with regard to the destruction of current records. But 
the records of modern governments are so voluminous that preserv- 
ation of all of them is practically impossible ; at the same time, 
as no one can foresee the shifts in the relative importance and 
value of documents for, future students, any one who destroys any 
but the most trivial records of public affairs and even of private 
occurrences; incurs the risk Of obliterating evidence of historical 
yalue, ,• ■ ...» 

v f Prof. Renier* in his illuminating little book, History , Its 
Purpose and Method (1950) emphasises the social role of history. 
It is admitted that authentic history is the story of civilised human 
Societies, as told by earnest students of the subject. Box every 
human being the memory of his individual experiences is a matter 
of primary importance i Without it he can take no important 
i ftor advance in the path of progress., :He cannot even 
survive without keeping such memory cons tahtly, fresh. It

HISTORICAL METHOD 


<6 

Herodotus and Thucydides, Livy and Polybius were the exceptions 
Tather than the rule in ancient and medieval times. In spite of 
their admitted merits these works are mixed up with much that 
is legendary and fabulous, and the so-called historians often invented 
speeches which they put into the mouth of historical characters 
and otherwise drew largely upon their imagination. For long 
ages history when it was not a dry chronicle maintained in monas- 
teries, courts and elsewhere, was looked upon as a branch of 
literature, and modern historians have had to exercise great care 
in their use of professed histories of Antiquity and the Middle Ages; 
The most notable exception to this common practice before the 
J9th century is in fact to be found in India in the regular succession 
of Arabic and Persian historians of the Islamic World, of whom 
quite a considerable number lived and did their work in India. 
And their example did not fail to appeal to some Hindu writers, 
most notably Kalhana of Kashmir who lays down several very 
correct principles of historiography and practises them to the extent 
to which the materials* at his disposal allowed him. The normal 
Hindu ; attitude to history,? however, Was different. It was not 
one of indifference bom of a disgust with life in time, but a desire 
to view human affairs against the 

^nd of divinity. There is a Greek tradition that an Indian sage 
who visited Socrates asked the Greek Philosopher what he was 
-engaged on ; the reply was that he was interesting himself in the 
^tudy of men and their ways ; the Indian thereupon asked him 
what he knew of the ways of the gods, and when Socrates confessed 
•Jiis ignorance on that subject, the Indian just smiled and said that 
men could not be understood without a correct knowledge of gods 
and supermen. Now that story may or may not be true ; but 
it gives a correct account ©f the Indian attitude to human, events, 
and goes far to* explaiU the scope and content of the numerous 
JPuranaSy Upa-puranas : and Sihala-pur arias— ail conceived as 'narrative 
«of universal evolution meant fbf the education and edification of 
■the populace. We of the twentieth century; A.D. have a natural 
\atxd insuperable difficulty in sharing or approving their view of 
the matter, but our ancestors were far from being indifferent to 
the progress of the world they inhabited. Only their accounts of 
■the world began with the creation, traversed the whole domain of 
■ Ae myth and" feble they cherished about ■ gods -and their avatar as 
-and the numerous classes of super-humans, and gave only a very

subordinate place to what we should call history. This tendency 
-to link up the human with the super-human is a constant trait 
-of the ancient Indian mode of thought. It accounts for the anxiety 
^f our royal dynasties to trace their descent from the sun and the 
jnoon, for the form of our two great national epics the Ramayana 
,and the Mahabharata which doubtless envelope a core of history 
: in many sheaths of imaginative embellishment, and for the fact 
-that even professedly historical works like Sana’s Harshacarita , 
TiJhana’s Vikramankadeva Charity and the Kalingattupparani of Jayan- 
gondar and the Muvar-ula of Ottakkuttan and the Pmyapuranam 
-of Sekkilar* to mention only a few well-known instances, often 
jmove on the ; border-land between fact and fable. On the other 
hand professedly mythological works like Pampa’s Bharata and 
Hanna’s Gadayuddha — both in Kannada — often contain the most 
•valuable references to contemporary historical events which 
.admirably supplement our gleanings on these matters from the 
•inscriptions. Despite their imperfection as history, these works, 
^particularly the epics and the hagiologies, have been potent factors 
;ia shaping the life of the people. Even so recent a writer as 
Jayaram Pinde, the court-poet of Shahji, in his Radha-Madhava 
Vilas a-Champu (1660) invents a conversation between the Lord of 
-the Universe and Brahma, the Creator, to proclaim the greatness 
of his hero. He writes 

Jagadisa Virinciku puchata haim 
kaho srsti raci, rakha kona kaham 
sasi vo ravi purava pascima lorn 
tuma soya raho sirasindhu maham 
aru uttara dacchina racehanako 
ita Sahaji haim, uta Sajaham. 

The sting of the conceit is in its tail ; the poet roundly affirms 
the parity of Shaji with Shahjahan. But no one was misled by 
ffie ^conventions of our ‘ literary histories 5 if we may so call them, 
#nd there is no lack of downright statements of facts in the 
•vofeiininops epigraphy and literatures of our country of which the 
close sffidy for ^historical purposesis still only in its initial stages. 

TrU'e.it k that. the ;sttongly t^dititmal character of our culture, 
of its literature and its arts had led to greater emphasis, on the 
achievement of tasks than on the persons or the epochs connected 
with it, and very often we are treated to details which we should 
gladly exchange for some others on which no light is forthcoming.

Valmiki and Vyasa are but shadowy names, and even Kalidasas 
is very largely so ; while we can see and admire the glory of the' 
Kailas at EUora or the superb excellence of the paintings at Ajanta 
and Bagh, we do not know anything of the names and lives of 
the painters, architects and sculptors who created these wonders. 
But this is true in some measure of all times and ages, and for a 
parallel we may go to the great cathedrals of Medieval Europe. 
Only a little study and reflection are required to show that people 
in India did not in any Way differ fundamentally in their attitude 
to life and its opportunities from other nations of the world.- 
Speaking generally, and subject to the one reservation that ha» 
just been: made, they were not perceptibly behind their contempora^ 
ries in other lands in the creation and enjoyment of the amenities 
of a complex civilisation, or even in their desire to be remembered 
by posterity for what they were and what they did. The hundreds 
of votive inscriptions recording the names, purposes and objects 
of the gifts, the many longer inscriptions recording the genealogies 
and achievement of long lines of rulers before coming to the actual 
business on hand* among which those of the Deccan and South* 
India take a very prominent place, the musical inscription of a royal 
disciple of Rudracharya at Kudumiyamatai, the numerous signed- 
sculptures on the walls of Hoysala temples in Mysore, the several 
temple chronicles some of which have survived after many have 
been destroyed, the prasastis at the beginning and the colophons 
at the end of most literary works giving authentic details of the* 
lives of the authors and their patrons, are enough to repudiate" 
the suggestion that to -the Indian his life was a 'nightmare, 5 an- 
experience not worth remembering or recording. 

The question is often asked whether history is a Science. The* 
authors of the Introduction to the Study of History are inclined ter 
dismiss the question as puerile. But there is no doubt that as Bury' 
once put it, 4 history is the oldest art, and the* youngest aspirant to- 
the claim of being a science.’ But Bury also said 4 History is a 
Science, no more nor less; 5 It has been suggested that history 
aspires to be a science because in the growth of mbclem knowledge' 
ftece the renaissance, Science got the start, and scientific methods’' 
greater perfection earlier than historical method, to 
ra^Ld;.• ^ • :T8 ! tht centuries the scientific method may be said -to

seemed- to be very reliable and to give most fruitful results of a 
definite character. History wanted to be like, the physical sciences- 
But since then there hah been a redress of the balance, and history 
has come into its own. Our concern, is more to point out that 
while -it is not very useful to seek to establish or repudiate the 
claim of history to be a science, it is much more necessary to see 
in what relation the method of science stands to historical method. 
Now, the essence of scientific method is to base conclusions upon- 
known visible facts. To the extent to which science does not da 
this, every, scientist should be inclined to say that it is not Science- 
Science bases conclusions - upon, tangible facts ; facts which can be 
seen, , tested, -and repeated, which can be e xperimented on. and, 
which can be personally test ed by every scientist e verywh ere. In 
othepworHslhe data of science are present an d universal. Every-- 
body can have access' trcTthem in the exact form in" Which it is 
reported by somebody. Once you think of that, you will at 
once realise that the ,, method of . history is, quite different. If 
persona}; knowledge of the facts on which your conclusions must 
be, based i s a condition of history, history will be impossible. No- 
historian, can live in the days of Mohenjodaro except metaphor- 
ically. ' Personal acquaintance with facts .cannot be the basis of 
any historical construction . It is at once' apparent that observation 
of the overwhelming ntajority of the essential facts of thfc life of 
man' is; beyond the capacity -qf any historian. There is little he

^question : Why did Brutus murder Caesar ? The questions are 
those of Prof. Collingwood, whose exposition is followed here. We 
see at once that in answering the second question we are faced 
•with a number of complexities which do not trouble us in answering 
the first. The trouble arises from the fact that history deals with 
human actions, motives and movements which are not always 
understood. Even the motives of present actions are not fully 
understood. When you seek to reconstruct past actions with the 
aid of stray records, the difficulty is increased a hundred-fold. 
‘The presence of human motivation at every s tage adds another 
dimension to the data of history, unknown to science and thereby 
increases the complexity of the 5 task of the historian. History is 
-intrinsically far more complex than the more objective realms 
.dealt with by science. In other words, the - facts 5 of history are 
highly subjective. It is a fact that Lincoln was a great man. But 
: is the conception of Lincoln’s greatness the same in the mind of 
-every person who believes him to have been great ? Was it ever 
the same ? Will it Over be the same ? Many historical facts, far 
from - being simple, have meaning only in relation to other facts, 
to other deeds, to other - thoughtsv and even to other emotions. 
“Many a historical fact is simple ih its statement, not in its relations! 
not in its significance. Thus the facts of history, as we have said, 
are highly subjective. ^History in other wdrds is true in the way 
in which a picture is true ; hot in the Way in which a physical law 
is true/ History gives you a certain knowledge of reality, but it is 
not a knowledge of universal application, like scientific knowledge.

has to have a mind which is free from pre-occupation , which is 
free from theories and is ready to take in all the bits of evidence^ 
r and appraise each such bit at its proper worth. The historian 
^teuld strive tlo be as scientific as possible in his Search for and

the testing of them should be done in the same spirit as that in

Il'ich the chemist and the botanist work. Thoroughness and 
.accuracy should be tjie aim of every scholar, no matter in what 
held he works. In this respect* and in no other, is the historian 
, a scientist. r 

History, then, is in part a science. It is also, and in a much 
^greater degree, an art. It consists not only in collecting facts 
..about the past, but in thinking and feeling about them. Adequate 
interpretation and portrayal are impossible without imagination, 
a sense of values and a gift of expression. We must have a proper 
* conception of the facts, of the conditions, of the motives, and of 
the characters.; We must acquire a proper understanding of them. 
‘The past cannot be constructed by men whose knowledge of life 
has been gained only from documents. Mere accumulation of 
Tacts is insufficient. Using our imagination and our judgement* 
-we have to interpret them. No, facts do not always speak for 
themselves. They . have to be weighed • and measured. They 
;mu$t be placed in their proper setting. There must be intelligent 
.reflection upon the significance of the facts. They must be seen 
:in their relations of time and place. There must be that insight 
into reality without which the past can have no vital meaning for 
"living men. More than this, in fact there is tio sharp distinction 
between facts and their meanings ; and social facts are not merely 
spatial-temporal.- ’ History is much mote an art than a science in 
the matter of portrayal. After a mental image of a period or an 
.event, has been formed* the story must be told. Brick-makers are 
necessary but even more necessary for an edifice of history is an 
architect. .The collection of material is the beginning and not 
the end of the historian’s task. He must have the deep feeling, to 
-which* the unaided and unimaginative reason rarely attains, that 
•our ancestors were once as really alive as we are now. And he 
-must have the literary power to make that apparent to others. 
When truth has been found, it must be transmitted. And that is 
in art. It is only perfection of style that enables a human voice 
-to speak unaltered across the centuries to a remote posterity. In 
this respect, History can be considered ati art, and a difficult art. 
.And as Cohen rightly points out, e this does not mean that the 
historian creates the events he reports. Having chosen a given 
perspective : ffiai * which he can truthfully report is obj ectively 
-determined. ' ■ The relativism of historiography is not identical

Now this leads us to say that to understand the past from- 
such data as we have of it is not so easy as it seems. The proper 
task of the historian is to interpret the past for the present. It 
has already been stated that the present has an influence in the* 
historian’s work. But if the historian seeks to interpret the past 
with the present instead of for the present, and if he seeks to carry' 
the present into the p&st and to discover the latest devices, social,, 
political, etc., in the earlier stages of human history, we can only 
say that he is engaging in a huge circular argument from which, 
no one can derive any profit. On the other hand, to emphasise 
the respects in which the past differed from the present and to 
account for the differences, and explain them in a manner intelligible* 
to us of 'the present, that is far more instructive and worthy bf the- 
historian than to hunt for. misleading similarities based upon 
distorted evidence. .• .4 

1 Errors of Hist oj^i,: There are many kinds of possible error.- 
The most common hr the interpretation of the past is what: 
'might be called the didactical error, the error of discovering in 
history the lessons which Wt wish fio inculcate. How often has not 
Luther been hailed as the founder of liberty and the secularisation 
of European life since the Reformation. That is the only basil 
for this common error. In reality Luther had much mere in 
common with his opponents than with us. Many instances of 
his life show that he was not less religious or less fervid in his hold- 
on religion or less intolerant than those whom he opposed.* 
If again we think of what had gone before Luther in the Age of the* 
Renaissance, of . Erasmus, of Machiavelli and other Renaissance- 
spirits, if may well become a question whether Luther on the- 
whole , did not go • back on the Renaissance ratte than give the- 
world a forward push towards secularisation and freedom. - - t „ • 
Now this hiad-of in a perspec-* 

tive from a particular; stand-point* becomes much greater in short 
abridgements of history than in, large treatises written on an- 
ampler scale with due attention to. proportion and detail. In 
mmute work, you see the complexity of the whole process, and 
: are not given to ; simplifying it. But in short accounts of 
World history, like -Wells’ History of the World, you cannot be too 
careful' to keep away, from such easy misleading simplifications - 
To say that Luther' was responsible for the freedom andl secularisa- 
tion of the modem world would be no more true thm to say that

iColumbus was responsible for the sky-scrapers of New York or for 
the Federal Reserve Bank. System. 

Another illustration may be found in a book of Laski. His 
Rise of European Liberalism seeks to interpret the history of Liberalism 
jn the light of recent occurrences. But it would be a nice point 
rfor argument how much of this reinterpretation is due to that 
jnatural process in which every generation has got to reinterpret 
the past from its own stand-point and how much the selection of 
.evidence has been guided by the bias of Laski in favour of commu- 
nism. In another work, more recent, Parliamentary Government in 
~ England, the same writer seeks to demonstrate that Parliamentary 
democracy was developed by the Capitalist class e as an instrument 
for the protection of private property and for maintaining the 
power of the middle and possessing classes over society. 5 He 
appears to forget that in an historical argument, what matters is 
the contemporary man's view of the course of events, not ours, 
and any one who reads Grenville or Guizot will perceive that 
Laski V view never occurred to any one in 19th century England 
nr France. 

The second type of error — and this is more common out 
here with us than in many other countries, is what may be de- 
scribed as the patriotic error, the error of discoveringnll great and 
good things in the past of one’s own country. And one of the 
most typical: forms this error' has taken in our land is the attempt 
to discover the latest political devices in the most: ancient literature 
and institutions of our land, i Innocent words have been made to 
yield meaninp which they could never bear. - We have been told 
that there were bicameral legislatures, there was Cabinet Govern- 
ment, there was separation between public exchequer and the 
private civil list of the king and so On. But the evidence on which 
these opinions are based will ndt bear a moment’s scrutiny. These 
opinions reflect, In fact, not the evidence of* the past, so much as 
ihe present aspirations of authors at la time when Parliamentary 
Democracy was more or, < leak universally' accepted as the^ proper 
political ideal.* t ,*-p h >■.,,* .qhku lo/i.v ‘ - .•* 

The third type of error has already been touched &i/f. it is

disputes and tq tell the tale almost exclusively from one particular

point of view. This is an old error ; and Polybius uttered ar» 
clear warning against it which is worth reproducing here. Com- 
menting on the work of two of Iris predecessors on the first Punic” 
War, he observes : ( Owing to his convictions and constant partiality 
Philinus will have it that the Carthaginians in every case acted 
wisely, well, and bravely, and the Romans otherwise, whilst 
Fabius takes the precisely opposite view. In other relations of* 
life we should hot perhaps exclude all such favouritism, for a 
good man should love his friends and his. country, he should share 
the hatreds and attachments of his friends ; but he who assumes 
the character of a historian must ignore everything of the sort,* 1 
and often, if their actions demand this, speak good of his enemies 
and honour them with the highest praises while criticizing and 
even reproaching roundly his closest friends, should the errors of* 
their conduct impose this duty on him. For just as a living 
creature which has lost its eyesight is wholly incapacitated, so 
if History is stripped of her truth all that is left is but an idle tale. 
We should therefore not shrink from accusing our friends or praising 
our enemies ; nor need we be shy of sometimes praising and soine~* 
times blaming the same people, since it is neither possible that 
men in the actual business of life should always be mistaken* We 
must therefore, disregard the actors in our narrative and apply 
to the actions such terms and such criticism as they deserve.’ If 
you take the history of Greece this can best be illustrated by reference 
to the three authors. Mitford was a strong Conservative with a 
profound admiration for Spartan institutions and a deep-rooted, 
hatred for Athens and Democracy. His history is written accord- 
ingly. Grote wrote a counterblast to Mitford, and one of the closest 
students of Greek history has described Grote’s great work as ‘ a 
long democratic pamphlet. 3 A third writer who is not so Well, 
known as he deserves to be, especially when his writing is compared - 
with those two other writers just mentioned, plays the real role- 
of a true historian. Thirlwall exhibits no bias one way or 
another. His scholarship had a wide range, and his judgement 
was equal to his scholarship. His work has stood the test of time 
as very few others written in his day have done. 

^ own country Jhe scope for partisan error is great. 

that from it is greater* I think it 

Will be enough simply to raise a warning that we should as far 
as possible seek to avoid reading present disputes into past history*.

Obvious instances of this tendency are found in many current 
popular estimates; of the role of the Brahmin in the past, or of the' 
‘ Aryan 5 in the Tamil land* 

British historians of India were labouring till recently under 
another difficulty of a similar i character, the exact nature and 
consequences of which cannot be better portrayed than in the 
following words of Messrs. Thompson and. Garrat (1935) “ Of 

general histories of British India, those written a century or more 
ago are, with hardly an exception, franker, fuller and more 
interesting than those of the last fifty years. In days when no one 
dreamed that anyone would ever be seditious enough to ask really 
fundamental questions, and when no one ever thought of any 
public but a British one, criticism was lively and well-informed, and 
judgement was passed without regard to political exigencies. Of 
late years, increasingly and no doubt naturally all Indian questions 
have tended to be approached from the stand-point of administra- ■ 
tion ; will this make for easier and quieter government ? The 
writer of to-day inevitably has a, world outside his own people, 
listening intently and as touchy as his own people, as swift to take • 
offence. c He that is not for us is against us.’ This knowledge 
of an over-hearing, even eavesdropping public, of being in paritibus 
injidelium , exercises a constant silent censorship, which has made • 
British-Indian History the worst patch in current scholarship.’ 5 ' 
Lastly, you have error of yet another kind, resting on a consti- - 
tutional incapacity to keep out of error. This has been boldly 
described by Langlois and Seignobos as c Fronde’s disease. ’ c There 
are young students, with no prior repugnance for the labours of' 
external criticism, who perhaps are even disposed to like them, 
who yet are, experience has shown it, totally incapable of perform-- 
ing them. There would be nothing perplexing in this if these- 
persons were intellectually feeble ; this incapacity would then be 
but toe manifestation of their general weakness ; nor ye t if they' 

■ through’ no technical apprenticeship. But we are 

concerned with men of education and intelligence, sometimes of 
exceptional ability, who do not labour under die above disadvan- 
tages. These are the people of whom we hear : c He works badly, 
he has the gtoitts ^of maccuracy Their catalogues, their editions, 
their regesta, . their 'monographs swarm with imperfections, and- 
never inspire confidence, try as they :may, they never attain, E 
do not say absolute accuracy, but any decent degree of accuracy,.

They are subject to c chronic inaccuracy, 5 a disease of which the 
JEnglish historian Froude is a typical and celebrated case. Froude 
•was a gifted writer, but destined never to advance any statement 
that was not disfigured by error ; • it has.; been said of him that he 
was constitutionally inaccurate. For example, he had visited the 
city of Adelaide in Australia ; c we saw, 5 says he, ‘ below us, in a 
basin with a river winding through it, a. city of 1 5 0,000 inhabitants 
none of whom has ever known pr will ever know one moments 
anxiety as to the recurring .regularity of liis three meals a day. 5 
Thus Froude, now for the facts ; Adelaide is built on an eminence* 
no river runs through; it when Froude visited it the population 
did not exceed 75,000 and it was suffering from a famine at the 
time. And more of the same; kind.. H . ... 

Fortunately we do not often come across many affected by 
this malady to. the extent this .extract would indicate. - But the 
percentage of liability to Froude’s disease irt different individuals 
may be a i matter deserving careful study and attention. These 
general observations may with advantage be closed with an account 
of the practice and theory followed by one of the most eminent 
historians of France, M. Fustel de Goulanges, given mostly in his 
own works. He says that he always* followed three rules, in his 
work ; to study directly and solely the texts in the most minute 
detail,, to believe only what they prove and finally to keep out 
resolutely from the history of the past modern ideas which a false 
method carries into it. He. explains the. implications of the three 
rules quite clearly in. the following manner. Even one who reads : 
document^ will serve no useful purpose if he does so with precon- 
ceived nbffions ; andthis is - die most common mistake of our time. I

rrather the text yields., is twisted, and comes to terms with the 
opinion preconceived by the spirit. 

Many think however that it is good and useful for the historian 
to have preferences, leading ideas, and superior conceptions. 
This, they say, gives his work more life and more charm ; it is the 
.salt which favours the insipidity of f$cts. To think thus is to 
mistake very much the nature of history. It is not an imaginative 
art ; it is also much of a science. It does not consist in narrating 
•with approbation or discoursing with profundity. It consists 
like science in facing facts, in analysing them, in putting them 
together and marking their connections. It may be, that a certain 
philosophy emerges from this scientific history ; but it should 
^emerge naturally, of itself, almost outside the mind of the historian. 
,By himself he has no other ambition than to see the facts and 
understand them exactly. It is not in. his imagination or in his 
logic that he seeks them ; he seeks and gets them by the minute 
.examination of texts, as the chemist finds his facts in experiments 
minutely conducted. His unique skill consists in drawing from 
the documents all that they contain and in not adding to this 
•what they do not contain. The best historian is he who holds 
himself closest to the texts, who interprets them with the utmost 
justice, who writes and even thinks only in accordance with them.

In this chapter, weipropose to examine the nature and signi- 
ficance of an important' branch of historical research, its method. 
It is the process employed in the search for and presentation of 
historical truth. It examines its conditions and the processes to 
indicate the character and . the limits of historical 5 ikhdwled|e'. It 
embodies within itself a body of rules which each researcher should, 
follow when he undertakes work on any problem of history. In 
other words* historical method deals with the complicated operations 
of criticism and construction, of analysis and synthesis. The 
critical investigation and appraisal of the various :? kind& of evidence 
for purposes of historical investigation is the main object bf the 
operations involved. ' ,:r ■’* 5 * * 1 : 

The importance of the study of this method was first recognised, 
in 19th century by German historians. Ranke and his pupils were 
the pioneers to apply these principles to historical research. But 
they never wrote any treatise on method. Bernheim, the doyen of 
writers on historical method, was the first German scholar to 
write a comprehensive treatise on the subject. It is the first detailed 
and scientific presentation of the processes of historical investigation 
and has been the guide of two generations of scholars and historians. 
But the book is in German and no translation in English is available. 
Further, Prof. Bernheim deals largely with the metaphysical 
problems which we consider devoid of interest. Secondly, though 
the teaching of the Lehrbuch is sound enough, it lacks vigour and 
freshness. And it is not intended for the general reader ; both the 
language in which it is written and the form in which it is composed 
reader it inaccessible to the great majority of Indian readers. 
Next to this German work, we have the celebrated book by name 
* Introduction to the study of History 5 by Langlois and Seignobos 
written in French and translated into English by G. C. Berry. It -

is the only complete and! authoritative treatise on historical method, 
available in English ^0 far. Recently, the Dutch scholar Renier 
has written a book by ; name History, its Method and Purpose 
and has fairly dealt* With the various problems of methodology 
' giving high priority to Philosophy of History. • ' ; 

■’ r l Historical method comprises four parts : Heuristics, Critibism,. 
Synthesis and Exposition. * These four parts exactly correspond to 
the main duties of. the historian. Heuristics deals' with the art of 
search for and the. collection of Various kinds of documents. The 
historian or the researcher should know the exact places or localities 
where these documents are lying. The second function of the 
historian is the critical interpretation or examination of the same 
documents,. known as c criticism. 9 Theithird duty is to group the* 
historical facts and to ascertain, - their causal genesis. * This » is 
technically known s as - synthesis. 9 ' The last and the crowning 
part of methodology M the* narration or. the presentation 'of the 
historical facts.i This process* is Imown as ‘ exposition. 9 *•’ 

Heuristics, the hmt r part 3 is the aft of searching for and 1 the 
cblleetidn i of various documents which form the main sources of 
history; ;It is concerned mainly with the collection and -the 
conservation of the various source materials or the^dociunents of

Iogues 5 Calendars and Bibliographies prepared by the archivists ; 
and further, as far as possible, unpublished manuscripts should 
also ,be consulted. Thus Heuristics which is derived from the 
German word c Heuristik 5 mainly concernsdtself with the searching 
-of the various documents available in various public and private 
archives and libraries for the purpose of historical research. This 
forms the first and the foremost part of the historian’s craft with- 
out which he canhot proceed with further work and investigation. . 

Criticism r 

’ The collection of documents in various libraries, museum^ 
archives and other places^ is not the chief end and aim of the 
historian’s task. He must find, out whether these documents are 
good or Bad and whether they are credible as evidence., This part 
of historian’s work constitutes Criticism^ . t 

Thus the main object of criticism is to- test the datalfurnished 
by his predecessors and to determine whether the fragments of 
information received are themselves true or what measure of 
probability should be ascribed tb them. These are the main duties 
of historical criticism . But criticism ‘is not the end and aim of 
historical research^ - Itcan prove no fact. It only yields probabili- 
ties. • Its wo.rk is purely negative. t It merely decomposes documents 
into statements* each labelled with an estimate of its value— 
Worthless statement or statement of unknown value or of true fact. 
The. proper coordination and grouping of facts, the perception of 
the relations: of events and the final narration of these facts are 
some pf the objects, of Historical Methodology. But yet these are 
of no value or significance unless based on proper scientific

out anachronisms, interpolations and additions. For example, our 
ancient books like MahaSkarata , Ramayana and the Puranas passed 
on from generation to generation with so many interpolations and. 
additions..* These can generally be detected by means of external 
criticism!* of documents. But the testing of certain portions of 
historical material requires the aid’ of several highly ^specialised, 
branches , of learning* , They are technically known as The 
Auxiliary Sciences of' History . They - are paleography, .diplomatics,, 
politics, economics, archaeology including geblogy and chronology.. 
A proper understanding of these various allied subjects is necessary* 
to r determine the authenticity of documents and relics. They* 
play an indispensable part in every stage' of historical work from.' 
heuristics * to narrative. These sciences auxiliary to history enable 
the . historian to clarify .and establish the true nature of c historical 
documents 3 in the widest sen&e of the term. ; Among these various

of data, some of which are certain, many only probable. It is 
now the business, of the historian to organise these data into a 
.complex, < unique,* evolving whole, the parts of which stand, in causal 
relation; to one another 5 (Fling). Synthesis mainly determines how 
to set bounds to our subject ; to divide it into various periods 
.and sub-periods and finally to decide what facts are to Gome into 
the synthesis and in what sequence and what are to be rejected. 
^Finally synthesis, deals with the relation of causal connection 
which exists between the parts. Further it. examines what parts 
of our narrative should be emphasized and what parts should be 
touched lightly in bur narration. History is such a wide subject 
that it knows no beginning and no end. Each act or historical 
-episode is the effect of some previous episode and probably leads 
on to another. Thus it offers or affords opportunity and scope to 
limit the subject matter and fix the dividing periods as* far as 
possible. Thus this limitation of subject matter is absolutely 
indispensable for 1 hny researcher to carry oil his work successfully. 
Fling rightly says that The historian must drive a stake m the 
glacier of time U mark the beginning of his task and one to mark its end 
But the limitation of the subject matter is ah automatic process 
and largely depends on our conception of what constitutes the 
unity of our subject. If we are dealing with the c Age of the 
■Cholas 5 in Indian History, the question arises when did the Cholas 
come into prominence and -when was their end ? Thus after we 
finish the interpretation and -criticism of documents, we must 
►group them in i w scientific manner. We must ascertain Which 
facts should form part of an historical synthesis and secondly, We 
must know hoW to combine these facts so that they* form a complex 
whole. There are so many ways of arranging these facts : ; - They 
-can be arranged either chronologically or ' fopically . Vin'cehit 
‘Smith’s Akbar is based mainly on the chronological basis* The 
-first 'volume of the Cambridge History of India is based on 1 Various 
topics;. But each method suffers from some drawbacks. They 
neglect one aspect or the other of History. The b^st syst&n Of 
-grouping the facts is to combine both the chronological arrangement 
as well as . tfie topical system. Thus in its final form, when we 
divide and group the main facts on -the basis of their external 
factors or Of their mtrinste as a 

detailed, well-organised outline* showing the results of the invests 
gation as a unique complex whole. This only forms the skeleton*

to be clothed with flesh and blood by means of vivid narrative. 

Narration or exposition is the crowning part of the historian’s- 
work. The main principle that the historian should be guided by 
at the time of narration is to be objective as far as possible. He 
must weigh in the balance the strong and the weak points of his- 
facts. Bias should be eliminated as for as possible. He must 
imbibe the spirit, of these times that he is writing on. Impartiality 
should be his guiding principle. Besides being impartial, he should 
possess the command of the language in which he is writing. A 
forceful style is a necessary factor in writing. But historical 
narrative should not be the servant of style. On the other hand, 
'style should be subordinated to historical narrative. And moralis- 
ing must be kept in the background, if it Could not be dispensed- 
with. The ancient Greek and Roman historiographers like 
Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy and Polybius; seldom aimed at the 
accuracy of their evidences but were concerned with the glorifica- 
tion of their themes in colourful language. They conceived of 
History' as the narration of memorable events. They always 
chose important incidents and heroes of battles. In other words,- 
they thought of History as a branch of didactic literature. This 
state of affairs continued till 18th century. Great historians like- 
Gibbon, Humey Robertson and Voltaire gave predominance to 
style and thus made history the handmaid of literature. 

But as a result of the Industrial revolution and of the scientific 
discoveries of the 19th century, there arose a new era in Historio- 
graphy.-! Gooch rightly,, observes that 19th century has been 
essentially regarded as The Golden Age of Historical Thinking . The - 
German historians like Ranke and, others introduced a new weapon- 
into the realm of historical scholarship. They applied the main 
principles of historical methodology like Heuristics and Criticism, 
of sources . 7 They , ransacked the Various I archives and libraries.* 
Bibliographies were formed and insistence was laid on the credibility 
and accuracy of historical facts. They subordinated style to- 
accuracy. They insisted that the. narrative should reflect the- 
character of the evidence. Each statement, they insisted, should- 
demand the re-call of all the evidence on which it rests .and its* 
character. Source materials should be incorporated into historical 1 
narrative^ Fppt-notes should accompany or support each statement' 
of ; the narrative. But this * may bef overdone as Coulanges has* 
pointed out with mordant sarcasm : In the preface to the third 


NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HISTORICAL METHOD 25 

edition of his Histoire des Institutions Politiques — cited in the 4th 
edition (1914) he says : 

£ I must explain the difference which is apparent between this : 
edition and its predecessors. This is more extensive and for this* 
I have two reasons : the first is that in reading my* work again, it 
struck me that some things were not sufficiently clear; I have had 
to express myself at greater length to be clearer. I have a second 
reason which takes me some trouble to explain. I belong to a 
generation, no longer young and in which workers imposed two 
rules on themselves ; to study a subject from all known sources 
and then to present only the results of their researches to the 
reader ; they spared themselves the display of erudition, the' 
erudition being only for the author and not the reader ; some 
indications at the foot of the pages sufficed for the reader whom 
they invited to verify. For about 20 years the usual methods have 
changed. The practice to-day is to present to the reader a display 
of erudition rather than results. They value the scaffolding more 
than the construction, and erudition has changed its forms and 
processes ; it is no longer profound and there is no exactitude 
to-day ; but erudition nevertheless seeks a display. Before all they 
must all appear learned. Many value the appearance more than- 
the reality. Once we deliberately sacrificed appearance; now it is- 
some times the reality that is sacrificed. At bottom both the 
methods are equally good, if loyally practised. The one ruled- 
about 25 years ago when I wrote many first works, the other prevails 
at the .present day. I conform to the taste of to-day, like the old 
who do not have the bad taste to persist in their past habits. My 
researches will Change, then, not fundamentally, but in their form. 
Or better, I admit, they change only in appearance, and this is why 
when I wrote first, the early redaction was precisely like the present 
one, long bristling with texts; and full of discussion. But this first 
draft I kept back, for myself, and ! took six months to abridge it 
for the reader. .To-day,* it is the first draft that I shall give here/ 

Thus exposition is the crowning part of the historian’s work- 
It : constitutes ihe characteristic and salient feature of ideal history 
books and historians . It demands accuracy and impartiality from 
the research workers and investigators . It insists on the subordina-* 
tkon of stylerapirlanguage to precision and fidelity. 

Thus ; a sfoientific method is an important aspect of historical 
investigation and research which must be followed by one and all. 


CHAPTER 3 

PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 

I The word c History 5 can be used in two senses : (1) the sum 
{-.total of man’s past doings and experiences, and (2) the narrative 
account of such actions by a modern historian. Likewise ‘Philosophy 
•of History ’ may also be thought of in two ways. It may be taken 
to concern itself with the actual events as they occurred and try 
to discover their meaning and purpose* and this is the sense accepted 
generally by writers on the subject in the nineteenth century. 

"The second meaning of, ‘history 9 points td an enquiry into the 
nature of a historian’s thought and the character of the method 
followed by him ; the critical discipline that is contemplated by 
this second meaning has engaged our attention in the bulk of the 
preceding chapters, It is necessary, before concluding our study, 
to say something qxi the more speculative, and occasionally even 
metaphysical sense of . the term Philosophy of History. 

The attempt to discover a plan, or pattern of historical events 
is, perhaps as old as history itself i (in both its, senses). For long 
. ages* in fact till well on in the nineteenth century^ historical narration 
was a branch of literature and often had la religious and theological 
association ; and the historians of those days, such as they were, ; 

•often sought to justify the ways 6f God and men, or at least to

witnessed. : These attempts were based on a belief in the progressive

HISTORICAL METHOD 


Hegel - is perhaps the foremost of modern thinkers in this* 
sphere and his c philosophy of history must be ranked among' 
those which have best borne out the claim to be a Theodicy, a 
vindication of the ways of God to man, which have done most to* 
show that the history of the world is the product of an infinite and- 
active reason 5 (Flint). He had remarkable "forerunners in Kant r 
Schelling, Herder and Fichte. It is difficult and perhaps invidious 
to seek to summarise briefly the complex systems of thought put 
forward by so many forceful thinkers* . but there is no other way 
of dealing with so large a subject within the scope of a book like 
this. To Kant {Idea of a universal History from a cosmopolitan point 
of view, 1784) , history becomes Tolerable despite first appearances 
because ho sees in it a rational process' proceeding on an intelligible 
plan through hidden tracks to 'a morally desirable goal viz • & 
world order or state with a political constitution perfect both from- 
the internal and external points of view, a society which * combines- 
' with the greatest possible freedom, and in consequence antagonism 
of its members, the Hgid; determination and guarantee of the* 

limits of this freedom, in sUqh a way that the freedom of each 
individual may co-exist with that of others ^alibefal.society with 
full play for private’ enterprise.* : In* the historical process the 
fortunes of individuals may suffer, but those of the race are secure ' 
in the long run. This view of [history is obviousty fl ^riorz and - 
external, and not one that arises - out of the study of historical . 
events and research into historical facts and evidence bearing on 
them ; it is just a way of looking at ascertained history with which 
one may or may not agree according to one’s own experience and 
understanding of selected facts. ; » 

Herder (A. 1744): who. was twenty years younger than Kant 
published his Ideas for a Philosophical History of Mankind in the same • 
year as Kant’s celebrated essay [ mentioned above, in fact a few 
months earlier. His intuitive and emotiohal approach to History 
is a complete contrast to Kant’s cool and critical temper. Herder 
lays stress On the role of geographical and’ climatic factors in 
human ^evolution, and 'day s' stress on the peculiarities of races ; 
his great-work was in fact the model for Hegel’s treatment of * 
History*^ Herder recognizes the working of natural 1 laws in the 
unfoldment of history iand holds that the flowering bf a civilM&tion 
tthtycrf&a- tti&e § >he has no use; for any appeal to 
miracle or mystery in understanding the historical process. The* 


PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 


29 


•purpose ot that process is, according to Herder, the attainment of 
humanity, a state in which man fulfils himself by reaching the 
highest stature he is capable of. He implies that man can promote 
this end by his , own endeavour, but does not explain how this 
►can be reconciled with his idea of the working of natural laws in 
history. 

IJegel’s Lectures on the Philosophy of History, were published 
posthumously in 1837, more than fifty years after Herder’s Ideas • 
Hegel’s view of History is bound up with the whole of his Philosophi- 
cal System, and it is not easy to convey an adequate idea of it in a 
few sentences. Concepts of pure reason, logical concepts, form, 
according to him, a self-generating series — thesis, antithesis and 
synthesis, the synthesis becoming in turn a thesis and generating 
a new series, and so on. The highest form of this, the supertriad, 
is furnished by the antithesis between Ideas and Nature finding 
the synthesis in Spirit. To Hegel the real is the rational, and on 
his view the philosophical historian seeks to illuminate history by 
‘elevating empirical Contents to the rank of necessary truth.’ 
‘The clue to World History is furnished by the Idea of Freedom : ' 
c Freedom is the sole truth of spirit. 5 In the Oriental World 
(China, Babylonia, Egypt) freedom was for only one man — the 
•monarch ; in the Greco-Roman World, in spite of slavery, the area 
•of freedom was more extended, the citizens if not all individuals 
claiming it as a rights Among the Germanic nations of modem 
Europe, the process has been completed and the Christian principle 
Pf the worth p£ the individual is accepted as the basis of social 
and politicallife. This progress has been achieved by the dialectic 
process, in which each nation or people serves as a unit with its 
own contribution to make, c its religion, its' political institutions, its 
moral code, its system of law, its mores, even its science and art* 
and the level of mechanical aptitude it attains. 5 Each nation has 
its own hour,: and when that hour strikes, other nations give Way 
to it. Another feature of Hegel’s philosophy of History is his 
doctrine of moving forces in historical change, which allows for the 
play of human passions in the realization of Reason’s great design. 
The aims, and methods of the chosen instruments of destiny like 
Caesar or Alexander are not to be judged by ordinary moral 
standards, for tb mighty a form must trample down many an 
innocent flower^ dcush to pieces many objects in its path.’ The 
apparent good of the individual caribe no criterion in this * social

ethics ? in the light of which Hegel’s concept of freedom must be 
understood. Hegel repudiated natural rights, and held that the 
freedom of the community :as a whole was the goal of history 
but the community was not separate from the individuals compris- ■ 
ing it aiid realized itself in them. 

The influence of Hegel’s thought on modern historiography 
is large and. undoubted. His stress on the importance of the past 
.for the understanding of the present was not known 1 so much in 
the eighteenth century,* and came to mark all historical writing 
after i his time. It made history a purposeful and critical study, 
different from the chronicle, . and the immense development of 
historical thought ih the nineteenth century was in no small measure 
due to* Hegel’s influence, * Nevertheless Hegel’s approach to 
History jis open to* criticism from many . ’sides. The whole attempt 
has struck many, historians ns an effort * to impose a preconceived 
pattern on the course of events/ to assiime the course of history 
before the facts arelknown, c to deduce the details of history from 
'the categories of. logidih. Again the moral element in the explan- 
ation which aims at leaving one morally satisfied, or at least not 
morally dissatisfied/ is 4ot of any interest to the historian as such. 
Further, the Hegelian interpretatiom/bf histoty is able to maintain 
itself Only by arbitrarily elimin^f ing from history all except one 
nation at a time. ? It has been said klso. that, Hegel c thought history 
a: rational process because it culminated in the Prussian state in 
whose service he himself worked/ But this cheap jibe, cannot 
apply fto -Hegel who. was by no means a narrow provincial. A 
more serious criticism takes another line ; since history is still an 
uncompleted process how can you say that its culmination is in 
the present, or indeed determine its goal at all 3 / c America/ says 
Hegel somewhere in his lectures, / ’is the land of the future, where, 
in the ages that lie before us/ the burden of the worlds history 
will reveal itself/ blithe dbes not explain how this is to be fitted 
into his scheme. > % I'v-*' ' d * • ’ * . • *! 1 •' - 

Some reference has . been made already to the French writer 
Auguste Comte and* his follower^ — thei Positivists. With great 
trust in the universal competence of Science, they tried to apply 
the methods; of thd positive sciences to social, data ahd evolve A 
new science ofjsoeial; dynamics; ;« Gomte believed he had made an 
tepbrtaht discovery which he formulated-, into his law of the three 
stages of bhmfe* progress ;r< Theological ^ in which man accounted-

for events by ascribing them to the operation of a controlling" 
spirit or spirits ; ‘ Metaphysical 5 in which abstract natural forces 
replace the spirit or spirits as motive forces behind events ; and 
‘Positive 5 or ‘ Scientific 3 in which these fictions are abandoned 
and phenomena are recorded and accounted for as they occur. 
He applied this law to the history of Europe: Greece, Rome and 
the Middle Ages fall into the first stage ; with the Renaissance, - 
begins the second stage — a period of criticism and the breakdown 
of the old order culminating in the French Revolution ; after which 
we came to the c Positivist era, only partially accomplished, which 
is to revive many of the features of medieval Christendom, with 
the important differences that it will rest on Science > and not on 
superstition, and that its pontiff will be not the Pope but Auguste 
Comte. 5 In Comte's system, as in Hegel's philosophy, the course 
of history is determined by considerations not relevant to it, and • 
facts are forced into a preconceived framework constructed to suit 
the personal prejudices of its founder; But Positivists were respon- 
sible for some brilliant historical writing, witness Frederick 
Harrison's 'Meming of History and other works. The main thesis 
of the positivist school in history is untenable, but it indirectly 
promoted -critical methods of study, though its programme of 
deriving so-called laws had no attraction for historians. And- 
both the metaphysical and positivist movements failed signally to 
recognize that History is an autonomous discipline With aims and 
methods of*its own, .certainly standing in close : relation to- other 
social sciences,: but incapable of being resolved into any of them. 

Comte is now almost forgotten but Mats is a live force. 
Bom in* 1818, when Hegel was at the height of his powers, Karl 
Marx entered the university of Berlin in 1836 when the Hegelian 
Philosophy was still under active discussion. Marx’s * thought - 
cannot be understood except in the light of Hegelian influence Oh . 
’it. In fact Marx keeps -Hegel's dialectic, but reverses his funda- 
mental position and says that Matter precedes Spirit. Hegd, as 
We noted] postulated a national spirit as the medium through 
which economic, political and cultural aspects of a nhtlou's life 
interacted ; .Marx enthroned the economic aspect as of supreme 
import; and sought to explain the rest with it— the Celebrated 
Economic Interpretation of History set forth -in' the Communist 
Manifesto of 1848 . • And Marx’s goal was a classless- society^, 
the economic class taking the place, in his system of thinking that- 



32 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


is held by the nation in Hegel’s. There is doubtless an element 
of truth in Marx’s contention ; but it is far from being a complete 
account of the social process. Marx despised both the Positivists 
and the Utilitarians, but nevertheless had many affinities to them. 

He aimed at a positive scientific foundation for history as much as 
Comte, and practical reform was his aim quite as much as of 
Bentham. Marx is best understood as having laid emphasis on 
the economic background of events as their best elucidation, and 
this is perhaps more true of the epoch of capitalism than of the 
preceding ages* In any case, Marx’s contribution to the philo- 
sophy of history was not much, though his influence on Communist 
thought and revolution can hardly be overestimated. 

Two recent attempts at interpretation have aroused consider- 
able discussion all over the world. Spengler’s Decline of the West : 
an Outline of a Morphology of History treats history as a series of 
completed cycles, not a succession of stages in a continuous develop- 
ment. Each civilisation passes from childhood to old age and 
death, and there is a succession of such civilisations. Gooch 
.admirably sums up and criticises Spengler in the following terms : 
Western Civilisation is the latest of these recurring cycles, which 
advance and recede like the tide on a .shelving beach. . For the 
familiar chronological sequence ancient, mediaeval, modern — 
which is only applicable to Europe, Western Asia and North-East 
Africa, he substitutes foui^ cycles, Indian, Arabian, Antique and 
Western, the latter beginning about A. D. 900. Each is - subdivided 
into Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter. The civilisation of the 
West, now entering its winter months and replacing spiritual 
activities by practical aims, has only about a couple of centuries Ai 
to rum , Spengler discovers ho endwing progress, no guiding spirit, 
no ultimate goal, merely an endless repetition of approximately i 
similar experience.’ To Indian students this recalls the old Hindu 
theory of Tugas and Mahayugas punctuated with pralayas of varying 
intensity and duration. i ; . . . , ■ , • 1} \ 

/ Much superior . to Spengler’s sombre tomes is Arnold Toynbee’s 
Study of History, recently completed in 10 Vols. hailed by Gooch as : , $ 

‘ perhaps the most significant achievement of English, scholarship y 
Since Frazer’s Golden Bough d Toynbee^ like Spengler, envisages 
history as a record of civilisations rather than of centuries and <;:i 
continents. But in every other respett the two writers are poles': -M, 
apart. Spengler is a quasi-biological determinist who holds that 


PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 


33 


all civilisations are fated to die, and that the future will be as the 
•past. Toynbee, on the other hand, holds that modern man, 
unlike his ancestors, has an accumulated store of memories and 
knowledge which open to him a fair chance of averting the doom. 
Toynbee also differs from Marx ; he rejects the simplified view of 
history as a struggle for economic control and lays stress on the 
significance of spiritual factors. His outlook is more biological 
’than mechanical. 

In one sense Toynbee’s concern with universal history is a 
deliberate break off from the professional standards of historians 
.developed towards the end of the nineteenth century which tended 
increasingly towards minute specialisation and the monograph. 
'He insists on longer views and perspectives. His aim is not a 
■modem version of the older philosophies of history reviewed earlier 
in this chapter, but a comparative study of civilisations, of which 
he enumerates twenty-one, with a view to establish the typical life 
.cycle of a civilisation. His study proceeds on empirical lines, the 
.documentation is detailed, and there is little selection of facts to 
suit a theory or preconceived framework. He finds the key to 
’the geneses of civilisations in the group’s response to the challenge 
set by its physical or human environment. But the number of 
instances studied is small and by no means homogeneous. 

One reflection that arises in relation to Toynbee’s approach 
to history is that it finds no room for the role of c Great Men, 9 
for c the capricious and apparently unaccountable appearance of 
men of genius ’ and its result on the course of events. In fact, as 
Tisher points out, 4 what no one has yet succeeded in doing is to 
account for his emergence at all.’ We may perhaps note also some 
other observations of the same critic, who pays a high tribute to 
the learning and breadth of outlook marking Toynbee’s work. 
* c The generalisations' are sometimes overdriven,’ and Toynbee has 
not altogether escaped the dangers of ‘pattern history * ; for Toynbee 
sees in the past not only pattern, but rhythm. 4 Our enthusiastic 
guide is enchanted by the notion of rhythmical alterations of 
stability and movement, repose and turbulence, divine peace and 
diabolic unrest, which the Chinese designate under the names of 
■Yin and Yang. In the great operatic performance of humanity 
he detects the recurrence of this leitmotiv of Yin and Yang. Other 
ears will be less sensitive to the regularity of the Chinese beat.’ 
lastly Toynbee’s work is more akin to a branch of Sociology than 
3

to history ; in fact he has not transformed history, but brought: 
into existence a new study which can hardly be included under 
the same caption as history as we have known it so far. 


CHAPTER 4 

THE SOURCES OF HISTORY IN RELATION TO 
INDIAN HISTORY 

, History as a subject of study is more or less completely at tkm 
mercy of its sources. History deals with the past of a people or a. 
country on the basis only of the traces or records it leaves behind’,/ 
and the discovery of such traces and records of a past that is dead ! 
and buried is itself an independent and arduous job which must 
be completed before History can begin. 

Thus History has to work under hard conditions and often 
with tough and intractable material. It does not deal with the, 
present or the future, but only with accomplished facts and dead 
realities, with what has been,, and not with what is or what ought 
to be, and thus lacks the living interest of current events or the 
romance of reforms and ideas. „ 

Then again History may not treat the records as it may choose 
but must treat them as it finds them. It must allow the records- 
to tell their own tale,, must let the evidence speak for itself. It 
cannot twist or tamper with or manufacture the evidence. It must 
remain observant and receptive of all reflections and reproduce 
the sources faithfully like a mirror or a photograph without trying 
to modernise the past* and without suppressing or omitting evidence; 
that tells against a pet theory or rooted prejudice. 

It is also a job to recover the records of the past. The historian, 
has to find them, very often by hard and sustained labour in. 
muniment rooms or by weft planned schemes of archaeological 
exploration followed by prolonged excavation bringing 
buried antiquities of by-gone ages. His next task is nolens. hard*. 
It is, when the records are recovered* to find out the truth* especially 
when they are conflicting, He must then*, like .the Judge, sift the? 
evidence, interrogate the facts and; find his. way to truth through a 
maze of’ contradictions ^ud sometimes studied distortions. ^Jfkdefd,,

historical method 


Without a critical study of these materials no part of the historical 
past can be reconstructed. 

The materials of history fall -into two groups : Remains and 
Records . Remains tire of two kinds, of which the first is bodily or 
skeletal remains. The archives of the earth offer us their testimony* 
The graves give up their dead. Such personal remains, together 
•with the places in which they are found,* and the things made by 
man that accompany them, tell us of the great antiquity Of man. 
‘They tell us that he lived on the planet many thousands of years 
before any of the civilizations came up of which we have written 
records. The second group of remains are the things man has 
made, things of war and things of peace, things of utility and of 
decoration. Archaeology, the science of antiquity, is the special 
study devoted to these things ; with their aid we lea m of the life 
and culture of distant lands and times . Frequently they; especially 
the earliest among them, are superior in authenticity to many 
written records. The knowledge we derive from things left by an 
old civilization is sometimes more explicit and certain than a 
written statement. Their meaning and significance have to be 
won from them by intelligent and trained insight. 

Another kind of materials is records. Records are those 
materials of history written or printed that have been made delibe- 
rately for the purpose of transmitting information. They are, 
generally, of much later date, than many remains. These records? 
are generally known as literary sources of history. These literary 
sources include religious works, * chronicles, ballads, historical 
dramas and epics. 

The above sources are of two fundamental kinds, primary and 
Secondary. A primary or original record is one that testifies of its 
own knowledge, or which at least for us is a fountain source of 
information^ The worth of a primary Source is measured by its 
opportunities for knowing the truth and by its power and will to 
tell the truth. The best original sources* are, in general, con- 
temporary with the events to which they relate or nearly so. To 
take one single instance, the inscriptions- of Asoka are the primary 
■sources for the Tfudy of the reign: of Asoka* They were issue# 
directly under his orders. The true way -to' know The men whose 
lives are the history of their age is to come as close to them as 
the barriers of time, distance and language will allows ; tb Seek 
always the original sources first, at least under the briefest guidance

and exposition ; never to satisfy ourselves .with dissertations* 
abridgements, compendia or secondary historians ; to listen to 
each man’s words, so far as we have ability or opportunity, in the 
tongue he learned from his mother, and talked with his own 
kinsfolk, and wrote with his own pen. A single page read in that 
way brings 'us nearer to the man, gives us better, so to speak, the 
feel of his pulse, the light of his eye and the complexion of his 
face, than whole chapters of paraphrase and commentary. 

A secondary source is one that borrows its knowledge from 
others. The best secondary records are, in general, the latest ; 
but to this there are many exceptions. Tor the same history of 
Asoka, the Junagadh Inscription of Rudradaman is a secondary 
evidence. This inscription was issued three centuries later than 
the reign of Asoka by an altogether different person. It gives us 
an insight into the administrative problems and arrangements of 
the time of Asoka. To take another instance, the travel chronicle- 
of Ibn Batuta forms a primary source for the reign of Muhammad 
bin Tughlak, whereas; the T arikh-i-Ferishta written by Ferishta. 
forms a secondary source for the same reign as it belongs to a. 
much later time. Ferishta compiled his chronicle in the 16th 
century, three centuries after the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlak.. 

In reading both primary and secondary records, it is generally 
best to read all the printed materials first ; otherwise much time 
may be lost in doing over again work that has already been done 
satisfactorily;. And the printed material will often point to the 
existence, whereabouts, » and character of unpublished matter. 

; With this general background, let us proceed to indicate the 
various sources for the reconstruction of Indian History from 
the earliest period down to modern times. 

The sources for the study of Ancient Indian History down to 
1200 A.D. may be broadly classified into two groups : (1) literary 
(2) Archaeological. - : V • • i.i *•. - a.* s;* 

Literary sources : f We use the term ? Literary *1 in a very wide 
sense, not in its/ usual restricted sense. To the historian every 
written document, from which we shall exclnde inscriptions and 
writings on coinsUisBterature^ Evefypiece ofliterature so defined, 
is a document, and in dealing with written documents the' historian, 
has to protect himself by certain very necessary safeguards. 

The first danger against which he has 16 protect himself is* 
that of: falling a victim to a deliberately falsified record. One 


"38 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


might think that deliberate falsification is rare. But we are rather 
apt to underestimate the chances of deliberate falsification's. Here 
is what a recent writer says : e Nothing can deceive like a document. 
Here lies the value of the war of 191448 as a training ground 
for historians. . . . Pure documentary history seems to be akin to 
mythology. . * . When the British front was broken in March 1918, 
and the French reinforcements came to help in filling the gap, an 
eminent French General arrived at a certain army corps head- 
quarters and there majestically dictated orders giving the line on 
which his troops would stand that night and start their counter- 
attack in the morning. After reading it with some perplexity the 
British Corps' Gommandetr exclaimed : “ But that line is behind 


the German front ■; yon lost it yesterday. 


? ? To which he received 
^ C'est pour Vhistom^- 


the reply made with a knowing smile f 
' that is for history-. '*4: 

This is a very modem instance and a very clearly stated one ; 
a deliberate attempt to: falsify history. The False Decretals or the 
False Donation ©f wliich many disputes in the 

Middle Ages turned, and a very suspicious account on which the 
whole story of the Black Hole of Calcnto rests* are instances in 
point of more or less deliberate and international falsifications of 
■other times. 

Even when there is no conscious and deliberate falsification Of 
•documents, the task - of the "historian is difficult enough. Fda^'Et 
best, ? as ¥on Sybel observes : c Every narrator of events reports to 
us not the events themselves, but the impression which he has 
received of them. In this process of representation, however, there 
is always mingled, after an experience* a subjective element ; and 
to regain the true picture rf events by eliminating tfiis subjective 
element is the Iksk o£ his toribal ^liticikm. * 

When we come *to recent times* however, the task of thb 
historian becomes in some ways more difficult and in others less so. 
The mass of documents becomes so great that no one can hope 
to deal successfully with more than a relatively small section of 
them. On * the other hand, we often find ourselves in a position 
to compare the narratives; of the same events by different witnesses, 
bitten/ perhaps, from different and sometimes complementary 
points ot view, and this makes for an easier and more authoritative 
ascertainment of the true course of things. 

Another source of trouble against which "the historian has to 


HISTORY IN RELATION TO INDIAN HISTORY % 


39 


■guard himself is the possibility of his mistaking boastfulness lor 
fact. Charles IX declared that he organised the massacre of 
St. Bartholomew. He had really nothing to do with it. It might 
.look strange that a man should claim to be at the bottom of a 
massacre. But notions of self-interest and virtue change with the 
times. We may think of the analogous case in our local puranas 
■where we read that 8000 Jains were impaled in Madura at the 
instance of one of our saints ; and you have an annual festival in 
commemoration ol this pious achievement. In these cases, out of 
a false sense of values, men have been eager to paint themselves 
blacker than they really were. And one should be slow to infer 
from the legend behind the Madura festival that any Jains were 
actually impaled, and much less 8000 of them as a matter of fact. 

Thirdly, there is the exaggeration that is characteristic of 
Court Poetry. Most of the good qualities you can think of are 
attributed to the patron. And his heroism in the field of war 
often results in almost every known country sending him tribute. 
And the choice of qualities and countries for mention is often 
governed by requirements of metre and rhythm ; and one needs 
some experience to be able to distinguish history couched in an 
ornate literary style from c pure poetry. 5 In describing the pros- 
perity of the court, our poets would think of nothing less than 
golden gates for palaces* Whenever we read of golden gates we 
can reasonably be sure only of this : that gold was known and that 
palaces had gates. f 

A fourth kind of difficulty arises in dealing with literature 
which embodies legends, legend ary literature . Niebuhr, one of the 
founders q,f modern historical .method, describes legend in very 
striking terms. He calls it a mirage produced by an invisible 
object according to an unknown law of refraction. But Neibukr 
Jhimself trafficked in legends very largely, and in his reconstruction 
of Early Roman History he employed a method which has since 
Been called c the method of divination. 5 I ' i ; ■ 

It is said that: the Chinese have a favourite method of writing 
their history. The chronological accuracy of the Chinese narratives 
is sometimes almost staggering. Their historical sense is sometimes 
quite unique. ? Yet when the Chinese wanted to reconstruct the 
past of their race, the learned Mandarin tried to distil History from 
the Mythology of his country by the simple process of removing the 
my thical element from the old assortment of local legends, romances 


40 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


and heroic poetry, and then dished up the residue in the form of a 
continuous narrative, and called it a history of the country. Such 
efforts to distil history from legend are not by any means confined 
to China and Chinese historians. We have to be very careful in 
dealing with the matter that is on the face of it legendary or matter 
that even raises the suspicion that it may be legendary. Of this- 
second class it is necessary to give examples. Many Buddhist 
accounts make the Buddha a contemporary of Prasenajit, Pradyotat 
and Udayana.* It is a question whether we do not have here a 
tendency to gather round the Buddha some famous legendary 
figures rather than to give a historical account of his contemporaries ✓ 
Then there is the verse about the Nine Gems of Vikramaditya’s 
Court. No historian has succeeded in completely elucidating that 
verse and reconciling all the known data with it, 

Again we have the story of the three Tamil Sangams, which is> 
on the face of it a stupendous legend, but yet it has passed foi^ 
history. And people insist again and again in South India on our 
talking only of the Third Sangam. And one is not sure again that 
the same tendency is not at work in modern historical research. 
The Gupta Age has come to exercise such a fascination on the mind 
of the Indian historian as a period when Hindu culture attained its 
acme that there is growing up a tendency among scholars to 
ascribe to the Gupta period almost any author who does not find 
a place elsewhere. So we are building up a new legend of Gupta 
ascendancy in all walks of life. It is possible, however, that some- 
times this line of criticism is carried too far. For instance, the 
tradition relating to the ashtadiggaj as the eight famous men of letters 
of the court of Krishnadeva Raya, fell under unmerited suspicion 
and is now seen to conform to facts of history. 

You must also suspect that certain recurrent motifs are of a- 
clearly legendary character. Take Trinetra, the man with three 
eyes^ we mean Trinetra Pallava, Trinetra Kadamba and so on. 
When we get Trinetras in different texts, invariably mentioned in- 
very edifying contexts, w*e must stop to think whether it is history 
dr legend we are being treated to. 

! ' Then take the often-told tale of the step-mother’s love for the 

heir-apparent to the throne. The motif occurs with reference to* 
Anoka’s queen Tishyarakshita and Kunala, and also in the stories 
of aftnuch later time in Deccan, viz* iti the stories of Sarngadhara 
and Kumara Ramanna. One does not know' if One can attach 



HISTORY IN RELATION TO INDIAN HISTORY 


41 


any value to these tales. We have then the whole set of foundation- 
myths which have got to be rejected as history — the love of a 
sage or a prince for a Nagi maiden, or a girl from the Patala, which 
results in the foundation of a royal family e.g. the Pallavas in 
South India and the royal dynasties of Kambuja and Champa 
in Indo-China. Then there is the legend of the origin of the 
Agnikulas, that relating to the migration of the Yadavas, and the 
stories told of different dynasties, that their ancestors originally 
ruled in Ayodhya or Ahicchatra and that they migrated to the 
Deccan and the South. 

But the e contempt of history for fiction 5 in the words of 
George Gordon, ‘ may be overdone. * The hard-worked historian, 
in his excusable preoccupation with the truth, is inclined to be 
impatient of fables even when they are the fables of a race. But 
myths like those we have mentioned are { infectious and pervasive, 5, 
colour men’s minds and influence actions . They are often solemnly 
recited in state documents, and portrayed in sculpture and painting 
of high quality. Legends which have so largely moulded men’s 
minds and conduct have a claim on the historian which he cannot 
lightly set aside. In his Abraham, Recent Discoveries and Hebrew 
Origins (1935) Leonard Woolley has examined how far Hebrew 
Tradition has been confirmed by the excavations at Ur and shown 
that though we get no direct evidence on the events of Abraham’s 
life or even of his name, still when properly intrepreted, Tradition 
and Archaeology light up each other in a remarkable manner. 

: . At this point we may perhaps briefly refer to the evidence of 
comparative philology which is a valuable aid to the historian, 
especially for tire pre-historic period to which no written records 
directly relate. Within its proper limits, the comparative study 
of languages has provided valuable glimpses into the past to be 
got in no other way. But to base large inferences upon stray and 
casual similarities in sound is one of the most dangerous temptations 
to which some students of history are apt to fail a prey. We have 
a wild account that Karikala traversed the whole of North India 
arid reached the Himalayas. As a matter of fact this story is 
unknown to the earlier poets Celebrating his exploits and occurs 
only in some relatively late works. But because .there happens to 
occur among the names of Tibetan passes of the Himalayas a name 
which sounds like Chola pass, it has been held that this name, 
Chela pass, is sufficient proof that Karikala Chola must have gone 


42 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


there on an expedition. Or take another instance which is equally 
illustrative of this kind of error. The tendency has become very 
strong of late to discover the influence of pre-Aryan inhabitants 
upon the growth of Indian Civilization. It has been felt by some 
scholars for some time that Indian History has been approached 
from the wrong end. To start from the North and advance to the 
South, to give a predominant place to the Aryan influence and to 
ignore the pre-Aryan inhabitants of the country and the part they 
played in the shaping of Hindu culture, — that is said to have been a 
great mistake of modern historical reconstruction. There is some 
justification for this view and the non-Aryan elements in Hindu 
culture are rightly claiming an increasing share of the attention 
of scholars to-day. But when the frenzy of the new attempt leads 
one scholar to suggest that the name ‘ Hanuman 9 is derived from 
the Tamil phrase c Anmandi/ and another to contend seriously 
that Sinhalese is a language of the c DravidianV group, it is time 
for us to cry halt and to ask ourselves if this reaction is really not 
being carried too far. : - . 

Comparative philology is not without its uses even in the 
study of historical times. The expansion of the Tamils and 
‘Teluguis across the Bay of Bengal is attested by the admixture of 
many words from these languages in the: Malay vocabulary, and 
Prof. Von Ronkel has done much good work in tracing several 
Malay . words to their South Indian sources. Similar work has 
been done for some East African languages as well. Again many 
a moot point in the historical geography of Malay Peninsula and 
Archipelago has to be settled by a patient comparison of names of 
places in many languages principally Chinese, Arabic and Malay. 
Personal and place names ate reproduced in a foreign language 
sometimes by transliterations ! and at other times by transla- 
tions ; yet other methods are also known.:* The study and correct 
interpretation of these data require much patient and cautious 
scholarship. Lastly, the method can be applied to the history of 
any settled language and its literature, and by* this means one can 
trace the external influences to which the people speaking the 
language have been exposed, and the extent to which their life 
has been affected by them. The grammar and prosody of Tamil, 
fo^ ins^co, and the vocabulary of the language when studied from 
this point of view mlay fee expected to yield very striking results** 
The Tamil Bwicoii contains valuable hints under individual words?,

'lout it is no substitute for a systematic study which, besides lighting 
up the different phases of the history of Tamils* may well be cal- 
culated to show how misplaced is the cry that is sometimes raised 
in favour of c pure Tamil*’ And the same thing will be found true 
of the other languages of South India* We may now review 
briefly the classes of literary evidence that are available to students 
of Indian History. Here literature falls into two broad classes, 

. Indigenous literature and Foreign literature * 

Indigenous literature is contained in several languages, 
Sanskrit, Prakrit and Pali, Tamil, Tel ugu,MaIayalam, Kannada and 
;in later times Persian and Marathi. Obviously it is not possible 
to review all this literature in any detail here. : Still a few remarks 
may be offered on the different types of literature in these different 
.languages* r ; 

Beyond a shadow of doubt, Vedic literature is the oldest of 
the literatures of North India and. Tamil literature of South India. 
Telugu and Kannada come later and their literary beginnings may 
be roughly put somewhere about the 8th century A*D. 

-The first division is general literature or belles-lettres . 1 Here 
the historian generally finds his data in thp prefaces and colophons 
Which usually give descriptions of the author and his works, the 
place of his birth and residence, his patron, ^the patron’s i achieve- 
ments. and, so on* And really a . considerable volume of historical 
mformation’ has been gathered , by the s tudy of prefaces and coloph- 
Ofis qf general works of literature* But nd tail prefaces and colophons 
can pass * unch allenged • The colophons of the different verses of 
the Tapui Pwmarmu were attacked father sharply by the 

late P.T. Srinivasa Iyengar, but it seemed that the attack- had 
been carried, too far in that case* But: a crucial case* in which 
on,e finds it difficult to make up one’s mind* is the preface to the 
^il^ppadikarm and Manimekalai, two works- to which have been 
assigned various, dates ranging from the first to the &th-j.cmtury 
A.p* There are good grounds to hold that they do not Stand m 
the same class; with Sangam Literature ; M spite of the fact that 
the Payiram of the Silappadikaram makes the authors of the two 
works cpnteinporam^ and ofiSeran Senguttuvan, one 

of the foremost monarchs of the Saiigam period, both the works 
betray m a ifM im^stakable signs -that* at least in their present form, 
they dp not gp back to the same age as-, ; sayv the Pattupattu or Pura- 
nanuru. We have also the curious statement that Gajabahu I of 


44 


. HISTORICAL METHOD 


Ceylon was a contemporary of both these authors. One canto of 
the Manimekalm is seen to contain evidence of its having been 
revised, and revised badly, by a later author. But whether the 
two original authors were contemporaries with each other and with 
Gajabahu ot Ceylon, and whether we have some other means ot 
explaining the data furnished by these works, are still open ques-* 
tions. They cannot be answered adequately without a far more 
systematic and critical study oi these works than they have so far 
received. The uncertainty of literary data can be seen also from 
the facts that the date of Kalidasa, the foremost of India’s poets, is 
still debated ; and from the, utterly composite character of the 
epics, Puranas and other works like the Manusmriti each made up 

ol several strata of different epochs. 

Besides belles-lettres, we have several works which though- 
they go by the name of commentaries, are often more or less- 
independent criticisms of original texts and are of at least as much- 
value to the historian as the texts themselves. In Sanskrit, Patanjali,- 
Sahara and Sahkarai are independent thinkers who chose to relate 
their thoughtstolexfant texts of high authority rather than comment 
tators strictly so called ;>‘at any rate their own contributions are 
not Jess important than those of the texts they discussed. In 
Tamil the various commentaries on the Tolkappifam , the great 
commentary of the Tiruvayamoli, the Idit , and other commentaries' 
on other works, famous ones like that of Adiyarkkunallar, Parimel-' 
alagar, and so on, furnish interesting evidence of great value. As- 
the historical data that we gather from. the commentaries are' 
casual s tatements with no ulterior purpose or motive behind them,, 
their value is very great. 

We have another type which is not so valuable, - puranic and. 
legendary literature. -SthaMpuran^s ate very late and generally 
worthless for purposes of his^ty ; But of ihore value When dis-- 
eteetly used, are the biographies of saints, such as those contained- 
in the P enyaptiranatn, the great treasure house of ‘Saiva hagioJogy. r 
The Gump tt amp am \ takes a similar position in the Vaishnava- 
system. -■ : '-V, s J 

Then we take another class of literature. It is quasi-his tori cal 
in character and frdm it a historian can expect to gain better aid 
than ffom puranlb and legendary lore. Here again the historian 
has to guaf d agaihst the influence of literary conventions in shaping 
the thought of the poet, and he must not accept as facts mere 


HISTORY IN RELATION TO INDIAN HISTORY 


45 


-repetitions of conventional statements. There are different types 
of quasi-historical poems in Tamil. Take the Ula for instance. 
The classic instance here is furnished by the ulas of Ottakkuttan on 
three successive Chola monarchs. The Ula> however, should not 
he understood to include all the Ulas on deities and legendary 
figures ; and in one case, the Ekambaramthar tda 3 it is not clear 
from the poem itself whether its hero is the deity of Kanchipuram, 
or a Sambuvaraya of the same name. These remarks apply to 
the similar compositions of the Kovai , Par ant and Kalambakam . 

The earliest instances we have of this type of poems are really 
quasi-historical. The later imitations generally take to legendary 
themes. From the historian’s point of view this tendency must be 
-characterised as a degeneration. The Pandikkovai , large portions 
of which are available in citations in commentaries and anthologies, 
is one of the earliest Kovais. Not quite so valuable is Kulottungan 
.Kovai on Kulottunga III, a poem which remains anonymous. 
Kalingattupparani holds a high place as a source of history. It 
deals with the story of the Kalinga expedition of the time of 
Kulottunga I and incidentally sheds much welcome light on a 
-critical period of Chola History. There are other paranis which 
are not half so valuable for history. The anonymous Natidik ka- 
lambakam is a good example ot its type ; it is a poem on Pallava 
Nandivarman III. 

We then come to works of the type of chronicles. We have 
•chronicles of many sorts. Some of them are more useful than 
others ; all of them more dependable in some parts than in others. 
Kalhana’s Rajatarangird, though often called the Kashmir 
•Chronicle^ attains almost the level of a regular history. The 
author laid down some correct principles of historical writing 
for himself, though he was not able to observe them always 
•owing to the defects in the sources accessible to him. It 
cannot be repeated too- often that the admission of any statement 
into a historical account is justified only after it has passed through 
the process of critical appraisal. Take a work like KeralotputtL 
This work is available in a number of versions. They are all of 
them late. ’ There ifc ! much in common among all these versions, 
but every version differs from 'every other in some respects. Much 
of the nakrative jin the beginning is obviously legendary i but when - 
you come to more recent times, these various versions ' of Reralotpatii 
tfhrow out sometimes very useful hints. In a somewhat better case 


46 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


is a more closely written chronicle, Maduraittalavaralaru , which, a& 
its name indicates, deals with the history of the Madura temple- 
It does not pretend to give the whole of the history. It is naturally 
more detailed on the modern side. It will be a useful work for' 
some scholar to undertake a critical edition of this chronicle tested 
by epigraphical and other data that are now accessible to us. Of 
the same class,, but on, .the whole less reliable, and in some respects 
more interesting, is the Koyilolugu which deals with the history 
of the Srirangam temple in the manner in which the Maduraittala 
varalaru deals with that of the Madura temple. A similar work 
on the temple of Kalahasti is also said to be in the possession of 
the priest of the temple. It does not Seem to have been examined 
yet by any student of history^ Then we have Madala Payji> the 
chronicle of the temple of Jagannatha at Puri, a quaint record of 
no great historical value, though otherwise interesting. The 
Prithiviraj Raso is another case in point, the raso being later and 
apparently less dependable than the Sanskrit Prithiviraj a Vijaya 
from Kashmir, There is reason to think that many of these 
historical chronicles were, brought up to date from time to time 
unlike the sthala pur anas which were unitary compositions of single 
poets. The Kongudesarajakkal is another chronicle which has been 
on the whole rather overrated by students of South Indian History. 
Of course there are parts of this chronicle which will escape this 
condemnation. Eor instance, certain statements regarding early 
Chola his tory in the Kongudesarajakkal have been strikingly confirmed - 
by authentic epigraphical evidence. How such accurate state- 
me ntsgOt mixed up with so much that is mere gossip is a problem. 
We js till processes by which these chronicles came 

into existence, ,Thfy de&erv$ careful and critical study too. We 
have some more typical chubnides like the KekSmpa Vijaya, The * 
Karnatakarajakkal, SavistaraChafitre, the Kala Jnana literature and- 
so on- But these works are of later origin. They belong to the 
medieval and modem periods of Indian History. We shall 
reserve the study of the value of these Chronicles for a later 
stage.. 

. Next to the chronicles we have the Ballads. The value of 
Ballads can hardly be underestimated for the study of Ancient 
history of India , The ballad is a simple popular poem devoid of 
high poetic ambition. Ballads are for the market place and the 
“ blind cfdwder or for the rustic chorus that sings the ballad.

47 


burden.” Some recent historical events have been cast into this 
form of narration eminently fitted for oral circulation among the 
people. The Ramappayyan ammanai and the Desinga Raj an Kadai 
are typical instances of this class. These ballads are not without 
value even as supplements to other sources on questions 
of facts ; but their unique value lies in the manner in 
which they exhibit the popular reactions to the events they com-* 
memorate. 

The Foreign Sources of Indian History 

The accounts of any country and its people by foreign observers 
are of great interest to the historian of the country. For they 
enable him to know what impression it made upon’ the minds of 
such observers and to estimate with greater confidence the part 
played by it in the general history of the world. * And where, as 
in the case ol Ancient India, the native sources of history fail him 
partly or altogether at some points, the writings of foreigners gain 
great value in his eyes. Yet it is easy to exaggerate the value of 
the Greek writings on India. The Greek writers did evince a 
commendable interest in observing and recording facts. But they 
were also credulous purveyors of all the fable and gossip that came 
their way. The few who wrote before the invasion cf Alexander 
did so mostly from hearsay and had little direct knowledge of 
India. The scientists and men of action who accompanied 
Alexander must have found most of their time taken up with 
planning, marching and fighting in a hostile and unknown country 
and the wonder is that they succeeded in doing what they did try 
make India known to their countrymen ; and- the lands they 
traversed were but the fringe of Hindustan far from the genuine* 
centres of Hindu culture in the heart of the country. The 
ambassadors of the Hellenistic kings who came after Alexander,, 
in particular Magasthenes, had better opportunities of studying 
the country and its people as their missions took them into their 
midst. But being ignorant of the language of the people, they 
must have depended on intepreters of sorts and experienced 
considerable difficulty in comprehending correctly what they saw 
and heard. The Chinese pilgrims of a later age who had command 
* of the Sanskrit idiom were much better placed in this respect, 
but their interests were not so wide. Lastly, with very few excep- 
tions, Herodotus being the most notable of them, all the original 
writings have perished and we now depend on excerpts preserved 



48 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


by later writers and compilers, who, in turn, had access only at 
■second hand to the matter they quoted. We lack the means of 
forming an independent integral judgement ot most of our ultimate 
authorities. Nevertheless it is useful to study these excerpts with 
care, for much can be leamt thus of the geography, physical and 
human, of India as it was understood by contemporary Greek 
writers, of its fauna and flora, of its society, religious conditions 
,and economic activity. 

Scylax : The first Greek to write a book on India was the 
sea captain Scylax of Caryanda whom Darius sent out in 509 B.C. 
on a voyage of exploration to find out where the Indus emptied 
itself into the sea. He is said to have started from the city of 
Kaspatyrus in the Paktyikan district, sailed down the stream to 
the sea and after a. voyage of 30 months, reached the place whence 
the Egyptian king Necho sent the Phoenicians to sail round Libya. 
We know little of Scylax’s book ; we do not hear of it as being a 
guide to Alexander in his voyage. It is certain however that 
Scylax started sotee of the fables about Indian peoples which 
coloured Greek traditional beliefs about India for many centuries. 
Aristotle cites Scylax’s statement that in India kings had a marked 
superiority over those they governed-. 

Herodotus : The references to India and Indians in Herodotus 
place them in a. dear light, and the monstrous races that formed 
the' stock in trade of Greek writers on India before and after him 
do not make their appearance in his pages. India |is to him the 
furthest region of the inhabited world towards the east, and the 
Indians; dwfell neares t the region of the rising Sun. Of the Indian* 
wdthip the empire of Darius he observed that they were more 
numerous than any other nation know to him, and paid a tribute 
exceeding .that of -every other • people, -360 talents of .gold dust. 
Bu=t he knows that there were many other; tribes of Ihdians, all 
of them dark skinned, living, -a long way from Persia towards the 
south over whom King Darius had no authority. There were 
many tribes among Indians and they did not all speak the same 
language, Herodotus s knowledge of the people across the Persian,, 
border was- by, no means confined to savages. There .is a very: 
gpO^ iaOfOiint of the life of the forest dwelling sages of India- who , 
used wild rice for' their staple food. Herodotus notes that the; 
beasts .and birds . of India, were much bigger than, those? found 
elsewhere, except the horses, which were surpassed by the Median

'breed. The Indus was for him the only river, besides the Nile, 
that produced crocodiles. Most interesting to the. Greeks must 
have been his discovery that there were trees in India the fruit 
'whereof is a wool exceeding in beauty and .goodness that of 
sheep. 

In truth the period between Herodotus and Alexander is 
marked by a decided set back in the Greek knowledge of India. 
'The Persians lost their Indian Satrapy after [some time and 
Alexander did not come across Persian officials east of the Plindu- 
kush. Even Herodotus was not perhaps much read and there is 
no evidence that Alexander knew of his account of Scylax’s voyage. 
But the expedition of Alexander was the first occasion when the 
West began to hear a good deal about India that was based on 
.direct personal observations of the reporters. Though in his wars 
and campaigns the first place was given to military considerations 
.other interests of a wider character were by no means forgotten, 
and among his lieutenants and companions there were many 
•scientists and literary men who later employed their pens in 
.describing what they had seen and heard wherever they went no 
less than in celebrating the martial successes of Alexander. They 
■were the first to communicate to the outside world a more or less

Seleucus. Megasthenes evidently knew Kabul and the Punjab 
very well and travelled along the Royal Road from the frontier 
to the capital of the Mauryan Empire. For his knowledge of the 
rest of India, he depended upon report. He wrote the Indika , a 
comprehensive work on India, apparently divided into four books ■ 
describing the country, its soil, climate, animals and plants, its • 
government and religion, the manner of the people and their arts. 
He sought to describe many things from the King's court down to 
the remotest tribes. Many writers copied him assiduously in later 
times even as they cast aspersions on his veracity as did Eratosthenes • 
and Strabo. 

Of the education and training of Megasthenes we know little. 
We may guess that he was an administrator and diplomat with a 
sober vision that sought to penetrate behind appearances and give 
a faithful report to his monarch of the strength and weakness of 
the neighbouring empire on the east. We do not know' if he 
wrote out his work when he was in India or after his return to 
the West., In any event his statements on the Indian State, Law 
and Administration must be interpreted with care in the light of' 
his natural prepossessions as an official of a largejiellenistic state, , 
and it is probable that some of them included an argument, . 
criticism or correction due to what other Greek writers before him 
had stated on particular topics. Megasthenes has often been 
denounced as untrustworthy both/by ancient and modern writers, 
but this charge applies, properly speaking, only to what he writes* 
from hearsay* particularly on the fabulous races of India and on 
Herakles and the Indian Dionysus. Of the former the learned- 
Brahmins of the country had a great deal to tell him, but he says 
that, he did not set down everything he heard, which may be 
readily accepted in the light of the puranie accounts of s uch races, . 
Q,aite probably he fell into some eirofs, but as we can be certain 
in no instance that we have his very words before us, it is always 
doubtful if the mistake was made by Megasthenes himself or those 
who copied him. Of the manner in which the Indika of Megasthenes * 
was used by these authors, Schwanbeck remarks : ‘ since Strabo. 
Arrianus and Diodorus have directed their attention to relate 
nearly the same things, it has resulted that the greatest part of 
i$m Md£ka has been 'completely lost and that of many passages*, 
singularly enough, three epitomes are extant* to which Occasion

Special importance must be attached to the classical writers 
who have elucidated the geography ancl natural History of 
India. Pliny the Elder is the earliest in this line. He wrote a. 
cyclopaedic f Natural History 3 in 37 books. The sixth book 
contains his geography of India, based mainly on the Indika of 
Megasthenes. 

Next to Pliny comes the anonymous author of the Periplus of 
the Erythraean Sea , written a few yearsjater after the publication' 
of Pliny’s work. He was a Greek, settled in Egypt, who made a 
voyage to the Indian coast about 80 A.D. and left a record of its* 
ports, harbours and merchandise^. This short work has preserved 
from oblivion a phase of the trade and maritime activity in Ancient 
India of which he hear also the in earliest literature of the Tamils. 
Ptolemy represents a further stage in that increasing acquaintance 
of theRomans with the countries oi the East ; he wrote a geographi- 
cal account of India in the 2nd century A.D. on scientific lines- 
He drew his data from secondary sources and has fallen into* 
numerous errors. His general conception of the shape of India is. 
also faulty in the extreme. 

After Ptolemy’s attempt ‘ to put into scientific form the records-' 
and personal impressions of a number of merchants, travellers 
and others of his time’, * there followed a long period without 
original observation or authorship, a period of copying, compila tion 
and imitation.’ The Roman Empire began to develop signs of 
weakness, and the delicate commercial system which had been 
reared during the Hellenistic and early periods broke down 
completely towards the end of 3rd century A.D. The Greek half 
of the Roman Empire indeed kept up its political unity much 
longer than the Western half. To this period belongs Marcian of 
Heraclea whose work has survived only in fragments. ‘ If it had 
been preserved to us in complete form,’ says Schoff, * it might 
indeed have been a more useful compilation of Roman geography 
for general reference than the highly technical work of 
Ptolemy.’ 

A more typical Byzantine figure was the crotchety monk,. 

* Cosmas ’ called Indikopleustes, the man who sailed to India. In 
his early life he was a merchant and his business took him to many 
places on the Persian Gulf, on the west coast of India and as far 
east as Ceylon. His book * Christian Topography' written some time 
between 530 and 550 A.D. sets out to disprove the theories of

classical geography on the configuration of the earth- and establish 
doctrines drawn from Holy Scriptures. Yule, characterised it, 
not very unjustly, as £ a Continent, of mud from which we may 
extract, however, a few geographical fossils dT considerable 
interest.’ 1 

The Chinese Writers : The writings of the Chinese travellers 
form a valuable supplement to the classical accounts of Greek and 
Roman writers. Three jpf the Chinese travellers, Fa-Hien, 
Hiuen-Tsang and I-tsing are better known than the rest and have 
•recorded their experience in books which are fortunately preserved 
in their original forms and have all been trahslated into English 
and French by Legge, Beal, Takakusu and Chavannes. From 
3rd century to 8th century, these travellers visited India and have 
left their impressions about the social and economic condition of 
India prevailing during their time. Fa-Hien came in the time of 
Ghandragupta Vikramaditya ; Hiuen-Tsang during the time of 
Harshavardhana ; I-tsing during the latter part of the 57th century 
A.D. All these three writers spent a considerable time in India 
and learnt its language and culture with great interest and enthu- 
siasm. The first two travellers, especially Hiuen-Tsang, travelled 
•widely almost all over the country. In these respects, the Chinese 
travellers possessed an undoubted advantage over the Greeks and 
the Romans. The Greek travellers . came, saw and remained for 
•sometime only in Pataliputra. But the Chinese travellers visited 
not only the country of M'agadha but even the extreme parts of 
South India. ; But these Chinese travellers visited India not to 
ywit$ the history Qfilndia but with a religious purpose. They were 
.all devout Buddhist monks whose journey to India was merely a 
pilgrimager to holy lands and whose .aim was mainly to study the 
.condition of Buddhism in India and to collect Buddhist relics arid 
.•scriptures. It is this aspect of Chinese travellers, that somewhat 
detracts from the historical value of their) writings. Beyond the ■’* 
*state of Buddhism, they never bothered about secular matters and 
•often do not even mention the names of the rulers of the countries '! 
they visited. But Hiuen-Tsang is not so circumscribed and. gives 
•some interesting information about his patrori Harshavardhana and 
other contemporary rulers of India. . He vividly describes the later ■ j 

life of Harshavardhana, his court, his altitude towards Buddhism jj 
and the system of education that wai current in India during his ' J 
'time. He himsell spent a few years in the University of Nalanda ■■

and devoted a chapter to the general-educational system of India 
in general and Nalanda in particular. 

The third great traveller I-tsing visited India about 675 A.D- 
and remained in India for some time. One of his accounts is-mostly 
interesting in so far it describes the condition of Buddhism inlndia 
and another gives the biographies of 60 monks who visited India. 
He left India by way of Java and returned to China ultimately 
in 695 A.D. His accounts were finished in 693 A.D. Thus the 
writings of Chinese travellers have rendered valuable contributions 
to. our knowledge of the state of Buddhism in India. But we must 
be on our guard against accepting as literally true all their state- 
ments, especially those which concern the Buddhist faith, even when- 
based on' personal observation. Their judgements on Indian 
people were warped by an implicit faith in the superiority of 
Buddhism and the intimate association with the men and monks and 
the institutions connected with that religion. Their concern was 
to depict the state ofBuddhisminthe various parts of the Buddhist 
world and other J matters take a subordinate place in their 
accounts. 

Arab Writers 

With the ninth century we enter on the period of the great 
Arab travellers, geographers and historians. From very ancient 
times much’ of the trade of the Indian Ocean had been in the 
hands of the Arabs, and with the rise of Islam there came a 
sudden expansion which was not confined to religion and 
politics, but spread' to commerce and science. The Prophet 
had been himself a merchant in his early life, and this no doubt 
explains in part the great prestige which Muslim merchants 
enjoyed. The dramatic story, of the expansion of Muslim power 
under the early Khalifs is well known ; one would expect that the 
political revolutions which accompanied it would have been, 
hindrances to trade. : But even in the midst of the most rapid 
and surprising conquests* commercial expansion went on apace* 
In the ,16th year of the Hegira (637 A.D.) , dti the : Caliphate oF 
Omar, a fleet started from the boast of Oman to ravage Sindh 
and the West Coaiftlbf India* And before the end of the seventh, 
century, a colony of Muslim merchants had established themselves 
in Ceylon* Some? Muslim women who had lost their parents in 
jSeylpn tyere carried off by: Indian pirates on their way back home,, 
and this event furnished a pretext to the famous Hajjaj to invade:

the Indus Valley. In 758 A.D. the Arabs and Persians settled 
in Canton were sufficiently numerous for them to be able to raise 
tumult in the city and. turn to their own profit the confusion thus 
created. In fact politically the Arab empire was not stable and 
£ it split up into various elements almost as quickly as it had been 
constructed. But as an economic and cultural power it remained 
of the greatest significance. It created for a time the conditions 
under which a revival both of prosperity and of learning was 
possible. The actual contribution of Arab scholars and of Arab 
artists is not so important as the work they enabled others to do. 
The empire was not so much Arab as Muslim, not a racial but a 
religious unity. <£ Out of some sixteen geographers of note ” (who 
wrote in Arabic), we are told by a modern historian, “ from the 
ninth to the thirteenth century, four were natives of Persia, four of 
Baghdad, and four of Spaim” ’ * 

Ibn Khurdadbeh 

Abul-Kasim-ObeidulIa-bin^ Ahmad was among the earliest of 
these writers. He is better known as Ibn Khurdadbeh, his Persian 
surname indicating that he was a descendant of a Magian, 
Khordadbeh by name. The latter embraced Islam like many of 
his co-religionists, and his grandson rose to a iiigh position in the 
•official world, and he, was in a position to: gather much authentic 
information on the various parts of the empire and the countries 
with which it maintained relations of one kind or another. His 
Book of Routes and Kingdoms was composed between 844 and 
B48 A.0. , but was still being modified in 885 A.D. Unfortunately* 
as Masudi remarks, he presents his facts in a dry and incomplete 
.manner, and if he enters into details occasionally, it is only to 
refer to some; quixotic legend . Yet, there is one precious passage 
describing the s.tate of intercommunicalion 5 between Europe and 
-Asia in the second half of the ninth century : i 

£ The Jewish merchants speak Persian, Roman (Greek and 
Latin), Arabic, and the Trench, Spanish and Slav languages. 
They travel from the West to the East, and from the East to the 
'West, now by land now by sea. They take from the West eunuchs, 
female slaves, boys, silk, furs. and swords. They embark in the 
country of the Franks on the Western sea and sail to Farama $ 
there they put their; merchandise on the backs of animals and

:go by land marching for five days to Colzom, at a distance of 
twenty parasangs. Then they embark on the Eastern sea (Red 
Sea) and go from Colzom to Hedjaz and Jidda ; and then to 
Sindh, India and China. On their return they bring musk, 
aloes, camphor, cinnamon and other products of the eastern 
-countries, and return Col'zom, and then to Farama where 
they take ship again on the Western sea, some going to Cons 
tantinople to sell their goods, and others to the country of the 
Franks. 

c Sometimes the Jewish merchants, in embarking on the 
Western sea, sail (to the mouth of the Oronte) towards Antioch. 
At the end of a three days 5 march (from there), they reach the 
banks of the Euphrates and come to Baghdad. There they embark 
on the Tigris and descend to Obollah, whence they set sail to 
‘Oman, Sindh, India and China. The voyage is thus made with- 
•out interruption. 3 * 

Abu Zaid Hassan, oi Siraf on the Persian Gulf, though no 
•great traveller himself, had immense opportunities of meeting 
.much travelled merchants and scholars, the celebrated Masudi 
among them. Siraf was then a busy port frequented by merchants 
from all parts of the world, and Abu Zaid declares that his object 
was to supplement ap earlier work on India and China by adding 
to it data drawn from his own studies and his talks with persons 
who had travelled in the eastern countries. 

, Abu Zaid’s predecessor Who wrote his work in 851 A.D. has 
•"often been called Suleiman ; but the evidence does not warrant 
anything more than the cautious conclusion of Yule, re-stated by 
Pelliot, that the work edited by Abu Zaid is a compilation of 
notes made by an anonymous writer ‘ from his own experiences 
;in at least two voyages he made to India at an interval of sixteen 
yea;rs and from what he had collected from others who had visited 
'China, Suleiman among them’.j c It is, clear, 5 says Yule, ‘ from 
the vagueness of his accounts that the author’s knowledge of India 
was slight and inaccurate, and that he had no distinct conception 
of its magnitude. 5 However that may be, he was largely drawn 
upon by Masudi who, had travelled in India and Ceylon and 
wanted to devote particular attention to India. I bn AJ-Fakih 
(902), another wrifer of the early tenth century, who preceded

Abu Zaid and Masudi, also drew largely upon this ■anonymous? 
writer whom Abu Zaid considered worthy of being edited more 
than half a century after the date of the original composition. In 
fact it is a common trait of Arab writers to- copy one another' 
extensively and it would be otiose to reproduce all their accounts. 

Abu Zaid adds many -interesting particulars to the notes of 
his predecessors. The accuracy of his information is established 
by the remarkably correct account he gives of the political revolu- 
tion that caused confusion in China soon after Suleiman’s visit or 
visits to that country and had entirely stopped the Arab trade* 
with China at the time he wrote his work. 

There aremany other Arab writers., travellers and geographers^ 
of the tenth century, * besides those so far mentioned. But their 
works have little on Southern India or at least little that is new 
except exaggerated and apocryphal accounts like that of the* 
temple of Mankir (Malkhed) from the pen of AbuT-Faradj (988) .* 
The illustrious Al-Biruni (c.1030) took the whole range of human- 
sciences for his sphere ; philosophy, mathematics, chronology,* 
medicine, nothing escaped his attention ; he knew Sanskrit very' 
well and appears to have read even Greek Works in -the original. 
He spent many years in India, was the friend of Mahmud of 
Ghazni and his son Masud, and in correspondence with Avicenna. 
He died at Ghazni in 1 048. His great work on Indians an excellent 
account of Indian religion, philosophy, literature, chronology;, 
astronomy, customs, law and astrology. His interesting fable on 
Kikhind attests the hold of the Rama legends on themindsr

Archaeology 

Archaeology easily falls into two broad divisions — pre-historic 
and historical. With regard to pre-historic archaeology though, 
we have been quite lucky in recent decades in the Mohenjo 
Daro and Harappa finds, and in the results of the super- 
ficial archaeological survey conducted in the area of the Indus- 
Valley Culture, still there are two respects in which our pre-historic 
archaeology differs from that of other countries. .The first is the 
relative paucity of finds of a striking character. We have had 
nothing nearly so sensational for instance, as the finds from Ur 
of the Chaldees, or the finds from Tutankhamon’s tomb, or those' 
of Schliemann in Troy or of Sir Arthur Evans in Crete. It has to 
be admitted that our finds have been less Spectacular though, 
not the .less interesting or instructive on that account. We have 
not had the advantage of a natural advertisement that results 
from the finds of golden cups, chalices, jewels, coffins and so on,, 
all beautifully wrought and high works of art of a very ancient 
culture. 

Another respect in which our pre-historic archaeology differs 
from that of other countries is that our studies have been proceeding’ 
by fits and starts and there has been no systematic attempt at 
exploring the pre-historic archaeology of even a definite area* The 
one exception is the surface exploration in the area ofthe Indus* 
Valley Culturein Afghanistan, Baluchistan and Southern Iran made' 
by the officers of the Archaeological Department, particularly Stein 
and N.G. Majumdar. But systematic excavation has been conduct-* 
ed over only a relatively small area of this rich and extensive fields 
Even in such known sites elsewhere as Adiccanallur no attempt .has 
been made to pursue the work begun many years ago: J Round- 
about Madras there are very interesting data that are iarhong the 
earliest relics of human habitation but they have been only little 
studied./ and by /a few scholars generally in their moments of 
leisure snatched from a busy administrative life: And prehistoric 
archaeology systematically pursued may produce very good results 
ashas beeif seen in rotj^tt years when the archaeological depart-* 
tnent has given some attention to the study 1 Soule of the South 
Indian Sites like Maski (Hyderabad) and ' ChandravalH as also' 
fOme ofthe numerous sites in the Vellar basin of the 6 Pudukkotta£ 


;58

State, 5 are very interesting as they bridge the transition from 
pre-history to historical times in a remarkable manner. Since the 
formation of Pakistan took away the sites of Mohenjo Daro and 
Harappa from India, . our Archaeological department has been 
making commendable and fairly successful efforts to trace the 
spread of the Indus Valley Culture in India and marked out many 
sites for study, though the excavations undertaken so far have not 
given striking results, except possibly at Rupar. 

The study of Ceramics and the classification and comparison 
of beads according to the form and material of their make are of 
great importance for the study of the pre-historic maritime contacts 
of South India, which seem to have survived far into historical 
times. These studies are still in their infancy and few Indian 
scholars are known to have taken to them seriously. The work 
now being carried on in Java, Malaya, Indo-China and the 
Philippines in this field has much interest for us. Prof. Beyer’s 
work in the Philippines, for instance, has led him to the inference 
that the Hindu colonisation of the Eastern lands from South India 
in the early centuries of the Christian era was not the beginning 
of such contacts, but only the continuation of a trade relation that 
started far back in the first millennium B.C. 

Attention may be drawn to some curious analogies between 
practices which prevail to-day in our midst and practices which 
'Wolley thinks prevailed in Ur about 3000 B.C. Again decisively 
South Indian features of culture are found to have spread far in 
the East* In fact there are many repetitions oi these features in 
Java, Indo- China, and even part oi Eastern China, so much so 
that the? Frehch scholar Parmentier was tempted to adumbrate a 
theory at a common origin ol temple architecture for the whole , of 
Southern Asia from Arabia right up to China. And others are 
.inclined to** suggest the spread of a pre-historic Dravidian culture 
to the Mediterranean. ^ . 

If we turn to the archaeology of historical times, here* again 
though one is quite conscious of the difficulties under which Indian 
archaeology has had to labour, particularly due to paucity of 
.funds and me* n, and the vastness of the area involved, still one 
.cannot but regret Ihat, while in the beginning of the 20th century 
the IndiaO Archaeological Department was the envy of other 
East Indies apd Jndo^China, ’the subsequent 
Jiistory of Archaeology has tended to throw India more and more 


IN RELATION TO INDIAN HISTORY 


59 


into the shade. In Java and Indo-China, striking work has been 
.done which will serve as a model for much ’that may be done if 
we had men and resources here. If you look at the pictures of 
many a Javanese monument before archaeological restoration and 
after it, you will be struck by the great care and thoroughness with 
which' the work has been carried out, and also by the very great 
ingenuity of it all. Of course, there is n6 comparison between the 
problems of a small island like Java and those of a vast sub- 
continent like India. But still with regard to methods of work, 
there is, it seems much to learn. It must be mentioned, however, 
that one school of archaeologists followed by the Indian department 
are opposed to all restoration (‘anastylose 9 as the French school 

• of Hanoi' calls it) but are keen only on conservation* 

South Indian Archaeology, in particular, has formed the 
study of only one separate monograph — Prof. DubreuiPs brilliant 
work Archaeologie du sud de lUnde (2 Vols. Musee Guimet, Paris) . 
'That was ah excellent beginning, there is much that remains to 
be done by way of amplifying and completing that brilliant sketch 
of South Indian Archaeology. The South Indian temple must be 
put at the centre of these archaeological studies* and we shall need 
many monographs, each specifically devoted to one celebrated 
temple. Here again the .Dutch Archaeological Department of 
Java furnishes the model. Now these separate monographs on 
different temples will have to be written and i written with care 
and discernment before we can attempt the general study of the 
rise and growth of the temple; and its place as a religious and 
social institution in South India. “ > j - 

We have had very superficial and sketchy attempts to derive 
the Sikhara from the Stupa or to derive the temple from funerary 
: monuments. There may be truth’ in these suggestions, but they 
are not more than mere suggestions at the moment, because no 
attempt has been made at a critical and systematic study of the 

• data available. The relations between the King’s palace and the* 

• God’s temple ib South India again is another topic* which will 

have to be studied in some detail with equal caution and judge- 
rment. , .i •• '/ ■ 

Archaeological momimen ts may be classified In different ways, 
and each method has its own advantages. Audi our knowledge is 
mot yet sufficiently precise to enable us to adhere always to any 
tone mode. Sometimes you will find monuments classified by the 


60 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


dynasties ;’we hear often of the Hoysala type, the Chalukya type • 
or the Pallava type ; also by locality — the South Indian style or ' 
the North Indian style. These are very vague- designations not 
quite clearly defiped or critically studied. Monuments are also 
grouped by their dates ; ancient, medieval, and modern are very 
broad divisions. There is also a theoretical classification known 
to books, on Indian architecture such as Nagara, Vesara and- 
Dravida., But a little attempt to use these terms in relation to 
known monuments will show very striking differences between 
theory and practice. It is not often possible to carry-out any 
Aguiar classification of known temples from the theoretical grouping 
of our Agamas. And no standard line of treatment of South 
Indian monuments has , yet been evolved. Hints towards such a 
treatment, will be found in the pages of DubreUiPs book mentioned . 
above which unfortunately has been translated into English only 
in parts.,: One chapter' of the first part has been translated under 
the title ‘Pravidian Architecture, 5 and the second part has appeared - 
in an English version- under the title ‘ Iconography of Southern 
India.’ , , - i : • ;• . ...... 

Archaeological evidence has sometimes a very great value in 
deciding problems of affinity and spread of cultural influences. - 
Take Amaravati Buddhist Art for instance. That is a very well - 
known school of Art with unmistakable characteristics of its own. < 
But these characteristics, or some of them, it shares with Gandharan 
art, though there, are also some striking differences between the * 
two, And the real explanation of these common characteristics • 
lies in the operation of similar influences of foreign origin upon 
Indian art in these areas. Gandhara was exposed to Greco-Roman 
influences across Persia and Bactria in the post- Alexandrian period. 
Likewise the east coast of South India was exposed to Greco-Roman 
influence by . the channels of maritime trade along the Red Sea, 
the Arabian sea and round Gape Comorin. To seek to belittle 
these influences is as much a mistake as to exaggerate their impor- 
tance. And the data are not wanting for a very proper and - 
accurate ? assessment of the extent of : this , foreign influence in the 
South and in the East.

"Indies. In a hillock called Bukit Segun tang near Palembang some 
parts of this image were dug out several years ago. More recently 
a further excavation resulted in the discovery of other parts of it* 
and by patiently piecing them together, Perkin, an archaeological 
engineer, succeeded in reconstructing the body of the image, but 
the head was still missing ; and only about 1937-B it struck a 
scholar,. Schnitgcr, that one of the heads with which he was very 
familial' at the Batavia Museum for over thirty years might belong 
to the image, and. this turned out correct. There are other 
instances like this. Now this image stands in Sumatra. The striking 
similarity of this image with some of the images of Gandharan 
art is so great that at one time Sumatran and Javanese papers 
began discussing actively how this, Greco-Roman influence got to 
Sumatra, and the explanation was sought in popular stories current 
in Sumatra that Alexander had actually invaded Sumatra, and 
some, more scientifically minded were inclined to maintain that, 
if it was not Alexander, it Was some commander of his that must 
have sailed across the Indian Ocean. The truth however seems 
to be that either that /image was brought in Sumatra by Hindu 
settlers from the Telugu country or what, considering the material, 
is even more probable, because the stone out of which the image 
is made is not found in Sumatra, it was imported from somewhere 
near Amaravati ; it must.be a very early image indeed because 
the hey day of Amaravati Art comes to an end by the 3rd or 4th 
century A. D. at the latests And if you want additional confirmation 
of this view you do nof lack it. Because there is a bronze image

South Indian Influence in the East, and deserves to be studied in. 
detail. We do not mean that there was no North Indian Influence 
but South Indian influences were earlier, and they were stronger 
and more continuous. North Indian influences come in rather 
late and are not quite so steady, and that is quite intelligible. 
After all South India is nearer these lands. The Pallava and 
early Chola temples of South India are clearly reproduced among 
the early Chandis of Java, and the later Chola monuments like our 
big . temples of Tanjore and Gangaikonda-Cholapuram are 
parallelled and excelled in the art of Angkor Vat in Cambodia. 
In fact the architectural development of South India and. 
of the Eastern colonies may be said to have a parallel history 
which has not yet been worked out in such detail as it deserves 
to be. , - *• ; 

If you turfl to South Indian Sculpture in particular, you will, 
find that there are few portraits of persons ; there are some Pallava 
portrait sculptures with names inscribed above the figures, especially 
at Mamallapuram- i Thete are some; Chola stone sculptures and 
bronzes which axe not quite portraits perhaps, but not quite icons 
either. And there are late; sculptures of a quasi-portrait character, 
coming from the Vijayanagara days, and from those of the Nayaks 
and their families,, which you find in the different temples of 
South India renovated by these Nayaks. There are old knages 
here and there popularly described to be this persbn or that ; for 
instance* one very huge stone image is called Kamban, it is not 
known with what reason, in Srirangam ; but of the authenticity 
of such namings one cannot be too critical. On the whole for a 
cotmtiw which made such an advance in the art of sculpture, the" 
number of portrait images is not so many as one would expect.- 
Of course one should not forget such examples as are found in the 
Tirupati temple of the images of Kxishnadevaraya and his queens- 
and of Venkatapati Devaraya or a fairly curious image in the 
Nandi temple Which is there called Chola pratima by the local 


But the growth of sculpture is illustrated more by icons,, 
images of gods and goddesses in stone and metal, meant for worship 
and sometimes for ornament also. These images, it seems, have 
life arid realism* and are less overlaid with symbolism and- 
mmm^Qw in the early stages of South Indian Art than in the later. 
TheMne may be drawn some where about 1100 or so. ’The later

images show a tendency to become stiffen, more and more the* 
products of an orthodox adherence to text book rules. There is- 
less freedom for the artist, less inventiveness coming into play, 
and an increasing rigidity in the form and expression. This is 
perhaps true of almost any Fine Art, at least in India, that it 
starts very well and attains some freedom ; then technical treatises 
begin to grow ; the growth of the treatises from the old and the 
good works of art seems to be a good feature, but it is the presence 
of these treatises that begins to do harm to the art at a later stage. 
One is reminded of William James’s remark that the greatest 
enemy of a subject is its Professor. 

We must not forget that there are fine sculptural panels 
large groupings of figures, very cleverly done, sometimes under 
very strikingly simple but effective conventions, which adoni the 
walls of our numerous temples. The sculptors of the Buddhist 
monuments at Amaravati, Barabudur in Java etc., found their 
themes in the Jataka stories of the past lives of the Buddha. Budr- 
dhist sculptures are not altogether absent even from South Indian 
Hindu temples. * The Tanjore temple contains sculptures of the 
Buddha in the process of the attaining of wisdom and of the worship 
of the tree of knowledge. But more common in Hindu temples 
are scenes from the epics and the Bhagavata, Periyapuranam and* 
other edifying works. The cosmic significance of Bhagiratha’s 
penance is strikingly brought out in sculpture on an extensive rock 
face in Mahabalipuram (Mamall&p uram) . Some Choi a monu-* 


ments .like the temples at Tiruvalur and Tribhuvanam proclaim 
their characteristic Ghola nature by the carving on stone of the 
story of Maim executing justice on his son, the son being thrown 
under the wheels of a chariot because he accidentally caused the 
death of a calf in that manner . A beautiful little temple at Amrita-- 
pura in Mysore contains a large number of sculptured scenes on 


There is again that singular freak, very interesting in its result, of a 
rebellious chieftan of South Arcot who put up in the Chidambaram 
temple sculptured pannels of all the poses and dances . described 
in a celebrated chapter in Bharata’s Maiymastra with the correspond

-to good use on account of the fact that these temples proclaim 
-their history by the inscriptions on their walls. The amount of 
.dated material for the study of the social life of South India has not 
yet been adequately realised or exploited. 

Epigraphy

logical evidence that the student of Indian History has to 
.deal with, Epigraphy f The number of scripts in which South 
Indian Inscriptions are written- in somewhat staggering, and for 
any one to work in- the field of South Indian epigraphy, a good

work. It takes quite a lot of time and trouble for the beginner 
-to know where a thing is to be found ; of course, it is true that 
"bibliographies can be used successfully only when you have gained 
a certain acquaintance with your subject ; but then, you soon reach 
ra stage when you mi$s very much the invaluable help you could 
.derive from well arranged bibliographies and indexes, for tracking 
your subject through a mass of material accumulated by several 
.decades of exploration and research. Taking the 28 volumes of 
the Epigraphica Indica, the half century and more of the Epi- 
graphy reports of Madras, and those of Mysore and Travancore 
and Hyderabad, there was till recently no publication which 
provided an index to these or classified the materials they contain. 
"The only thing we had in that line was Rangachari’s Topographical 
Mst and that stops with 1915. Since 1915 there has been a most 
active campaign for collecting epigraphs which has been very 
•fruitful indeed. KielhonTs list of Southern Inscriptions, still very 
useful so far as it goes is now rather antiquated and deserves to 
'be brought up to date. Sewell's Historical Inscriptions of Southern 
Jtidia , again useful in its way because it gives a minimum of fairly 
well-ordered references on each important occurrence, is yet no 
substitute for a complete hand-book such as a revised edition of 
JCielhorn’s list would make. Mention must be made of Dr. 
D.R. Bhandarkar’s List of N. Indian Brahmi inscriptions — a very 
Handy aid for the period it covers. There is also Luder’s List of 
.early Brahmi Records and now the two Indexes, Topographical 
and Subject to the Annual Reports on S. Indian epigraphy. 
But above All, the publication of texts must be speeded up. 

„ After the first three volumes of the South Indian Inscriptions 
'excellently edited by Hultzsch, Venkayya, and Krishnasastry, 
we have been treated to most unhandy volumes that fail to 
•give ariy assistance to the student and make his task unduly

further volumes are a further improvement on these as they

these inscritpions from South India as Tamil written in BrahmS 
have not proved altogether convincing. Asoka’s inscriptions are 
found in two or three places, one set of the minor rock edicts in 
and near SidcLhapura, Mysore, and the 14 Rock Edicts a copy of’ 
the minor Rock Edict in the region of Erragudi and Gooty and a 
copy of the Minor Rock Edict discovered near Cuddapah in 1954,. 
marking the limit of Asoka’s Empire in the South. The records 
found in Maski and elsewhere in Hyderabad are also well known. 
The long and regular series of inscriptions belonging to different 
dynasties cannot be dealt with in any detail here. But a few 
instances of some of the very crucial inscriptions which furnish 
* definite evidence of very interesting cultural contacts may be 
noted. Take the Yupa Inscriptions of Mulavarman of Borneo. 
Here in what is, at the moment, a distant non-Hindu country,, 
you have a number of stone inscriptions — seven of them, written 
in early Pallava script of the close of the 4th’ or early 5th century 
A.D. They show that a king Mulavarman by name, performed. 
Vedic sacrifices, made go-danas and gave dakshinas to Brahmins, 
surely a very interesting set of records. These inscriptions bear 
an unmistakable testimony to the early spread of South Indian 
colonies in the east, and they do not; stand alone., , There is another 
record in Champa, in Indo-China, known as the Vocanh record.- 
It is about half a century or so earlier than the Yupa Inscriptions;, 
and there are inscriptions from Western Java in the same script in. 
a somewhat later form commemorating the rule of Purnavarman 
of Taruma. Now all these records are very near in point of time 
to the Yupa Inscriptions. And this evidence we have to take 
into account ; along with other archaeological evidence 
sculptures. They all fit in very well with one another. Some- 
time later we have a Tamil inscription from Takua-Pa ; we, have 
reason to think that the inscription definitely belongs to the 9th . 
century. It says that there were a Vishnu temple and a tank and- 
a set of people appointed for the special protection of these, and- 
it also contains the name Avani Narayana celebrated in Pallava 
history as a surname of Nandi Varman III. It also mentions the 
mmigramam, a mercantile association, and the script is Tamil 
characteristic of the 9th century. In another fragment, also in'. 
1Famd, : from Sumatra is mentioned another mercantile association 
nm^mu^nnummr 9 and it is dated in Saka 1010. In all* 
these ways you find that epigraphy is able to furnish most definite

and conclusive evidence of very interesting cultural contacts. In 
this sense epigraphy is the most important source of Indian history. 

Epigraphical evidence, however, is not always as definite or 
as conclusive as one would wish. Conflicting evidence is often 
quite common, especially when we compare data upon any one 
event drawn from inscriptions of different dynasties. We have 
only too many instances, when we come to political transactions, 
in South India, of both parties in a fight claiming victory. It is 
rthe proper task of historical criticism to solve these conflicts and 
jreach probable conclusions. 

The most important class of South Indian Inscriptions is that 
of the stone inscriptions, Their value as evidence is much higher 
than that of any other class of inscriptions because of the material 
on which they are engraved. There are generally very few chances 
of these inscriptions becoming faded. You can always fix the 
age of an inscription from its script, and if there is one thing of which 
epigraphists are sure, it is the relative chronology, of authentic 
inscriptions. It means; that inscriptions which are not authentic 
are easily found out. The evolution of the Brahmi script through 
various stages, and of the other scripts, from time to time, has 
been traced carefully and with sufficient precision for us to be able 
,to decide the chronology of an inscription within a century or even 
less of its true date. Therefore, we cannot but regret the numerous 
instances of the most* thoughtless . desl^tion of the stone inscrip- 
tions of South India in a large number of temple renovations* 
^eyeral centuries $go a vain Tandyaa Emperor was foolish enough 
to think, that; the recording of a petty little grant which he made 
of some lambs and. sheep, to a temple was much more important 
than the Svarajatis of what should have been at first a sister record 
to the famous Kudumiyamalai musical inscription of the seventh or 
eighth century A.D. As a matter of fact, one cannot imagine how 
this happened, because the old Pallava script is in istelf a most 
attractive' piece of ornament. ; In fact the ornamental character 
.of epigraphy on stbne is very pronounced in the Pallava period,, 
and continues to be equally pronounced till late in the Chola 
period. If you go to Tanjore you should study the chiselling of 
the inscriptions on the mouldings of the tremendous basement of 
the Great Temple. In fact it is one of the Wonders of the World, 
ftfote also ; the impression which the inscriptions put upon the 
pillars on the peristyle of the temple make. Try to imagine these. 


68 


HISTdRIGAL METHOD 


pillars without the lettering and you will see a tiresome sameness 
about them. But with these letters somehow the whole group 
becomes more interesting ; and in out of the way places like Tiru-* 
veitkadu, and Punjai, in the Tanjore District, the Sfbfte masons 
have been at great pains to study the distributioft of the inscriptions 
on the walls of the temples with a view to adorftiftg the blank 
•spaces on the walls of the temples in a symmetrical fashion. The 
stone masons of old who did thi& work did it with great love and 
as a work of art. We find even long after the establishment of 
an archaeological department entrusted with the carO of ancient 
monuments, renovations of temples are allowed to take place with 
absolutely no regard for the epigrapbical loss that is sustained in 
the process. We cari only say that this foi'USb change and one is 
glad to find an increasing solicitude being shown for monuments ; 
but much mischief has been done already, many inscriptions 
have been destroyed beyond repair. Inscribed stones hUVe Been 
dressed to look new and all the lettering has disappeared. And 
the modern vandalism which is paralleled by that of at least one 
Pandyan King of old, staftds in striking contrast td the several 
instances of the scrupulous care which was taken to preserve 
inscriptions on other occasions by mediaeval monarches. One 
need not detail here the actual instances kftBWin There are at 
least half a dozen or' mote of recorded examples 1 !ft Which the 
renovator of a temple, usually a Chola Or Pandyaft monarch or a 
feudatory of his, says that the inscriptions oft the old walls of the 
temples were at first faithfully copied ift a book before the temple 
was demolished , and theft after it was reconstructed* the inscriptions 
•were recopied on the walls of the new temple. And this is borne 
/Out by the fact that we have at number of felith Indian Inscriptions 
which belong to the mediaeval period By fectipt* but the 
contents of which go back to a much earlidr time; But one canftot 
commend die process in itself oi suggest its adoption to-day* For 
it is not very satisfactory, and students of manuscripts know how 
scribal error often vitiates documents and sometimes totally obscures 
the meaning. Considering the nattire of the matter and the 
antiquity of the script, we cannot but Suspect that something Was 
Tost^ that the; originals were not always read accurately, and in 
factiS some casds th6fe is a frank confession, that because the old 
writing was in Vatteluttu, it was not possible to preserve some of 
the inscriptions as already no one could read the script properly* 


IN RELATION TO INDIAN HISTORY 


69 


But, after all these losses we are still lucky in being left with such 
great lot of inscriptions as we do now possess, for without these 
inscriptions South Indian History must have remained a sealed 
book. It may be said in passing that the stone inscriptions of the 
Ceded Districts, especially in their more inaccessible parts, have 
not yet been. collected as systematically as elsewhere ; and speaking 
generally, the epigraphy department should make an intensive 
effort to push on and complete the epigraphic survey of each taluk 
that was undertaken with some enthusiasm some years ago, but 
obviously this >vould require a considerable strengthening of the 
staff in the department if the survey is to be completed in a 
measurable time. 

The Tirumukkudal inscription of Virarajendra endowing a 
college and a hospital among other things, and the much later 
Marathi inscription of Tanjore of SarfojTs time take rank easily 
among the longest stone inscriptions of the world. 

We may iioy? leave stone inscriptions and pass on to the 
next important class, viz., inscriptions on copper plates. Copper 
plates are not of .course so difficult to forge as stone inscriptions 
are and a number of forged copper plates are known ; but here 
again a trained epigraphist has little difficulty in most cases in 
discovering the genuine from the spurious, and one has to say 
that, on the whole, cqpper plates seem to have fallen under a 
greater measure of suspipiqn than really should attach to’ them* 
One of the .ablest epigraphists that worked in the field of Indian 
f!istory, Jf J> Fleet, was inclined to reject a great, mass of the early 
Ganga records from Mysore as bare-faced forgeries. The authority 
that Fleet’s word carried in the world of Indian epigraphy and 
history has been so great that not all the efforts of successive 
Directors of Archaeology in Mysore to turn the current against 
I’le.et’s opinion hqye completely succeeded in undoing the mischief 
of Fleet’s original findings. Ifitt when ye^r after year the Mysore, 
epigraphy department succeeds in bringing p, light qne copper- 
plate after' another crying on the face of it every trace of authen- 
ticity, aa^d these inscriptions are : dated or datable in t^e .early 
centuries of the .Christian era, the 5th pr 6th century, it becomes 
difficult -tq resist the ; qqncluslpn that at leas t some of the plates 
that - Fleqt rejected forgeries deserve reconsideration . In, some 
•c$ses he was obviously right, for instance in the case of a record 
dated in 169 Saka Era. 


70 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


There is much genuine material in early copper plates and 
even in mediaeval ones. Until we come almost to the close of 
Vijayanagara period, copper plates are very important sources of 
information and very recently we have come across evidence of 
what one might call the archival practice in the middle ages among 
the Ghola officials. This is a very definite datum from which we 
can conclude that the copper plates as well as stone records were 
copied out from a common original preserved in the chancery of 
the Palace, if one may so put it. The Kanyakumari stone inscrip- 
tion of Vira Rajendra has long long been known to scholars. Its 
Sanskrit part is a poem, almost a Kavya in itself ; and, recently a 
copper plate of the same king has been recovered. The errors 
in the stone inscription are repeated in the copper plate, sure 
proof of a common source for both the copies ; these copper 
plates were discovered at Charala in the Chittoor district. 

Generally we know the names of composers of these Prasastis , 
but it is seldom that we have such duplicates among stone inscrip- 
tions and copper plates-. Very often, especially for very early 
history, copper plates are either the only source or the only tolerably 
full source of our knowledge of historical events. Early Pandyan 
history and early Pallava history would have Remained entirely 
unknown but for the presence of a fair number of authentic copper 
plates. The Velvikudi and Sinnamanur copper plates are almost 
the only source for early Pandyan history. 

Our smritis lay down the rule that a tamra sasana may be made 
on the occasion of a grant by a king. They have not thought of 
any other material, and all the great South Indian monarchs were 
-Content with copper as the material on which to engrave theit 
grants ; but as the kingdoms became smaller and the kings’ real 
power diminished, their vanity seems to have grown, and more 
oostly material came to be used, Silver plates and some times gold 
plates ; but as the Value of the writing material increased, the value 
of gift itself went more than proportionately lower. And in the 
Dutch charters relating to Nagapatam, Pulicat, Cochin, Tuticorin 
and other places you have often definite statements saying that 
copies were made on paper and silver, the former in Dutch and 
#fce latter in the Indian languages Concerned. There were three 
parties to a treaty of Cochin in 1663. That treaty concludes with 
the statement that the six copies of the treaty should be written, 
three in Malayalam and three in Dutch, the Dutch copies on 



IN RELATION TO INDIAN HISTORY 


71 


■paper, the Malayalam ones on silver olas, and one copy each of 
the Malayalam and Dutch versions would be [deposited with each 
party. Gold was used early for small inscriptions of votive 
"Mantras, Chaltrams etc., to be put along with relics in Buddhist 
stupas . Several early Buddhist inscriptions from Burma of about 
the 5th century are also found engraved on gold and in South 
Indian Characters. The Taxila silver scroll is another case' of a 
more precious metal than copper being employed in early times. 
'That again comes from a stupa . Recently two silver plates relating 
to Negapatam, one in Telugu by the lastNayaka ruler of Tanjore, 
and the other in Tamil by the Maratha conqueror that followed 
were edited recently in the journal of the Batavian Society of Arts 
and Science (T.B.G.). 

The next class of inscriptions is much shorter being inscrip- 
tions on coins and images. Inscriptions on coins are not of 
particularly great value in South Indian history ; but we should 
;not forget that it was inscriptions on coins that at the beginning 
•of the modern study of Indian history yielded a clue to Indian 
Palaeography at the hands of James Prinsep, the mint-mas^br of 
Calcutta in the middle of 19th Century. Prinsep came across 
.digraphic inscriptions on coins, one and the same inscription being 
given in two scripts, in Greek and Brahmi, and that was how the 
■value of Brahmi letters came first to be discovered. For the history 
•of Indo-Greek sovereigns the evidence of inscribed coins is of 
.inestimable Value, for without these coins, the history of these 
.monarchs would have remained unknown ; inscribed coins kre of 
-considerable value also for the history of the Kushanas, the Guptas, 
’the Western Satraps and other dynasties. But more useful and 
more important to the history of South Indian Art is the class of 
’inscriptions found on our metallic images, because the palaeography 
of inscriptions is of very great value with regard to inscribed metal 
images as there is no other way available of judging the age of 
these images ; the inscriptions of known images in South India 
have not been studied as completely and as carefully as they deserve 
-to be and without such a careful study the history of the art of 
bronze-casting in South India must remain imperfect. 

One does not wish to create the impression that everything 
that is contained in inscriptions is gospel truth or must be accepted 
by a historian as such. There are legendary genealogies without 
dumber in inscriptions. We cannot accept them as history because' 


72 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


they happen to be put upon copperplates or stone. There are 
solemn recitations of ancient grants by Trinetra Kings. Then you 
have the famous formula in Telugu-Choda copper plates which 
thereby crystallised the legend of Karikala Chola putting out the 
third eye of Trinetra Pallava who refused to aid him in raising the 
embankment on the sides of the Kaveri to control the destructive 
floods of that great river. That again comes from copperplates. 
And sometimes these copperplates are treacherouSj as they in- 
corporate legend in a form which is intriguing indeed. There is 
one verse in the Tiruvalangadu plates which seems to be a perfectly 
clear play upon proper names, but of which the true significance- 
was missed for several years by every one who had discussed it. 

That is a verse relating to Rajaraja I. The literal meaning 
of it is ‘ Because Bhima, skilled in battle, killed with a club my 
name sake Rajaraja, therefore shall I go and fall upon this strong 
Andhra ruler Bhima by name. And saying this Rajaraja fell 
upon him. 1 From this we were led to believe that there was a'- 
Rajaraja in the Teiugu country, that a Bhima had invaded his. 
territory and killed him and that Rajaraja Chola went to avenge 
the death of Rajaraja, the Teiugu king, who was thus disposed of 
by Teiugu Bhima. And the search for this otherwise unknown 
Rajaraja went on for some years, but to no purpose. In fact the 
verse means only this. ‘ I killed him because of his name Bhima. 
Why ? For the: answer you must think of the Mahabharata ; you. 
must also remember that Duryodhana was also called Rajaraja.. 
It simply means that Bhima (the Teiugu king) and Rajaraja 
Chola were born enemies, and this idea is sought to be conveyed, 
by a play upon the names celebrated in legend. So you cannot 
be too careful in dealing with such stuff. 

There is much poetry and literary enjoyment in the inscrip- 
tions of South India, and no historian of the literatures of South 
India can afford to neglect the inscriptions ; for his work would, 
be incomplete unless he takes into account all the numerous* 
Kavyas that constitute an important chapter in the history of 
literature in each of these languages. In Kannada and Teiugu 
the earliest literature is , to be recovered exclusively from mscripn 
tions, and even long after purely literary works come into promi- 
nence, some of the inscriptions still stand very good comparisons 
with them. These inscriptions werewritten by the very mew ; 
who were the makers of the literature of the country. The greatest

73? 


poets of the laud were attached to courts and they were often- 
called upon to compose these inscriptions. 

Bufiler wrote a celebrated essay on 4 Literature in Inscriptions r 
and established the continuity of literary tradition in Sanskrit 
demonstrating the falsity of the theory of the Renaissance off 
Sanskrit literature which held the field till then. Similar studies 
can be undertaken of the literary value of the inscriptions . in 
Tamil* Telugu and Kannada. 

Numismatics 

From Epigraphy, let us pass on to Numismatics. Numismatics 
is the science which treats of coins. Numismatics, like epigraphy, 
forms an important source of material for the reconstruction of 
ancient Indian history. In other words, it helps us to construct 
history and not merely to corroborate it. < Many thousands of 
coins have come to light. Hoards have been discovered in different 
parts of the country. Considerable advance has been made since 
the days , of Cunningham in the lines of the preparation of scientific 
catalogues of these boards. Among notable works on the subject 
may be mentioned John Allan’s Catalogue of the Coins of Ancient 
India (in the British Museum), London 1936 ; Catalogue of the Gains

-problems elaborately. The punch marked coins have been 
systematically and thoroughly studied independently by a band of 
'Numismatists like D.D. Kosambi, Durga Prasad, E.H.C. Walsh in 
the pages of the Journal of the Numismatic Supplement, Journal 
ofthe Bihar and Orissa Research Society, Journal of the Numismatic 
.Society of India, Bombay and other learned periodicals* South 
Indian Numismatics has not received as much attention and care 
at the hands of scholars as that of the North. Elliot’s Coins of South 
Jndia (1886) is almost the only book which aims at a systematic 
account of the coinage of South India. After this publication, 
.new hoards of coins have been unearthed in Chandravalli, Arika- 
. medu, Chitaldoorg and other places. A scientific catalogue of 
these new discoveries on thfe lines of Allan and E.J. Rapson is a 
great desideratum. Here we may point out the pioneer attempts 
of some Numismatists on this line. Robert Sewell has made an 
. excellentstudy of ancient Roman Coins in the Journal of the Royal 
Asiatic Society for the year 1904 ; more recently in the Ancient 
. India No, 2 for the year 1946, we have an excellent appendix which 
contains an up-to-date bibliography on the identified Roman Coins 
found in India and Ceylon. - T. Desikachari’s South Indian- Coins, 

' Codrington — Coins of Ancient Ceylon , Mtokzx-^-Bayance Hoard (1954:), 
may also be mentioned in this connection. C. J. Brown’s The Coins 
of India (1922) is the only general book on Indian Numismatic 
study which satisfies the needs of the general reader. The author 
has achieved two objects in the book (1) to describe the evolution 
of Indian Coinage, (2) to show its importance as a source of 
history or as a commentary upon political, economic and social 
movements. The Indian Numismatic Society (Bombay) also has 
been doing yeoman service by publishing new catalogues of coins. 

The importance of Numismatics for the study of the political 
and economic condition of a country is too obvious to need elabora- 
tion. Here we shall cite only a few instances. Let us take political 
.history first. For the history of some early foreign dynasties, we 
.have no other evidence than that from coins. In the annals of 
^Ancient Indian History, we generally read that after the disintegra- 
tion of the Mauryan empire* the Greeks, Partho-Seythians, and 
^ue-Chi orKushans entered India, founded colonies, and established 
: states some of which were long lived. The empire of the, satraps 
of Ujjain lasted till the fourth century A.D* j what is more, the 
rinvaders were. assimilated by the indigenous population, and the

'"barbarians became Hindus. Sanskrit flourished and the theatre 
developed new features even if did not take its rise in the court of 
the Scythian Satraps. The Graeco-Buddhist art of Gandhara was 
born out of the mingling of Greeks and Hindus and produced 
■ distant effects reaching as far as Amaravati and even beyond the 
seas. The details of the history of this fascinating period bristle 
with difficult problems. The evidence is mostly mimismatic, and 
the coins reveal the names of over fifty rulers of foreign extraction. 
It is their coins which not only give us their names but also enable 
us to fix their order of succession,. As in the case of Indo-Bactrian 
‘Greek princes, many names of the Kshatrapa rulers have been 
revealed by their coins, which, again as they give the name and 
title not only of the ruler but also of his father, and what is most 
important, specify dates, enable us to arrange them in their order 
of succession and often to determine even the exact year in which 
one Kshatrapa ruler was succeeded by another. 

The study of the coins also enables us to know something about 
the personality- and personal accomplishments of the sovereigns. 
"The Tiger-slayer type of Samudragupta exhibit him in Indian 
dress, slaying a tiger. The Lyrist type also' depicts him in Indian 
dress, sitting cross legged, playing on the Vim } on the obverse, and 
Xaxmi on the reverse. It is only through his Asvamedka type of 
coin that we come to know that he performed this imperial sacrifice, 
a fact which is not disclosed in any of his contemporary inscriptions 
.or literature. 

A proper study- of coins also, helps us to know something 
.about the Administrative History of India. The coins, issued by 
-the Malvas, Yaudheyas and Vrishnis, shed a welcome light on 
their Republican form of Government. The coins of these non- 
rmonarchical states confirm arid corroborate the facts that we get 
;in Indian literature and inscriptions. * * , ■' 

The study of the coins again comes to the aid of the historian 
-in locating the place of some of the local tribes of Ancient India. 
YVe know that the Yaudheyas were an oligarchic tribe and find 
mumerous references to them in inscriptions and literature. But 
the problem is, where are they to be located ? This can easily 
"be fixed by the provenance of their coins. We kndw that their 
■coins have been found in the Eastern Punjab and all over the 
■country between the Sutlej and Jumna rivers . It is this knowledge 
tthat enabled numismatists like Cunningham and others to locate 


76 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


the place of the Yaudheyas with the Johiyas settled along the' 
banks of the Sutlej in the region which is known as Johiya-bar. 
Likewise, on the basis of the finds of the coins the locality of the 
Malavas has been fixed in the regions of Central India. It is 
again through coins that the Madhyamika city has been identified 
with Nagari near Chitorgarh, which also contains the ruins of a 
large town. 

Ancient Indian Numismatics has contributed a lot towards 
the reconstruction of the Religious History of India. The fact 
that the foreign dynasties like Indo-Parthians, Indo-Bactrians and 
Kshatrapas adopted Hinduism and fostered it, has been disclosed 
only by a proper study of their coins and coin-symbols. Gondo- 
phares, the founder of the Indo-Parthian dynasty, has one type of 
coins on the reverse of which figures Siva holding a trident. 
Similarly on some of the coins of the Kushana King Wema- 
Kadphises, we find Siva bearing a trident, sometimes with his 
bull Nandin behind and sometimes with gourd and tiger skin. 
Besides being a useful source of knowledge for the religious history 
of India, the study of Ancient Indian coins throws a welcome light 
pn the antiquity of Hindu iconography, and the practice of image 
worship ; J.N. Banerji has well discussed the aid of numismatics 
towards the Study of Hindu Iconography in his scholarly book 
The Development of Hindis Iconography (1941). 

Lastly, numismatic study offers useful clues to the economic 
conditions of Ancient India. It also sheds a welcome light on 
ancient trade and commerce. The pure gold coins of the Imperial 
Quptas reveal in unmistakable terms the economic prosperity and 
wealth of the country as far back §s 4th and 5th cent. A.D. The 
debased currency of the later Guptas of the 6th century shows 
again the economic depression and instability of government 
caused by Hun inroads and other causes at the time. Thus a 
thorough study and comparison of weights and fineness of coins 
of different times show us in an unmistakable way the changes in 
fhe economic condition of the country. This is largely true in 
t|ie case of India also. The Roman coins found in South India 
are helpful to the study of Indo-Roman commercial relations in 
^ wly? cenftr^^f .the ..Christian era. • 

These facts naturally lead us to consider the problem of the 
antiquity of coinage in Ancient India. Contemporary archaeo-* 
logical and literary sources fully prpye that various types of coins*

-were current in different parts of the country even before Alexander’s 
.entry into India. The Vedic Mishka , Satamana and Suvarna may 
have been ingots of gold of definite weights. But in later works 
-such as the Jatakas, the Grammar of Panini and the Arthasastra 
of Kautilya, we have some references to gold coins called Mishka 
.and Suvarna, silver coins called Karshapanas along with their multiples 
and subdivisions. The vedic Satamana , as its name implies, was 
based on the mana unit, a weight known to the Rig Veda . But 
the evidence of the law books and even of Kautilya is by no means 
clear or cbnsistent on the weight and fineness of: the statidard 
coins or oh their relation to token currency. It has been observed 
■that silver and copper coinages were often independent of each 
other, and differed with areas of circulation. There seems to be 
.no way of assessing the effects on currency of the attempts of the 
[Nandas to standardize weights and measures or of th 6 establish- 
ment of the Mauryan erhpire. The punch-marked silver coins 
that have been found in large numbers all over Iridia have 
generally been identified with the silver Karshapanas , dharanas, 
or pur anas (eldtings) as they have been variously called in legal 
literature. These coins bear on their surface, usually on one side, 
•separate marks made at different times by different punches; 
Specimens in copper are not unknown, though rare. They are 
usually square or oblong, seldom circular. The marks * hill and 
orescent 5 and ‘ peacock 5 have generally been recognized as 
peculiar to the Mauryan epoch j other 1 marks are earlier and 
might well go back to the early fourth century if hot the 

fifth. ' The king of Taxila is said to have presented Alexander 
with thirty talents of coined silver. These coins hre indigenous in 
origin according to the opinion of many numismatists-. V.A* 
Smith observes, * the punch-marked coinage was a private coinage 
issued by guilds and silver smiths with the permission of the ruling 
powers 5 (GvCvI.MvL p. 133) . But systematic Studied of the eohl^ 
hoards, and their provenances have led scholars td suggest that 
they . were shriek ' by : a ceritral > authority* 1 1 Ik®! Spooner 'and 
Walsh told the same view. ^ ■ '*/ ^

though devices like the bull and the elephant are Indian. But 
the Mitra coins of the second and first century B.C. with the names 
of ten kings (Sunga) in Brahmi script and the Mathura coins with 
twelve royal names, though double-die-struck, are free from foreign 
influence- The coins of Malwa illustrate the transition from 
punch-marked to the die-struck coinage. Thus a system of coinage 
originated in India and evolved on indigenous lines till Greek 
contact in the second century B.C. and the following centuries 
improved and enriched it- 5 (The. Coins of India > Chapter I.) 

. The coinage of India was improved in the succeeding epochs 
under the influence of the artistic currencies of the Greeks and 
the Romans.:? The Greeks coins in India have disclosed to us the 
names of more tton thirty rules, most of them unknown to other 
sources, of History. 1 Their characteristic' features are portrait-* 
heads and bilinguial legends $ most of them are circular and 
conform to the Persian* or Indian standard of weight. ; There is 
little doubt thatthe services of the very best artists of Bactria were ■ 
made use of in the drawing of the many individualistic portraits* 
bf the. earlier .monarchSv BuAydemus, Demetrius, Euctratides and* 

Others, and the skill, of the finished work still ranks these heads- i 
with the finest ever made.. Gardner rightly oberves : 4 The 
portraits of Demetrius, of Antimachus, and of Eucratides are 
among the.most remarkable * which have corrie down to us from 
antiquity* and the effect of them is heightened in each case by the 
introduction of a peculiar and strongly characteristic head-dress * 
which is rendered with /scrupulous exactness of detail. 9 ( The coins

Hmvishka* Demetrius struck copper coins with legends in two

respectively. Eucratides imitated him and issued silver and , ^ 
copper coins, and one of his copper coins contains the figure of

portraits^ on the obverse are so clear that we can gain some idea-

of the personality of the Indo-Greek kings. Devices on the reverse 
include animals like the elephant and the bull. The Hellenistic 
influences of Bactrian coinage were gradually replaced by the 
introduction of Indian elements. /It shows that c The engravers* 
were no mere slavish copyists of western models, but were giving 
free and spontaneous expression to their own ideas. ’ ( Cambridge 
History of India, Vol. I p. 645). , 

The copper coins of Maues show Greek gods and goddesses 
and the elephants head in imitation of & certain coin of Demetrius 
on one coin, he is seated on horse back ; this; striking device is* 
characteristic both of the Saka and Palhava coinage. Silver coins 
of Azes I and Azilises are abundant. As on Maues 3 coinage, 
Greek gods and goddesses appear on Doth silver aftd copper of 
these two kings, but now for the first time, an Indian goddess 
Laxmi is introduced. The legends onthese coins deserve attention. 
Most of these foreign coins are bilingual, Greek and Kharoshthi 
scripts being used after their prototypes, while some of the Satrapal- 
group contain legends in Brahmi script alone as was the norm of 
the native currencies. The Greek legends are only partially 
legible on some of these coins, the Kharoshthi ones are clearer* J 
The coinage of the Kushanas is divisible into several main 
groups , the coins of Kujula Kadphises ^thoseof Wuna Kadphises* 
the striking pieces of the Kanishka group of kings, and, lastly, the - 
money of the later Kushanas* They have; all itheir distinctivr 
tw-ts* and a simultaneous study of these' groups,? indicates that one 
merges into the other; The Greek legend on the first group is 
generally illegible | it is far clearer on, the seconds The Kushanas;,* 
issued gold as well as Popper Coins. The copper coins of Kadphises I 
contain the bull on the obverse and the Bactrian camel on the* 
reverse* Kadphises II issued the double slater y the 4 uartpr 

Staler, and on some of these coins he appears crbss-legged on* ^ 
couch, or his head or bust is found. c The portrait of the hing is‘ 
most realistic though hardly flattering-~a corpulent figure with: 
long heavy faPe and a large nose, he appears wearing on his head 
a conical hat with streamers* 3 (Brown, Goins of India?'p.3§) On 
the reverse of his coins is found Siva oh his characteristic symbol**** 
The most important mark of Kanishka and Huvishka is the varied 
reverse. It is a remarkable thing especially in contrast with the 
single device feature of the coins of their predecessor Wima Kad-^ 
phases* The large number of their gold and copper coins bear on 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


'M 


the reverse the figures of divinities belonging to various creeds, 
;Zoroastrian, Indian, and Greek. The only two Indian .deities 
appearing on Kanishka’s money are Siva and Sakyamuni Buddha, 
while no real member of the Greek pantheon -is ever to be found. 
On the obverse of some of his coins he is standing and on a few 
of his copper coins*, sitting on a throne. Huvishka’s copper coins 
.show him seated cross-legged, seated with raised arms, reclining 
on a couch, and riding an elephant, and on the reverse many 
gods appear. Siva and Nandi are characteristic of the reverse 
of Vasudeva*$ issues, and on the other side the king is standing. 
‘The coins of the later Kushanas, the successors of Vasudeva, have 
on their reverse either Siva on Ardochso. They were soon to be 
.characterised by Only U partial bjdinguality, differing from the 
.-earlier mode. The Greek script showed a progressive degradation 
-until the legend almost ceased to be intelligible, and the second 
•script, used , to write only the king’s name in ‘ Chinese fashion, 5 
ii.e, vertically under his extended arm, was Brahmi ; the reverse 
.device as usual had the short descriptive label in Greek. 

The Safca Kshatrapas of Western India continued their 
earlier coin-type during the 2nd and 3rd cent. A.D. The 
Kshatrapa rulers possessed a remarkable historic sense. The 
.circular Brahmi legend on the reverse 6 f their coins carefully 
;mientibns the name and title, not only of the ruler but also of his 
:father. From the time of Jivadaman (175 A.D.), each coin issued 
ifrom the mint began to bear the date of its issue, given behind 
the bust of the king. This has come to the aid of the modem 
historians to determine the chronology of the Western Kshatrapa 
rulers. The; 'crescented three-arched hill with the Sun and the 
Moon on either side is the reverse symbol on the Kshatrapa coins* 
A few Kshatrapa rulers issued copper coins also, but they are 
.anonymous. Generally they have elephant on the obverse and 
•three-arched hill on the reverse with the Sun and the Moon on 
cither side and the date of issue below. 

The Yaudheyas and : other republican .tribes 5 imitated the 
<c©|)pei coinage of the Kushanas, just as the Kunindas and others 
d# ihe Pun|ab had copied Greek and Saka types in the first century 
B.C. 

The Age of the Imperial Guptas (320 to 600 A.D.) constitutes 
n formative period in the evolution of Indian coinage; Various 
coin types of the Gupta emperors are highly interesting as Well

;as instructive. They shed a welcome light :on the personality of 
■the sovereigns, on the economic prosperity of the empire and the 
•immense wealth of the country. The study of these coins also 
.attests the gradiial. Ihdianisation of the currency. 

With, the assumption of the imperial title Maharajadhiraja, 
-Chandra Gupta I, the founder of the empire, started his gold 
.coinage. The view of Allan that the coins bearing the figures 
.of Chandragupta and his queen Kumara devi on the obverse are 
.commemorative medals issued by his son Samudra Gupta is 
untenable,. As mark qf the disappearance- of the foreign rule and 
the establishment of a new Hindu State, Chandra Gupta I must 
have issued his gold coins. Had Samudra Gupta' issued these 
.coins as commemorative medals, the name of the commemorator 
■would have appeared on these coins as it does on the commemorative 
medals of Eucratides. As it is, Samudra Gupta's own name is- 
.-conspicuous by its absence. 

On the obverse of the coins of Chandra Gupta I, we find the 
king and his > queen Kumara devi standing and facing each other.

Besides imitating Samudra Gupta’s Asvamedha type and. 
some of the types , of his own father, Kumara Gupta introduced 
the Peacock type and 1 the Elephantrrider and Pratapa types. He 
struck silver coins. The empire continued undiminished down to* 
the death of Skanda Gupta. Gupta mints were fairly active 
during the reign of Skanda Gupta. His silver coinage is as copious, 
as that of his father, he supplanted s^ome of its types by introducing 
new ones like the' Bull and the Altar types. But his gold coinage 
is much less, copious and shows only three certain types. The 
financial strain of the Huna wat had also told upon the treasury, 
for many of his gold coins are heavily 'adulterated’* *' - 

The Hunas issued several coin types in -silver and copper* 
some , of them original. Their earliest coins wire issued on the 
model of the Sassanian type- They are thin and large and hatfe 
the Sassanian bust on the obverse and the Alter and Fire-attendantis;

and Kashmir, they issued a copper currency closely imitating 
fitae Kushana proto-type with the standing king on « the 
obverse and the seated goddess on the reverse. With the 
annexation of Central India, they came into contact with the

During the early centuries of the Christian era Roman imperial 
coins of gold and silver were imported in considerable quantity 
in the course of trade and circulated freely in the country ; the 
* -small copper coins hearing Roman devices and legends might 
have been locally produced by foreign settlers. The author of 
the P&riplus makes frequent mention of large imports of specie in 
.the ports, and the specie mainly consisted of Roman 1 coins. Hoards 
of these different metals have been unearthed, in various localities 
of South India, and they undoubtedly comprised the wealth of 
the rich South Indian magnates, traders and producers. There 
were also Roman settlements in the country, as excavations at 
Arikamedu near Pondicherry and other places have proved, and 
Roman coins were in great demand there- Robert Sewell in his 
lucid accotet *(J.R.A.S>*1904) of these hoards refers to a large 
number of Roman copper coins, some among them being of the 
emperors Aroadius and Honorius, mostly collected from Madurai 
and its environs. They were in his opinion imported from Rome 
M currenc^ fc comparatively small value by ‘ Romans 

or persons . using Roman coins in daily life actually resident at 
Madurai for a time.’ Colonel Tufnell refers to another jclass of 
coins found at Madurai, 4 small Insignificant copper coins, scarce 
the size of a quarter of a farthing., and closely resembling the early 
issues of the native mints, * but which are at the same time Roman 
ifi character. On one side they bear the imperial head, very much 
worn, aomiWtnes witih faint traces .of aa ii^eriptioh ; the other- 
side shows the figures of three Roman soldiers standing, spear in 
hand, ■' 'n- -c . > . ■' . . . . * , . •. • • - - 

The Satavahans used lead for many of their issues, and their 
coins bear legends of the names of kings which confirm the Puranic 
lists of these names. 'One of the most interesting types erf these 
coins is that bearing aifcwo-masted ship on the obverse, an indi- 
cation of the maritime power and activity of the Andhras ; the

tsmall and dumpy* and were issued also in their half and quarter 
divisions. Their legends were at first either in Telugu, Kannada 
or Nagari, while later kings used Nagari exclusively. 

The coinage of the short-lived sultanate of Madura, usually 
in billon and copper, follows the contemporary Delhi models and 
:!s hardly distinguishable from Delhi issues except by its southern 
type of calligraphy. The gold and silver coins of the Bahmani 
iSultam also followed the Delhi patterns on a more generous scale. 
.In those 6f earlier reigns there is some variety in arrangement 
and design* but later a single design was adopted for both metals. 
'The earliest copper closely followed that of Delhi, but innovations 
soon appeared, and the copper standard underwent many and 
frequent changes. The five sultanates that succeeded the Bahmani 
'.Kingdom had their own separate issues, though not so well turned 
<out. 

- Chronology 5. 

We now pass on to Chronology. Now the first observation 
^to make here is that somehow it has happened that in discussions 
of early South Indian Chronology there has been prevalent a 
fairly widespread error of using geological arguments in historical 
discussions. Now this has to be said with some emphasis* because 
the talk of Lemuria, of Tamil having been spread all over the 
area of the Indian Ocean before the ocean submerged the land, 
and of its being the oldest language in the world-*— this talk has 
beeii the pastime; of some persons for too long. It is time that 
'.some stood up and said, c It is all bosh T Human life cm 
.earth in any form that concerns us as students of history had its 
:first beginnings not more than thirty or thirty-five thousand years 
ago at the highest. But geological changes relate to conditions 
of earth before any life (not only human life) came into existence. 
Submergence of continents and emergence of oceans are not 
occurrences of every day, and the last great change of this? character 
: is put. by geologists some millions of years ago. What has this 
got to do with the history of humanity which stretches back at 
most to about five* isbybr ten or twenty thousand y^ars from now? 
JP,ofr that 4«g(h!of?t!me^wouM take us back to the old stone age, 
an age when, men were hardly different from animals, when they 
had no language,, no. speech and no 'culture* ind were ‘Still living

and the other from the date of its destruction. The so-called- 
* destruction ? must be taken to have been an important incident 
in a war or otherwise, from which an era was begun, rather than 
' the permanent disappearance of the city, which has been a flourish-- 

ing port almost since the date of its foundation. ' 

| The internal chronology of a king’s reign is often determined 

I from the spread of his inscriptions over Jhis regnal years, The 

most important dynasty of South India were the Cholas, whose 
Inscriptions account for somethlng like a third of- the total number’ 
| of South Indian inscriptions ; they followed an excellent practice 

1 in this regard- The first great monarch of the line, Rajaraja,. 

| started the practice of having a^set prds f asti in which the important 

1 achievements of the ruler should be recorded in a definitive form.- 

1 That pmsasti was repeated in every one of the grants recorded in 

I his reign, and as the reign advanced and fresh achievements fell 

i to the credit of the monarch, the firasasti was expanded accordingly , 

j One may trust oneself almost unreservedly to the guidance of 

,these j>/*z^ exploit their growth through the reigns as much 

, as possible. Without such guidance it would not at all be possible 

to evolve the relative internal chronology of the events of a reign. 

| Again, there are other aids to the historian which are found In 

other practices of particular dynasties. The Cholas, for instaace r 
j -had a rule by which a Rajakesari was always succeeded by a 

| Parakesari. This rule has come tp furnish very great aid m 

^dealing ^with the interval between the death of Parantaka I and 
\ the accession of Rajaraja I, one of the most intricate periods oF 

Imperial Chpla chronology. Likewise among the Pandyas there

-;in it, sometimes as many as four, all connected by the phrase of 
ediramandu ’ being repeated the required number of times. 
Another type of aid we get is the presence of definitely astro- 
rnomical data, the Panchanga data being given* One may think 
that this is a blessing, but scholars who have worked in the field 
have reason -almost to wish that these data were not available, at 
least in such profusion. Only one scholar was ‘able to Make a 
satisfactory use of them— not dll'* but only some of them-^-and that 
was Prof. Kielhdrn. He adapted the rule that he wduld f ndt 
make any emendations in the data given by the inscriptions and 

• that fie would not accept any single date, however satisfactory,' if 

• it stood by itself unrelated to at least one other date, equally 

• satisfactory. 5 ' Thus His - rule Was that If two separate inscriptions 

• without being amended in any manner yielded dates which were 
.Mstorically ‘ reconcilable with each other, then any one of them 
may be taken as an established datum. This caution Was- very 

•necessary because the details of any particular group may repeat 
•themselves thrice in a century and you will not be able to determine 
the corresponding year in the Christian era accurately unless you 
have the data which fix the date in the Christian era definitely. 
"That fixation cannot be attained without two ! inter-connected 
dates, and this problem is very acute when we deal with the history 
of the medieval Pandyas. It is there that we have a large number 
of inscriptions furnishing these astrological data, but data which 
are riot easy to" reconcile with one another. It is iri that field that 
Prdfi Kielhorn’s great work has been of invaluable assistance in 
’laying a path for evolving a more or less continuous account of 
that period . Kielhornls methods and conclusions have been more 
/on- ■-less closely Mlowed by hls successors. Jacobi and Sewell 
almost strictly adhered to his rules, but they werfe a little more

IN RELATION TO INDIAN HISTORY 


91 


* valuable as a guide, it does not seem to be astronomically quite 
. above criticisnh And when you come across the work of an 

scholar like Venkatasubbiah of Mysore, astronomy becomes an 
, extremely uncertain: thing, because from the arguments he employs 
to criticise his predecessors and to explain his own results, we are 
unable to see that his results are any better than those which he 
•would replace. Swamikannu Pillai made a famous attempt to 
. demonstrate that five Pandyan kings were contemporaneously 
ruling for several generations together ; and he based his conclu- 
sions on astronomical data which he set out to interpret in the 
.light of Marco Polo’s statement that Five Brothers were ruling 
simultaneously in the kingdom 'of Ma’bar. Marco Polo was a 

* contemporary witness. He travelled in India in 1292 and observed 
that five brothers were ruling. Either Marco Polo was not well 

: informed, or there whs a persistent confusion between Pandavas 
: and .Pandyas ,* it cannot be said that the efforts of Swamikannu 
. Pillai to pf oveC this succession have yielded satisfactory results. 

•« ; We must ahvays bear in mind that at best all our chrono- 
logical: results 1 ard only .approximations, particularly in early 
history $ so that one can make no bones about shifting a date 
. about 10 or ? 15 years this way or that. This cannot be done 
course for dates that rest on ah eclipse or some such definite datum; 

: in , one case the Dumber of days that had elapsed in the Kaliyuga 
at the time of the record is mentioned. But speaking generally, 

: South Indian history is still in the making, and we must beware 
■? of tying ’ourselves down to a chronology rigid in all its details 
until our mvesti^ations have proceeded much further than they 
have yet dbne. ! We have not yet got, for instance, an authoritative 
account even dfthePallava political history, much less of dynasties 
Tike the Gahgas, Kadambas.and so on. Thefe are indeed books' 
on these subjects, but they do not carry you far. They are very 
' often pure rehashes of published reports, the data in whibh have 
-not been passed by any sound process of historical criticism . One 
- often finds that the contusions reached on a topid feom the Pandyan 
point of view undergo a? considerable revision when the? GfebN 
side is taken up and a correlation is attempted between th 6 Pandy& 
and Chola history. ? There will perhapsibe somb' further shifting of 
-several of ’the dates ranging front the 5th to the l§th century 
JLP& * because^ there are a number of synchronisms suggested by 
•the - Pallava i and* Gaiiga inscriptions which have not yet been

HISTORICAL METHOD 


critically studied, and in some cases we do not have the accurate" 
data which would be necessary before we could reach a very' 
precise conclusion. 

Where we have several inscriptions dated in the Saka era as 
we have under the Rashtrakutas, later Chalukyas, the Vijayanagar * 
rulers etc., the difficulties of chronology disappear largely, and a 
clear and authentic sequence of events becomes more easy to * 
establish. Generally speaking, chronology becomes less and less ■ 
of a problem as we approach our own times. 

One final word on the present position of historical study. 

There is much to inspire hope. The number of periodicals that 
are devoted to the study of Indian historical subjects is on the 
increase* and conferences held from time to time to discuss topics 
of historical interest are' also becoming increasingly useful and ~ 
numerous ; still one feels that we are not making any very definite 
or steady approach towards building up proper and sound standards • 
of research in all the activity that is going on.* Our journals are 
found to publish very valuable articles by the side of mere repeti- - 
tions, sometimes with new error added to old. In that respect 
perhaps our brethren in the scientific field are in a much better 
position. If one turns, for instance, to the pages of the scientific 
numbers of the journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, one ■ 
seems to get on the whole less room for dissatisfaction. In fact 
even on the archaeological and numismatic side, that journal was 
holding up a much higher standard than other journals which 
need not be named-' There is a real necessity for much winnowing 
being done, for distmguishing the wheat from the chaff, and for ■ y 

building, tip a proper standard of historical research* One is here j 

reminded of a passage in the book of Langlbis and Seignobos to * y* 

which We have made $0 many references already. > That passage >r 

seems to reveal a state of things that prevailed in France not long | 

ago and furnishes a parallel to the situation we find in India 
to-day,. and is therefore well worth dur attention* ? Towards the

iment to those scholars who showed lack of conscience or method, 
in a manner calculated to disgust them with erudition for ever. 
"They performed sundry notable executions, not for the pleasure 
of it, but with the firm resolve to establish a censorship and a 
•wholesome dread of justice, in the domain of historical study. 
Bad workers henceforth received no quarter, and though the 
Revue did not exert any great influence on the public at large, its 
police operations covered a wide enough radius to impress most 
-of those concerned with the necessity of sincerity and respect for 
method* During the last twenty-five years the impulse thus 
given has spread beyorid all expectation/ (pp. 137-8). 

Hints to Students 

Some hints are offered here to the student who is still a 
■beginner in the craftmanship of history. There are many excellent 
manuals, some of which will be found in the bibliography to this 
■book, that are worth reading at the outset, for that will save him 
from committing ^ number of minor mistakes by giving him useful 
tips on many matters. What follows here is by no means meant 
as a substitute for such reading, but as a supplement to it. The 
work of a student comprises three well-marked stages : the choice 
of a subject, the gathering and, arranging of the material relating 
to it, and the writing out of the results of his study. s 

In the choice of a subject the student must have a due regard 
for his own taste Jan® scope offered by At subject

of students starting work with no initial knowledge of epigraphy,

HISTORICAL METHOD 


has enabled them to read and criticise their sources at first hand-- 
As a rule it would be well for the student to look upon his first . 
year after graduation as a period of preparation for research. * 
Arid; there is scope here for our universities , to offer short courses- 
of an intensive character in Archaeology, Linguistics and Diplo- • 
matics, which students could take with advantage before they 
actually enter upon research. The study of some modern European 
languages other than English is also very desirable as much work- 
on Indplogy is done and published these languages which does* 
not appear in English at all r or al least riot sufficiently early to 
be useful to the student iri his work. Whether this language should . 
be French, German, Dutchye#! Portuguese must depend on the 
subject of the student’s interest. ? Sanskrit, Persian, and Marathi 
are also indispensable foi* particular branches of Indian historical 
study.- *;*„ - • • -• * ■ 1 ; -i U- ;■> * 

; Often the strident looks to the teacher to name the subject of" 
his research. And often a student who starts like that looks to* 
the teacher also for everything else, some times even the actual 
writing out of the thesis. Perhaps the student is not altogether 
to blame for this, for throughout his Degree course he has generally 
done very little for himself or by himself, but has had everything 
done for him. But this plan does not work iri 1 the domain of" 
research where what a student gains by contact with his teacher* 
is strictly limited by his own capacity for self-education and self-- 
expression. It would be well for the student to put himself to- 
some trouble to discover his own interest and choose a subject, 
suited to it ; he must of course depend on his teacher for advice* 
bri the i scope for work in the chosen : subj ect, the bibliography * 
relating to it and so bn, at first, though if he does his work diligently ** 
be will soon surpass his teacher iri his detailed knowledge of these -

h Earih student must develop his own plan iri the study of the * 
sources and the accumulation of aids tp his memory, in the form, 
of riotes, extracts, memcrianda ririd so on. The only gerierrit 
advice that can be offered appears simple and obvious, but not- 
so erisy to follow in pirietice as it looks . The notes and extracts

at first or to confine one’s reading too narrowly. But unless one* 
happens to be in the happy position of being able to devote an 
indefinite mimber of years to the study of one’s subject, one must 
have a due regard to the time at one’s disposaLin choosing, the 
topic for study. The loose-leaf and the index-card are generally 
recommended as the most convenient carriers of notes and extracts * 
and this will, in practice, be found much more handy than volu- 
minous notebooks ; but there is a disadvantage against which 
careful provision must be made ; it is much easier not to miss a 
card or a single sheet of paper than a note-book ; and no precaution 
is superflous that would ensure that the student has before him 
at the time of his final writing out of his results, all the notes and ■ 
references that he has accumulated on the topic of the chapter or 
section in the course of his study. A more serious charge some- ■ 
times levelled against the system of loose-leaves and cards is that 
it restricts the scope for the play of mind by mechanising the 
processes of research ; and it is up to the scholar to be conscious 
of this danger and prevent its occurrence. Whatever the chances 
may be of such a deterioration of method setting in over work- 
spread over long years or done in the midst of other preoccupa- 
tions, a student working for a definite period on a selected topic 
should find it easy to keep his mind constantly switched on to his 
subject as it were, and to respond quickly to the impact of each 
new datum as it comes along his path ; and this is the surest method . 
q { keeping research from degenerating into a routine business* 
An alert and mobile mind that does not run into grooves is the 
most important requisite for success in the interpretation and- 
proper presentation of new data, or reinterpretation of old data 
in the light of new ; an awareness of this requirement and practice-

The task of writing out the results of the study forms the last : 
stage of the student’s work. Often considerable difficulty is felt- 
here mainly owing to the student having to write in a foreign idiom- 
that he has not quite ma$e his own. Hard work on his part 
and timely guidance from the teacher both in the planning of~ 
chapters and sections and their writing will go far to secure the 
highest quality of work possible under the given conditions. Every’

So far, we have described the nature of the main sources 
for the History of Independent Ancient India. We now enter 
upon a long period of several centuries, when Indians were no 
longer left to themselves and had to come to terms with aggressive 
and domineering aliens who generally had little sympathy or 
love for them and their culture. The first newcomers were Turks 
by race and the adherents of the youngest religion in the world* 
Islam. The History of Islam in India is the story' of a continuous 
adjustment and mutual influences in the midst of many conflicts 
between two cultures with r well-marked traits of their own. The 
Muslim conquest of Northern India was effected towards the end 
of the twelfth Century after a bitter struggle which dragged its 
dreary length for the best part of two centuries. After a century 
of halt and such consolidation as the conquered allowed, attemjkr 
followed in the fourteenth century to subjugate the Deccan and' 
‘South India ; these efforts resulted in the formation of the inde* 
pendent Sultanate of the Bahmani Kingdom (1347) about k 
decade after the resistance of the Hindu South to Islam had found 
its focus in Vijayanagar (1336) w The Mughal* inquest of thr

historical method 


The historians of this period of Indian History possess one 
marked advantage over the scholars interested in the preceding’ 
period. The Hindus showed little interest in historical literature,, 
and the • Sanskrit chronicles and biographical works that have 
survived can be counted on our fingers. The Muslims gave 
themselves much more to genuine historical writing than the' 
Hindus, and a number of historical .works were produced under 
the patronage of the Sultans. They were mostly written by 
Muslim authors who concern themselves more with kings and. 
courts and wars and intrigues, say little about the life of the Common 
folk, and almost exclusively present the course of events from the 
conqueror’s stand-point. The reactions of the Hindus have to be 
understood in general only by laboriously piecing together data 
drawn from stray and obscure sources. The his tpry i o f Vijay anagar 
and of the Marathas is, however, much better known, than that 
of Hindus and; Hindu kingdoms , elsewhere, The Muslim writers- 
\yere seldom , free from a religious bias that made them indifferent 
to the culture of the Hindus. These Persian historical prose 
works should be supplemented by a study of the contemporary 
foreign observations, epigraphical researches, coins and monuments,* 
Only then can we get an accurate idea of the Medieval period 
of Indian History. . f ? • . . ■ 

... t ; Many of the Persian historical prose .Works have been rendered, 
into English but the translations are not always reliable. The 
translations ofsome ofthese Persian works as given in The History'

i 

Mughul and Maratha periods of Indian history up to the third- 
battle of Panipat 1761. V. A. Smith writes : c Elphinstone knew 
the Maratha country and people so intimately that his narrative 
counts as a primary authority for some, purposes. 9 Edward. 
Thomas’s Chronicles ofthe Pathan Kings of Delhi (London 1871) also 
provides some valuable Information on the subject. Stanley Lane 
Poole’s standard work oxi Medieval India under Muhammadan Rule 
(Story of the Nations) (London, 1906) needs no introduc- 
tion to any one interested in Indian History. Although* 
mainly based on the translations of Elliot and Dowson and 
prejudiced in some places, it remains still one of the best surveys of 
period. The Cambridge History of India Vol. III Turks and Afghans ; 
edited by Wolsley Haig (Cambridge 1928), mostly written by"' 
European scholars, may also be consulted. Among the works 
written by Indians, may* be mentioned Iswari Prasad’s History of 
Medieval India (from 647 .h iHe Moghul Conquest) Allahabad (1928) ^ 
and Asirvadilal Srivastava’s The Sultanate of Delhi (2nd ed. 1954).. 
There are also some good biographies of some of the prominent 
personalities of die period. Mohammad Habib 9 s Sultan Mahmud*

Muhammad Nazim’s Sultan Mahmud ofGhazna (Cambridge’-— 1931)..

achievements of Muhammad-bin-Tughlak. ; Among the provincial 
histories. The History of Gujarat by H. C. Bailey stands as a pioneer*

during the Muhammadan rule and describes in detail the Muslim, 
dynasties who ruled over Gujarat, their rise and fall/ their wars 
with neighbours and Imperial Delhi. Published in 1866, and 
partially based on a translation by Prof. Dowson, this work forms- 
a Sequel to Elliot’s History of the Muhammadan Empire in India 
as told by its own historians. Mr. Commissariat’s History of 
Gujarat (1938) forms a splendid supplement to the above mentioned, 
work. Stewart’s History of Bengal is very useful on the historical 
role of Bengal in Medieval times.: On its cultural side, we have*

The fundamental Persian chroniclers of the Turkish period are 
(1) Amir Khfisrau, (2) Barani, (3) Isami, (4) Wassaf, (5) Shams- 
1-Siraj Afif, (6). Minhaj-us-Siraj, (7) Ferishta and others. Amir 
Khusrau, fi the Prince of poets, 9 c the Parrot of Hind, 5 a prolific 
•writer of very elegant poetry, prose arid music, mystic* philosopher 
and politician, rose to fame under Balban, became the tutor of 
his eldest son, prince Muhammad, then Librarian of the Imperial 
Library at Delhi under Jalal-ud+din Kliilji, and lived to enjoy the 
patronage of Ghiyas-us.-din Tughlak before he died in A.D. 1325. 
Khusrau was also a soldier add; took part in many Campaigns of 
which he has given ah account in his works. He was a master 
of poetid prose, many Hindi words occur in his writings* and he 
is sometimes reckoned as a> writer of Urdu., Ziauddin Barani, the 
historian, who knew Khusrau well, declared him to be the greatest 
of all poets, ancient and modern ; for , whereas other poets had 
^excelled in one or two forms of verse-— the qita , the qasida, the 
gkazal , the rubai — Khusrau was pre-eminent in all. Khusrau was 
.also a master-musician well versed in the technique of the art and 
is known to have held' discussions with Gopal Nayak, a renowned 
musician of the South in his time. j ; 

Amir Khusrau’s prose-work* theKhazain-ul-Futuh is the official 
history of Alauddin’s campaigns. It has often been referred to by 
the later historians of India. Sir Syed Ahmad Khan has quoted 
it in the second volume of his Asarus-Smadid, and Sir Henry Elliot 
has noticed if ini the third volume of his . History of India as told by

summarises them: to enable his Bdok’ to stand on its own feet. The 
Tmikh-i-Firoz Shahi of Baton! (1286-1359) is the history of the

Barani .'was a min of noble ' descent, whose forefathers had held 
high offices under the Khilji Sultans; Barani himself flourished 
under Muhammad-bin-Tughlak whom he outlived by several years. 
Barani named his work Tmhh-i-Firaz Shahi, after Firoz-Shah though 
the actual history of Firoz Shah forms not more than a fifth part 
of the whole. His history is a chronological account of the reigns j 

of the Delhi Sultans from Balban to Ghiyas-tid-din Tughlaq- 1 

He has devoted much space and time to Balban and Alauddin. Sr 
His account of 'Muhammad-bin^Tughlaq’s . reign is. confusing. 
Besides narrating the political history, Barani describes, many more 
factors like the administrative regulations'? the frequency of Mongol 
Invasions,' the expeditions to South India, Alauddin 5 s tariff legisla- 
tion, Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq’s token currency and others. 
Barani knew the value. of history and was fully aware of the duties, 
and responsibilities of a historian. He gives expression to his 
critical faculty in his observations, and says, * I took care to sift 
the matters, and to distinguish between fabrication and reality/ 
f To be honest,’ he continues, ‘in observing incidents, and irt 
chroniding them as such’ is the most essential duty of a historian/ 

•He knew also howmecessary it was for a historian to be free from, 
religious bigotry.,' He knew also the value of truth in matters 
of historical investigation. c I, the compiler of the Tardkh-i-Firoz

larly devoid of order and arrangement. It is without paragraphs 
•and the subject is divided under different headings. He was also 
-careless of dates and chronology. He is c an unmethodical writer 
'with no taste for chronology. 5 He died in extreme poverty. 

The Bibliotheca Indica edition of this work has been checked 
with the manuscripts in the British Museum .and the India Office. 

A famous Moorish traveller of the time is Ibn Batuta (1304- 
1378)* a Doctor of Law, native of Morocco. He started on his 
travels in 1325 and during the next eight years visited Arabia, 
Persia and reached India in 1333. Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq 
appointed him Qazi of Delhi, \Wiich office he held about eight 
years. After having toured the different States in India, he 
returned to Morocco in 1353. Here at the instance of Sultan 
Abu Inan, Ibn Batuta dictated the experiences of his journey to 
Abu Abdullah Miffianmrad-bin-Muhammad, commonly known as 
Ibn Juzai, who edited them as the e Rihla 5 (Journal)* Ibn 
Batuta died at the age of 73 .(1377-78). 

Ibn Batuta ranks higher than Barani in the matters of quali- 
fication and historical investigation. He was a doctor of law and 
theology. He also possessed greater advantages than Barani for 
getting accurate information about facts. His account of the 
Delhi Sultanate from Kutb-ud-din Aibak to Muhammad-bin- 
Tughlaq is largely a result of his experiences and acquaintances in 
India except the part relating to the latter sovereign. His reliability 
is beyond question as far as his personal knowledge of men and 
things is concerned. His account of Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq 
-corroborates the picture depicted by Barani who, however, was less 
learned than the foreigner. His account is a valuable supplement 
rto ffie indigenoiis sources. - * .

The Futuh-us-Salatin by Isami is the only extant con temporary 
'work on the history of the Bahmani Kingdom. The author was 
the grandson of an old sipah salar Isami who was compelled by 
.Sultan Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq to leave Delhi for Daulatabad 
fin 1327 A.D., the grand-father died on the way, but young Isami 
.made his home there. He attached himself to the first Bahmani 
Sultan, began to write his work in 1358 and completed it in the 
.next year. Modelled on the Shah Nam a of Firdausi, the work is 
•written in limpid verse and narrates the history of the Sultanate 
■iof Delhi to the time of Muhammad-bin-Tughlak, It then gives a 
yivid picture of the years of political turmoil in the Deccan which 
preceded the foundation of the Bahmani kingdom, besides much 
valuable and accurate information on the Muslim conquest of 
-the Deccan and South India and on the reign and character of 
i:he first Bahmani Sultan. Other works on the Bahmani Kingdom 
were late compositions written long after the extinction of the 
‘Sultanate and from the particular standpoint of one or other of 
.the succession States. Notable among them is the Burkan-i-maattr 
£ Ali bin Aziz^ullah Taba Tabai of Simmin (Persia)— a contempo- 
rary of the more famous Ferishta, and like him at first a courtier 
of the Nizam Shah’s kingdom of Ahamadnagar. Little is known 
.of the life and activities of Taba Tabai ; he began his history in 
1591 and completed it in the next five years. It is a history of 
ithe Nizam Shahs to which is prefixed an account of the Bahmatii 
Sultans as an introduction. His bias in favour of his patrons is 
bvftfent' -tteoUj^iiOuf his narrative ; but in some respects his 'State- 
ments seem to be more authentic than those of Ferishta and better 
ill accord "with the evidence from coins. But beyond a shadow of 
^doubt Ferishta is the Prince of Muslim historians of the period. 
The wide range and sweep of his work which forms a general 
history of Muslim rule in India, the number of authorities he 
.consulted, and the general sense of perspective that dominates the 
■entire narration impart a monumental character to his history. 
Covering wide ground, and often at second hand, he is sometimes

mcaka , the Krishnaraya Vijaya , the Varadambika Parinaya , the Acyuta 
Rayabhyudaya , the Raghunathabhyudaya and the Sahityaratnakara belong 
to this class. Of much less literary value, and in no way more 
dependable is the Tamil chronicle of Kongudesarajakkalin-Cariltiram 
or the history of the kings of the Kongu country. This is another 
chronicle which has been on the whole over-rated by students of 
South Indian History. In some parts it is indeed useful. But it 
pretends to give us a systematic chronology which it is very 
difficult to fit into the definitely known facts of South Indian 
History. 

The Keladinripa Vijaya is a Kanarese chronicle in prose arid 
verse treating of the chiefs of Keladi. They were also known as 
‘the Nayaks of Ikkeri or Bednur as they shifted their capital during 
the later years of their rule. It was probably written by a Brahmin 
poet called' Linganna who seems to have flourished * about the. 
middle of the l &th century. The work has not yet been translated 
into any other language. It offers much new information about 
the gradual expansion of Bijapur into Karnataka. It throws light 
on the foundation of the Maratha dominion in’ South India. This 
Is a post-Vijayanagar Chronicle. 

We have other chronicles still-*— the Karnatakarajakk al Savistara 
Caritai is a fairly longish account running into several hundreds of 
pages ; it was compiled by a certain writer by name Narayana, for 
the benefit of Col. Mackenzie when he started bringing together 
a magnificent collection of antiquities, literary, epigraphical, 
artistic and so Ori.' This is also a post-Vijayanagar chronicle. The 
JCarnataka Rajakkd Sanktra Cdrkai is quite good on recent history, 
.oft the histpi^ oTtfte Sriropeftft * companies ' tod their struggles for 
supremacy in Soutli Tndia, Then we have a chronicle poem in 
the Vdugoti %ri &as -been -critically studied and 

recently published in a practically definitive edition by Dr. 1ST.

historical value and the amount of history that can be got from 
it is certainly much greater than from many other works of that 
oharacter. * ’ **'• *

It is in the field of Vernacular literature, especially Telugu, 
j -that this species of historical composition is perfected. The 

! ; historical introduction made its first appearance in Telugu as early 

..j as the age of the Chalukyas ; but it did not come into vogue until 

^ much later. Tikkana who lived during the later half of the 13th 

-century A.D. is the first Telugu poet to trace the history of his* 
patron's family in the prologue of his poems. He gives a succinct’ 
account of the Nellore branch of the Telugu Choda family in the 
’introduction to his Nirvacanottara Ramayamm . This plan soon 
acquired considerable popularity, and an introduction describing 
d:he history of the patron's family became a normal feature of the 
^ literary works of this age. The example of Tikkana was followed 

by all the subsequent Telugu poets so effectively that Telugu, 
literature has become one of the principal sources of Vijayanagar a* 
History. The earliest Telugu writer who was associated with the 
Rayas was the poet Nachana Somalia who lived . at the court of 
[Harihara I. Unfortunately the early books of his poem Hcrivamsa 
have not come down to us ; and it is not possible* to discover what 
he said about the history of his patron's family . v Vallabharaya, who 
-was a subordinate of Hariham Ii, gives some interesting information

The members of the :Bhat community held the monopoly of reciting

influence oh the : growth of historical literature* f The medieval 
prasasti writers not only based their compositions^ oh the material 
finished by, the biruda-gadyas , but frequently adopted even the 
language o f the Bhats. One interesting feature of the biruda-gadya is 
that it grew with the passage of time. : It passed on from generation 
to generation, gathering mass, absorbing new titles, so that the 
biruda-gadya of the last king ofany dynasty attributed to him all the 
titles of his predecessors. - If the Bhats confined their attention only 
to the composition of .these gadyas , the chronicle would not have 
come into existence at all. Besides the biruda-gadyas, they composed 
verses eulogising the glory, of their patrons* These verses, which 
were composed for the occasion, were preserved carefully and 
tacked on to the biruda-gadyas on which they serve as a metrical 
Commentary. As each generation made its own contribution, the 
bimda-gadya was transformed into a j chronicle within the course of 
a few generations. Although every noble family must have had 
its own .chronicle* only a few survived. The most important of 
them are the: Mmm Gmtrqrrii €ikkademtaya

loosely connected material. The Aravitivamsa Car Ur am .which 
traces the history of the Avuku branch of the Aravidu family presents 
another stage in the growth of the chronicle. The ' bimda-gadya 
completely drops out of it. This is probably due to an accident. 
Th c Aravitivamsa Caritram is not an independent work; it is tacked on 
as an appendix to Konerinatha’s poem, the Dvipada Balabkagavatam . 
Probably the author consciously made an innovation in the method 
of writing the chronicle. Whatever be the circumstances in which 
the change was introduced; there need be no doubt about the 
result. It gave the Hindu chronicle its final shape. The Keladi~ 
nripa Vijayam, already described, however betrays no traces of the 
Mruda-gadya. . It is a typical chronicle in prose and verse, approxi- 
mating very nearly to the Muhammadan historical works in verse. 

One other chronicle, which is later than the above works, may 
also be considered- This is the Ramarajna-Bakhair which is included 
in the Mackenzie collection. It describes the events connected 
with the disastrous battle of Rakshasi-Tangadi which opened the 
flood-gates of the Mussalman invasion on South India. This 
chronicle furnishes us' with- the Hindu version of the great battle 
and enables us to investigate the problem afresh. Two versions 
of the chronicle — one iii Marathi and the other in Kannada— am 
extant. One appears to be a translation of the other, although 
it is not easy to determine which of the two works is the original. 
Jt purports to he the account of an eye-witness. 1 The. minute 
description of the .contending armies, and then? movements bn the 
battle field, tod the! graphic narration^ of the progress of events 
seem to bear nut this s claim but it several defects of a serious 
nature. The inclusion: of the emperor Akbar ih the confederacy 
of the Mussalman kings fighting against the Raya, and the intro* 
duction of a long passage enumerating the fictitious names, of the 
most important of the 64 queens of the Raya make, it obvious that 
the author; of the hakhdr could not have been a contempomry of 
Rama Raja, much less an eye-witness of the battle which saw his 
downfall. ; . Probably, a genuine old chronicle was tampered with 
by a later . redactor, who distorted it in his attempts: to improve 
it, owing to ignorance* This supposition . gives 1 < a. i satisfactory 
explanation of the intriguing problems with ; which the student of 
the chronicle is confronted. . 1-.<a Im

India; specially in the Telugu country, from the administrative

records maintained in the villages. These records known as danda 
kaviles or kaviles are village registers containing information about 
the political, religious, social and economic conditions of the village. 
It remained in the custody of the village kamnam> who could enter 
into it all important events concerning the village that happened 
.during his time and pass it on to his successor. The dandakavile 
would thus grow in bulk from generation to generation, each 
generation making its own contribution to the history of the village. 
Col. Colin Mackenzie who was the first to recognize the value of* 
these records sent into the villages his clerks with instructions to 
collect and copy them. The clerks whom he despatched in this 
manner collected several of these danda-kaviles, and copied every 
inscription in the villages whether on stone or copper ; but in 
many cases, either because they could not induce the karamms to 
part with their kaviles or because they considered the original not 
worth copying, they prepared digests of the village registers. These 
digests are usually known as Kaifiyais and they yield much informa- 
tion of value. 

The danda-kaviles and the kaiftyats contain, as is to be expected 
in records of this description, an admixture of legend and history^ 
The legendary element predominates in the accounts of the early 
period ; but it leaves the later history comparatively free. The 
danda-kaviles are usually silent about the administration of the 
early dynasties such as the Satavahanas and the Pallavas#- 
Occasionally they break the silence, only to treat us to a descrip-' 
tion of the miraculous birth of some forgotten king or the foundation 
of some vanished temple ; but as they approach our own times 
they free themselves from mythology and grow more and more 
accurate ahd trustworthy ; though they give only a hazy and not 
very accmate account of the Chalukyas and the Cholas, they' 
become fuller and more precise in describing the history of the 
Kakatiyas, and their account of the Reddis of Kondavidu, the* 
Rayas of Vijayanagar* and the Gajapatis of Orissa is very nearly 
accurate, and occasionally they even furnish us with the key ter 
the solution of some problem on which the inscriptions throw* 
IfttfeDb no lights ®ut these works must be used with great caution*, 
as feet and fiction are sometimes found in them inextricably 
mixed together. . i ; * vB

foreign sources of Ancient India, we have seen how the references* 
of Greek and Roman writers to India gain in. extent and accuracy" 
to the end of 2nd cent. A.D. Then we have seen how the Itineraries 
of Chinese Travellers and the chronicles of annalists throw light 
on the social and economic conditions of the time. We have also 
seen how from eighth century onwards the "writings of Aratr 
merchants and travellers, historians and geographers begin to be 
important, and the Chinese sources become ipore copious and* 
definite than before. 

The illustrious Albertini marks the transition from Ancient to 
Medieval times, He was followed by Abulfeda (1273-1331), Ibm 
§aid (11214-1286) and Ibn Batuta. The writings of these early 
Medieval Arab historians and geographers furnish valuable evident 
ces on the political, social and economic conditions of the times.- 

To turn lastly to the European travellers in India after Cosmas, 
it has been doubted if the Jewish traveller from Spain, -Benjamin 
of Tudela (1170) ever visited India, though he has some interesting 
remarks to offer on Qpilon and its trade. With Marco Polo, ‘ the 
prince of medieval travellers, 5 begins a new epoch in the direct 
contacts between Europe and the East. He reached the court of 
Kublai Khan after a hazardous journey of three and half years 
across Asia. He spent seventeen years in the Mongol court where 
he became a favourite of the Khan and was employed on many 
important missions. Finally lie was .chosen to escort a princess of " 
the, Kham’3 family on her bridal journey to. the ruler of Persia, 
He left China in 1292 and his voyage to Persia through, the Indian 
seas lasted about a year and a half. Thence he travelled to 
Constantinople and returned to Venice finally in 1295. He was 
.only passing through some parts of South India on; his way to 
Persia, but the amount of information he was able to collect i& 
indeed surprising. His veracity and justness of observation were’ 
doubted for a long time, but this is no longer so. He has muchr 
to tell on the manners, beliefs and practices of the people of South* 
India and on their maritime trade. ‘ The commerce of India he 
found stretching* like ^ iinm^ territories of’ 

Kublai Khan to the shores of the PerTOnrG^lf ;and of ; the Reel. 
Sea. i He. found the shores and the islands of the Indian sea

of the topaz, the amethyst, and the emerald, of the sapphires of- 
Geylon, and the diamonds of Golqonda. 5 , r .

Moirco Polo has stood the test of time as few travellers who 
have travelled so widely and written upon so many matters have 
done. There are two recent ■ Versions in English of his travels 
(1) Prof. Ricci's (ed: Sir Denison Ross) in the Broadway Travellers 5 
series and (2) Marco Polo — the ■ Description of the World by 
A. C. Moule and Paul Pelliot. If the Venetian merchant represents 
one side of the culture-contacts between the West and East, the 
three monks who visited South India soon after Marco Polo repre- 
sent another. First among them was the Franciscan friar, John of 
Monte Goivino, who travelled in 1292-3 by way of India to China 
to preach the gospel in the vast land of Paganism and what he 
considered little better, Nestorianism. This- lonely monk was out 
of sympathy with much that he Saw in India, and with him may be 
said to begin the stream of Christian missionary criticism of Indian 
life and' habits which has not always been either intelligent or 
charitable, i Nearly 30 years later came Friar Odoric of Pordenone 
who reached India soon after 1321. He travelled along the west 
coast, visited Ceylon ahd went up to the shrine of St. Thomas in 
* MaiiapOre/ His account of some Hindu customs and practices 
is obviously that of an eye-witness.. Lastly we have Friar Jordanns 
who may have reached India a little before Odoric ; in his writings 
he holds out to his brother friars in Europe the prospect of extensive 
missionary work in the East. His mention of the Parsis and their 
mode of exposing the dead is among the earliest notices of this 
community in India. He Was appointed Bishop of Columbum 
(Qjuilon) in 1328, but it is hot known if he actually took charge 
of the office. Yet another monk, John of Marignolli, a native of 
Florence, deserves a passing mehtion ; he went out to China by 
land, like Marco Polo, as Papal legate to the court of the Great 
Khan'; he teft China by sea fr©» the celebrated port of Zayton 
in 1346 and reached Quilbn Where he spent some time before 
setting sail for the Coromandel coastto visit the shrine of St. Thomas. 
He also spent some time in Ceylon 1 and gives an interesting account 
of the Buddhist^ monks of the island. . Jv;*

r R. H. Major’s India in the fifteenth century contains a good collection 

I of the texts of these foreign travellers who visited India in the 1 5th 

century. The earliest European visitor to Vijayanagar whose 
] account has come down to us is the Italian Nicolo Conti who 

came to the City in 1420 or 142L He was a Venetian of noble 
family, who, when a young man, resided as a merchant in the 
I city of Damascus, whence he started on this travels to the East, 

* though in what year is not precisely known. He passed through 

[ Persia, sailed along the coast of Malabar, visited some parts of the 

interior of Hindustan, and also of the islands of Ceylon, Sumatra 
~ and Java. He returned to Venice in 1444 after twenty-five years 
of absence. He wrote nothing himself, but narrated his experiences 
to a papal secretary who wrote them down in Latin for his master’s 
^ information ; this was translated into Portuguese and from Portu- 

guese into Italian. The original Latin version is not extant. 

The first Indian city which Conti visited was Cambaya where 
he notices the number of precious stones called sardonixes and 
! also the prevalence of the custom of Suttee. At a distance of 

three hundred miles inland he comes to the great city of Vijaya- 
nagar, the capital of the great Hindu Kingdom of Medieval South 
India, Conti gives a description of the Vijayanagar court and its 
festivals, its currency and other matters. His description of 
Mailapur, the burial place of St. Thomas, is also interesting. 

At about the same time, there came to Vijayanagar the 
l Persian Ambassador Abdur Razzak, sent on an important mission 

!; to the Zamorin by Shah Rukh. He sailed to Calicut from Ormuz 

* in 1442 and. did not much like that city. His stay was cut short 
by a message from the Raja of Vijayanagar asking that he should 
be sent on to the capital without delay. Abdur Razzak went to 
Vijayanagar by way of Mangalore, was well received and witnessed 

•/ the Mahanavami festival. He emphasises the king’s absolute 

| „ power and his high esteem for Brahmans and the adnunistratiYe 

£■ activity of c Danaik. 3 Besides a splendid description of the City 

! of Vijayanagar, his narrative supplies valuable information or* the 

£■■■■ topography, administration and social life of the Hindu kingdom 

of South India in the 15th* century. Later some jealous merchants 
i from Ormuz cast doubts on his credentials with, the result that 
the ambassador came to be treated with less consideration than 
iy before ; he left Vijayanagar for Mangalore towards the end of 
1443, and Mangalore for Persia early in 1444. The record of his

mission is the testimony of a trained official on the state of adminis- 
tration and society at the time. The most satisfactory description 
of the work, however, will be found in the elaborate article by 
M. Quatremere, in the fourteenth volume of, the Notices et Extraits 
des Manuscripts , which comprises a great portion of the life of Shah 
Rukh, and the text, accompanied by a version in French, of two 
other extracts from Abdur Razzak’s history, relating respectively 
to the voyage of the ambassador of Shah Rukh to China and to 
that of Abdur Razzak himself to India ; the latter R. H. Major 
has rendered into English with notes in his India in the 15 th century. 

The Russian trader Athanasius Nikitin spent some years in 
the ' Deccan round about 1470 and travelled in the Bahmani 
kingdom which he entered by way of Chaul. His observations 
give details of the court, the army, and the condition of the people 
under Bahmani rule. With the beginning of 16th century the 
fbreign evidences become voluminous. This particular century 
witnessed some mighty rulers like Krishnadeva Raya, Rama Raya 
and Venkatapati Raya. The last sovereign may be regarded 
as the last flicker of the empire of Vijayanagar. The Portuguese 
established their commercial ascendancy in South India in the 
16th century. A stream of Italian travellers, traders, and jewellers 
visited India and have left valuable accounts of what they saw 
and heard in different parts of the country. 

Ludovico di Varthema of Bologna, an Italian gentleman and 
soldier who was eventually knighted by the Portuguese, travelled 
in India during the years between 1502 and 1508, and has left 
behind a Vivid record of his experiences. His credibility was 
doubted for a long time, but wrongly. His account of Goa and 
Calicut and other ports of the west coast and of the effects on them 
of the advent of the Portuguese and his description of the city 
and empire of Vijayanagar, contain much that is interesting and 
Valuable; Friar Luis, who was sent to that city by Albuquerqhe 
in 1510 elucidates the war-like activities of K^shnadeva Raya 
before his war with Orissa. 

The Portuguese Duarte Barbosa served the government bf 
his country in India, from 1500 to about 1516 ; he knew the 
Malayalam language very well and ‘spoke it better than the 
natives of his country. 5 He Was feiior (factor) in Cannaribre in 
1502V arid acted* an interpreter between Francisco Albuquerque 
and the king of Cannanore in 1503. He was valued’ as a writer 


Sources for medieval Atin modern Indian history 1 15 

by Gaspar Correa, and was employed by Albuquerque for his 
ability, though he did not support the policy of developing Goa 
at the expense of Cochin and Cannanore. Barbosa returned to 
Portugal between 1517 and 1518 and then gave the final touches 
to his narrative which covers much wider ground than the sphere 
of his official activities and includes a full description of Vijayanagar. 

Longworth Dames, the editor of Barbosa describes the value 
of the book in the following words : 

c The value of Barbosa’s work at the present day is principally 
geographical and ethnographical. Some of his historical references 
are of considerable importance, but, as he has distinctly stated 
himself his object was not to write a history, but to describe the 
people and the country and its products. In these respects he 
stands almost alone in his period, and his accounts are extremely 
accurate in many respects and show great powers of observation. 
This applies more especially to the South of India, where his long 
residence and his knowledge of one at least of the languages 
(Malayalam) gave him an understanding of the people, of which 
we find few traces among the writers of that period. 5 {The book 
of Duarte Barbosa by Longworth Dames, Intro. I, VIII). The 
work of Duarte Barbosa has been rendered into English from the 
Portuguese manuscript by Longworth Dames in 2 Vols. under the 
title of The Book of Duarte Barbosa and by Lord Stanley under the 
title of A Description of the Coasts of East Africa and Malabar in the 
beginning of the sixteenth century by Duarte Barbosa , both for the Hakluyt 
Society. ' - ■*- 

The Value of Other Portuguese writers for the history of the 
sixteenth cehtuty has been sufficiently recognised since Sewell 
emphasized it generally in A Forgotten Empire (1901) which included 
translations of the chronicles of Domingos Paes (1520-2) and of 
Fernao Nuniz, a horse-dealer who spent three years in Vijayanagar 
(1535-37) j besides part of letter written from Cochin by Manuel 
Barradas (12th December 1616) giving an account of the origin 
and course of the civil war then in progress in the kingdom of 
Vijayanagar. The Chronicle of Nuniz, composed in 1537, incor- 
porating the information gathered by him about the rulers of 
Vijayanagar from the foundation of the city, has- invested the 
most significant period of Vijayanagar history With flesh and blood. 
KrishnadOva Raya lives in the pages of history as no other ruler 
does, thanks to these two Portuguese travellers ; neither the 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


116 

Mussalman historians nor the inscriptions of that emperor exceeding 
300, not even the contemporary indigenous literature, could 
substantiate his unique role in South Indian History. Caesar 
Frederic, who visited Vijayanagar, a couple of years after the 
battle ofTalikota comments on the ruined greatness of the Imperial 
City. Ralph Fitch who spent the years 1583-91 in India, Nicolas 
Pimenta, visitor of the Jesuits in India at the close of the sixteenth 
century, the Dutch traveller John. Huighen Van Linschoten (1583) 
are other writers who have their own contribution to make to our 
knowledge of South India in their days. The contemporary 
Jesuit letters from South India often embody passing but vivid 
references to political events of the early seventeenth century. 
The affairs and trade of the kingdom of Golconda and the port 
of Masulipatam at that time receive much elucidation from the 
writings of the Dutch factor Schorer (1615) and the English factor 
William Methwold (1618-22) which have been edited by Moreland 
together with another Dutch account, anonymous, dating from 
about the same time. 

Besides being indispensable to elucidate the administration and 
social life of South India in Medieval times, the accounts of these 
foreign travellers throw light on the fortunes of the Portuguese 
power in India. Moreover, the Portuguese were fortunate in 
their historians during the sixteenth century, and the works of 
Joao de Barros, Gaspar Correa, Couto and F.L. de Castanheda are 
unequalled among the works of that period. e De Barros is the 
classical authority on the subject, and his full and comprehensive 
survey will always retain its value as a philosophical history con- 
taining the fullest summary of the geographical facts possible at 
the ti,me, and also as a fine example of literary style. 9 (Longworth 
Dames, The Book of D . fiarbosa , Intro . XX) % Correa and Castanheda 
are to be valued rather for their accurate accounts of events which 
came under their personal observation, as they were acquainted 
with India. Garcia de Orta, though not historical, can be grouped 
with the above writers as a supplementary to their accounts. The 
Commentaries of Albuquerque ed. by Birch 4 Vols. 1875-83 for the 
Hakluyt Society also throw some valuable light on the early 
history of 16th century South India.

history of Medieval India. But thpy are few and scattered when 
compared to the volume of indigenous Persian chronicles and 
foreign writings. Some of these inscriptions have been well 
studied and edited by a band of scholars, Indian and foreign, in 
volumes of Epigraphia Indica and Indo-Moslemica. They throw 
some light on the achievements of the sultanates also. The study 
of coins of these sultanates is interesting as well as instructive. 
Almost all the sultanates issued gold currencies after the Persian 
model. They have been studied and well catalogued by eminent 
numismatists like Lane-Poole, Nelson Wright, Richard Bum and 
Taylor. They supplement and corroborate the literary and 
epigraphical evidences. 

The Mughul Period 

The Mughul pdfiod forms one of the most glorious chapters 
in the annals of medieval and modem India. It is also one of 
the best studied periods. No other period of Indian History is so 
rich in its sources as the age of Mughuls. Many of the Mughul 
emperors Were themselves men of letters and have left us their 
records of the events of their reigns. The other members of the 
royal family have also written histories of their times. Moreover 
the Mughul rulers regularly maintained court historiographers 
and encouraged them to write the official histories of their times. 
The Mughul period is rich in foreign sources also. The coins, 
monuments and inscriptions also confirm the above literary 
sources. 

Considerable advance has been achieved in the field of Mughul 
history by a hoast of scholars, both European and Indian, since 
the days of Elphinstone and Lane-Poole. The Persian works of 
historical literature have been edited with critical notes by Erskine, 
A. S. Beveridge, Elliot and Dowson and others. Excellent bio- 
graphies have been brought out of the dominant rulers of the 
period. The adventurous life of Babar has been critically studied 
by S. M. Edwards, Rushbrook Williams and Lane-Poole ; Dr. 

S. K. Banerjee’s Humayun' Badshah (O.U.P. 1938) in two volumes is 
one of the best accounts of the unfortunate life of Humayun. 

K. R. Quanungo’s Sher Shah (Calcutta 1921) is a careful and well 
written life of the famous Afghan ruler of India in the 16th century 
based on the various Persian authorities dealing with the period. 
V.A. Smith’s Akbar the Great Mogul (Oxford 1917) and the interesting 
little book of Lawrence Binyon on Akbar (London 1939) provide

comprehensive and penetrating surveys of the achievements of 
Akbar. Beni Prasad’s History of Jahangir (2nd ed. 1930) is an 
exhaustive and critical study from all sources. Pages 441-77 give 
a detailed Bibliography. He says, about European accounts in 
general, e Their unfamiliarity with the country and its politics, 
their ignorance of Persian, their prejudices and their credulity made 
it impossible for them rightly to interpret what they saw.’ (p.455) . 
Maclagan’s The Jesuits and the Great Moguls Gh. V. p. 69-92, deals 
with the Jesuits as well as other Europeans at the court of Jahangir 
Dr. Banarsi Prasad Saxena’s History of Shahjahan of Delhi (Allahabad 
1932) is a most welcome addition to the critical monographs that 
have recently appeared on the lives of the Mughul emperors. 
Sir Wolseley Haig, in his foreword to the book, writes : c Saksena 
treats his subject with praiseworthy impartiality. Shahjahan, in 
his hands, is not “ The virtuous sovereign with hardly a blemish 
on his character ” depicted by contemporary Indian chroniclers, 
nor on the other hand, is he the monster of moral depravity described 
by some European travellers who have flavoured their pages with 
scandalous: gossip of the purlieus of the court.’ Pages I-XXX 
contain a critical discussion of the sources, Persian and European. 
There is also a classified Bibliography at the end of the book" 
p. 345-49. L.S. Jast’s Shahjahan (London, 1934), with all its 
inaccuracies, is an interesting contribution. K.R. Quanxmgo’s Dara 
Skukoh (Calcutta, 1934) gives a critical account of the life of Dara 
Shukoh, the mystic philosopher prince of Medieval India. The 
long reign of Aurangzeb has received^ the attention of so many 
scholars. , S. Lane-Poole’s Aurangzeb "(Rulers of India— O.U.P.

j The primary authorities for the history of the Mughuls are 

| mostly literary, consisting mainly of indigenous Persian accounts 
'j — official and non-official, and autobiographical. Official histories 

and court bulletins abound in volume in this period. This extensive 
Persian historical literature can be supplemented by a large volume 
of observations on Mughul India by foreign travellers and to some 
extent by numismatic and monumental evidences. Among official 
\ histories, we possess accounts of the reigns of the emperors from 
Alcbar to Bahadur Shah I. These were compiled by order, from 
the despatches, news-letters, treaties, orders and revenue returns 
preserved in the state archives of Delhi. Their value lies in 
j their wealth of topographical information, dates and names of 

j persons, their accuracy and minuteness of detail. The subject- 

matter in these official histories is arranged merely in chronological 
■; order with a dry succession of names, like a government gazette. 
But their value is unique to the historian. Though compiled 
from kings 3 point of view, these, histories do not suppress any 
defeats suffered by the imperial army or . any natural disturbance 
affecting any part of the empire. We can trace the major incidents 
stage by stage, day by day. On these official histories, S.R. 
Sharma’s estimate is worth reproducing. hefe : c Drawing upon the 
accumulated mass of material to be found in the govermment 
Archives and writing contemporaneously . with the events, their 
works unfold a. view of the history of the period which is very full, 
usually very accurate and always very vivid . 3 {.Moghul bibliography 

The Akbar Kama by Abul Fazl takes a high rank among 
the official, histories of the period. Abul Fazl wrote under state 
patronage ? and hence had all the facilities the state could place 
at his disposal. He obtained material from the record .office and 
from c the old members of the illustrious family and the servants of 
the, State . 3 Abul Fazl himself says, ‘ I examined both prudteC 
trUth speaking old men and active minded, right-actioneA young 
ones and reduced their statements: to writing ; ; The royal command 
was issued to the. provinces that those whb from old service 
remembered with certainty or with, admixture of doubt, the events 
of dad pash should; copy . out their notes and memoranda and 
submit ' them Court . 3 Among the Mughul historians, Abul 
Fazl was^ the -most gifted. The Akbar Nam ' wag f Written ’ at ’the

Timur and deals in detail with Humayun, and the history of 
Akbar’s reign is particularly full. The narrative goes up to 1602 
in which year Abul Fazl was assassinated at the instance of Prince 
Salim. The Akbar Mama is published in three volumes by the 
Asiatic Society of Bengal. It has been rendered into English by 
Henry Beveridge. A number of passages selected from all the 
three volumes can also be found in Elliot and DowSon’s History 
of India Vol. VI pp. 21-146. 

Ain-i-Akbari or Institutes of Akbar compiled by the same 
author as a result of seven years 5 labour gives a wonderful survey 
of Akbar’s empire. Its originality and historical value are high. 
V.A. Smith rightly observes ; 4 Even in Europe it would be difficult 
to find an authoritative compilation of a like kind until quite 
recent times .... Abul Fazl is entitled to the -gratitude of later 
ages for the industry and skill with which he handledhis embarrass- 
ing mass of material 5 {Akbar, The Great Moghul — p. 4) . The Ain-i~ 
Akbari (Vol. I) is translated from the original Persian by Blochman 
and the second and third volumes by H.S. Jarrett for the Asiatic 
Society of Bengal. 

Jahangir gave his patronage to the completion of a valuable 
dictionary called the Fkrhang-i~Jahangiri and the composition of 
historical works continued in his reign. Among the many valuable 
histories produced under Shah-Jahan and Aurangzeb, special 
mention must be made of the Padshah-Mama of Abdul ^Hamid and 
Alamgir-Nama of Muhammad Kazim. 

Emperor Shah Jahan wanted to have a grand history of his 
reign compiled on the lines and written in the style of Abul FazPs 
Akbar-Mama . Sadullah Khan recommended Abdul Hamid, as the 
proper man in that age capable of performing such a task, because 
he enjoyed among his contemporaries great reputation as a success- 
ful imitator of Abul Fazl 5 s inimitable Persian prose style. Old 
Abdul Hamid who was in . Patna was invited to the court in the 
second decade of Shah Jahan 5 s reign and entrusted with the work. 
He lived to complete the first twenty years of the reign. The rest 
was completed by Hamid’s pupil Muhammad Waris.. He was 
stabbed to. death by a mad student whom he kept with him. 

, The Padshah-M ama is the only detailed and the most authoritative 

history of the reign of Shah Jahan. The materials for this history, 
were drawn from state papers, news sheets, reports of daily occurren- 
ces at court and other official doei^nts, .* This V# read out to

the Emperor by his Wazir Sadullah Khan, and amended by him 
at the Emperor’s suggestion. £ The Padshah-Nama , therefore, has 
also the merits and defects of an autobiography, so far as the 
character and doings of the Emperor are concerned. Shah Jahan’s 
character is reflected in this court history, as he liked to portray 
himself’ (Quanungo’s Data Shukoh — p. 405). The Padshah-Nama 
is also useful for the life of Dara Shukoh. The Alamgir~Nama by 
Muhammad Kazim, compiled in 1688, contains the history of 
first ten years of Aurangzeb’s reign. The Emperor prohibited the 
continuation of this official history when the author presented it 
to him in the thirty-second year of his reign. All subsequent 
historians like Khafi Khan have profusely drawn upon it. 

Among the non-official histories of the period, mention must 
be made of Gulbadan Begum’s Humayun-Nama , Jauhar’s Taz~ 
kiratul-Waqiat , Nizamuddin Ahmad’s Tabaqat-Akbari, the Tarikh-u - 
Shershahi by Abbas, the Tawarikh-i~Shahjahani by Muhammad 
Sadiq and Muntakhabud-Labab of Khafi Khan. Nizamuddin 
Ahmad’s Tabaqat-i-Akbari has a high place among the medieval 
histories of India. As pointed out by Dowson : c It is one of the 
most celebrated histories of India and is the first that was composed 
upon a new model in which India alone forms the subject matter 
of the work, to the exclusion of the histories of other Asiatic countries. 
Both Ferishta and Shah Nawaz Khan, the author of the Maasir - 
ul-umara , have highly praised Nizamuddin’s work . . According to 
Ferishta* c of all the histories that he consulted, it is the only one 
he found complete.’ Shah Nawaz says, c This work cost the author 
much care and reflection in ascertaining facts and collecting 
materials and as Mir Masum Bhakkari and other persons of note 
afforded their assistance in the compilation, it is entitled to much 
credit.’ 

■It is . the general history of Muslim India which becomes 
fuller as it approaches the Mughul period. Nizam-ud-din was 
the military secretary of Akbar and knew him well. He is regarded 
as f perhaps the best historian of the period ’ by W- Erskine. The 
Tarikh-i-Badauni is a general non-official history of the Islamic 
world including an account of Akbar’s reign down to 1595* He 
freely criticises Akbar without any fear or favour. He is one of 
the orthodox historians of-jhe period. 

Muhtakhabu4-Lubab of Muhammad Hashim Khafi Khan is a 
;well written history, c commencing with the invasion of Babar, 


122 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


1519, and concluding with the 14th year of the reign of Muhammad 
Shah. 9 The author’s father was an officer under Murad Bakhsh. 
Khafi Khan himself conducted an embassy to Bombay in 1694. 
‘ His reflective style, description of the condition of society, and 
characteristic anecdotes, 9 writes Prof. J.N. Sarkar, ' save his work 
from the dry formality of the court annals, and he is specially 
informing with regard to Deccan affairs. 9 

The work is frequently referred to as Tarikh-i-Khafi Khan \ 
Khafi ('concealed 9 ) is supposed to have been the title j wittily 
conferred by Muhammad Shah upon the writer, Muhammad 
Hashim Khwafi, for his having concealed his work for a long time 
(owing to Aurangzeb’s* prohibition of writing official histories). 
Others derive the word from Khwaf a district of Kuhrasan near 
Naishapur. The historian was made Diwan by Nizamul Mulk 
in the reign of Farrukh Siyar. Khafi Khan began his work in 
1717, ten years after the death of Aurangzeb, as he himself seems 
to indicate in the introduction to the first volume and, completed 
it in 1733, to which date he brings down his narrative in the second 
volume. Khafi Khan has certainly borrowed much from court 
chronicles like Padshah-Nama> as nobody can help if. He was the 
writer of the period to utilise -the non-official sources like 
T arikh- i - Qandh ari i and herein lies the importance of his history. 
M. Elphinstone has based his narrative of Mughul history in his 
History of India, on the authority , of Khafi Khan’s book. • , 
But the scientific historians cannot be satisfied with the above 
court chronicles and private histories* whibh ate, after all* compila- 
tions. The^ historian naturally, wishes to go to, their very source^ 
to the raw-materials, Out of which the above general works have 
been compiled. Moreover, these Persian -histories are derivative 
by nature, as they were compiled from still earlier records: or 
documents written immediately after the events described- i Tb this 
latter class belong the vohiminous collections of letters or the 
despatches of the provincial Governor^ and g( nerals and the 
reports sent to , court by newswriters and ; spies d The summaries 
of such of these despatches, and reports as were read but before 
the emperors in the open court were preserved in the royal archives. 
These documents have been described as the ? A Minutes of the 
Proceedings of the Mughul Emperor, in Court. 9 , The Mughul 
emperors maintained a set of professional clerks, to take down 
these minutes of the proceedings of -the court. (As 'they were being 


SOURCES FOR MEDIEVAL AND MODERN INDIAN HISTORY ,123 

copied down, they became the Akhbarat or the News of the Imperial 
Court. 

Notable among the letters written during the period were 
those of Abul Fazl and of emperor Aurangzeb. They w r ere marked 
by elegance and ornate style and fanciful imagery and the letters 
of several writers like Jai Singh, Afzal Khan, Chandraban Brahman 
are still held as models. Even for the 1 8th century Mughul history, 
we have such Akhbharats. These news-letters of the Mughul 
period present the great historical events of the period in a new 
perspective, and furnish a wealth of corroborative evidence. They 
shed exclusive light on a few contemporary occurrences. They are 
of immense value to a reconstruction of the social and general 
background of the period. Their chronology is highly dependable 
and will be found useful in checking up the dates of certain events 
on which other sources are not quite definite. c In them we see 
events as they happened day by day, and not as they were dressed 
up afterwards by writers with a purpose. In them we see the 
actual hopes and fears, plans and opinions of those who made 
Indian history. 9 (J. N. Sarkar’s History of Aurangzeb , p. XVI) . Their 
form and manner of presenting historical material is quite distinctive. 

The Royal Autobiographies also come to the aid of historians in 
the reconstruction of the history of the period. Some of the 
Mughul emperors were men of high literary standards and have 
left us their autobiographies. Among these, the Tuzuk-e-Babari 
and the Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri form a separate class by themselves. 
The Tumk-e-Babari gives a true picture of its author and his achieve- 
ment. Babur had ‘a great love for nature, a trained eye for 
beauty , in all its forms, and a scientific keen observation. 9 The 
result is the production of an autobiography which echoes the 
political career of Babur. 4 Soldier of fortune as he was, Babur 
was hot the less a man of fine literary taste and fastidious critical 
perception. In Persian, the language of culture^ the Latin of 
Central Asia, as it is of India, he was an accomplished poet, and 
in his native Turki, he was master of a pine and unaffected style 
alike in prose, and verse; . .‘His battles as well as his orgies were 
humanized by a breath of poetry. . . . His memoirs contain the 
personal impressions and^acute reflections of a cultivated man of 
the world, well-read in Eastern literature, a close and curious 
observer, quick in perception, a discerning judge of persons and 
a devoted lover of nature, ^-one moreover, .who was well able, to 



124 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


express his thoughts and observations in clear and vigorous language 
.... The utter frankness and self-revelation, the unconscious 
portraiture of all his virtues and follies, his obvious truthfulness 
and fine sense of honour give the memoirs of this prince of auto- 
biographers an authority which is equal to their charm 5 (Lane- 
Poole). c Babar’s memoirs form one of the best and most faithful 
pieces of autobiography extant ; they are infinitely superior to the 
hypocritical revelations of Timur and the pompous declaration of 
Jahangir — not inferior in any respect to the expeditions of Xenophon 
and rank but little below the commentaries of Ceasar. 9 

Originally written by Babur in Turkish, the Titzuk-e-Baburi 
was translated by Abdur Rahim into Persian under instructions 
from Akbar. Ilminsky published the Turkish text in 1857. It 
has been translated into English by Mrs. Beveridge. 

The Tuzuk-'i-Jahangiri or the Memoirs of Jahangir is of very 
great value as the personal memoirs of the Emperor, mostly written 
by himself during the first eighteen years of his reign and by 
Muhamad Khan, the Bakhshi, during the nineteenth regnal year. 

• It provides detailed information on the personal lives of Jahangir 
and his nobles, with important occurrences in the empire. The 
imperial regulations are reproduced in full. Epidemics are 
described in great detail. Dowson speaks of it as a very rare work, 
almost unknown even in India itself. c It is a plain and apparently 
ingenuous record of all that its author deemed worthy of note ; 
taken as a whole the work is very interesting, and assuming that 
Jahangir is mainly responsible for its authorship, it proves him to 
have been a man of no common ability. He records his weaknesses 
and confesses his great faults with candour, and a perusal of this 
work would leave a favourable impression both of his character 
and talents. 9 (Elliot and Dowson, Vol. VI, pp. 284-391). The work 
has been translated into English by Rogers, the rendering being 
revised, edited and annotated by Henry Beveridge. 

Foreign Sources * The next source of information concerning 
the Mughul period is to be found in the writings of the foreign 
travellers and merchants who visited and resided in the Mughul 
court* These foreigners were highly popular in India in the 16 th 
and 17th centuries. They had sometimes access to the court and 
came in contact with influential Mughul Officers . They had ample 
opportunities to study the Indian conditions, manners and customsr. 
Though these travellers could not understand the real significance 


SOURCES FOR MEDIEVAL AND MODERN INDIAN HISTORY 125 

of Indian society and manners, yet their contributions have a value 
of their own and can by no means be ignored by Mughul histo- 
rians. f 

The Jesuit records occupy the first place in volume and impor- 
tance* These documents throw a welcome light on the life of Akbar 
and Jahangir. The Jesuit contact with Akbar began in 1580 A.D. 
and three missions were sent to his court from Goa. An account 
of the first mission was written in 1582 by Fr. Monserrate, a great 
scholar. Fr. Du Jarric, the French historian, published an account 
of the Jesuit missions in 1661, including the three missions to the 
great Mughul. Based on the original Jesuit letters, his work is of 
unsurpassed value for elucidating the religious activities of Akbar. 

4 The Fathers were highly educated men, trained for accurate 
observation and scholarly writing. They made excellent use of 
their opportunities at the Imperial court, and any book which 
professes to treat of Akbar while ignoring the indispensable Jesuit 
testimony must necessarily be misleading. 5 (V. A. Smith’s Akbar , 
The Qreat Moghul — page 7). These Jesuit sources have been 
thoroughly studied by scholars like Father Hosten, Maclagan 
and V. A. Smith. John Cornua -Alfonso's Jesuit letters and Indian 
History (1955) is the latest production on the subject. 

The observations of the foreign travellers throw a welcomd 
light on the 17th century India. These European travellers came 
from different countries by different routes on diverse missions — 
some in quest of trade, others in search of a career, and yet 
others, a small minority, to seek diversion in new countries 
among new peoples with strange manners and peculiar customs. 
Some of these travellers received a warm reception at the 
hands of the Mughul Emperors. The travellers also were 
men of learning and culture, keen, shrewd and sympathetic 
observers and occupied a privileged position at the imperial 
Qourt. Side by side with the Jesuit writings, the accounts of 
seven Englishmen, who travelled in Northern and Western ' 
India during the reigns of the Emperors Akbar and Jahangir, 
Ralph Fitch (1583-1591), John Mfldenhall (1599-1606), 
William Hawkins (1608-13), William Finch (1608-11), Nicholas 
Withington (1612-16), Thomas Coryat (1612-1617), and Edward 
Terry (1616-19), though not designedly written for publication, 
have the great merit of ‘naturalness of the narrative. 9 William 
Foster observes : £ Most of our travellers are seen, as it were, in 


historical <meLho:£>

undress, and we learn more of their characters than we probably 
should, had they been conscious that they were addressing a wider 
Audience. . . . For the travellers themselves one feels a genuine 
admiration. One and all, the men who here write their adventures 
so soberly and so modestly with many a shrewd observation and 
occasionally a flash of humour, ran daily great risks ; and in fact 
three of them found in the east their last resting-place, while a 
fourth died on the voyage home* Sickness, robbery, threats of 
violence were incidents that did not shake their cheerfulness, and 
there is little reflection in their narrative of the danger and hard- 
ships which were constantly their lot. 5 They had chosen to 
c wander to the unfrequented yule, and they accepted the conse- 
quences, however unpleasant, stolidly and without repining 5 
(Early Travels in India 1583-1619, ed. by Foster).* William Foster 
had done ah yeomen service by editing and annotating the most 
important among these travel books. 

. ** Sir Thomas Roe was sent as an ambassador from King James 
to the court of Jahangir to secure the right of English merchants 
to participate in trade and to obtain necessary protection. His 
Journal is of unsurpassed value in shedding light upon the splendours 
of the royal court. £ But he was too shrewd to allow the pomp 
and glitter to blind him to the real state of the country, and he 
brings out clearly the darker shades of the picture. . . . He saw 
clearly, too, the forces which were making for disintegration ; 
and though “ the time when all in these kingdoms will be in 
combustion 35 was not so near as he imagined, yet it was only 
postponed by the force of character of Shah Jahan and his still 
more capable son. 5 The Journal of Hawkins also is of inestimable 
value to know the political and economic conditions of 1 7th century 
India. The Journal of William Finch gives an excellent description 
of cities, towns, buildings and roads. De Laet 5 s account of the 
topography of the Mughal empire is partly based on Finch. But 
his- observations on Mughul politics are rather fanciful. The 
Journal of John Jourdain , edited by William Foster and published 
for the Hakluyt Society gives the commercial activities of the

English traders on the west coast, their relations with the Portuguese 
and their treatment by the local authorities, and the notices of the 
cities and towns through which the author passed in the second 
half of the 17 th century. Terry's Voyage (Purchas Vol. IX pp.1-54 
of reprint of 1777) is a useful supplement to Sir T. Roe's account 
of the life, character and policy of Jahangir. He also says some- 
thing about the Jesuits and the Portuguese. But his observations 
on the manners and customs of the people are notable. The 
letters of Master Thomas Goryat give a glimpse of the personality 
and character of Jahangir. 

Mention' may be made of other European travellers like 
Fran coys Pelsaert, De Laet, Pietro Della Valle, Sir Thomas Herbert, 
Johann Albert Von Mandelslo, Francois Bernier, Tavernier, 
Manucci, Thevenot and Careri. Their observations throw a 
flood of light on the different aspects of Mughul rule in India like 
the prohibition of slaughter of cows, freedom of conscience in the 
Mughul dominions, the festival of Nauroz and weighing ceremony, 
the skill of Indian barbers in massage, elephant fights, the order- 
liness in the Mughul camp and the defects in the military system 
of the Mughuls. 

De Laet’s Description of India, and Fragment of Indian History 
1625* e is a complete gazetteer of Jahangir's India. Although it 
is a compilation, it is a faithful and reliable compilation. 9 (Banerjee). 
The , account of Jahangir's reign in the * Fragmentum ' agrees 
substantially with the Persian Histories^ Francoys Pelsaert's 
Remonstrance is the account of a Dutch factor who was in India 
for Seven years (1620-27) . His observations on Sha^ Jahan are 
valuable. He describes Agra, Lahore, Kashmir and other towns 
which he actually visited. His remarks about the district courts 
and the prohibition of the slaughter of cows are interesting. 

Pietro Della Valle (1623-1627), an Italian traveller, has been 
described as the most eminent among those who travelled for 
pleasure, with no motive of trade or service, ‘ the most intelligent 
in apprehension and the most accurate in description. 9 He was 
born in Rome in 1586 and sailed for India from Bandar Abbas 
in Jam 1623. He visited Cambay, Ahmadabad, Chaul, Goa, 
iKkeri, Mangalore and Calicut, and sailed back from Goa to 
Muscat in November 1624. He honestly records the events which 
he witnessed, and makes a sincere attempt to be truthful. He

notices the freedom of conscience in the Mughul dominions and 
the respect for Hindu sentiments by the prohibition in Cambay 
of slaughter of cows. His letters e bring forth to the mind’s eye 
a vivid and life-like representation of men and manners as they 
existed in the early part of the seventeenth century in the Portuguese 
Settlements on the coast and in the native territories adjacent to 
them. 5 

Mandelslo, the young German traveller, was in India for a 
brief period of nearly a year in 1638. Olearius published the 
full narrative of Mandelslo in 1658, four years later appeared a 
French version by Wicquefort and this was rendered into English 
by John Davis. His account of the Mughul administrative system, 
his description of the city of Agra and others are highly 
interesting. 

Peter Mundy, who remained in India for eight years from 
1628 to 1636, gives a faithful record of the prosperity of the 
country and people of India under Shah Jahan, £ His account of 
the Moghul system of government is a mixed yarn, but his picture 
of the severe famine of 1630 and the description of the sufferings 
of the people is very touching. 5 * Among the French travellers, 
Bernier, Tavernier and Thevenot deserve consideration here. 
Thevenot died on his journey home from India. Tavernier who 
has been rightly regarded as the 4 Prince of Ramblers, 5 was a 
French commercial traveller who made six prosperous voyages 
to India between 1641 and 1666, visited many places from Surat 
to Dacca and Masulipatam and spent about ten years in this 
country. In 1665, in his last voyage, he had an audience with 
Aurangzeb making him some valuable presents and selling him a 
number of precious stones. Finally the jeweller reached Paris, 
at the close of the year 1668. As he was now sixty^three years 
of age and a very wealthy man, he resolved to retire from business 
and enjoy his fortune. He lived on to a wealthy and honoured 
old age, dying at Moscow in 1689. 

The voyages of Tavernier are valuable for their account of 
the social and economic conditions but not equally so regarding 
political events. His descriptions of Indian cities are noteworthy. 
We is a good authority on the Indian diamond mines in the 17th 
century. He confirms the evidence of previous travellers as to 
the oppressi ve provincial administrations. 

* B. P. Sakscna, HistoyTtfSha Johan XXV. “ * 



Sources for medieval and modern Indian history 129 

e With interesting but isolated pieces of information such as 
the foregoing the six voyages abounds. Tavernier narrates them as 
they occur. He does not seek, like Bernier to find the historical 
or social philosophy underlying his facts, or, like Thevenot, to 
weld those facts into a general account of India. Therein lies 
the difference between the commercial traveller and his more 
philosophical contemporaries * (Oaten- Foreign Travellers , p.192). 

Jean de Thevenot was bom at Paris on the 6th June 1633. 
He died near the small town of Miana in Persia while returning 
to his native land in 1(567 after an arduous journey of about four 
years. During this span of thirty- four years he travelled consider- 
ably in many countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. An ardent 
student of geography, ethonology and natural sciences, he assi- 
duosly studied the accounts of early travellers in which his uncle 
Melechisedech was highly interested. In 1666, he arrived near 
Diu after having visited Carthage, Egypt, Persia and Bagdad. 
After paying a visit to Cambay, Ahmadabad and Burhanpur, he 
jpe turned to Surat, where he witnessed the interesting ceremony of 
the marriage of the governor’s daughter. At this point, in his 
narrative, Thevenot devotes considerable space to a description 
of all the chief towns of North-West India, as well as of the previous 
history of Gujarat. Then he paid a visit to Golconda, Aurangabad 
and Daulatabad. He was the first European traveller to describe 
the wonderful cave-temples of Ellora. By the end of 1667 he 
sailed for Bandar- Abbas en route to France, but the rigours of his 
unceasing travels had impaired his health and he passed away in 
Persia at the age of thirty-four. After his death, his manuscripts 
were arranged and published by two of his friends. They passed 
through many editions and were translated into English, Dutch and 
German. 4 To the students of Indian History Thevenot's Voyages 
is a work of abiding, interest, for, nothing illustrates so well the 
merits and demerits of a foreign traveller’s account of a country so 
vast with a history so chequered and a culture so ill-comprehended.’ 
(Indian Travels of Careri and Thevenot , ed* S.N.Sen Intn. xix). 
Bernier, a well educated and experienced traveller came to India 
in 1658 and stayed for twelve years. His observations on the 
War of Succession are valuable. 4 He enjoyed unrivalled oppor- 
tunities of observation; was acquainted with the leading philosphers 
of his day ; was fully conversant with the newest historical and 
philosophical methods ; and was easily capable of looking beyond

the immediate occasion of an event to its ultimate cause. The 
result -was that the Historie de la dernier e Revolution des Etats du 
Grand Moghul , which was published in 1670* and the various 
letters which he wrote from India to his friends in France* are 
among the first authorities which the historian of Aurangzeb 
consults. 3 * 

Bernier was patronised by Danishmand Khan* a leading 
mansabdar at court. The War of Succession was described to 
Bernier by a French gunner in the service of Aurangzeb. The 
news of the tragedy of Dara* he obtained from the Portuguese, 
the Muhammadans, and the Dutch who were present in Bengal. 
He also consulted European merchants long settled in the country, 
ambassadors and interpreters. His description of Delhi, Agra 
including the Taj, and Kashmir is instructive. He also makes 
significant observations on the administration of justice in the 
Mughul • empire, criticising the panegyrics of some previous 
travellers. . 

Bernier's Travels has been translated by Gonstable, and 
edited by V.A. Smith, O.U.P. 1914. 

Another prominent writer on 17th century India was Niccolao 
Manucci whose voluminous writings form an important source of 
.information for the period. He left Venice while still a boy 
and spent his lifetime in India. His knowledge of Persian and 
Turki made, him enter the service of Dara, whom he served with 
loyalty and devotion. He was present at the battle of Samugadh, 
escaped to Lahore to join his patron and followed him to Multan. 
After many vicissitudes he again entered service under Prince 
Shah Alam in 1678 and observed much of Mughul politics and 
.social life. c But like most other European writers he is not to 
be depended upon where he .speaks not from personal knowledge 
or experience but merely from hearsay and bazaar gossip* 5 (S.R. 
Sharma). He .died in 1717. His Storia de Mogor translated by 
William Irvine is in four volumes, and an abridged edition of the 
same in one volume, containing the observations relevant to our r 
needs, has been published by Irvine’s daughter Margaret L. Irvine 
under the title— A Pepys of Mogul India (John Murray* London, 
1913). , ;

Mr. Irvine, its editor, says c a somewhat mingled yarn, comprising, 
among other items of information, a vivacious account of the 
author’s travels, which is scattered here and there in the history 
proper — a chronicle of previous Mogul Kings, a valuable treatise 
on tho Mogul court, administration and institutions, absurd 
supposed extracts from official chronicles, a useful description of 
the rest of India outside the Mogul dominions, and a full and 
important account of all Aurangzeb’s and part of Shahjahan’s 
reign , . . .For the closing years ofShahjahan and for all Aurangzeb’s 
reign Manned is a writer who cannot be ignored.’ 

Mr. Oaten Sums up the value of some of these writers in 
the following words : 

e Bernier appeals to the philosophic historian ; Tavernier to 
the arm chair reader who regards a book as a pleasant method 
of passing the time ; Manucci to the man who reads with the 
combined object of instruction and diversion. Each in his own 
sphere is unrivalled. If they are judged by their skill in arranging 
their facts and in synthetising them into a complete and well- 
balanced picture, Manucci is not worthy to be mentioned in the 
same breath with Bernier ; but considered merely as a store house 
of observed political and social information, the Venetian’s book 
is perhaps destined to be of more ultimate value to the historian 
of India.’ (, Foreign Travellers , p. 226). 

The accounts of Dr. Fryer and Dr. Careri supplement and 
corroborate the voyages of the above mentioned travellers of the 
17th century. Dr. Fryer’s narrative conveys to us a considerable 
amount of information relative to Sivaji and the Maratha power 
in general. He was in Persia and India during the nine years 
ending in 1681. His observations in India were confined to 
places on the Coromandel and Malabar ^coasts, and to trips a 
little way inland at various places between Cambay and Goa, 
For his limited field however, c he is a valuable authority, in 
addition to which he is an exceedingly interesting writer.’ He 
has an excellent account of the two cities of Bombay and Surat ; 
the more important aspect of his narrative is his analysis of the 
political condition of the kingdom of Bijapur. Moreover the 
historian of Sivaji cannot afford to neglect the Voyage of Fryer . 

I ^ Careri, a man of noble family, was bom in 1651 and died 
at Naples in 1725, long after he had concluded his totir round 
the world. A student of Jurisprudence and a lawyer by profession,

Gareri had attained the highest distinction in the University and 
secured the degree of Doctor of Civil Law. Some reason made 
him leave his country and seek peace abroad. As the editor of 
Churchill's Voyages and Travels says he did not go 4 as a vagabond 
trusting to fortune, but well provided with money to make him 
acceptable in all parts and gain admitance where others under 
worse circumstances could not.* Like his contemporary traveller 
Thevenot, he traversed the different European countries, and 
reached India, but unlike his French predecessor he did not under- 
take an ambitious survey of the Mughul empire. He furnishes 
graphic descriptions of the cities and camps he visited himself 
and his minute account of the churches and convents of Goa is 
accurate in every detail. He depended on hearsay for the history 
of the ruling dynasties and the civil administration of the country, 
and his narrative is not free from minor mistakes. Gareri has 
given a graphic and detailed account of Goa. His description 
of the c Fruits and flowers of Industan 5 is worthy of study. His 
description of the Kanheri caves is instructive . 4 Careri has some 

very interesting remarks on the Mughul theory of administration 
and on the land system ; a useful analysis of Aurangzeb’s revenue 
and wealth, and of the extent of his territory ; a critical dissertation 
on his absolute power ; and an examination of the organization 
of his army ... .It is as an authority for the condition of Aurang- 
zeb’s army in the midst of its Deccan campaign that he is indispens- 
able * (Oaten, Foreign Travellers , p. 236). 

Careri’ s volumes were first published at Naples in 1697-1700 
and first made known to Englishmen in ChurchilPs A Collection 
of Voyages and Travels (1700). But these seventeenth century 
travellers did not rise above the credulity of their age and were 
not adequately informed about the political condition and geography 
of India. Yet 4 as a contemporary source of Indian history they 
will always remain indispensable, but what cannot be dispensed 
with is not necessarily infallible 5 (. Indian Travels of Thevenot and 
Gareri , Intro, lxiv). We can close our account of the foreign 
travellers of 17th century by reproducing the remarks of 
Sir Jadunath Sirkar on the extent of their reliability and credulity. 

/'Their works are of undoubted value as throwing light oh 
the condition of the people, the state of trade and industry, and 
tfe tdktoty of Chris tian churches in India* Moreover, the criticism 
of Indian institutions by foreign observers has a freshness and

weight all its own. But of the political history of India apart 
from the few events in which they took part or which they personally 
witnessed, their report merely reproduced the bazaar rumours and 
the stories current among the populace, and cannot be set against 
the evidence of contemporary* histories and letters in Persian .... 
From their position these foreign travellers had no access to the 
best sources of information ; the state archives were closed to them. 
They visited the makers of Indian history only occasionally and 
as suppliants for favours ; hence they could not derive the oral 
information which only familiar intercourse with the highest 
personages in camp and court could have given them. Finally, 
their imperfect knowledge of literary Persian prevented them from 
using the written . annals of the time and checking the reports 
they had received orally/ ( History of'Aurangzeb , I p.xxi- — ii) . 

For the later Mughul history, we have a number court 
chronicles, Akhbarats, the East India Company correspondence 
and Maratha despatches. Among the secondary authorities, The 
Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan by H. G. Keene, New ed. 
London, 1887 ; The Fall of Moghul Empire by Sidney Owen, 
London, 1912 ; History of India — Elphinstone Bk. XII p. 675- 
753 ; Later Moghuls by W.Irvine ed. by J.N.Sarkar in two volumes, 
Calcutta ; Fall of the Moghul Empire by J.N*Sarkar in four 
volumes (Calcutta, Sarkar & Sons) may be mentioned. 

Sources for Maratha History 

The Maratha people who created an independent state 
under the leadership of Shivaji, late in the 17th century, played 
a very important part in Indian politics throughout the 18th 
century. The first European who attempted to write the history of 
the Marathas is Edward Scott Waring. His History of the Marathas 
was published in 1810 in London. The author worked for 
seven years in the English embassy at Poona and had full access 
to the records of the Marathas. 

But the greatest historian of those who attempted to write 
the history of the Marathas in English is James Cunningham 
Grant Duff. He was Captain of die native infantry of Bombay 
and Political Agent at Satara (1806-1822). The first edition of 
his well known History of Mahrattas was published in London in 
1826 (in 3 vols.). In its latest form (1921) it has been resurrected 
in two volumes edited by S.M. Edwards with an interesting * Memoir 
pf the Author * and a learned Introduction 


134 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


£ The want of a complete history of the rise, progress and 
decline of our immediate predecessors in conquest, the Mahrattas,’ 
writes Grant Duff, £ has been long feit by all persons conversant 
with the affairs of India ; in so much that it is very generally 
acknowledged, we cannot fully understand the means by which 
our own vast empire in that quarter was acquired, unti] this 
desideratum be supplied/ 

Fully aware of the difficulties of Robert Orme and Scott 
Waring, Grant Dufflaboured hard to make good their deficiencies 
with what result modem scholars best know. 

‘ Circumstances placed me , 3 he says in his preface to the 
first volume of the original edition, £ in situations which at once 
removed many of the obstacles which those . geijlemen (Orme 
and Waring) encountered, and threw materials within my reach 
which fyad been previously inaccessible/ But it may be said that 
Grant Duff prepared the way for all his successors providing a 
good starting point in the writing of a. History of the Maratha 
people. About the nature of Maratha sources, the advice of 
M. S .Elphinstone , to Grant Duff has "already been quoted. 
Grant Duff’s History is based on the Maratha records available 
in those times. On the subversion of the, , Peshwa’s Government, 
the most important of their public and secret correspon- 
dence were made over to him by Elphinstone, who was the 
sole Commissioner for the settlement of the conquered territory 
in the Deccan. Captain Dundas, under the orders of Elfhin- 
stone, allowed Confidential Agents employed by him to have 
access to the inass of papers which were found in the Peshwa’s 
palace. The Revenue and State accounts of the Maratha Govern- 
ment were examined for him by Captain Mac Leod, who was 
the first Assistant to the Commissioner. The records of the Satara 
Government were in Grant Duff’s charge and he himself had 
free access to the records in the Bombay Secretariat and of the 
old Surat Factory. The ' viceroy of Goa furnished him with 
extracts from the records of the Portuguese* Government. The 
Court of Directors, too, allowed him partial access to;flxe records 
in the India Office in order to corroborate a variety of facts derived 
from purely Maratha sources. Besides these . various records, 
temple records,' imperial" and royal deeds, state .papers, in the 
possession of men once high in authority under the Peshwa govern- 
ment were also procured to him. , - 



SOURCES FOR MEDIEVAL AND MODERN INDIAN HISTORY 135 

But Grant Duff wrote for his own countrymen, and it is 
natural that considering the materials made use of by him, more 
of them should have suspected that his narrative did not form 
the last word in the history of the Marathas. There are some 
loop-holes in his account of the Marathas. He has omitted an 
account of several of the expeditions of the Peshwas. He could 
not grasp , the full significance of the Maratha institutions- But 
yet it can be truly said that Grant Duff's History of Mahrattas 
‘ takes its place in the very first rank of historical compositions, 9 

The English historian of the Marathas failed to apprehend 
correctly the great moral which the Maratha history possesses 
for all ages. He has lent colour to the view prevalent until recently 
that the rise of the Marathas was due to fortuitous circumstances, 
and has compared this rise to the sudden conflagrations which 
often occur in the Sahyadri mountains. 

Mahadev Govind Ranade’s Rise of the Maratha Power , published 
in 1901, Ivas the first, of its kind written by an Indian, that too 
by a Maharashtrian. This book marks a milestone in Maratha 
Historiography., c The rise of the Maratha power, 9 he pointed 
out, c was not a mere accident due to any chance combination, 
but a genuine effort on the part of a Hindu nationality to assert 
its independence 9 ; and that e the success it achieved was due to 
a general upheaval, social, religious and political of all classes 
of the population- 9 His general introduction to Sahu'Chhatrapati 
and, the Peshwas 9 Diaries is, a very valuable sequel indicating the 
sound principles of his treatment. 

A History of the Maratha People by C.A. Kincaid and D.B. 
Parasnis, published in, three volumes in 1918 marks further progress 
in the field of Maratha Historiography. Parasnis was an inclefatxg^ 
able worker in the field of historical research. He is well known 
to the public as the author of the standard biography of Rani 
Lakshmi Bai of * Jhansi, of works on the Nawabs of Oudh, the 
navy of the Marathas and so on. His collections of Maratha 
letters are of very great value to the students of Maratha history. 5 
Whenever we speak of historical research in Maharashtra, the 
name of Rao Bahadur Parasnis comes prominently to our mind. 

. Among other materials mention may be made , of the works 
published .under, the auspices of the Bharat Itihas Samsodhak 
Mandal, a Society started in Poona with the object of advancing 
historical research, There are many critical essays which are gf

HISTORICAL METHOD 


great value to the students of Maratha history and some documents 
of historical value have been published in the journal and procee- 
dings of the Mandal. 

The name of G.S.Sardesai occupies a unique place in the 
field of Maratha historiography. His work has been described 
already. Besides the monumental work of Sardesai, there are 
other very learned treatises, such as Sarkar's Sivaji and His Times , 
and Surendranath Sen's Administrative System of the Mar at has, 
Military System of the Marathas , and Foreign Biographies of Sivaji ; 
The Third Battle of Panipat by Sejwalkar is also noteworthy. 

‘The royal period (1600-1700) of Maratha history differs 
fundamentally from the Peshwa period (18th century) not only 
in the extent but also in the nature of its historical records. Not 
only is there a striking difference between the wealth of con- 
temporary documents in Persian and English that illuminate the 
history of the Peshwas and the comparative poverty of the same 
for Sivaji's reign and those of his two sons . . . .The Marathas 
were more busy with the sword than with the pen ; no literature 
proper, no long history or biography was produced then. Hence, 
the Maratha Kingdom before the Peshwa period utterly lacks 
the state papers, detailed official histories, personal memoirs and 
letter books of which Moghul history is so full*. (J.N.Sarkar) . 

The historian of Sivaji has to cull out the sources in eight 
languages : Marathi, Sanskrit, Hindi, Persian, English, French, 
Dutch and. Portuguese. The chief documents that now survive 
are in English and Persian. On the other hand, the Persian 
and English sources were absolutely contemporary, promptly 
written with due respect to chronology, and carefully preserved 
since then. The writers belonged to a higher intellectual calibre 
than the Marathi chroniclers, as is clearly seen from a comparative 
study of the sources in the three languages. 

The chief Marathi sources for the reign 'of Sivaji are the 
Bakhars or chronicles and the correspondence of Maratha history. 
Though the Bakhars in general f contain merely a few particles 
of truth floating in a sea of absurdity 5 (Rajawade), the only 
exception is the Sub as ad Bakhar , written in 1694 at Jinji by order 
of Raja Ram. A small book of barely 100 pages, composed from 
memory without the help of written memoranda or documents, 
if suffers from chronological and topographical inaccuracies.- But 
yet it is the best Marathi biography of Sivaji. Later biographies 


SOURCES FOR MEDIEVAL AND MODERN INDIAN HISTORY 137 

have been based on this Marathi chronicle. This has been edited 
by K.ISf. Sane, 3rd ed. 1912 and translated into English by J.L. 
Manker as Life and Exploits of Sivaji (Bombay 1886). The later 
chronicles like Chitragupta Bakhar , Shiva digvijaya , Shiva Pratcpa 
etc. are no more than versions based on Subasad Bakhar } incorrect 
and pure guess work in many cases. No state paper is used, there 
is no idea of correct chronology. ‘ They are no more histories 
than the Sanskrit Puranas, and they bear the signs of being the 
production of some ignorant credulous dull-brained persons and 
not the work of any intelligent minister of state or scholarly author 5 
(Sarkar) * 

The Jedhe Sakavali is a bare record of events with dates main- 
tained by the family of Kanhoji Jedhe, a Coadjutor of Sivaji, 
covering the period of 1618-1697. The Jedhe Karina , a necessary 
supplement to the Sakavali , helps us to know some of the activities 
of Sivaji. The letters of Sivaji to his father and to his officers 
enable us to understand the inner motive and mind of Sivaji in 
his founding of the Maratha State. 

Among the Sanskrit works, the Radha-madhava~vilasa~champu by 
Jayaram Pindye, ed. by Rajawade (1922), the Siva Bharat by 
Paramanand, ed. by S.M. Divekar (1927), and Sivaraj-Rajya - 
bhishek-Kalpataru throw some light on the career, conquests and 
coronation of Sivaji. Sotne of these Sanskrit poems are very 
reliable and useful. They are generally in the form of epic poems 
and dialogues. The Siva bharal is an incomplete epic consisting 
of thirty-one chapters and 2262 verses. It generally agrees with 
Jede Sakavali with regard to the achievements of Sivaji. 

The Rajavyavahara Kosh , a Persian-Sanskrit dictionary of 
political terms in verse, compiled at the instances of Sivaji by 
Raghunath Hanmante, is very useful to understand the civil and 
military organisation of Sivaji. The Hindi poets Bhusan and 
Lai Kavi praise Sivaji extravagantly. 

The Persian sources which are generally contemporary in 
character are among the most useful materials for the history of 
Sivaji. Most of the Persian histories, official and private, written 
in the time of Aurangzeb deal with the life and exploits of Sivaji. 
Of them, the histories of Khafi Khan and Bhimsen are very valuable, 
Khafi Khan always associates, the name of Sivaji with some vitu- 
perative epithets, like the reprobate, the father of fraud, the daring 
free booter, and so on. But Bhimsen was an eye witness to some 


138 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


of the activities of SiVaji. His estimate of Sivaji is worth reprodu- 
cing : c a soldier, unequalled, skilled in' the arts of government, 
and a friend to men of virtue and religion 3 (Rawlinson and 
Patwardan) . 

The records of the English factories on the Bombay coast 
and inland relating to Sivaji begin from 1659 and contain notices 
of events as they were reported without any attempt to embellish 
them. The English at Rajpur and Karwar employed spies who 
travelled in Sivaji 3 s dominions and brought back news of his 
doings and plans. But these documents do not supply information 
on all the achievements of Sivaji. They tell us something about 
the relations of Sivaji with, the English. They arc weak on the 
biographical side of Sivaji ; Dr. Fryer who was in Surat in 1673 
gives a vivid account of Sivaji 3 s army, 4 more splendid 3 than 
the contemporary Mughul forces. 

As we have already seen, several foreign travellers visited 
India in the 17th century. Some of them like Bernier and Taver- 
nier, Thevenot and Carre either knew personally Sivaji well or 
heard of his activities in the South. It is, therefore, natural that 
Sivaji should find a place in their published and unpublished 
works, though, their information cannot be always taken to be 
true. The historian Robert Orme was familiar with some of the 
works of these travellers. Of these Abbe Carre visited India 
twice (1668 to 1671) and on the second occasion travelled overland 
from Surat to Fort St. George. His History of Sivaji ^ though 
defective in some respects, contains a comparison of Sivaji with 
Ceasar. e It Is needless to say that Carre’s work is of unequal 
value. His account of the two sacks of Surat, the Maratha raid 
info Bardes and.SivajPs conciliatory policy towards the European 
merchant nations is . substantially correct, but there is much in 
his history and its sequel that is no better than ordinary bazar 
gossip. About the early career of Sivaji, he was hopelessly ignorant. 
Like Cosme da Guarda, Carre was also an enthusiastic admirer 
of Sivaji and in him we come across an impartial witness who 
testifies to the respect arid admiration in which the Maratha 
hero Was held not only by his officers and subjects but also by 
his enemies and adversaries 3 (Sen, Foreign Biographies ). 

The- value of Memoire of Francois Martin (of Pondicherry) is 
the highest imaginable for Sivaji V Karriatak expedition. His 
agents were frequently in. attendance in .the . camp of Sivaji and 


SOURCES FOR MEDIEVAL AND MODERN INDIAN HISTORY 139 

the reports .they brought back were immediately entered in his 
diary* 

Martin served the French East India Gompany for a couple 
of years. In 1670 he was at Surat and heard a rumour that Sivaji 
contemplated a second sack of that wealthy emporium of oriental 
trade. As an ally of Sher Khan Lodi of Valikanda-puram, Martin 
closely watched the political movements in the neighbourhoods 

He was fully aware of what was going -on in Western India* 
In 1675 he received some letters from Monsieur Baron, then at 
Rajapur, telling him of Sivaji’s fresh conquests at the expense of the 
King of Bijapur. At the instance of French East India Gompany, 
he wrote a daily journal of everything that deserved notice 
since his arrival in Madagascar, and these notes were later continued 
after he came to India. For our purpose Martin’s Memoire is of 
the highest value as it furnishes the best contemporary account of 
Sivaji’s Karnatak expedition and thereby forms a necessary 
supplement to Subasad Bakhar. The letters of the Madura Mission 

dated 1659, 1676, 1678 and 1682 throw some, welcome light on 
the activities of Sivaji and Venkaji in the Coromandel Coast. 

Of the Dutch writers, the accounts of Gautier Schcmten and 
De Graaf throw valuable light on the main incidents of Sivaji’s 
life. Schouten has referred to the first sack of Surat by Sivaji 
(VoL I 399-400). ‘ De Graaf, the Surgeon,’ says Orme, c made 

six voyages to the East Indies, in the service of the Dutch company. 
His first outset from Holland was in the year 1640, his last return 
in 1687, a period of remarkable length in such wearisome employ** 
ment. In each voyage he was detained several years abroad* 
and sent to different parts, where the Dutch had concerns or settle- 
ments and seems to have fared at them well. He gives much and 
various information. The first mention he makes of Sevagi, is 
where it might be least expected, when he was travelling in Bengal* 
when nearer the operations of Sevagi, he mentions him only 
once.’ . . '< •, J 4 - 

The Dagh-Register (Diary) of Batavia enables us to follow 
the events till 1665; The letters of the Dutch factors at Surat 
Vengurla and Karwar also come to our aid in elucidating the 
history of Sivaji. They corroborate the accounts of the above 
two travellers with regard to the sack; of. the city of Surat by 
Sivaji.

incidentally and some of the French travellers have devoted some 
interesting chapters to the career of Sivaji. The credit of first 
writing a systematic biography belongs to Cosme da Guarda 
whose Life of Sivaji (1695), though defective in several respects, 
makes some interesting and instructive observations on the great- 
ness and efficiency of Sivaji’s army in contradistinction to the 
Mughul forces, De Guarda wrote in Portuguese and described 
himself as an inhabitant of Goa. He was one of the admirers 
of Sivaji and was quite conversant with the manners and customs 
of Western India. His Life of Sivaji preceded Subasad Bakhar 
by one year but did not see the light till 1730. De Guarda’s 
biography gained immense popularity among the Portuguese 
officers serving in India. It may be inferred from De. Guarda 5 s 
writings that his Portuguese neighbour^ held a very high opinion 
about the generalship and statesman-like qualities of Sivaji. The 
Goa records are mainly corroborative. They elucidate the 
military, naval and diplomatic activities of Sivaji, the significance 
of the Chauth and other administrative arrangements. 

Portugueses e Maratas , z. Sivaji by Panduranga Pissurlenear 
(reprinted from the Boletim do Instituto Vasco da Gama) 
is the fullest and most scholarly work on the Portuguese relations 
with Sivaji and supersedes all other works on the subject. 

We can close our accounts of Foreign evidences of Sivaji by 
reproducing the estimate of Dr. S.N. Sen over these writings ; 

f To these intelligent observers we are indebted for the earliest 
biographies of the Maratha hero. It is futile to expect from 
them unimpeachable accuracy or impartial history, bat they have 
preserved for us a number of interesting anecdotes, contemporary 
gossips and incidentally some information of real historical value. 
Some of these foreign writers were men of good education and 
real learning, Fryer was a Doctor of Medicine, Bernier and Delion 
belong to the same learned profession. Thevenot was a man of 
wide cultural interests, Navarette, Carre and Ovington were 
clergymen ; but they all suffered from defects of tfie same kind, 
if not of the same degree. Ovington was guilty of two serious 
mistakes in a single sentence about the first sack of Surat, although 
he visited that city only twenty-five years after the incident. In 
spite of these obvious defects no serious student can afford to 
ignore the testimony of these European writers ; if they lacked 
accuracy and precision, they alone could and did transmit a 


SOURCES FOR MEDIEVAL AND MODERN INDIAN HISTORY 14*1 

faithful portrait of Sivaji as his contemporaries knew and saw 
him. 3 {Foreign Biographies , Intro, p. XIII — XIV). 

Some of the Kannada works of the 18th century are also 
helpful as they throw some side light on the careers of Shaji, Sivaji, 
and his successors. Among these we. may note,. Linganna’s Keladi 
Nripa Vijaya ; Govinda Vaidya 3 s Kanthirava Narasarajendm Vijaya , 
and the anonymous historical account called Hyder-nama. The 
two former are Kavyas of great merit. Linganna is supposed to 
have completed his work by 1763 ; Govinda finished his work by 
1648 ; and Hyder-nama was completed by 1782. Linganna 5 s work 
is a regular chronicle of the Keladi kings, while that of Govindayya 
is an account of the wars of the Mysore king Kanthirava Narasa 
Raja Odeyar. The Hyder-nama is an excellent biography of 
Hyder Ali, the Sultan of Mysore. Of these Linganna’s account 
covers a wide range of Maratha history with special reference 
to the parentage and lineage of Sivaji. If Linganna’s account is 
valuable for the earlier phase of Maratha history, Hyder-nama is 
helpful for the later phase of the Marathas in the 18th century. 
The anonymous author gives an authentic account of the many 
phases of Hyder All’s administration and his wars with the con- 
temporary Maratha Peshwas and other kingdoms. 

The Peshwa Period— 1707-1818 A.D. 

The two centuries that followed the death of Aurangzeb 
witnessed momentous changes in the history of India. The 
Mughul empire rapidly faded out as an effective force in politics, 
though its memory lingered on till the middle of the nineteenth 
century and influenced the trend of events like the memory of 
the Roman Empire. The Marathas spread their sway over nearly 
the whole of India under the great Peshwas. In the North, the 
English gradually asserted their political supremacy and caniO into 
conflict with all the native powers including the Marathas, The. 
nature of the sources for this period is quite different from .that 
of the previous periods . The Peshwas established a huge secretariat 
at Poona and carried on regular correspondence with their agents 
in different parts of India and with other native powers. This 
daily correspondence and other official records . form a useful 
source of information. The contemporary East India Company 
correspondence must also be taken into consideration. 

The primary sources for the study of Peshwa period consist 
Of . three categories (1) The Marathi official records popularly 


tflsfORlCAt METHOD 


142 

known as the Peshwa Daftars, (2) The Persian Records, (3) 
The English Records, popularly known as the Residency Corres- 
pondence. Students of Indian History are generally aware that, 
when the Maratha dominion was incorporated into British dominion 
in 1818, all its official records were carefully housed at Poona by 
the British Government and came to be, popularly known as 
‘The Peshwa’s Daftars 5 of which the late Mr. Jackson, a scholar 
of repute, remarked that c no Government in India owns a collection 
of vernacular state papers that approaches in interest or importance 
those of the Poona Daftar and it is the duty of Government to 
make them available to all students of Indian History. 5 

This daftar consists mainly of the original Marathi records of 
the Peshwa administration and about the contents of the records 
Mac Leod states : 

c The general contents of the Daftar under the Peshwas may 
be described as follows : — All accounts 1 rendered to the Government 
of the revenue and expenditure of the district, with the settlements 
of them by government ; the accounts of districts rendered by 
the hereditary district officers, and those of villages by the village 
officers, of farms, of customs, accounts of all alienations of the 
public revenue, whether Inam or otherwise ; of the pay, rights 
and privileges of the government and village officers ; accounts of 
the strength and pay of troops, and the expenses of all civil, military 
and religious establishments. In the Rozkirds were registers of 
all revenue transactions generally, together with all grants and 
payments, and more particularly the accounts of all contributions 
and executions levied on foreign states ; the whole of which were 
considered and exhibited in one comprehensive view in the 
Turjums. 5 * . ■ ... ■ 

These; Marathi historical records .were published by the 
Bombay Government itself in 1934 in 45 volumes edited by G.S. 
Sardesai under the title of Selections from the Peshwa’ s Daftar . But 
these records of the Peshwas come to an abrupt end, with the 
exception of a few papers, about the year 1782, because Nana 
Fadnis, who was in sole charge of the Peshwa’s Government at 
Poona, received and looked after all the despatches and state 
papers that reached the capital. When he died in 1800, all the 
official correspondence were transferred to his country residence 
m ManvaE, whence they found their way to Satara and came to 
published by R,B. Parasitic. They: also form the principal

contents of the Satara Historical Museum. Moreover after the 
close of the first Maratha War in 1782, Poona ceased to be the 
centre of Maratha politics. ! Mahadji Sindhia controlled the 
Indian politics of late 18th century. 

Another mass of Marathi records relating to North India 
during the 18th century is the Gulgule Daftar of Kotah, of which 
two volumes have been edited by A.B.Phalke. But they largely 
deal with Sindhians dealings with Rajaputana. 

The Patwardhan Papers , edited by V.V. Khare (14 volumes), 
give us news-letters from the Peshwa’s court and echoes of North 
Indian affairs of great interest, but these do not rank as state 
papers, except with reference to Poona politics. 

There are also the 13 volumes of Marathi extracts with 
English summaries, issued under the title of Selections from the 
Satara Raja's and Peskwa Diaries (Nine volumes of the so called 
diaries and four, supplementary volumes named Sanads and 
letters, Kaifiyats^ Treaties, Agreements and decisions) published by 
a private agency with liberal aid from the Bombay Government. 
But these were hot diaries in the true sense of the word, they 
contained only extracts from the daily account books, giving items 
of income and expenditure with grants and judicial decisions now 
and then. These Marathi records come to an end with the year 
1723, when the Treaty of Salbai closed the first Anglo-Maratha 
War and British 1 Residents began to be posted at the Maratha 
bdutts." The correspondence between these Residents and the 
Governor-general, as well as duplicates of the more important of 
the letters, written by one Resident to another or to the Governors 
of Bombay and Madras and British military chiefs, popularly 
known as* The Poona Residency Correspondence comes down to 1818 
when the line of the Peshwas ended and Maharashtra came under 
direct British rule. , , . ; 

• These Poona Residency Records consist of about a hundred 
files each containing from some 700 to 800 pages in manuscript 
and came to be saved from the firb set to the British Residency 
by Baji Rao when he took up arms against the British in the last 
Maratha War. They related to the political 1 affairs of almost all 
parts of India covering a period of 33 years from the appointment 
of Malet in 1785 to the annexation of the Peshwa’s dominions in 
<1818. c They form a mine 6f information of the highest value in

only of the Marathas, but of the various other Indian powers and 
thus they constitute the principal basis of history for practically 
the whole of British India. For the .affairs of Tipu Sultan, the 
Nizam, the Rajaput States, and the various Maratha Chiefs and 
confederates, these papers offer a virgin field to the research 
student^ and when published, they would render the present 
standard works of Anglo-Indian History mostly obsolete ’ (Sardesai). 

Prof. J.N« Sarkar and Sardesai have rendered a monumental 
service to the advancement of Maratha historiography by editing 
these .English records in 14 volumes, published under the authority 
of Bombay Government. These volumes form a necessary supple- 
ment to the Marathi series, and in many respects complementary 
to . the English records preserved in the Bombay Secretariat, of 
which G.W. Forrest edited four volumes of selections (one relating 
to Maratha history and three to British Indian) about 50 years, 

.ago. ‘ 

; . What enhances the value of these English records is that j 

they supply two elements which are wanting in the Marathi j 

records.. Their intelligence is far more accurate and widespread ! 

than that of the Marathas ; and the despatches of the English \ 

residents give a broader survey of Indian Politics and a deeper 
and more intelligent criticism of character and policy than is to be 
met within the terms of matter-of-fact Marathi letters. Therefore 
they enable us to reach the root causes of events and to trace j 
the wider movements of Indian politics in a degree unattainable 
by the indigenous Persian and Marathi sources* Several of 
these English Residents like Colet and M. Elphinstone were men | 
of high intellectual calibre, of extraordinary capacity, resourceful- 3 
ness and power of initiative and their spy system was also | 
-perfect. - , - / * i C ; f.;; ' ■’? 

There are some valuable Persian contemporary sources which I 
supplement, and where necessary correct, the narratives and dates : 
occurring in these English records. We can select only a few , i 
Persian chronicles and Marathi records which throw light on this 
period. They are : (1) a Persian Chronicle of Delhi from 1738 : : 1 

to 1798, described by J.N. Sarkar in the Proceedings of the Indian ; 
Historical Records Commission Vol- III (1921), (2) The letters of < ^

Persian secretary and agent. Apart from the defects in his memoir* 
it gives us the inside \iew of contemporary North Indian politics 
— or diplomacy below stairs — for several years* while the Resident’s 
despatches give us the official or front window view of the same. 
This work is the fullest and best history we possess of Shah Alain’s 
reign and Mahadji Sindhia’s doings up to 1792. Francklin’s 
Shah Aim * written in 1798* suffers from the defect that he missed 
this source, which was composed in 1806. Recently J.N. Sarkar 
has edited some of the Persian sources with a scholarly introduction, 
under the title c The Persian Sources of Maraiha History, ’ published 
by the Bombay Government in 1953. 

The third battle of Panipat has evoked the interest of so many 
contemporary chroniclers and historians. The Tarikh-i-Manazilu - 
l-Futuh of Muhammod Jafar Shamlu is the account of an eye 
witness of the battle of Panipat and the events leading thereto. 
The author states that 4 during the prime of life 5 and 4 for the 
space of flve-and-twenty years 5 he was constantly with Ahmad 
Sulfan Abdali* and having accompanied him several times to 
Hindustan, became well acquainted with the whole series of royal 
marches from the city of Kandahar to the metropolis of Shah- 
Jahanabad. The author himself was present on the field and 
witnessed the circumstances with his own eyes* He learnt other 
particulars from persons of credit and sagacity* and having written 
them down without any alteration* designated the work by the 
title of Manazilu-l-Futuh or Victorious marches . Kashi Raj Pandit’s 
account Of the Fmiipat events* as found in Col. James Browne’s 
translation has been edited with valuable notes and appendices* 
by principal H.G.Rawlinson (O.U.P. 1926). 4 The literature of 
this campaign is immense,’ writes Rawlinson, 4 and a study of it* 
even from Marathi documents, would alone occupy a large volume. 
The Persian sources have yet to be adequately catalogued and 
examined.’ In their absence Kashi Raj’s c is the most detailed 
account we possess of the battle* and is the work of an eye-witness 
who evidently desires to give an impartial narrative of what he 
saw and heard. He had many friends in both armies and was 
equally impressed by the gallantry of the Marathas and by the 
masterly strategy of their opponent the Abdali monarch ’ (Intro- 
duction). Sejwalkar’s account of the Third Battle of Panipat 
published by the Deccan College, is the latest addition on the 
literature of the battlev

Another valuable contemporary account in Persian has been 
translated by Sir J.N. Sarkar in the pages of the Islamic Culture 1 
(Vol. VII No. 3 p. 431-56). It is entitled ‘An original Account 
of Ahmad Shah Durrani’s Campaigns in India and the Battle of Panipat 9 
from the Persian Life of Najib-ud-daulah (British Museum 
Persian Manuscript 24, 410). 

The Nigar-Nama-i~Hind of Saiyid Ghulam Ali covers the 
ground in much greater detail. For the battle of Panipat £ the 
author informs us that his authority was a Brahman of the Deccan 
named Rao Krishna Rao, who was in the service ofNawab Shuja’u- 
d-daula of Oudh, and was present at the interview which the 
Maratha envoy Bhawani Shankar had with him J (Dowson) . 

The Sources for the study of British Indian History 

A proper study of the rise and growth of British dominion 
in India is absolutely indispensable for the proper understanding 
of the present day problems and institutions. There are possibly 
in this period more numerous and more markedly divergent 
points of view, though a smaller number of gaps, and more urgent 
and vital problems awaiting solution that are of significance to the 
present and the future of our land than in similar periods of the 
past. The manuscript materials for the study of British Indian 
History preserved in the National Archives and other State 
Departments of India, as well as in England, are enormous. In 
India itself there is a vast volume of material dealing with almost 
every phase first of the Company’s activity and then of the Crown. 
It is calculated that the India Office in England (now merged in 
Commonwealth Relations Office) alone contains more than 50 
thousand volumes in its record collection. It is an, inspiring centre 
of research, and many historians have availed themselves of the 
facilities which are generously provided by t|ie authorities of the 
department. As has been repeatedly pointed out by many 
historians, the difficulties of the student of Modem Indian History 
consist not so much in the collection of material as in its selection. 
In addition to these published and unpublished records, there have 
been accumulated a staggering amount of pamphlet literature 
embodying the swaying passions and prejudices of the men who 
played a part in the drama of European enterprise, and of the 
collections of letters received and copies of letters despatched 
.which it was usual for men in high offices an those days to keep 
for themselves. Thus it is impossible for any one, however vast

and encyclopaedic his knowledge may be, to discuss authoritatively 
the enormously wide range of manuscript material extending from 
the seventeenth to the nineteenth century. So we may concentrate 
on some significant and indispensable works on the history of 
British India and include in this category all printed works, whether 
they are works of travel, parliamentary papers or solid historical 
treatises. Considerable progress has been achieved in the field of 
Modern Indian History both in the matter of writing general 
histories and in the publication of historical corpuses. The 
sifting of data, the tentative inference of conclusions, the process 
of historical criticism and the final shape of presentation accom- 
panied by a due regard to the nature and character of the material 
used and to the genius of the period, topic or movement taken 
up for study, haye been, on the whole, done with a fair amount 
of success and an appreciable crop of excellent work has resulted. 
The credit for these results should go to those venerable pioneers 
in this field like Robert Orme, Bruce, James Mill, Marshman, 
Thornton* Keene, Beveridge and Elphinstone, to whom we owe 
so much for keeping the subject afresh and alive. Among these, 
Orme and Bruce wrote under official patronage. An earlier 
writer, Richard Cambridge made the Anglo-French struggle in the 
Carnatic the subject of his study. Jonathan Scott’s, Deccan published 
in 1794 contained more than its title signified. Francklin’s Shah 
Alum had been the standard work on the subject until Sarkar 
wrote his Fall of the Moghul Empire (4 Vols. 1932-50). The first 
quarter of the 19th century introduced many writers whose works 
are regarded as classics of Indian History. John Malcolm, Mount- 
stuart Elphinstone* James Mill and Beveridge wrote the story of 
the consolidation of the British power in which the two former 
had also played their parts. Mill’s History of British India described 
by Macaulay during the debates of 1 833 as 6 on the f whole tire 
greatest historical work which has appeared in our language since 
that of Gibbon 5 required a considerable effort to read. * The 
subject was little known, the treatment extremely detailed and 
the tone of the work disagreeably censorious. The utilitarian 
philosopher described with scant sympathy a society which rested 
on caste and tradition. The want of personal knowledge of 
India which he maintained was an aid to impartiality, deprives 
it of touches which might have softened its rigid outlines. Sympathy 
and imagination are conspicuously lacking. But the value of the

work lay in its mass of information and its analytical power. It 
took rank among the classics of its time and won its author a 
place in the India House. 

Henry Beveridge, an English advocate, published in 1862 
A Comprehensive History of India based as much as possible on 
original and official sources. It is a work in three large volumes 
with rich illustrations. Princep wrote his book in 1819 and called 
it Political and Military Transactions in India in his time. The 
interest of some writers went beyond their own times and the 
regions which they served. Some carried their labour 'home. 
Grant Duff utilised all the Maratha documents and brought 
out his History of the Mahrattas as already noticed* Wilks completed 
his History of Mysore , Elphinstone began his History of Rise of the 
British Power in India in retirement, which he decided to leave 
incomplete in 1841 ; c I have no talent for narrative/ he wrote, 
£ e and that is enough to have been fatal to historians as incomparably 
superior to me as their subjects are to mine/ 

But these earlier works of Indo-British History had their 
defects. The dross oFromahticism and sentimentalism which can 
easily permeate research in mOre antique epoches, affected these 
histories in a greater measure. They made mistakes and occa- 
sionally failed to understand the people about whom they were 
writing. From the middle of the 19th century onwards, the 
character of books on Indo-British History underwent a change. 
The Europeans began to love the country of their adoption. Among 
the histories of the post-Mutiny period, four standard histories 
occupy a prominent place. They are Vincent Smith’s Oxford 
History of India, the several voltrmed Cambridge History of India , P.E. 
Roberts’s History of British India, Garratt and Thompson’s, Rise 
and Fulfilment of British Rule in India, Roberts’s volume is superior to 
the Oxford History. c For Political Perspective, the Cambridge 
History, as usual, is dull but reliable, Thompson and Garratt 
readable but biased’ (Philip Woodruff). Professor Dodwell’s 
British India is also a standard work on the period. The sources 
of Modern Indian History may be studied in brief under the 
following heads (I) the Portuguese, (2) The Dutch and the French* 
and (3) The English. 

Every school-boy knows , that the English were preceded by 
a number of other European adventures like the Portuguese, the 
Dutch and the French. The ascendancy of the Portuguese lasted 



SOURCES FOR MEDIEVAL AND MODERN INDIAN HISTORY 149 

for a century from the 16th century to the 17th' century. c They 
were the great buccaneers of Asia and roamed about the Indian 
Ocean and the Bay of Bengal with the ability and daring of their 
forbears* They lacked both a polity which could give unity and 
stability to their scattered energy* and an ideal which could inspire 
the descendants of Vasco Da Gama with the spiritual vigour and 
fertile energy of the early pioneers 5 (S.A. Khan). 

The achievements of the Portuguese in the East have been 
examined and interpreted by Danvers with appreciable fulness 
under the title of The Portuguese in India (2 Vols.) Caxnoen’s Lusiads 
(1553), summarises * the achievements of Portuguese conquerors in 
a language of suppressed vigour and classic purity 9 . There are 
also notices, commentaries and biographies, left by the Portuguese 
governors and viceroys which are absolutely indispensable for a 
proper understanding of the Portuguese India in the 16th and 
17th centuries. The Hakluyt Society deserves the thanks of all 
historians for the variety, volume, and scope of its investigations 
intp Portuguese history. The vigorous personality of Albuquerque 
may be studied in his Commentaries while Vasco Da Gama’s Journal 
of the first voyage shows the prejudicial and narrow mentality 
and outlook of the early Portuguese. c Portuguese histories were 
written in a vein of pronounced racialism but their mistakes can 
be corrected by works in Persian and Arabic which covered the 
same ground. 9 (S.A. Khan), The translations of Du Jurric, 
Moh&errate, Duarte Barbosa and Albuquerque have thrown a 
flood of light on Portuguese relations with India. The works of 
P. L. Cabral, Jao pe Barros, Gaspar Correa, Godinho and others 
also provide useful sources of information about the political and 
social conditions of Portuguese India. 

For the achievements of the Dutch, Colombo and Madras 
have published most useful selections from the records of the 
Dutch in India and Ceylon. In the Colombo Record Office, there 
are more than 3000 volumes of “ General Records 99 and 700 
volumes of the Proceedings of the Council. Very few of the 
standard works in Dutch have been translated into English and 
the gap in our knowledge of the organisation and powers of the 
Dutch Company has not yet been filled. The multi-volumed 
Corpus Diplomaticum Neerlcmdo-Indicum of Heeres and Stapel contains 
some remarkable Dutch documents which throw a flood of light 
p;n the achievements of the Dutch in India, The Batavia Dagh

Registers also supplement and corroborate the information of the 
above documents. 

For the activities of the French and English East India 
Companies in the 17th century, we have abundant materials of 
varied nature. The records of their activity have been preserved 
in a series of luminous works which are at once the pride of English 
scholarship, patience and industry. No scholar has rendered 
greater service to a proper interpretation of this period than 
Sir William Foster. His monumental work on English Factories in 
Indian and Court Minutes of the East India Company are a model of 
solid research. Besides the work of Foster, the historical researches 
of Yule and of Hunter hav£ made us familiar with the doings of 
pioneers of trade and industry, and we can follow the progress 
of Madras or. of Bombay in the 17th century. The economic 
aspect of the century has been thoroughly examined and inter- 
preted by Moreland. The personality of Sir Josiah Child, the 
dominating figure in the Council of Directors from 1677 down to 
about the end of the 17th century, is clearly exhibited in his forceful 
despatches written to the E. I. Company from London. Colonel 
Love’s Vestiges of Old Madras is very useful for this period, while 
the records of the Surat Factory and some Bengal Factories have 
# been utilised by Anderson, Yule, and others. The Indian Travels 
of Bernier, Tavernier, Manucci, Thevenot, Careri should not be 
ignored for this period. The manuscript materials of the India 
Office Library, the National Archives of India and other places 
have been listed by Mr. S. A. Khan under the title The Sources 
for the History of the British in the \lth Century . C.R. Wilson’s 
Early Annals of the English in Bengal is also useful for this 
period. Talboys Wheeler’s Madras in the Olden Times can also be 
consulted. 

The primary sources for the 18th century history mainly 
consist of contemporary state papers, supplemented by Marathi 
and Persian records. The volume of correspondence with the 
servants of the E.LC. in India reached enormous proportions. 
They had to keep -very detailed records of their daily transactions 
for the perusal of their masters in England. These discussions were 
entered at length upon the records of Council Meetings and were 
designated Consultations or Proceedings. This has led to the 
increase of the mass of documents which supply abundant historical 
ritateriah of first rate importance. These records have been 


SOURCES FOR MEDIEVAL AND MODERN INDIAN HISTORY 151 

carefully preserved both in India Office Library and in the 
National Archives of Delhi. Some of these records have been 
listed and calendered by Forrest, S. CL Hill and others. The 
Cornwallis correspondence has been edited by Denison Ross in 
two volumes. They provide a useful source of information on the 
relationship of East India Company with the native powers of 
India. We have also the correspondence exchanged between the 
East India Company represented at Fort William in Calcutta and 
the Court of Directors in London, popularly known as The Fort 
William Correspondence . These letters are a veritable mine of 
information regarding the history of the Company in India. The 
Government df India decided long ago to publish these letters 
in extenso divided conveniently into 21 volumes and edited by 
eminent scholars. Only a few volumes have come out so far. 

These letters give a true picture of the state of Company’s 
affairs at a critical time of its history. The ignorance of Indian 
land revenue system on the part of the English and the resultant 
confusion ; the anxiety of the Company to extend their trade and 
commerce not only to every part of India but also to the neigh- 
bouring countries like Nepal and Tibet ; the drain of specie and 
the consequent scarcity of silver leading to experiments in bimetal- 
lism and gold currency ; — all these are adequately described. 
The letters give an insight into the actual workings and the evils 
of Clive’s Dual system. They also depict the rather unstable 
political conditions of the times. There are also occasional 
glimpses of the social conditions in the country. On the whole, the 
documents of the Fort William Correspondence are indispensable 
for the correct understanding of the East India Company’s affairs 
in the 18th century. There is also a lot of material on the 
Company’s relations with other rival European powers, with the 
titular Mughul Emperor Shah Alam, Shuja-Ud-Daula, Nawab 
Wazir of Oudh, the rising power of the Rohillas and the Sikhs, 
the Company’s faar with Mysore, the Maratha affairs, and the 
threatened invasion of Abdali from the north-west. 

The India Office Library, The National Archives of India, 
The Madras Record Office, The Admiralty and War Office 
Records, the Archives de Pondichery and Archives du Ministere 
Colonial (Paris) contain much unpublished matter, to which may 
be added such printed English records, as the Records of the 
Fort St. George, Military Consultations, 1752-56, the Siege

Diary, 1757-9, The letters of Kirkpatric and others. The available 
material is almost endless, and is still increasing. 

We have also a number of standard contemporary and later 
specialised books on this period. Orme’s Military Transactions , 
supplemented by Clement Downing, R.O. Cambridge, Colonel 
Wilks on the South Indian Wax's form the chief works on this 
period. Dodwell’s Dupleix and Clive is a valuable book concerning 
the first half of the 18th century. The works of Holwell and 
Vansittart also glow with the first spring tide of a heroic adventure. 
Wo have the chronicles and annals composed by persons who had 
taken active part in the campaigns or in the administration. 
Among these, the monumental Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai has 
been unique as a piece of record rare among Indians. It reflects 
as has been well remarked by Sir Frederic Price, the 6 inmost 
thoughts and reflections of an extremely able, level-headed oriental, 
and of his criticisms — which at times are of the freest character — 
of his fellows and master. It is a strange mixture of things trival 
and important ; of family matters and affairs of state ; of business 
transactions and social life of the day ; interspersed with scraps of 
gossip, all evidently recorded as they came to the mind of the 
diarist, who might well be dubbed the 4 ' Indian Pepys.” Homely 
as is its diction, there are in it descriptions of men and things which 
are vividly life like, and passages which are startling ; some in 
their pathos, and others in their shrewdness/ 

This unique contempoi'ary diary throws a welcome light on 
the troubled politics of South India in the fateful years that saw 
the disintegration of the Muhammadan power in the Carnatic and 
the growth and final settlement of the conflict for dominion between 
the English and the French. Ananda Ranga Pillai occupied a 
most influential position in the French Service and retained his 
rank and importance even down to his death only just a few days 
before the surrender of Pondicherry to General Gpote in 1761. 
Ranga Pillai’s Diary has run to twelve volumes in its English 
translation (by J.F. Price and I^.H.Dodwell, Madras 1904-1928), 
in spite of the fact that there were several gaps in the narrative 
now available, some running on for months at a strefeh. Ranga 
Pillai is seen at his best when writing of Dupleix and of his defects 
of temper and character, He was only 52 years of age when he 
died. £ Thus disappeared an acute Indian observer who was far 
i^rmf d on political matters than arty other Jmhan of the 


SOURCES FOR MEDIEVAL AND MODERN INDIAN HISTORY 153 

times and his diary contains more authentic details of a political 
nature than that which any other Indian at Pondicherry could 
have kept. He knew most intimately all that was going on in 
the Indian quarter and was very accurate and valuable in watching 
the course of the trade and feeling the pulse of the popular senti- 
ment. 5 

The Life, of Lord Clive by Sir George Forrest, also Lives by Sir J. 
Malcolm and G. B. Malleson are some of the works on the period. 

The above works may be supplemented by Verelst’s Government of 
Bengal and William Bolts 5 s -4 Dutch Adventurer under John Company . 

The literature on Warren Hastings is enormous. His 
versatile and mysterious negotiations continue to evoke the passion- 
ate devotion of a band of disciplined scholars. 6 Opposition and 
criticism of his whole administration alternates with fulsome 
eulogy and sickly sentimentalism 5 (S.A.Khan). 

The principal authorities consist of the Proceedings of the 
Bengal Council and Select Committee, preserved in duplicate at the 
National Archives and in the India Office Library. Selections of 
the official despatches of Clive and Warren Hastings have been 
edited by Sir George Forrest. The works of S. G. Hill, Long, 
Marshman, Keene, Dodwell and S. C. Hill are well known to all 
the students of the period. ‘ There is no good full-dress Life of 
any Indian statesmen or soldier of the first rank. Of shorter Lives } 
those in the series ‘ Rulers of India 5 are often good ; of longer 
Lives, Gleig’s Warren Bastings is almost unreadable j Sir George 
Forrest Clive is badly arranged. For the controversies centering % 

on Hastings 5 actions the reader may be referred to Sir James 
Stephen, Sir John Strategy, H. Beveridge, Burke and Macaulay. 

For Hastings 5 impeachment, see the contemporary full report 
published by Debrett. The Oxford History is almost uniformly 
unsatisfactory on Hastings ; Miss Sydney Grier is a special pleader 
but informing ; Mr. P. E. Roberts is good. 5 (Garreatt & Thompson 
p. 666.) Penderel Moon's Warren Hastings is the latest and most 
impartial account of the achievements of Warren Hastings. This 
is well written, readable and fully documented. For the Anglo- 
Mysore Wars under Warren Hastings and Tipu, the primary 
authorities consist of Wilks 5 History of Mysore and for Comwalli 5 s 
campaign A. Dirom (Narrative of the campaign) and for the last 
campaign A. Beatson’s View of the origin and conduct of the war with 
Tippoo Sultan . Roberts’s India under Wellesley has not yet been 


154 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


superseded by any other recent publication on the subject. The 
correspondence of most Govei nors-General has been published ; 
Cornwallis correspondence has been edited by Denison Ross in 
two volumes ; Wellesley’s despatches, edited by Montgomery 
Martin, and the Duke of Wellington’s, edited by S. J. Owen, are 
illuminating and instructive. The administration of East India 
Company has been well tackled by a band of scholars like Kaye 
and others. Keith’s Constitutional History of India has become a 
classic. 

The first half of the 19 th century offers great scope and oppor- 
tunity for research workers, as the materials have not been properly 
tapped, and only a few full-length biographies of the leading 
actors have been published. H. T. Prinsep’s History of the Political 
and Military Transactions in India during the Administration of the 
Marquess of Hastings is a solid piece of work, in which the achieve- 
ments of Hastings are vividly described in a simple and direct 
style. £ Kaye’s Life of Metcalfe is a good solid Victorian biography 
with plenty of letters and minutes quoted in full. Edward Thomp- 
son’s is much more likely to appeal to the general reader, but 
there is a tolerable deal of Thompson to every penny worth of 
Metcalfe ’ (Philip Woodruff) . Malcolm and Grant Duff have 
become classics and are familiar to all students. We also need 
detailed biographies of Lord Amherst and Lord William Bentinck. 
Besides the Political Proceedings of the Government of India at the 
India Office and the National Archives, there are the Ellenborough 
papers in the Public Record Office, and the Auckland and Broughton 
papers in the British Museum. The number of contemporary 
publications is voluminous and includes works by Havelock, 
Outram and Burns. The literature on Afghan Wars is also 
abundant. Sir H.M. Durand published his work The First 
Afghan War and its Causes and was followed by Havelock’s Narrative 
and J. W. Kaye’s History of the War in Afghanistan . c Kaye, like 
Colonel Wilks on Mysore, is an admirable writer, excellent reading 
and excellent history ’ (Garratt and Thompson). Lord Colchester’s 
History of the Indian Administration of Lord Ellenborough gives official 
letters only ; Sir Algernon Law’s India under Lord Ellenborough is 
also valuable. The literature on Indo-Sikh history is also volumi- 
nous. J. D. Cunningham’s History of the Sikhs is a masterly survey 
of theT subject. He had neither the opportunity to consult the 
original records nor the inclination to carry on a sustained and 


SOURCES FOR MEDIEVAL AND MODERN INDIAN HISTORY 155 

laborious inquiry. There are also some valuable books by travellers 
e.g. by Drew and Vigne, Syad Muhammad Latif’s History of the 
Punjab and W. M. Gregor’s History of the Sikhs supplement the 
information of the above works. H.R. Gupta’s History of the 
Sikhs may also be consulted. The life of Ranajeet Singh has 
evoked the interest of both the contemporary as well as modern 
historians. Sir Lepel Griffin’s little book and Hon. W, Osborne’s 
The Court and Camp of Ranajeet Singh are contemporary works on 
Ranajeet Singh. N. K* Sinha’s Ranajeet Singh is the latest biography. 
The articles of Sita Ram Kohli on the army of Ranajeet Singh 
in the pages of the Journal of Indian History are also worth men- 
tioning in this respect. The Punjab Government Records which 
have been published include important material relating to the 
Delhi Residency and Agency , 1807-1857 ; The Ludhiana Agency 1808- 
1815, and The Lahore Political Diaries 1847-9. At present, Sardar 
Ganda Singh has been actively conducting research on the various 
problems of Indo-Sikh History. His recently published c The 
Punjab in 1839-40 ’ is a good collection of records of the time of 
Ranajeet Singh. 

A number of works exist on the Administration of Dalhousie 
and the Mutiny; J. A. Baird’s Private letters of the Marquess of Dal- 
housie, Sir Edwin Arnold’s Marquiss of Dalhousie* s Administration 
and Sir W. Lee Warner’s Life of the Marquiss of Dalhousie are worth 
mentioning. On the Sepoy War of 1857 Kaye and Malleson’s 
book is still regarded as the best general history. Books like 
Cooper’s The Crisis in the Punjab , W. H. Russel’s My diary in India, 
G. O. Trevelyon’s Cawnpore should not be neglected. ‘ This 
literature is enormous ; and it can be supplemented by biographies, 
which exist of all the great soldiers who either won fame now or 
began careers which led to fame hereafter.’ 

The nine decades that followed the assumption of direct rule 
in India by the British Crown constitute the most formative period 
of Modern Indian History. The establishment of a centralized 
government which firmly maintained law and order throughout 
the country, the progressive improvement in the means of commun- 
ication both within the country and outside, the spread of the 
new education on Western lines leading to the rise of an official 
and professional class with a common outlook were powerful 
factors that promoted the political unification of the country. 
British policy was governed by the operation of two rival and 



156 


historical method 


opposite motives ; on the one side was the liberal wish to hold j 

India as a trust to be returned to its people at the proper time ; j 

on the other the natural conservative desire to put off the day of f 

reckoning as far as possible, to be in no hurry to let go the brightest 
jewel in the British Crown. The gradual Indianisation of the j 

higher government services in response to the growing and insistent f 

demand of the c educated Indians/ the introduction and develop- j 

ment of representative institutions, slow and halting at first, but \ 

more rapid and definitive since 1909 under the stimulus of claims 
based on the progress of self-government in the colonies are proof 1 

of the liberal view at work. After the first instalment of consti- 
tutional reform in 1909, the first World War and the new political \ 

technique of Mahatma Gandhi quickened the pace of advance \ 

and the constitution was revised again (1919) and India set on ' j 
the road to parliamentary government. The conservative reaction { 

to this rapidly changing situation was to nurse the claims of the | 

hundreds of c Indian States ’ and of the minority communities, 
particularly the Muslims ; this was clearly seen in the federal 
constitution of 1935, forced by the attitude of the Congress to the 
constitution of 1919. The exhaustion of Britain after the Second 
World War, the c Quit India 9 demand raised by Gandhi even f 

when the war was on and pressed after its cessation, and the 
formation of the first Labour Government in Britain with a clear f 

majority in the House of Commons led to the recognition of India’s I 

claims to political independence, though this was coupled with a f 

partition of the. country into two sovereign States to satisfy the \ 

intransigent demand of Jinnah and his followers for a separate / 

Muslim State. Whether the pace of political and constitutional ■ 

advance thus forced by several concurrent causes, internal and f- 

external, has outrun the social conditions and technical resources j 

of the country, and whether the partition could have been avoided j 

by more patient statesmanship are questions that may not ever f 

be answered alike by all. , | 

£ The post-Mutiny literature is mostly reflective or explanatory, j 

an<l not so largely narrative as the literature dealing with the 1 

exciting events which resulted in the full establishment of British i 

rule everywhere. We now get abundant autobiographical material, 
the practice having become usual of writing your reminiscences 
afte retirement, even if you had done little beyond big game

historical value, and a considerable proportion justify their publi- 
cation, Official documents now keep a high standard. Gazetteers, 
reports, are often excellent, though their authors had no thought 
of producing literature.’ (Garratt and Thompson p. 668) . 

The above period must be studied with great caution, as the 
nearer we approach the present times, the greater is the temptation 
to mix up history with politics. Historians must be careful when 
they deal with problems which are the catch-words of political 
parties. 

* This period hals been traced in the colourless biographies and 
memoirs of the time. We have the Parliamentary papers of the 
period and the biographies, the contemporary documents and the 
secondary works which are. familiar to students of Modern Indian 
History. There are also biographies of many Indian statesmen 
and books of reminiscences, some of which are available in English. 
There is a Life of Michael Madhusudan Datta, the father of Modern 
Bengali Poetry and Drama. There are also Lives of all post- 
Mutiny Viceroys, and some of these were men of letters. The 
autobiographies and reminiscences of some of the contemporary 
Viceroys provide a useful source of information to understand the 
currents and cross-currents of the times. Lord Curzon’s monu- 
mental British Government in India contains much information 
difficult to obtain elsewhere. ’ (Garratt & Thomson) . Roberts’s 
Forty-one years in India , Sir Surendra Nath Banerjea’s A Nation in 
the Making , Edwin Montagu’s An Indian Diary contain some useful 
information on contemporary history ; for the achievements of the 
Indian National Congress, we have voluminous records of the 
proceedings of the Congress. They have been examined by Pattabhi 
Sita Ramaiah in his monumental work The History of Indian 
National Congress in two volumes. The writings of Tilak, Gandhi 
and Mrs. Beasant also provide some information on this period. 
Two distinguished Journalists, Lovat Fraser and Sir V. Chirol 
wrote on the achievements of Lord Gurzon and on the Congress 
achievements before the first World War, but they have become 
out-dated now. Since their time the flood of political and journali- 
stic works has been increasing. Reginald Coupland’s works may 
be supplemented by Babu Rajendra Prasad’s admirable book 
India Divided. The Viceroyalty of Lord Ripon by S. Gopal is worth 
noticing also. 

The British administration has been surveyed by a host of 



HISTORICAL method 


153 

scholars like Hunter, Sir Alfred ’ Lyall, and Sir Richard Temple. 
A. B. Keith’s Work on Indian Constitutional History (already noticed) 
is the most authoratative and well documented book on the consti- 
tutional development and administration of pre-independent 
India. The problem of the Indian States has been well tackled 
by Lee Warner and K. M. Panikkar. The Indian Nationalist 
Movement has been well traced in Laj Pat Rai’s Unhappy India 
and Mrs. Besant’s How India Wrought for Freedom* The Government 
of India has decided to bring out a scientific history of the story 
of Indian Freedom Struggle, mainly based on the official reports, 
newspapers and proceedings of the Congress. 

Such is the outline of the different sources for the study of 
the History of Modern India from 17th to 20th century.

The Development of Indian Historiography 

In the task of unveiling the wisdom of the East, the services 
of Western as well as Eastern orientalists can hardly be under- 
estimated. It was during the days of Warren Hastings that the 
first impetus was given to oriental research and a devoted band of 
scholars under the lead of Sir William Jones founded the Asiatic 
Society of Bengal in 1784. Colebrooke and Wilson followed his 
tradition and enriched the Proceedings of Society with their 
contributions, with a view to popularize the abstruse scriptures 
of the Hindus and the Sanskrit classics. Every branch of oriental 
thought came to be explored from a new approach, marked by the 
critical methods of science. 

The decipherment of the ancient Brahmi script by James 
Prinsep with the aid of some Indo-Greek coins in 1837 opened a 
fruitful epoch in the study of Indian antiquity. James Fergusson

first described the Rock-cut temples of India in 1845, and published 
his monumental History of Indian and Eastern Architecture in 
1875. General Sir Alexander Cunningham and Dr. James 
Burgess laid the foundations of Indian archaeology on sound lines 
(1862-90). Ancient Indian literature was studied and interpreted 
with great acumen by Burnouf, Max Muller, Lassen, Oldenberg, 
Kielhorn, Buhler, and several other scholars ; Bhagawanlal Indraji, 
R.L. Mitra, Sir R.G. Bhandarkar, and other Indian scholars 
besides Fleet, Rice, Griffith, Haug and other Europeans working 
in India contributed their own quotas ; the results of all this work 
which threw a flood of light on ancient Indian history and culture 
were drawn together in Smith’s Early History of India (1904) 
which furnished a dependable chronological framework for the 
first time. Medieval and modern Indian history naturally 
attracted attention earlier. Orme’s Transactions of the British 
Nation in Indoostan (1*763-78), Wilks’s Historical Sketches of Mysore , 
Grant-Duff’s History of the Mahrattas , Elphins tone’s History 
of India , and Mill’s History of British India are all rightly regarded 
as classics, Tod’s Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan is a magnificent 
work which suitably enshrined the annals of Rajput fihivalry and 
exerted a wide influence on literature and drama. Mention must 
also be made of the monumental collection of Persian chronicles 
by Elliot and Dowson in the History of India as told by its own Historians 
(1867-7?) and Hodivala’s Studies in Indo- Muslim History (1939). 
The discovery of India’s past had a large part in the promotion 
of Indian nationalist sentiment which manifested itself sometimes 
in an exaggerated stress on * Hindu Superiority,’ or * Indian 
Spirituality,’ though generally the feeling did not exceed the limits 
of a restrained and legitimate pride in the Venerable age and 
continuity of Indians civilization. The discovery of the enigmatic 
urban culture of the Indus valley (Mohenjo Daro and Harappa) 
in the twenties of the present century has gone some way to accen- 
tuate the feeling. An attempt is made in the following pages to 
give a brief sketch of the life and the services rendered by some 
of the European and Indian orientalists towards the elucidation 
of India’s heritage. 

1. Dr. RJG. Bhandarkar 

; "7" Among the oriental scholars, no name is field in greater 
veneration than that of Sir Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar. 
Dr. Bhandarkar was a great Sanskrit savant, reformer and reVivalist. 



DEVELOPMENT OF INDIAN HISTORIOGRAPHY 


161 


He was bom in 1837 of poor Maharastra Brahmin parents. His 
education began in the Elphinstone College of Bombay in 1853. 
His early life and career is a source of deep inspiration to young 
men of India. Later he worked as a Professor of Oriental languages 
for some years in the Elphinstone College* Bombay. He retired 
from. Government service in 1893. 

The literary activity of Dr. Bhandarkar is almost coeval with 
the starting of the c Indian Antiquary.* tie was for a long time 
member of the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. He 
contributed noted ; articles such as c The Age of Patanjali** 

4 The.Age of Mahabharata * and c Veda in India * to the Journal 
of the Royal Asiatic Society. 

Bhandarkar^ name was widely spread soon after the publica- 
tion of his brilliant article The Nasik Inscriptions* in the 'Transac- 
tions of Oriental Congress 187$.’ The . collected reports on 
Sanskrit manuscripts of Dr. Bhandarkar form vast store houses of 
historic information on a variety of topics. His reports are quoted 
with profound respect by all scholars* both European and Indian. 

Dr. Bhandarkar published his finest historical work ‘.Early 
History of the Deccan * in 1884. It embodies his considered 
views on the chronology of the various periods in the Deccan 
history. 

To commemorate the name and work of Dr. Bhandarkar* 
some of his disciples and admirers started an Oriental Institute in 
Poona towards the middle of 1915 which is now known as ' The 
Bhandarkar Institute.’ s 

2 . Beveridge 

Henry Beveridge* an English advocate, published in 1862 a 
comprehensive History of India based as much as possible on 
original and official sources. It is a work in three large volumes, 
and its full title is worth reproduction as it is a fair indication of 
its scope : c A Comprehensive History of India, Civil Military and 
Social, from the first landing of the English to the suppression of 
the Sepoy Revolt* including an outline of the Early History of 
Hindoostan.’ The early history is not of much value now, but 
the rest of the book is a monument of popular and at the same 
time authoritative writing* quite outspoken in its criticisms of the 
Company and its policies. The book is also very richly illustrated. 

3. Dr. Buhler 1837-1898. . - 

An Indianist of a very wide range of acquirements and the

very centre and chief promoter of Indological studies in Europe, 
Dr. Buhler was one whose activity has decidedly determined the 
progress of Indian research. The son of a clergyman and bom 
at Borstel, 19th July 1837, Dr. Buhler received his early education 
in the public school at Hanover. In 1 855, he entered the University 
of Gottingen. In 1858, at London, he became acquainted with 
Prof. Max Muller and the acquaintance soon ripened into intimate 
friendship. Through the latter’s influence, he got an appointment 
in the Elphinstone College, Bombay, as Professor of Oriental 
Languages. In 1880, he was appointed to the chair of Sanskrit 
and Indology in the University, of Vienna. It was amidst the 
congenial atmosphere of the Vienna University that he planned 
and partly completed the Encyclopedia of Indo~Ary an , Research) the 
greatest enterprise yet undertaken, in the field of oriental scholarship. 
A man of vast influence, friend of all and enemy of none, Buhler 
soon enlisted for his work, the co-operation of 30 different scholars 
in various parts of the world and the work was pushed through 
rapidly enough. The series contemplates to furnish all knowledge 
about the Indo- Aryans — ‘their history, religion, philosophy. Under 
his editorship nine .parts appeared including his own contribution 
on Indian Palaeography. 

His other literary activities were all concerned with compara- 
tive philology and Vedic mythology and these were contributed 
to { Orient and Occident ’ edited by Buhler’s own master, Prof. 
Benfey. The next great milestone in the road of literary activity 
ofBuhler ( was the inauguration of Bombay Sanskrit Series in conjunc- 
tion with Prof. Keilhorn, who was then in Poona. 4 The object 
of the series was to give young native scholars an opportunity of 
learning European methods of criticism in editing texts and to 
procure cheap and good editions of Sanskrit standard works. for 
use in Indian Schools and Colleges.’ Besides editing the four 
books of Pafichatantra,' he brought out for the same series the' first 
part of Dandin’s Dasakumaracharita. In 1875 he edited the historical 
romance of Bilhana, Vikramankadeva Gharita which he himself had 
discovered. Quite .early in his Indian career in 1 867 in co-operation 
with Sir Raymond West, he produced the famous Digest of Hindu 
Law. In 1886 followed his translation of the Laws of Mum in the 
Sabred Books of the East edited by Max Muller. His .range of 
scholarship included even the history of Sanskrit Literature. The 
n^'cegsity to fix mile stones in the long history of Sanskrit literature 



DfiVELOPEM^NT OF INDIA# HISTORIOGRAPHY 16$ 

led Buhler to a critical study of inscriptions , which, in turn resulted 
in the elucidation of the Hindu Period of Indian History. His 
85 articles in the Indian Antiquary mostly bear on the interpretation 
of Indian historical documents and it may safely be asserted that, 
during his time, no one did more in this branch of Indian research. 
The results of his epigraphic studies are to be found in two of his 
masterly treatises, on Indian Brahmi Alphabet and on Indian Palaeo- 
graphy (with 9 tables), works. of great value still. 

* He has rendered valuable service to the cause of Indian 
Religious History, European and Indian interest regarding one 
of the earliest religious systems of India, Jainism, dates from 
BuhleFs discovery of manuscripts pertaining to that faith. More 
than 500 texts and Jaina Prakrit manuscripts were discovered and 
purchased by Buhler and these were despatched to Berlin where 
it had the effect of awakening German scholars to almost unprece- 
dented literary activity. Berlin, became a centre of Jaina 
philology. £ Buhler had the true nature of a scholar — accurate, 
incisive, critical in his own work, helpful, kindly and stimulating 
to others.’ (C. H. Tawney). 

4. George Coedes. 

The foremost living authority on the history and archaeology 
of Indo-China. He is one of those scholars of the present gene- 
ration who have been steadily working on the impact of Ancient 
Indian Culture on the Far Eastern -countries. He is a great 
linguist. He has mastered Sanskrit, Khmer, Mon and Malay 
as well as the modern European languages. He is a prolific 
writer. He was for many years the Director of the French School 
of Archaeology at Hanoi, and contributed scores of articles on 
the different subjects of cultural expansion of India to the Bulletin 
of the French Archaeological Commission of Indo-China, He is 
a leading contributor to the c Bulletin of Hanoi school.’ He is 
engaged in editing the Corpus of Kambujan Inscriptions. And 
he has stated the main conclusions of his studies of many years 
in the comprehensive book called The Hinduised States of Indo- 
Ghina and Indonesia , first published in Hanoi in 1944 and sub- 
sequently in a revised form as a volume in the French History of 
the World issued from Paris. 

5. Alexander Cunningham,) 1814-1893 

The value of A. Cunningham’s contribution to Indian 
Historical Research cannot be exaggerated. He was one of the 



164 HISTORICAL METHof) 

t 

great pioneers who had to contend against not only prejudice and 
ignorance but also many other difficulties in the pursuit of a 
branch of learning that was then considered to be fruitless and 
unprofitable. He may be truly said to be the founder and .father 
of Indian Archaeology. 

Son of AUan Cunningham, born in 1814 and educated at 
Christ’s Hospital, he reached India in 1833. , He was the Executive 
Engineer at Gwalior and was a field Engineer in the Sikh wars. 
In 1862, he was appointed the Director of Archaeology in India 
and his. function was c to superintend a complete search over the 
whole country and a systematic record and description of all 
architectural and other remains that are remarkable, alike for 
their antiquity or their beauty, or their historic interest.’ Cunnin- 
gham published annual reports which contained personal descrip- 
tions of archaeological tours in specially interesting districts 
undertaken between 1862 and 1884 ; here is a great mass of 
information, systematized to some extent, according to the light 
then available. Each volume embodied the results of a single 
tour, published two or three years after the tour had been made. 
Cunningham’s reports aimed at exhaustiveness and thus in their 
time were believed to carry a certain final authority. In their 
entirety these twenty-three volumes bring together the results of 
the Survey of the Central and Northern part of India, at which 
General Cunningham and his assistants worked patiently for 
nearly a quarter of century. 

Apart from the official reports of his annual tours and his 
occasional contributions to the Asiatic Society of Bengal’s Journals, 
he edited the Corpus Inscription inn Indicarum I — Asoka Inscriptions 
and wrote the Bhilsa Topes, the Ancient Geography of Indict, based 
on the Itineraries of Chinese travellers, the Stupa of Bar hut, the 
Book of Indian Eras . and Makabodhi. After his retirement, he 
paid much attention to Numismatics on which he was an .eminent 
authority. In these and other respects, General Cunningham was 
truly a great pioneer, with an almost uncanny instinct for arriving 
at the truth,, even when, as sometimes happened, his reasoning 
was at fault * 

6. Elphinstone , 1779-1859 . : 

While Mountstuart Elphinstone has been rightly regarded as 
one of the eminent founders of the British Indian Empire, his 
Waitings have long remained unavailable for study, although they

can by no means be considered less valuable than those, for instance, 
of Munro and Wellesley, Sir George Forrest published in 1844 
a small sketchy volume of his 4 Minutes and Official writings/ 
and the same year appeared two volumes of his life by T.E.Cole- 
brooke. But they do not do justice to his remarkable career 
which in those days of advance in historical research one would 
like to examine critically from original sources. 

Buckland in his Dictionary of Indian Biography gives a long 
account about Elphinstone of which the following is an excerpt : 
c bom 6th October 1779, educated at the High School Edinburgh, 
went out to Bengal as a writer, stationed at Benares where he had 
to ride for his life when some European officers including the 
Governor-Generars Agent Cherry were murdered by order of 
Vazir Ali in January 1799. In 1801 he was appointed Assistant 
to Barry Close, the Resident at Poona. From 1804-8 he was 
Resident at Nagpur, when he was sent as envoy to the Afghan 
monarch Shah Shuja who received him at Peshawar on March 
5, 1809. Upon his return from this mission towards the end of 
1810 he was pdsted to the Residency at Poona, and after the 
conquest of the Peshwa’s territories he became the Governor of 
Bombay, which post he held for eight years. He wrote An account 
of the kingdom of Cahul and its Dependencies in Persia , Tartary and India , 
1815. It is more a diplomatic work. He wrote his History of 
India in 1841, for which he was called the Tacitus of modern 
historians and the Rise of British Power in the East edited in 1887 
by Sir E. Colebrooke. He was not ambitious, occupied his time 
with study and maintained his interest in Indian affairs, -being 
regarded as the Nestor of Indian Statemanship. He was a Vice* 
President of the Royal Asiatic Society. He combined through life 
a keenness for field sports with his love of books and the despatch 
of public business. 9 The character of Elphinstone, at a Jkter 
date, when he was governing Bombay, is best- sketched by 
Bishop R. Heber in his journal under the date 15th August 
1825. , ■ r ■ : 

Mr. Elphinstone is in every respect ah extra-ordinary man, 
possessing great activity of mind and body, remarkable talent for 
and application to public business, a love of literature and a degree 
of almost universal information such as I have met with in no 
other person similarly situated, and manners and conversation of 
the most amicable and interesting character. While he has been 



166 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


engaged in active political and sometimes military duties since 
the age of eighteen he has found time not only to cultivate the 
languages of Hindustan and Persia, but to preserve and extend 
his acquaintance with the Greek and Latin classics, with the 
French and Italian, with all the elder and more distinguished 
English writers and with the current arid popular literature of the 
day, in poetry and history, politics and political economy. No 
Government in India pays so much attention to schools and 
public institutions for education. He is one of the ablest and 
most amicable men I ever met with. 5 
7. James Fergusson, 1808-1886. 

Forgusson was a great pioneer in the realm of Indian Art 
and Architecture. He was the son of Dr. William Fergusson} 
He was born in 1808. In his early age, he came to India. During 
the years 1835-1842 he went on long tours visiting various localities 
in India containing or reputed to contain architectural remains 
and gathering materials for his projected works on the Art and 
Architecture of India. He joined the Royal Asiatic Society in 
J?840. He contributed brilliant papers on ‘ The Rock-cut temples 
of South India/ 4 Ancierit Buddhist Architecture in India ’ and so 
on. In 1855 his great work £ Illustrated Hand-book of Architec- 
ture 5 was undertaken at the request of John Murray. 1 This was 
afterwards enlarged into four closely printed volumes, the last 
being the History of Indian and Eastern Architecture (1876). This 
work of Fergusson/not merely satisfies the reader who takes it up 
with a view to satisfy his aesthetic tastes but it aims at the broader 
and deeper task of illustrating and explaining in the full spirit of 
modern architectural enquiry the entire body of Indian history 
and progress. J * 

One of the Fergusson’s greatest contributions to the realm 
of thought was his ‘ Tree and Serpent Worship / a monumental work 
prepared under the authority of the Secretary of State for India 
and published by the India Office in 1868. Fergusson was the 
first to point out that the serpent played an important part in 
the mythology of India and that its worship not only prevailed 
but considerably influenced $uch faiths as Jainism, Buddhism and 
^Vaishnavism. He died in 1886, loved and respected by all who 
knew him intimately. - A remarkable figure, 1 a versatile genius,

bered for the signal services he has rendered to the cause of pure 
historical studies. 

8. Jjp. Fleet , 1847-1917. 

A prince among the epigraphist-historians of India, Dr. Fleet 
occupied during his life-time the position of a founder and 
leader of Indian historical studies. A perfect master of Sanskrit 
literature, Dr. Fleet had a thorough grasp of the Kannada language 
in its old and medieval forms. This enabled him to collect the 
vast mass of Sanskrit and old Kanarese inscriptions, of which the 
Bombay Presidency was full, and month after month throughout 
the thirty years of his stay in India, he was educating the learned 
world by editing and interpreting these inscriptions. That Indian 
chronology is firmly fixed, that the science of Epigraphy itself 
has progressed by leaps and bounds is very largely due to him. 

He came to Bombay in 1867 and entered the revenue and 
executive branch of the Government of India. In 1872, he was 
appointed as the educational inspector in charge of the southern 
districts of the Bombay Presidency. In 1883, through the influence 
of Alexander Cunningham and Mr. Gibbs, Dr. Fleet was 
appointed as the Epigraphical Superintendent of Bombay Presi- 
dency. Later he became the Commissioner of Southern and 
Central Provinces. In 1897, he left India and settled permanently 
at Ealing and died in 1917. His first literary undertaking on a 
large scale was the publication for the India Office of a volume 
entitled * Pali, Sanskrit and Old Kanarese Inscriptions/ This 
useful and scholarly collection was later on followed by the publica- 
tion of his c Inscriptions of the Early Gupta Kings and their successors h 
This formed volume III of the Corpus Inscriptionum Indie arum, a 
splendid monument of exact scholarship and critical judgement, 
which by establishing the epoch of the Gupta Dynasty in 319-20 
A.D. provided the key-stone of Indian chronology. 

The next important publication of Dr. Fleet was " ^ The 
Dynasties of the, Kanarese Districts 3 incorporated in the Bombay 
Gazetteer Vol. I, Part II. Like R.G. Bhandarkar 3 s Early History 
of Deccan, it is a source book by itself. 

His fame as an indologist rests, however, not On the publication 
of the works we have mentioned above but on the endless series 
of epigraphic notes and historical notices in the pages of* Indian 
Antiquary . Between 1875 and 1891 he gave to the world of oriental 
scholarship 196 critically edited Sanskrit and old Kanarese inscrip-

tiom, together with disquisitions on the dates, pedigrees and 
facts disclosed by them. Between 1892 and 1910 he wrote largely 
on ancient place names and the identifications of their sites. Of 
his work and its value, thus writes Dr. Fleet himself : 

‘ I can only express the hope that writers who may wish to 
quote me will look to my later writings in preference to earlier 
ones/ 

9. Grousset — Died in 1952. 

He was the director of Musfe Guimet, Paris for many years. 
He was a great humanist and shrewd art critic. He was one of 
the leading French-Indologists in the first half of the 20th century 
in Europe. In the Footsteps of the Buddha , (an English version 
of his Sur Us traces du Buddha ,) is at once the most sympathetic and 
illuminating interpretation of Huien-Tsang and a fine commentary 
on the state of contemporary Hindu culture, in Central Asia. 
Besides numerous papers on eastern subjects, he wrote a two 
volume Hisloire de ! Extreme-Orient which is remarkable for the 
bibliographical notes it contains. In a series of 4 books constituting 
the Civilisations of the East series, he dealt with the Art of Iran, 
India, China and Japan. 

10. Hultzsch , 1857-1926 

Hultzsch was one of the greatest epigraphists of India. He 
was born in Dresden on 29th March 1857. He graduated in 
1874 fin the University of Leipzig and studied classics and oriental 
languages in Bonn. In 1882, he came into contact with Buhler 
in Vienna.! In 1886, he was appointed Epigraphist to the Govern- 
ment of Madras, a position which he held till he became Professor 
of Sanskrit in Halle in 1903. 

, The first literary work which he published after his first 
dissertation was an edition of the Baudhayana Dharma Sastra 9 Leipzig 
1884, which he dedicated* to Buhler. He was assistant editor of 
the Epigraphia Indica Volume I, 1892 and sole editor of volumes 
III — VIII and IX, pp, 1 to 144. He published three volumes 
of South Indian Inscriptions , Madras , 1890-1903 and finally the 
monumental edition of the Inscriptions of Asoka in the Corpus Ins crip - 
tiomm Indie arum VoLI 3 Oxford 1925. He was an accomplished 
Sanskrit and Prakrit scholar/ and was familiar with the chief 
Dravidian languages. Also Kavya and My ay a claimed his interest.

‘ They are all characterised by critical acumen, unbiassed 
reasoning, scrupulous accuracy and solid learning. Such qualities 
made him eminently suited for epigraphical work, and when 
Indian Epigraphy has at the present day reached such a high 
stage, a large share in the merit belongs to him. His writings 
throughout bear witness to the urbanity and gentleman-like 
frame of mind, which endeared him to everybody who came into 
near contact with him. 5 (Sten Konow). 

11. Kielhorn, 18404927. 

Kielhorn is one of the pillars of Indian Epigraphy. Born in 
1840, he was educated at Gottingen. He took his Doctor’s degree 
at Leipzig. In India, he was the Superintendent of Sanskrit 
Studies in the Deccan College, Poona. In conjunction with 
Buhler, he founded the Bombay Sanskrit Series and also with 
Buhler, he initiated the work connected with the search for Sanskrit 
manuscripts in Western India. On the death of Buhler in 1898, 
he succeeded in taking over charge of the responsible and laborious 
duties “of editor of the German Encyclopaedia of Indo-Aryan 
Research written by various scholars in Germany, Great Britain, 
India and America. He has given us, in the department, at the 
request of the Bombay Government, A Sanskrit Grammar which ran 
through four editions and is a standard guide for those who seek 
an introduction to the language according to the western method. 
We owe to him a fine edition of the Mahabhashya of Patanjali 
in the Bombay Sanskrit series. 

There is another line in which he established a reputation. 
About 1883 his attention was attracted to the ancient inscriptions 
of India. From 1886 onwards his labours were, in fact, chiefly 
devoted to epigraphic work. He edited a large number of Sanskrit 
inscriptions, from all parts of India, in the Indian Antiquary and 
in the Epigraphia Indica . In illustration of what his wide knowledge 
of Indian literature enabled him to do in this line* we may point 
in particular to his treatment of the Aihole Inscription of Pulakestn If 
of the Talagunda Inscription of Kakusthavarman and of the Junagad 
Inscription of Rudmdaman . He also applied himself largely to 
elucidating the subject of the various Hindu eras and other recko- 
nings chiefly in articles which appeared in the Indian Antiquary 
from 1888 to 1896. In this department we may further point 
to his Lists of the Inscriptions of Northern and Southern India , published 
fis Appendices to volumes 5 and 7 of the Epigraphia Indica, These

lists, with their supplements and the synchronistic tables of the 
Dynasties in volume 8 must always form the basis of work for any 
one applying himself to the history of India from fourth century 
onwards. 

4 We have lost, in Prof. Kielhorn, not simply a great scholar 
who will not easily be replaced, but one who was esteemed and 
loved by any one who had the privilege of coming into personal 
contact with him. Pie was the beau-ideal of both a scholar and 
a teacher. He was painstaking, complete, accurate in everything 
that he took in hand. 5 (J. F. Fleet.) 

12- Max Midler 

In the realm of Indian literature, Max Muller 5 s name is of 
great importance. He was the son of a German lyric poet and 
was bom in 1823. He took his education in the University of 
Leipzig in 1841. He was an eager and laborious scholar and took 
to the study of Sanskrit as his life’s passion. 

Max Muller’s luminous conception of and his devotion to the 
science of language are among his greatest qualities. In his 
Biographical Essays he points out how the tie of language is the 
strongest and dearest of ties. Again his depth and range of vision 
in regard to the panorama of human development are equally 
remarkable. He acquired the same by studying the science of 
language and the science of religion. 

Coining to the works of Max Muller, his Biographical Essays 
occupy a prominent place. We are able to grasp from these essays 
how Max Muller had a nature full of the noblest impulses, generous 
and loving in his estimates of men. His devotion to the study of 
Comparative Philology also finds ample expression in this volume 
as in \m other works. Max Muller gives in this volume the bio- 
graphy of eminent personalities such as Rajah Ram Mohan Roy, 
Keshavachandra Sen and Dayananda Saraswati, in a lucid manner. 
The volume deals also with two Buddhist priests, Colebrooke, 
Dr. Mohl Bunsen, and Kingsley. 

‘ India ! What can it teach us ’ is a famous volume contain- 
ing Max Muller’s lectures delivered before the University of 
Cambridge . . The book is one of great charm and value. 

Bidory of Ancient Sanskrit Literature* h a valuable book 
that has come from Max Muller’s pen and in it he deals with the 
Hindu sacred scriptures with insight and learning.

of Max Muller, In his preface he speaks of the Vedanta Philosophy 
as c a system in which human speculation seems to me to have 
reached its very acme.’ His object is c to give a more compre- 
hensive account of the philosophical activity of the Indian nation 
from the earliest times., and to show how intimately not only their 
religion but their philosophy also, was connected with the national 
character of the inhabitants of India.’ 

Another work is c Three lectures on Vedanta 'As the title 
itself suggests, the book contains three lectures delivered at the 
Royal Institution in March 1894. In the first lecture he deals 
with the origin of the Vedanta philosophy. The second lecture 
deals with the soul and god, while the third deals with the similari- 
ties and differences between Indian and European philosophy. 
His magnificent edition of the Rigveda with Sayana’s commentary 
was undertaken at the suggestion of Bumouf. 

Max Muller has given his ideas about the relation of language 
and thought in his book c The Siletian Horse-herd Other great 
works of Max Muller are : c The Science of Religion c The Science 
of Thought 5 and ‘ The Science of Mythology .’ But by far the most 
important evidence of his oriental scholarship was the monu- 
mental series known as ‘ The Sacred Books of the East.’ It was 
a magnificent conception to bring the whole of oriental knowledge 
in a series of encyclopaedic volumes. Canon Farrar has summed 
up his life’s work admirably by saying that he introduced and 
popularised Comparative Philology, that he showed the importance 
of Sanskrit, that he edited the Rigveda, and that he introduced 
into England the Science of Comparative Religion. 

13. James Mill , 1773-1836 

Among the older generation of historians, from whom historical 
research may well expect substantial contributions to the exploita- 
tion and elucidation of the knotty problems in the domain of 
research, we have no hesitation in stating that James Mill will 
hold the premier place. There is that atmosphere of scholarly 
brilliance about him, that attracts towards him many an ardent 
young inquirer, with confidence. He was born in 1773 ; son of 
a shoe maker, educated at Montrose Academy and Edinburgh 
University, he studied philosophy. He was the friend of Bentham 
and George Grote, and held pronounced views on political economy 
and utilitarianism. He was appointed to the India Office in 
1819 as an Assistant Examiner of Correspondence and by 1830 


172 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


was at the head of the office. He was the father of John Stuart 
Mill. 

The greatest literary work of Mill is his History of British 
India . In the preface to this book, Mill has claimed for himself 
the merits of patient and laborious investigation and of original 
and independent judgement. The claim is substantiated by 
the work. His history is remarkable for extensive and diligent 
research and Tor opinions which are peculiar either to the author 
or to the school of which he was a distinguished disciple. The \ 

fourth edition of the book was edited by H.H. Wilson with notes 
and continuation. Mill takes the narrative up to the close of ! 

the 18th century. With regard to the facts of his history, j 

the sources of information were more scanty and less pure than 
the historian suspected. c With very imperfect knowledge, with \ 

an implicit faith in all testimony hostile to Hindu pretensions, \ 

he has elaborated a portrait of the Hindus which has no resemblance 
whatever to the original and which almost outrages humanity* 

(Wilson) . *‘But notwithstanding the imputations which have I 

been urged to its disadvantage, the editor regards the history of £ 

Mr. Mill as the most valuable work upon the subject which has \ 

yet been published. It is a composition of great industry, of J 

extensive information, of much accuracy, on many points, of 
unrelaxing vigour on all 5 (Wilson) . 

14 Rapson , 1861-1937. 

E. J. Rapson was born at Leicester on 12th May 1861. Placed 
in the Pirst Glass of the Classical Tripos in 1883, he turned to 
Indian Studies. In 1887, he entered the British Museum as an 
Assistant in the Department of Coins, while his mastery of the 
Kharosthi alphabet pointed him out as the one to whom the 
task of editing the documents brought back by Dr. Aurel Stein 
from Chinese Turkistan in 1901 should be entrusted. In 1906, 

Rapson was elected to the Chair of Sanskrit at Cambridge. When 
the Cambridge History of India was planned by the University 
Press, Rapson was the obvious editor for its first two volumes. 

He was still able to ’give time to his professional work, arid 
in 1920, the Clarendon Press published the first volume of 
Kharosthi Inscriptions 1 discovered by M. A. Stein in Chinese 
Turkistan, which he had edited in collaboration with N.M. Boyer 
;ahd?; Bl Senart. The same editors produced volume II in 1927 
and volume III followed in 1929, edited by Rapson and his pupil

Prof. P. Noble. 

In the field of Numismatics, Rapson’s work is distinguished 
] by accuracy and completeness. His first book on the subject is 

j e Indian Coins' inBuhler’s Grundriss (1897) which summarises what 

was then known of Indian numismatics for the period before the 
j Muslim conquest of Northern India. It is an admirable guide to 

i the subject and is specially valuable for its bibliographical references . 

! 1908, after he had left the museum, was published his Catalogue 

of the Coins of Andhra Dynasty , the Western Satraps , the Traikutaka 
Dynasty and the i Bodhi 9 Dynasty in the British Museum, The catalogue 
in an excellent piece of work which still remains the standard 
account of the dynasties. 

I His three chapters in Cambridge History of India Vol, I on 

' Indian Native States after the period of the Maurya Dynasty, 

I on the Successors of Alexander the Great, and on the Scythian 

* and Parthian invaders are models of the treatment of numismatic 

material for history where written records are scanty or fail com- 
pletely. While editing the Cambridge History, Rapson published 
a little book on Ancient India (1914) which is an excellent primer 
on the subject, with valuable notes on topography. His work as 
editor of the Cambridge History of India Vol. I which appeared 
in 1922, is marked by all the special qualities which distinguish 
him. The second volume on Medieval India was planned by him 
and much work had been done by him on the chapters written 
j by Other contributors * His. untimely death before he had completed 

all the chapters which he intended to write himself has caused a 
great loss. 

15. BDMce , 1837-1927. . 

B. L. Rice was one of those European orientalists who were 
largely responsible for the rescue of the Mysore history of; ancient 
[ times from oblivion. He was one of the pioneer workers of acknow- 

ledged merit in Indian studies. Having acquainted himself with 
Mysore at a very early age in life, he held the posts successively of 
Head Master of the Central High School at Bangalore, Inspector of 
Schools in Mysore andCoorg (1865- 1868), Director of Public Instruc- 
tion in the Mysore State (1868-1883), Secretary to the Education 
t Department of .Mysore Government and finally became the 

Director of Archaeological Researches in 1890. A detailed 
epigraphic survey of the State was started and the results were 
published by the time he laid down his office in 1 906.

\*li 


The most important piece of work done by Mr. Rice was 
the collection of nearly 9000 inscriptions. The Epigraphia Carnatica 
series, initiated in 1886, contains twelve large volumes which are 
an indispensable source of information for the history of the Deccan. 
The general results of these collections were summarised in a 
separate volume entitled Mysore and Goorg from the Inscriptions . 
Among Mr. Rice’s discoveries may be mentioned the Minor Rock 
Edicts of Asokain the north of Mysore, the Talaganda Pillar Inscrip- 
tion disclosing the history of the Kadamba dynasty, the Sravanabel- 
gola Inscriptions, the Vokkaleri Plates throwing new light on the 
history of the Chalukyas and the Atakur lithic Record describing 
the relations between the Rashtrakutas, the Gangas and the Cholas. 

Another great literary work of Rice was the publication of 
Mysore Gazetteer edited by him in 1877-1878 ; the Bibliotheca. 
Carnatica, a series of classical Kanarese works on poetry, grammar, 
rhetoric, begin in 1884 ; his Goorg Inscriptions appeared in 1886. 
He collected hundreds of manuscripts to preserve which the 
Government Oriental Library was founded at Mysore. 

C A man of untiring industry, wide learning and earnest 
devotion to the pursuit of truth, he has rendered exceedingly 
great services to the cause of knowledge by the stimulus which he 
has given to historal and literary studies in South India 9 (L.D. 
Barnett) ; 

16 & 17. Jadmath Sirkar and Sardes ai 

Among the living historians of India, the names of J.N.Sircar 
and Sardesai occupy a unique place in the realm of Mughul and 
Maratha History. If J.N. Sirkar is the pioneer in the Mughul 
historical studies, Sardesai has made the Maratha historical 
documents accessible to the students of Modern Indian History 
and written an epic account of the Maratha achievements in his 
Marathi Riyasdt of which the English version in three volumes is 
styled A New .History "of the Marathas. . . 

J. N. Sirkar is known to the world as the author of the monu- 
mental five volumes on the History of Aurangzeb . It is a work 
based on various original sources not to be easily surpassed. The 
first two volumes deal with the reign of Shahjahan ; the third 
with the political activities of Aurangzeb in North India from 
1658-1681 ; the fourth volume deals with the activities of the 
emperor in Southern India 1645-1689 ; the last volume is devoted 
to the last phase of Aur^ngzeb’s lifeJ (1698-1707). An. abridged 


development of Indian historiography 


175 


version of this, entitled A Short History of Aurangzeb is also available. 
Besides being the biographer of Aurangzeb, J. N. Sirkar is the 
author of many more books on the different aspects of Mughul 
rule in India. His Studies in Moghul India is a collection of 22 
historical essays on the many-sided activities of Mughul emperors. 
'His Anecdotes of Aurangzeb is a brilliant exposition of many interesting 
stories connected with the life of Aurangzeb. In his Moghul 
Administration , he has given an admirable survey of the Administra- 
tive structure of the Mughul empire. He is also the author of 
Sivaji and His Times . This is an admirable sketch of the founder 
and father of the Maratha nation, Sivaji, mainly based on the diverse 
original sources. The contemporary Dutch, Portuguese, French 
and, English records have been made use of in this book by the 
author. A third edition of the book, thoroughly revised and re- 
written, was brought out in 1930. 

In 1940, Sirkar published Another work by name The House 
of Sivajiy?kichis& collection of all his writings on the Royal Period 
(1626-1700) to which are added a long life of Mallik Ambar. (from 
original sources) and biographies of the four eminent pioneers of 
Marathi historical research, Rajawade, Sane, Khare and Parasnis. 
This is a necessary supplement to Sivaji and His Times , for all 
serious students of the subject. Sirkar is an honorary member of 
the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain. 

Sardesai is the doyen among.modern historians. J. N* Sirkar, 
his frifefrd and co-worker says of him and his works : 

. c From the unspeakable loneliness and utter vacuity of a 
forlorn old man’s life, Govind Rao was saved by a force, stronger 
even than Death, his passion for advancing the study of Maratha 
history on a scientific basis. He had begun his literary career in 
Baroda by making Marathi translations pf Machiavelli’s Prince 
and Seeley’s Expansion of ^England, which were published in The 
Baroda series in 1895. .He then planned and composed his.famous 
Riyasat works in Marathi about this time, with the object of diffusing 
higher knowledge in a popular form through the vernacular. Here 
his devotion to national History found an adequate expression in 
the form of a complete conspectus of the course of the Maratha 
rise and fall, from the beginnings under Sivaji to the dismal day 
when from the balcony of the Parvati temple the last Peshwa Baji 
Rao II looked helplessly on the ruins of his dynasty and the extinc- 
tion of the independence of his people. This grand plan was 


i?6 


HISTORICAL METHOD 


carried to completion under the title of Marathi Riyasat in nine 
volumes in the course of thirty years, the first volume having been 
published in 1901 and the last in 1932. Several of the volumes 
have gone into a second edition. 9 Sardesai himself says about 
the Riyasat : 

4 In it I tried to bring together the scattered, disarranged 
and un-calendared mass of historical data and opinions found in 
that tongue and, after comparing them with available materials 
in other languages, to construct a compact critical study of the, 
rise and fall of the Modern Maratha State. My work too, like 
Rajwade’s, remained unknown to the world ignorant of my native 
language. The present New History of the Marathas to be completed 
in three volumes, is the first attempt to present a fresh and full 
treatment of Maratha History , in English, embodying the results 
of the latest research. It is not a translation of my Marathi Riyasat ; 
nor does it pretend to be a work of the ideal merits as described 
above;. It is mostly made up of the utterances of the great figures 
who dominated the historic stage during the two centuries of our 
rise and fall. As a supplementary attempt, the reader’s attention 
may be invited to the author’s c Main Currents of Maratha History ’ 
published a few years ago. In it have been discussed some of the 
outstanding and debatable questions arising out of the past life of 
the Maratha People.’ 

The scientific collection and edition of the official -records of 
the Peshwas or the Peshwa Daftars } about 27,000 bundles of Marathi 
manuscripts, in forty-five volumes is another monumental Work of 
Sardesai. The unprinted material of minor historical importance 
has also been carefully sorted and rearranged for the convenience 
of future workers. ‘ It is an achievement that recalls to our 
memory the huge corpus of documents on Roman history published 
under the guidance of Mommsen, and it stands as an enduring 
monument.to the devoted labour and wide accurate learning of 
this son of Maharashtra 9 (.J. N. Sirkar) . 

The recovery of Mahadji Sindhia’s Records is another piece 
of research carried out by Sardesai in 1937. 

But the completion of these series of Marathi Records in 
1934 meant for Sardesai not repose but the shouldering of a new 
task, the editing jointly with J. N. Sirkar, of the English Records of 
the Old Poona Residency , These English Records begin where the 
Peshwa Daftars end in 1776. The Poona Residency Records 




bEVELOPMENT OF INDIAN HISTORIOGRAPHY 177 

contain a rich and varied mass of historical and economic informa- 
tion, These fourteen volumes of Residency Records bring the 
thread of Maratha History down to 1818 A.D. In the words of 
Sirkar : ' 

c Eternal vigilance in self-criticism has been the saving salt 
of his (Sardesai’s) writings; Tireless striving after accuracy, 
passion for going down to the root of things, cool balance of judge- 
ment and unfailing common sense in interpretation have marked 
his historical works, 9 , I 

18. Virnent Smith 

Dr. V;iA. Smith was one of the last of the eminent band of 
orientalists, scholars and researchers, who, from the time of Sir 
William Jones and Charles Wilkins have done so much, for the 
advancement of Indology. ... 

c His knowledge of Indian History and art and all their 
connections was comprehensive and unrivalled ; his experience in 
India enabled him to use his materials with judicious discrimi- 
nation and he co-ordinated and wrought them up into complete 
treatises that were acknowledged as- authoritative. He accomplished 
a great work that lay beyond the scope of the researches of other 
individual scholars and conferred notable boons of permanent 
value not only on them, but also on all persons, interested in India ’ 
{Eminent Orientalist#)* I , , 

; : This verdict on the output of Dr. Smith’s scholarship,, genius 
for collation and laborious industry, is an eminently just and 
impartial one. For nearly half a century, since his entry into 
the Indian Civil Service in 1871, did he patently study the history, 
archaeology and arts of the people of the country which he served 
for about three decades. His contributions to oriental scholarship 
were immense and valuable ; he was an erudite and thorough 
student of the materials that he collected ; and the strength of his 
conclusions impressed his readers no less than the stores of buried 
learning which he brought to light. , , , : , 

He was bom in Dublin on June 3, 1848, the son of Aqudlla 
Smith, a wel-known numismatist and archaeologist. .He took his 
I,C*S. in 1869 and served through the regular magisterial and 
executive offices till about 1909. Dr. Smith’s literary activities 
covered a period of nearly forty-five years. To the Indian Anti- 
quary alone he was a valued contributor of more than forty years 
standing. The Coins of the Gupta Dynasty, the History and 
h — 12

MlSTORlGAL ME^HOb 


Coinage of the Ghandel dynasty, the Palas of Bengal, these were 
among the important subjects on which he wrote to the Antiquary. 
The Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society was vastly enriched by 
his contributions on the coins of the Gupta Dynasty and on the 
probable estimate of Graeco-Roman influence on the civilisation 
of Ancient India. The Journal of the German Oriental Society 
and the Ostasiatisch Zeitschrift contain a number of articles from 
His pen on the Andhras and their coinage, the Indo-Parthian 
dynasties, and Sakas of North India and other subjects* He was 
a frequent contributor to the journal of the Royal Asiatic Society*; 

. Dr. Smith in 1901 published his book Asoka r the Buddhist 
Emperor of India , a popular yet scholarly account, of which he was 
engaged on the third edition when he died. He relied . mainly oh 
Buhler’s translations of As oka’s inscriptions, but checked them by 
comparison with the versions of other scholars.. He was the’ first 
writer to arrive at .a true estimate of the historical value of the 
legends .enveloping Asoka and keep them separate from' authentic 
history. The second edition of Asoka came out in 1909. 

He completed in 1904 Early History oj India , which fashioned 
all the evidence scattered in many publications, his own and 
those of others, into a reasonable account of the period from 600 
B.G. to the Muhammadan conquest. This work the learned 
author humbly regarded but as 4 the taking stock of the accu- 
mulated stores of knowledge.’ He designedly confined hiihself to 
the plain narration of political ; events. It was designed to be 
primarily a political history and a presentation of dynastic facts 
and hot ‘ an encyclopaedia of Indian antiquities as some critics 
seem to think that it ought to be.’ J r / 

A second and an improved edition appeared in 1908. ‘The 
third edition was .brought out in; f 914’ and a, fourth revised d>y 
S.M. Bdwardes., appeared in 1924. ■ : ' ...” h: :.''J 

: ’ In 1906, Dr. Smith issued the first volume of the Oatdogw 
of Coins in the Indian Museum , Calcutta, Dr. Smith has given us 
within the covers of a single volume a succinct account of all the 
ancient and medieval non-mussalman coinage of India which 
Wpuld serve as a hand-book to the student by enabling him to 
easily find out the class to which belongs any specimen that he 
might have. He afeo wrote the Oxford Student’ si History of Bida,

to be the first' comprehensive and masterly survey of fine art in 
all its branches from its beginnings to the present time. A second 
edition of the book has been revised by Prof. Codrington. 

In 1917 was published his Akbaf , The Great Mogkul, 1542-1605. 
It is an admirable account of that. great Mughul emperor. The 
commentaries of Monserrate, du Jarric, Peruschi and various 
other Jesuit missionaries who were invited to the Mughul Gourt, 
as well as the writing's of early European travellers have been 
made full use of b ? y Dr. Smith. One outstanding feature of 
Dr. Smith's book is that it brings out prominently the greatness 
and the genius of Tulasi Das — ‘ the tallest tree in the magic 
garden of medieval Hindu Poesy.’ 

Dr. Smith’s Oxford History of India , published in 1919, was 
his last great -work. Its purpose is to provide a compendious 
up-to-date history. of India as a whole 9r based on the results of 
modern research andmarked by ‘ scrupulous accuracy of statement 
and impartiality of judgement.’! 

He edited Bernier's Travels and Sleeman's Rambles and Re- 
collections, contributed to the Oxford Survey of the British Empire and 
wrote Indian. Constitutional Reform viewed in the light of History 
in 1919, . " 

19. Sylvain Levi 

The name of the French Savant Sylvain Levi is significant in 
Indian history. He Was bom in 18,63 and took his degree in 1883 
when he was; just 20 years old. Sylvain Levi’s contact with. 
Bergaigne, one of the greatest teachers of Sanskrit that Europe 
produced, is worthy to. remember. Levi was a sound student of 
the classical languages and took to Sanskrit studies with great 
zeal. 

Levi’s first published work was a paper on the Brihtkatha - 
manjari of Kshemendra in the Journal Asiatique for 1885-86. 
He Was then appointed ‘Master of Conference of the School of 
Higher Studies ’ in Paris. It was in these conferences of his early 
years that he came into contact with the most brilliant among his 
pupils, A. Meillet, the eminent philologist, and A. Foucher, the 
illustrious scholar of Buddhist Art and Archaeology. Later he was 
nominated to the Council of the French. Asiatic Society. Levi’s 
first Contribution after this, was * Bergaigne and Indianism ’ 
in the Journal Asiatique for 1890* The same year he submitted 
two theses for his doqtorate, o fie ip Latin on ‘ What about Greece ?

HISTORICAL METHOD 


Ancient Indian monuments conserved 5 and the other in French 
on c The Theatre of the Hindus 9 which stands still an authority 
on the subject of Hindu drama. In 1894 he was appointed to 
the chair of Sanskrit in the College of France. At the age of 
31 he reached the highest educational position and began his 
life’s work as the colleague of such eminent savants as Darmesteter, 
Maspero, and 'Gaston Paris. He delivered lectures on various 
subjects relating to his chair, discussing Asoka inscriptions and 
organised classes for teaching Chinese and Tibetan, along with 
Pali and Sanskrit. Levi visited India, Nepal, Indo-China and 
Japan in 1897-98. After finishing the tour he took much more 
interest in Indian studies and published his monograph on the 
c Doctrine of Sacrifice in the Brahmanas 9 in 1898. 

Levi’s association with Chinese scholars during his tour gave 
new life to the parallel study of Chinese and Indian culture. 

Levi’s interest in institutions of public benefit was great.— 
It is in connection with one of these that he visited India early 
in 1922 at the invitation of Tagore issued from the Santiniketan 
Viswabkarati. His views in regard to the position of India in 
the history of civilization bring them near enough in idea to Viswa- 
bharati, as he said in concluding his article on c Bergaigne and 
Indianism ,’ ‘ From Persia to the Chinese Sea, from the icy regions 
of Siberia to the islands of Java and Borneo, from Oceanea to 
Socotra, India has propagated her beliefs, her genius, her tales, 
and her civilization.’ He gives his view bn Indian history : 

‘ The multiplicity of the manifestations of the Indian genius as 
well as their fundamental unity gives India the right to figure 
on the first rank in the history of civilized nations/ 

20. Horace {dayman Wilson 1786-1860. 

Bofn September '26, 1786^ and educated at St. Thomas 
Hospital, he arrived in Calcutta in 1808, in the medical service 
of East India Company. He was at once attached to the Mint 
at Calcutta for his knowledge of Chemistry and assay. He was 
Secretary to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. He lived and Worked 
in Calcutta till the close of the year 1832. He became Boden 
Professor oF Sanskrit at Oxford in/ 1833, Librarian of the India 
House in 1836, and died in 1860. 

:;.i: The versatility of Wilson’s powers was best tebwh. by die 
#ide £ange of his acquirements & Indian languages. He knew 
Persian, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil and Marathi* 



DEVELOPMENT OF INDIAN HISTORIOGRAPHY 


181 


As for his knowledge of Sanskrit, it was of a very high order. His 
literary works are so many that a bare list of them would fill several 
pages of an ordinary book. He translated the Meghaduta of 
Kalidasa in 1813. He published the Theatre of the Hindus and 
Sanskrit- English Dictionary } besides contributing to Asiatic Researches, 
the Journals of the Asiatic, Medical and Physical Societies and 
other oriental literature. He wrote an Historical Account of the 
Burmese War , and catalogued Col. Colin Mackenzie’s manuscripts. 
Another useful work of Wilson is his well known treatise on the 
Religious Sects of the Hindus . It is a valuable contribution to the 
history of Hindu religion and theology. He has given us a 
summary of the Puranas and of the Kathasaritsagara . Wilson’s 
translation of the Rig Veda is another work for which he is deservedly 
famous. It is # a very creditable performance and appears to have 
done yeoman’s service to those subsequent Sanskritists who made 
their attempts in the same direction. He brought out a new 
edition of Mill's History of British India . He prepared a Glossary 
of Indian Revenue Terms . He was the greatest Sanskrit scholar of 
his time, combining a variety of attainments as general linguist, 
historian, chemist, accountant, numismatist and musician. Wilson 
was a wonderful man, and there have been few, indeed, who 
would bear to be compared with him in the domain of oriental 
learning.
