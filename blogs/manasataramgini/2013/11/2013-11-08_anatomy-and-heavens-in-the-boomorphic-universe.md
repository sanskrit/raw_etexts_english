The bovine species lay at the center of the existence of the early
Indo-Aryan. After all he owed his very success in history to the
strength of milk. Hence, rather appropriately payas means both milk and
strength in saMskR^ita. Not surprisingly, he tended to literally see the
world as a bovine expression of cosmic proportions, replete with
homologies or saMbandha-s between the macrocosmos and microcosmos of the
bovine body. In a sense this persists in the image of bhArata even
today: videshin-s instinctively associate bhArata with the “holy cow”,
even though a deracinated, urban, modern Hindu might try to protest that
India is not just about cows. All this said, the evidence suggests that
the spread of the Indo-Aryans within bhAratavarSha itself was
accompanied by the spread of their bovine herds and at the genetic the
spread of a certain strain of [lactose
tolerance](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/genetic-determinism-sociology-and-history/ "Genetic determinism, sociology and history").
Not surprisingly, bovine symbolism is central to Aryan ritual and
thought, be it in the plaint of the Iranian zaotar zarathushtra, i.e.,
geush urvan or the many ritual incantations of the atharvaveda. Indeed,
the strong bovine connection to the atharvan-s (and their Iranian
counterparts) emerges as the central element of the famous legend of our
clan: the theft of the family cow leading to the multi-generational feud
which ends in the great war between the bhR^igus and the haihaya-s
(alluded to in the brahma-gavi spell of the atharvaveda). Thus, in the
AV bovine rites we sense a special connection to our forebears, rites
which were done by bhR^igu and paulomi, the clan-furthering chyavAna and
sukanyA, the famed apnavAna and ruchi, R^ichIka and satyavati, jamadagni
and reNukA.

Among others the taurocentric Weltanschauung of the atharvan-s is best
captured in a yajush incantation from the vulgate atharvaveda (AV 9.7),
which provides a remarkable parallel to the Iranian legend of the
gav-aēvō-dātā or the
[ratu](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/06/16/the-broken-chain-and-the-chain-of-knowledge/ "The broken chain and the chain of knowledge")
of the bovine (eventually slain by angra mainyu). This incantation is
part of the offering verses belonging to a now largely forgotten ritual
performed by the bhR^igu-s and a\~Ngirasa-s of the atharvan tradition.
These rituals belong to a category know as the AtharvaNa sava-s which
are only performed by the atharvavedin-s and differ from the sava-s
performed by the ritualists belonging to other vaidika traditions. These
sava-s are performed usually in the uttarAyaNa period and may be done
only if the ritualist’s female partner is initiated in the appropriate
mantra lore and has had an earlier AV ritual dIkSha with the yoktra
girdle tied around her waist. Before the sava a reddish-brown bull
should have been sacrificed to the terrifying mahAdeva and its organs
offered thus with the names of rudra:  
chitta: the sinews;  
bhava: the liver,  
rudra: the pancreas  
pashupati: the stomach  
agni: the heart,  
rudra: the blood  
sharva: the kidneys:  
mahAdeva: the marrow of the ribs  
auShiShThahan: intestine and colon  
Its complete hide is then prepared as a seat for the ritualist and his
patnI.

The two then perform the sava dIkSha. Here sitting on the bull hide with
its neck facing east and its hairy side upwards they offer oblations of
ghee into the fire with all the mantra-s from AV-vulgate 6.114-124
(known as the deva-heDanaM recitation). When in course of this rite they
make oblations to yama they touch water after each svAhA. On completion
they observe the vrata for 3 days during which they abstain from all
sexual activity. They bow to all the directions and thereafter the
mortar, pestle and winnowing fan are purified with mantra-s. They churn
out and establish the fire with the incantations specified in the
kaushika sUtra chapter 60. The patnI cooks a plate of rice on the ritual
fire and mixes it with ghee and fresh milk. One part is cut out and kept
for offering to the ancestors, one part is used to feed brAhmaNa-s and
the third part is used for the daiva oblations. For the rite the
ritualist and his patnI wear identically colored garments. If he desires
cattle he uses the bovine incantation (AV 9.7) to make oblations to the
deities imagining the whole universe to be a gigantic bovine:

AV-vulgate (9.7)  
Omniformed cattle, of all forms attend on him who knows thus\!

At first sight this collection of mantra-s epitomizes the macranthropic
(or macrotherian) theme. Seen abundantly in Hindu traditions from the
veda onwards, which we have earlier discussed on [these
pages](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/macranthropy-and-the-sambandha-s-between-microcosm-and-macrocosm/ "Macranthropy and the saMbandha-s between microcosm and macrocosm").
However, a closer examination shows that it is not just any macrotherian
theme but a specific version, which we may term stellar macranthropy. In
this form we have the explicit equation of parts of the macranthropic
entity with stars/constellations in the sky. This interpretation
overturns the assertion made in the last century by the American
indologist Whitney who translated the AV and is largely followed by
white indologists and their fellow travellers thereafter:  
“*The revatI-s and kR^ittikA-s are two asterisms in Pices and Taurus;
their connection with the parts to which they are assigned is, as in
nearly all the other cases in this hymn, of the most purely imaginary
and meaningless kind.*”

However, the statement in AV 9.7.15 that the stars comprise the form
(nakShatrANi rUpam) of the bovine suggest that the allusion to these
constellations is not purely meaningless as the indologist would have us
believe. Rather it indicates the macranthropic bovine was indeed meant
to span the stars and the mention of the two constellations is not
entirely without meaning. This class of stellar macranthropic constructs
are repeatedly encountered in the veda. As the Hindu scholar Narayana
Aiyangar had pointed out 115 years ago in his “Essays on Indo-Aryan
mythology”, these stellar constructs occur at least three times in
distinct forms in the taittirIya shruti: The starry prajApati
(taittirIya brAhmaNa 1.5.2.2); the starry dolphin or shishumAra
(taittirIya AraNyaka 2.5.13) and the uttaranArAyaNa or the puruSha
(taittirIya AraNyaka 3.13). This tradition of stellar puruSha continued
down to the purANa-s (e.g agnipurANa chapter 196) and is also specified
in detail in the 105th chapter of the bR^ihat-saMhitA of the great
naturalist varAhamihira. In this later version the nakShatra puruSha is
also invoked as viShNu (shAmbhavAyanIya ritual) during every month of
the year. The ritual is supposed to be performed by both men and women
for greater sexual accomplishment. In the parallel later bAdarAyaNIya
ritual, the stellar prajApati is comprised of rAshI-s instead of
nakShatra-s. Returning to the yajurvedic versions of the rite we find
that the uttaranArAyaNa is the least detailed in terms of equivalences.
However, that it represents the nakShatra puruSha is clear because it
has the explicit statement, same as that seen in AV 9.7.15 (nakShatrANi
rUpam ||). This is followed by the only explicit association it makes:  
ashvinau vyAttam ||  
His open mouth are the twin ashvin-s. This choice is strange at first
sight but makes sense if it is taken to indicate the position of the
beginning of the nakShatra-s on the ecliptic: a proper parallel to the
statement in the taittirIya brAhmaNa, where the nakShatra lists begin
with kR^ttikA, that kR^ittikA is the mukham (mouth) of the nakShatra-s.
As correctly inferred by Tilak, this indicates that the nakShatra at the
vernal equinoctical point marked the beginning of the list and was
termed the mouth. Now, when the ashvin-s are at the mouth it clearly
indicates a period after the kR^ttikA period as ashvayajau the nakShatra
of the ashvinau is two nakShatra positions away from kR^ttikA. Thus, the
uttaranArAyaNa might be inferred as being approximately 1100-900 BCE in
age (see figure below; \[Footnote 1\]).

[![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GnY3Fm9Yo6E/UocmJ3luhaI/AAAAAAAACxI/Ovoh3fM5AOk/s640/ashvayuja.jpg)](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Db0K2201AtOlNZA1HC42JtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite)*The
equinox at ashvavyuja around 1000 BCE*

Thus, it clings to the Vedic corpus at its fag end and is consistent
with its late hallmarks, namely the rise of puruSha nArAyaNa, who was
superseding prajApati in most of his roles. This also provides the
transition between the vaidika nakShatra puruSha and paurANika one
clearly identified with viShNu. This period might correspond to the rise
of the nArAyaNIya or epic pA\~NcharAtra which alludes to these mantra-s
as the mahopaniShat. This it negates the nonsensical and obviously
biased assertion of the American indologist Whitney maintained to this
date among Abrahamistic white indologists and their imitators:  
*“The Hindus borrowed their nakShatra system from Mesopotamia and would
probably have retained it in that form \[i.e. with kR^ittikA at the
vernal equinox of 2300 BCE\] until the present day but for the
revolution wrought in their science by Greek teaching.”*  
Clearly even within the vaidika period (including vedA\~Nga jyotiSha)
the Hindus had made multiple changes for precession not just at the time
of varAhamihira after interactions with yavana-s.

The vaidika stellar macrotherian, the shishumAra, also hints a specific
astronomical position: it describes the constellation of Draco with the
deva-s, ritual entities and atri the primordial astronomer among the
vipra-s identified with various stars of the constellation. It is
described as containing the pole star dhruva and is associated with the
ritual where the yajamAna recites this incantation while gazing at the
north pole. This was correct for alpha Draconis at 2800 BCE (below).

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GmYGUPCZXGU/UofM-4Eo05I/AAAAAAAACxY/H385SZRAqxw/s640/shishumAra.jpg)](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/YbD0tKgLdCwW7VoW1mYvM9MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite)*North
Pole in shishumAra (Draco): dhruva (Alpha Draconis)*

Now returning to the macrotherian bovine we observe that kR^ittikA and
revatI do not occupy the head of the bovine. Rather at the “forefront”
of the bovine is prajApati who is identified with the horns. In vaidika
tradition prajApati is traditionally associated with rohiNI (alpha
Tauri; prajApate rohiNIvetu patnI |) and the Hyades cluster from which
the horns of the bovine emerge. So, we propose that the forefront of the
stellar macrotherian bovine is the fore part of Taurus and kR^ttikA and
revatI are placed behind it for a reason, contra-Whitney. Now one could
protest that we are bringing in a rAshI of the Bull, which the
dull-witted Hindus are not supposed to have known in the Vedic period,
rather adopting it much latter from their erudite West Asian and Greek
teachers. However, we, like several before us, argue that the
Indo-Aryans were very much aware of constellations distinct from
nakShatra-s that were used primarily for a lunar purpose. Starting from
Tilak, it has been proposed the that dogs (Canis Major and Canis Minor),
Bear, Draco, Hunter (in Hindu world moved to Canis Major on occassions);
mR^iga and other constellations were known and figured distinctly from
the ecliptic divisions in the form of the nakShatra-s. Indeed the bovine
associated with Taurus seems to be one such. Several lines of evidence
support this view:  
1\) We had earlier argued this with respect to the [sauchIka agni
mantra](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/11/21/the-path-of-fire/).

2\) The atharvaveda states:  
yA rohiNIr devatyA gAvo yA uta rohiNIH | (AV-vulgate 1.22.3ab)  
Of the cattle which indeed are red, of them rohiNI is the deity.  
Thus, rohiNI (alpha Tauri) the nakShatra is linked to cattle.

3\) A mantra of kakShIvAn of the gotama clan to the ashvin-s states:  
revad uvAha sachano ratho vAM vR^iShabhash cha shiMshumArash cha yuktA
|| \[RV 1.116.18cd\]  
The chariot that bore you two brought beautiful riches: a bull and a
dolphin were yoked together.  
This absurd yoking of the bull and the dolphin to the car of the
ashvin-s has greatly mystified later observers and practitioners of this
mantra. However, it can be resolved, if as noted above the shishumAra is
the constellation of Draco which marks the cycle of the chariot that
revolves daily around the north pole. The yearly revolution was the one
corresponding to the bull or Taurus. Around the time the vernal equinox
was in rohiNI, there was also a northern polestar in the form of alpha
Draconis, the dhruva of shishumAra (above picture). This further
strengthens the link between the nakShatra rohiNI and a constellation
equivalent to Taurus overlapping with it.

4\) The above is further supported by a mantra to the ashvin-s composed
by agastya that states:  
pra vAM sharadvAn vR^iShabho na niShShAT pUrvIr iShash charati madhva
iShNan |  
evair anyasya pIpayanta vAjair veShantIr UrdhvA nadyo na AguH || (RV
1.181.06)  
Approximately: The autumnal bull of you two, like a mighty one comes
forth, sending from the east, sending forth honey. Let them swell with
the other ways and strength: the heavenly speeding rivers (high rivers)
have come to us.  
Here the bull of the ashvin-s is again alluded to as rising in autumn in
the east (which would correspond with Taurus at the vernal equinox) and
the heavenly rivers are said to come along. While some interpret this as
rain. We suspect it is the Milky Way which rises just ahead of Taurus.

5\) Another allusion comes from the mantra of vAmadeva gautama to
agni:  
sa jAyata prathamaH pastyAsu maho budhne rajaso asya yonau |  
apAd ashIrShA guhamAno antAyoyuvAno vR^iShabhasya nILe || (RV 4.1.11)  
In dwellings first he came into being, at great base \[of heaven\], and
in this atmosphere’s womb; Footless and headless, concealing both his
ends, drawing himself together in the bull’s station.  
The first hemistich refers to the 3 manifestations of agni: the ritual
fire, the celestial fire and the atmospheric fire. Here, as Santillana
and von Dechend argued in the Hamlet’s Mill the [heavenly fire
(vaishvAnara)](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/11/21/the-path-of-fire/ "The path of fire")
is associated with the [equinoctial
colure](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/11/26/the-crossing-of-ashmanvati/ "The crossing of ashmanvatI"):
This is implied in this mantra by the statement that his ends come
together – i.e. the ecliptic ends meet and this happens in the station
of the bull. Here again we see an allusion the vernal equinox in a
constellation conceived as Taurus, i.e. the rohiNI period.

In light of these connections the stellar bovine of the atharvaveda
indeed seems to represent in part the celestial path with its start at
boviform constellation of Taurus. This appears to be a memory of time
when the vernal equinox lay at that position (Figure below). The
association of the constellation with prajApati continues into the
classical siddhAnta period (sUryasiddhAnta 8.20) where the stars
brahma-hR^idaya (heart of brahma or prajApati) and prajApati are
described as being in Taurus.

*The vernal equinox at rohiNI with the taurine constellation of
vR^iShabha*

The AV stellar bovine joins the long list of the macranthropic or
macrotherian depictions, which we have discussed before, a common
feature throughout classical Hindu tradition. As we have posited before
these are symbolic representations of the theory that the same forces
and elements which run and constitute the microcosm denoted by the
animal body also run the cosmos. Thus, they are the earliest depictions
of the underlying unity that pervades the various levels of nature, the
understanding which we continue to seek to this date – this one capture
the two great sources of knowledge regarding this unity – the
understanding of an animal’s structure and working on one end and the
understanding of the astronomical realm at the other.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  
Footnote 1: Like a white indologist, one might object that we are
choosing the beginning ashvayujau for our reckoning rather than the end.
Yes, but on other grounds, namely relative chronology based on
continuity with earlier and later Hindu traditions, the possible taboo
of naming the former yama nakShatra bharaNI, and the relatively old
position of the uttaranArAyaNa in the vaiShNava material, as suggested
by its pan-yajurvedic presence, we are justified in presenting the early
ashvayujau as the likely temporal layer.
