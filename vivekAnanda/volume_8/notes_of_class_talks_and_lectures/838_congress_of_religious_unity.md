## CONGRESS OF RELIGIOUS UNITY

(*Report of a lecture in the* Chicago Sunday Herald, *September 24,
1893*)

Swami Vivekananda said, "All the words spoken at this parliament come to
the common conclusion that the brotherhood of man is the
much-to-be-desired end. Much has been said for this brotherhood as being
a natural condition, since we are all children of one God. Now, there
are sects that do not admit of the existence of God — that is, a
Personal God. Unless we wish to leave those sects out in the cold — and
in that case our brotherhood will not be universal — we must have our
platform broad enough to embrace all mankind. It has been said here that
we should do good to our fellow men, because every bad or mean deed
reacts on the doer. This appears to me to savour of the shopkeeper —
ourselves first, our brothers afterwards. I think we should love our
brother whether we believe in the universal fatherhood of God or not,
because every religion and every creed recognises man as divine, and you
should do him no harm that you might not injure that which is divine in
him."
