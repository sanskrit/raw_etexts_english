shivovAcha :

durgA nAma japo yasya kim tasya kathayAmi te /  
aham panchananaH kAnte tajjapA deva suvrate//

shiva said to pArvati

O devI, how could I narrate the glory of the name ‘durgA’?  
It is because of the recitation of durgA nAma ( durgA’s name) that I am
called pa\~nchAnana.

dhanI putri tathA nyAni chira\~njIvI bhaved bhuvi /  
pratyaham yo japed bhaktyA shatam ashtottaram shuciH//

One who recites the name of durgA 108 times every day, is blessed with
prosperity, offspring, wisdom and longevity.

aShTottaram sahasram tu yo japed bhakti samyutAH/  
pratyaham parameshAnI tasya puNya phalam shR^iNu//  
dhanArthi dhanamApnoti j\~nAnArtthI j\~nAnameva cha/  
rogArto muchyatE rogAt baddho muchyate bandhanAt//  
bhIto bhayAt muchyate pApAn muchyate pAtakI/  
putrArthi labhate putram devI satyam na saMshayaH//

One who recites the name of durgA 1008 times daily with great reverence
will be blessed with whatever he asks for. Those who in dire need for
financial aid will be blessed with all round prosperity, one who longs
for wisdom will be blessed with nyAnA sampat, the one who suffers from
ailments shall be relieved from their ailments,One who is desirous of
progeny will be blessed with putra lAbha and the one who is in fear is
relieved from his fears. One who has been imprisoned will be set free,
if he repents and recites the name of durga 1008 times daily with faith
and devotion. All the sins are absolved by reciting durgA nAma.

evam satyam vijAnIhi samartha sarva karmasu/  
Ayutam yo japet bhaktyA pratyAham paramEshwarI//  
nigrahAnugrahe shaktA sa bhavEd kalpapAdapA/  
tasya krodhe bhaven mR^ityu prasAde paripUrnatA//

If one recites Her name 10,000 times, he is blessed with the ability to
bless and curse and will be a living wish fulfilling tree (kalpataru).
In his anger there is death and in his pleasantness there is
fulfillment.

mAsi mAsi cha yo lakshaM japam kuryAd varAnanE/  
na tasya graha pIdA tasya kadachid api shAnkarI//  
nachaishwaryam kshayam yati nacha sarpa bhayam bhavet/  
nagni chaura bhayam vApi charanye jale bhayam//  
parvatArhane napi simham vyAgra bhayam tathA/  
bhUta preta pishAchAnAm bhayam nApi bhavet kvachit//  
na cha vairi bhayam kAnte napi dushta bhayam bhavet/  
paraloke bhavet swargIm satyam vai vIra vandite//  
chandra sUrya samudbhUtvA vashet kalpAyutam divi/  
vAjapeya sahasrasya yat phalam syAd varAnane//  
tatphalam samAvApnotI durgA nAma japAt priye/  
na durgam nAma sadR^isham nAmAstI jagati tale//  
tasmAt sarva prayatnena smartavyam sAdhakottamaiH/  
yasyA smarana mAtrena palayante mahApada//

One who recites her name 100,000 (in a month), will not be troubled by
malefic planets, his wealth never diminishes, there will no fear for
snakes, fire, thieves, enemies,forest or water. While mountaineering
there will be no fear/ trouble of tigers, lions, demons or evil
entities. He will be ever blissful and will attain the highest abode of
the dEvAs (heaven) in his afterlife. He shall remain in heaven as long
as the sun and moon exist. To him accrues the benefit of 1000 vAjapEya
yagnAs. There is no name that can be compared to the greatness of durgA
nAma in the whole universe. Difficulties and sufferings disappears the
moment one remembers Her divine name.

The image in this blog is the one of the beautiful[Jagaddhatri Durga of
the Brahmachari family of
Shantipur](http://www.pothik.co.in/jagaddhatri-puja-brahmachari-family-homstead-santipur/).

More sources(from the page: দুর্গালোকনিবাসিনী শ্রীমদদুর্গতিনাশিনী
মহামহিষাসুরমর্দিনী দেবীমা): In
[here](https://www.facebook.com/1676123549332983/photos/a.1676127312665940/2227207907557875/?type=3&theater),it
is said in shAstra that for one who does japa of durgA nAma:his shiva
comes with His shUla,viShNu with His chakra,indra with His vajra,etc.
And it is a name of great power/shakti. Brahma gained the power of
creation by this name,shiva reached His high state by
smaraNa(remembrance) of this name,and this name is the secret of all the
strength of the respective deities in their fields. One who remembers
this name at the end gains sAyujya mukti with devI even if he was a
great sinner his whole life.

from[here](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2197923287153004&id=1676123549332983&__tn__=H-R)
it cites a shloka

daityanAshArthabachano dakAraH parikIrtitaH\|  
ukAro vighnanAshasya vAchako vedasammata\|\|  
repho rogaghnavachano gashcha pApaghnavAchakaH\|  
bhayshatrughnavachanashchAkAraH parikIrtitaH\|\|

In the name of ‘durgA’, ‘da’ kAra is daityanAshaka, ‘u’kAra is
vighnanAshaka,’ga’kAra is pApanAshaka,’A’kAra is shatrunAshaka. The one
who destroys daityas,vighnas(difficulties),sins and enemies is durgA.
The page then goes into a brief discussion of daiva and asuri
sampat(those qualities) and which Durga destroys in the sAdhaka. Someone
else noted that this shloka is from the brahmavaivarta purANa.

This page then

that famous
[dvAtriMshannAmAvalI](https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_devii/durgaa32.html?lang=sa)
of durgA(litany of 32 names of durgA). I am translating mostly the
instructions for special usage of this nAmAvali(written in Bengali in
that FB page).

The person who reads this nAmamAlA,he certainly attains freedom fro all
fears. Anyone under attack of foes etc gets freed from pATha of these
names. There is no doubt about this. If a king becomes angry and gives
the death penalty/harsh punishment or if a man is surrounded by enemies
in battle or near any dangerous animal,if this hymn is recited 108
times,he is delivered from all fears. In times of danger,this upaya is
second to none in dispelling fears. No harm comes to the man who
studies this nAma mAlA. This should not be given to non-devotees or
rogues. If one is in grave danger, pAThath of this nAma mAlA should be
recited 1000,10,000 or 100,000 by oneself or through a brAhmaNa relieves
one from all dangers. Offering oblations in purified agni with white
til(seasamum) mixed with honey vanquishes all difficulties. The
purashcharaNa saMkhyA(count for purashcharaNa) is 30,000. After
purashcharaNa if one recites this,one attains siddhi(success) in all his
endeavours. \[This is apparently from the Geeta Press edition of
saptashati apparently,translated into Bengali by the page admin\].

\[sadAshiva said to umA\]:Oh boon giver!Oh devI! Listen to be infallible
words. Without the knowledge of durgA one’s pUjA and japa bear no
fruits. ‘durgA’ is the supreme mantra,’durgA’ is the supreme japa.
‘durgA’ is the supreme tIrtha and the supreme kriyA. She is also the
nature of supre bhakti and the nature of the highest mukti on this
earth.
buddhi,nidrA,kShudA,chAyA,shakti,tR^iShNA,kShamA,dayA,puShTi,shAnti,lakShmI
and matI:All of them are verily durgA. All the supreme vaidika and
tAntrika kriyAs:They are verily durgA and nondifferent from Her. Japa of
‘durgA’ is also non different from them. Worship the feet of durgA and
always continuously remember durgA day and night. Oh devI! Do japa of
the mantra ‘durgA’,the supreme cause!
