title = "03 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE"

+++

The calendar has got two distinct uses, viz., civil and religious. The Indian calendars, in the particular form it has assumed in different parts of the country, are used for the purpose of dating not only by the rural, but also by a large section of the urban population. On account of the fact, as mentioned above, that the usage of one area differs from another, the Committee recommends that the unified National Calendar should be used uniformly in all states of India, for civil purposes wherever necessary, in place of local calendars. 



## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CIVIL CALENDAR 

- (1) The Saka era should be used in the unified national calendar. The year 1954-55 A.D. corresponds to 1876 Saka or in other words the year 1954 A.D. corresponds to 1875-76 Saka. 

- (2) The year should start from the day following the vernal equinox day. 

- (3) A normal year would consist of 365 days while a leap-year would have 366 days. After adding 78 to the Saka era, if the sum is divisible by 4, then it is a leap-year. But when the sum becomes a multiple of 100, it would be a leap-year only when it is. divisible by 400, otherwise it would be a common year. 

  - The years Śaka 1878, 1882, 1886, 1890, 1894 etc., are leap-years consisting of 366 days each. But the gears 2022, 2122, 2222 and again 2422, 2522, 2622 Saka are not leap-years, while 1922, 2322, 2722 Saka are leap-years. 

- (4) Caitra ( pronounced as Chaitra ) should be the first month of the year, and the lengths of the different months would be fixed as follows: 

  - Caitra 30 days (31 days in a leap-year ), Vaisakha-31, Jyaiṣtha-31, Aṣadha-31 Śrāvana–31, Bhadra-31, āśvina-30, Kartika-30, Agrahāyana--30, Pauṣa-30, Magha-30, and Phalguna-30 days.

  - Corresponding dates :- The dates of the reformed Indian calendar would thus have a permanent correspondence with the dates of the present Gregorian calendar. The corresponding dates are as follows :

    - Indian Calendar ... Gregorian Calendar 

    - Caitra 1 ... March 22 in a common year & March 21 in a leap-year. 

    - Vaisakha 1 April 21

    - Jyaiştha 1 ... May 22

    - Aşadha ... June 22

    - Srāvana 1 ... July 23

    - Bhadra August 23

    - Āśvina 1 September 23 

    - Kārtika 1 October 23 

    - Agrahāyana 1 November 22

    - Pausa 1 December 22 

    - Māgha 1 January 21

    - Phālguna 1 ... February 20 

  - The Indian seasons would thus be permanently fixed with respect to the reformed calendar, as follows : 

    - Seasons, Calendar months 

    - Griṣma (Summer) 

    - Vaisakha & Jyaiṣtha Varṣā (Rains ) 

    - Āsādha & Srāvana Śarat (Autumn) 

    - Bhadra & Āśvina Hemanta (Late Autumn)

    - Kartika & Agrahāyana Sisira ( Winter ) 

    - Pausa & Magha Vasanta ( Spring ) 

    - Phalguna & Caitra (Summer) 



In course of implementation of these recommendations, the states now having the solar calendar for civil and partly religious purposes which start the year from Vaisakha 1 ( April 14 ), will have to begin the year 23 days earlier, but the first month will be Cailra. The effect of this on the states are as follows: 



- Bengal, Orissa, & Assam : Solar months start approximately seven days later than now, 

- Tamil Nad : Solar months start approximately 23 days earlier than now, for the month called Vaisakha (14th April-14th May) in Bengal and Orissa is called Chittirai or Caitra in Tamil Nad. 



Those who use the Caitrādi lunar calendar also for civil purposes, would however experience no great difficulty in adopting this unified calendar, as they have at present the beginning of their year varying from 15th March to 13th April, and the first month is Caitra.
