translators worked in close physical proximity to printing presses, while authors frequented the premises of the publishing house and often main tained personal links with their publisher. As in premodern Europe, writers and intellectuals in nineteenth-century India were on much closer terms with print shops and the people involved in printing than is the case today (Eisenstein 1980:18). In a direct reflection of this, the NKP's printing works, warehouse, editorial office, and bookshop were located adjacent to one another. In its dual function of commercial enterprise and intellectual meeting place, the House of Naval Kishore is indeed re miniscent of Eisenstein's description of early European print shops: 
As pioneers in new manufacturing and marketing techniques, early printers shared something in common with other urban entrepreneurs; but as pioneers in advertising and publicity, in agitation and propaganda, in lexicography and bibliography they must be placed in a class by themselves. Their shops were different from those run by earlier manuscript bookdealers and lay stationers, because they contained new machines and mechanics trained to operate them. At the same time, the new workshops also differed from those run by other contemporary manufacturers because they served as gathering places for scholars, artists and literati; as sanctuaries for foreign translators, emigrés, and refugees; as institutions of advanced learning, and as focal points for every kind of cultural and intellectual interchange. 
(Eisenstein 1980: 23) On observing the amount of literary activity and press work conducted on the NKP's premises in 1884, the American missionary John Hurst was instantly reminded of the famous Imprimerie Catholique in Paris. The only parallel to the NKP he had ever seen, noted an impressed Hurst, was the Abbé Migne's establishment in Paris, where even the editors of the complete editions of the Fathers prepared all their matter beneath the same roof under which the compositors did their work, the pressmen completed it, and the packers sent off the great folios into every land' (Hurst 1887: 354).' 
The South Asian context provides another interesting point of com parison. A kārkhāna or "factory' in the modern sense of the word, the NKP shared many of the characteristics of the traditional kārkhāna or 'workshop of the Mughal period, with its departmental structure, meticulous method of keeping records, and wide array of artisans, artists, and culture specialists situated at the core of book production—calli graphers, stone-correctors, illustrators, bookbinders, translators, and

scholar-editors. Naval Kishore, in his self-perception as a patron of lite rature and learning, consciously drew on the model of the kārkhāna, which he strove to perpetuate, albeit in a modern commercial setting. While post-Mutiny Lucknow and its surrounding qaşbahs undoubtedly abounded in skilled artisans and learned men looking for work, he must be credited with attracting some of the most distinguished talent of the day to his press. 'No other press in India was fortunate to have such a large number of hafiz (scholars who have memorized the Qur'an], learned scholars, historians, writers and poets, as were gathered simultaneously at this press in Lucknow', writes Nazir Kakorvi (Kakorvi 1939: 184). 
In this refashioned modern kārkhāna, traditional learning and crafts manship were held in high esteem. Naval Kishore was acutely aware that his firm's reputation relied and thrived on the expertise of the large number of culture specialists employed by him. The NKP's outstanding achievement in the promotion of oriental literature and learning was as much due to its founder-proprietor's vision and entrepreneurial skills as to the many individual contributions of calligraphers, scholar-translators, and literati working at the press. Preservers of knowledge as much as innovators, these men applied their talent and expertise to the collection, correction, and editing of old texts, as also to the composition of a host of original writings and translations. Due to their multifarious efforts, the NKP's role in promoting literature was original and creative; it was at no time limited to commercial mass production alone. In depicting the House of Naval Kishore as an intellectual and literary arena, this chapter will take a closer look at the NKP's engagement in scholarly and literary publishing. Some light will be shed on the social background and contri bution of the men employed at or associated with the press who, if not poets or prose writers in their own right, are conspicuously absent from literary histories. Many of them belonged to traditional artisan and know ledge communities and were living embodiments of the transition from scribal to print culture. 
5.1 The Department of Copying 
and Calligraphy Commercial printing in nineteenth-century India, to the extent that it relied on the technique of lithography, required a large number of calli graphers (khushnavis, khattāt) and scribes (kātib). Calligraphy traditionally held a high and privileged position in Islam; it was the most revered form of Islamic art and considered one of the few vocational

activities suitable for the Culama. As a major centre of Islamic learning and the site of the narubi court and administration, Lucknow boasted an eminent tradition of master calligraphers - About 700 calligraphers alone are said to have been employed in the nawabs' Bait al-inshā or ‘Depart ment of Letters. The transition from manuscript to print culture, however, coinciding with the end of the navābi and the 1857 uprising, dealt a severe blow to their art and made employment at a printing press or madrasah one of the few alternatives to a life in dire straits. Even the greatest artists were forced to exercise their skills for commercial pur poses, a fact much bemoaned by Sharar: 
Now there are katibs, clerks, not calligraphers. If one or two well-known penmen have remained, they are forced to earn their living by kitabat, the copying out of documents and manuscripts, which is actually inimical to the art of calligraphy. ... Earlier calligraphists thought that getting involved in writing a manuscript was beneath their dignity as it would be impossible for anyone who wrote out a whole book to maintain throughout the principles and standards of calligraphy. (Sharar 1975: 103-4) 
Forced to eke out a living, the calligraphers could do little but compromise. This situation was by no means confined to Lucknow. As Metcalf notes, in 1873 the Culama at the Deoband madrasah reacted to the changing situation by employing a skilled calligrapher to train students for work at the increasingly important lithographic presses' (Metcalf 1982: 103). Undoubtedly, the lithographic presses were the chief beneficiaries of what may be perceived as the plight of the calligraphers. Like other Lucknow presses, the NKP benefited greatly from the city's expertise in penmanship. By enlisting the services of the finest artists, it soon gained a reputation for the excellent calligraphy of its texts. When the Lucknow press prints a man's diwan it raises him to heaven. The calligraphy is so good that every word shines radiant!' wrote an enthusiastic Ghalib in 1861.3 
Yet this configuration was also advantageous to the calligraphic pro fession in post-navābi Lucknow. In providing employment to several generations of masters and pupils, firms like the NKP played a vital role in keeping their tradition alive. By 1872 Naval Kishore alone gave emp loyment to sixty-eight scribes and calligraphers, including some highly

distinguished artists and scholars. While some calligraphers wrote in both naskh and nastaliq, others specialized in one particular style only. Since Lucknow calligraphers did not sign their names in books, little is known about the artists to whom early lithographed books owe so much of their distinct physical appearance and character. Whatever information we have on the NKP's calligraphers is owed largely to A.H. Nurani, who in a 1994 monograph collected biographical details on forty-nine individuals. 
One of the first master calligraphers to join the NKP in 1859 was Munshi Amirullah 'Taslim' (1820–1911), a pupil of the noted Lucknow calligrapher Abdul Hai Sandelvi. Born in Faizabad district, Taslim had served as a soldier in the army of Muhammad Ali Shah and work ed as a scribe for the Mustafa'i Press. On opening his printing shop, Naval Kishore employed him at a monthly salary of Rs 20. Because of his knowledge of Arabic and Persian, Taslim was assigned the task of proof-reading. He also temporarily joined the editorship of Avadh Akhbār. Taslim was not only an excellent calligrapher (one of his masterpieces being the 1862 edition of Ghalib's Qāti -e burhān), but also an able Urdu 
Khan 'Nasim' Dehlavi (1794–1864), a shāgird of Momin, was also associated with the NKP for some time.The NKP published an early collection of Taslim's poetic work entitled Kulliyāt-e Amirullāh Taslim (also known as Nazm-e arimand, *1872) as well as his Masnavi Nālah e Taslīm (*1872). In 1875 Taslim shifted to Rampur where he rose to a position of eminence among the poets of the Rampur court. From there he published numerous romances, collections of poetry, and a history of the Rampur State entitled Tārīkh-e bādi. 
Second only in fame to Taslim was the Lucknow master calligrapher Maulvi Hadi Ali (d. 1865). Hadi Ali was a distinguished Islamic scholar and a poet of Persian and Urdu who wrote under the pen name 'Ashk. He was considered an expert in the art of composing chronograms (tarikhgoi). His career provides an excellent example of how calligraphy shifted from a context of traditional Islamic art and scholarship to the commercial domain: born in a scholarly family in the qaşbah of Bijnor, Maulvi Hadi Ali had been educated at Farangi Mahall and trained in

calligraphy by Hafiz Muhammad Ibrahim. Together with his poetic men tor Nawab Fateh ud-Daulah (Mirza Muhammad Riza) Barq', he spent some time at the court-in-exile of Wajid Ali Shah in Matia Burj and also worked as a scribe and proofreader for Haji Harmain Sharifain's Muham madi Press. Upon joining Naval Kishore's print shop in 1859 he was ap pointed the first formal editor of Avadh Akhbar and soon became head proofreader in the Lithographic Department. In this position he continued to work as a calligrapher, while also writing and editing various comment aries on religious works. Hadi Ali not only excelled in nastaliq but was considered to have no equal in the writing of naskh and the design of Tughras (Sharar 1975: 104). An expert in both large and miniature scripts, he won special distinction for his calligraphy of the Qur'an. He did not live to see the publication of his masterpiece, a widely acclaimed large letter edition of the Qur'an, which took him five years to prepare. It was published posthumously as Qur'an sharif jali galam (*1868) with the Persian commentary Bahr al-ulum al-islāmīva in its margins. Avadh Akhbār extolled the edition as a specimen of exquisite handwriting, prepared with such beauty and excellence as has never been seen to the present day. This Ouran is the legacy of the late Maulvi Hadi All, whose calligraphy has no equal in the whole of Hindustan. By studying 
relied on Hadi Ali's skills as an editor, entrusting him with some impor tant Persian publications such as Ghalib's collected Persian verse, Kulliyāt-e nazm-e fārsi (*1863), and the Divān-e Hafiz (*1866). By 1869 his edition of Hafiz had made it onto the list of Trübner & Co., where it was offered to Western readers at such a price as will make it accessible to all students' (i.e. 7 sh., 8 d.). 
One of the most accomplished of Hadi Ali's pupils was Mur Muhammad Shamsuddin Lakhnavi (1831-1921), known as 'Ijaz raqam or 'Miraculous Pen'. He is credited with having invented a new style of nasta'liq which became popular in Afghanistan and Iran. He authored several widely used instructional tracts on calligraphy and trained many young calligraphers at the NKP and the Madrasah Aliya Furqaniya." The handsome monthly salary of Rs 50 he received indicates his superior

of his artistry is an illustrated large-letter edition of Sa'di's Gulistan (1886); his calligraphy of the Būstān (*1877) was extolled as 'a gem of lithographic elegance' by a British observer.! 
Embedded in a highly refined aesthetic tradition and invested with sacred meaning, the copying of the Qur'an required particular expertise and could only be entrusted to the most accomplished artists. In addition to Maulvi Hadi Ali, two master calligraphers were hired for the purpose. The first was Hadi Ali's pupil Maulvi Hamid Ali, known as 'Murassa raqam' (*Precious Pen'). A descendant of the venerated Lucknow saint Hazrat Muhammad Ali Shah, Hamid Ali was a scholar of Arabic and Persian who taught calligraphy at the local Madrasah Aliya Furqaniya. Next to several fine editions of the Qur'an, he copied a host of Arabic and Persian texts for the NKP (Nurani 1994: 74-5). The second newly hired master of Qur'an calligraphy was the scholar and poet Munshi Ashraf Ali 'Ashraf”, surnamed 'Javahir raqam'('Jewelled Pen'). Ashraf Ali belonged to Lucknow and had received his training from Amirullah Taslim. An expert in the writing of naskh, he prepared at least five different editions of the Qur'an, among them a large-letter edition that included 
Abdul Qadir's Urdu translation (*1872)."2 Another noteworthy accom plishment was his calligraphy of Shaikh Abu'l Faiz Faizi's voluminous Qur'an commentary, Sawāti al-ilhām (*1888), an extraordinary work to which we shall return later. 
Maulvi Muhammad Ismail, a scholar of Arabic and Persian and an expert in nastalig, was in charge of supervising the scribes and calligraphers at the NKP's lithographic department. In this position he was responsible for the compilation of the firm's catalogues and also oversaw the preparation of lithographic drafts in Nagari script. On the opening of the NKP's Kanpur press in 1865, he was promoted to the position of branch manager (Nurani 1994: 64). 
By employing several experts in ‘mirror' or reverse writing (ma küsni gāri) and stone correction (işlāḥ-e sang), the NKP contributed to the survival of a rare and waning calligraphic art. In reverse writing, the calligrapher writes on the stone's surface in inverse script, which then appears the right way round in print.13 According to Sharar, this rare art

The technique is not to be confounded with the Arabic calligraphic art of hanna ('facing each other') where a text is worked into a pattern in which one half is a mirror image of the other.

was invented in Lucknow.lt Foremost among the masters of reverse writing was Mir Hashmat Ali, who learnt his craft whilst working at the Nawab's Royal Press before 1857. He joined the NKP in its early years,

What he writes in reverse is printed clear and correct If not a miracle, what else can you call it? 
Na kahie karāmat to phir

The second master of mirror-writing and stone-correction was Munshi Sayyid Ali Husain, a pupil of Shamsuddin, who excelled in naskh, nasta'liq, and shikasta. One of his admirers was Abdul Halim Sharar, who would later employ him as a calligrapher for his journal Dilgudaz 
Muhammad Khan and Maulvi Mahbub Ahmad—the latter became super visor of the lithographic department in the early 1870s. 
In the transition from scribal to print culture, calligraphy provided an important visual link between the lithographed book and the manuscript. Even though calligraphic hands would over time become adapted to the exigencies of commercial printing, and connoisseurs would much bemoan the decline of the calligraphic art, the fact that lithographed books were handwritten remained crucial to their cultural acceptance. Publishers were well aware that an exquisite handwriting could decide over the sale of a printed book, particularly when it came to cherished religious and literary classics. This also applied to another typical feature of manus cripts, the insertion of commentaries and glosses. As in the manuscript,

they appeared in fine writing in the margins of the book and were usually written at a pronounced slant. 
The manuscript tradition also served as a model for lithographic illus tration. 16 Title pages of printed books were embellished with decorative borders and drawings of floral ornaments, while narrative texts were often illustrated. Steeped in the Persian tradition, the early Lucknow printers had developed a particularly ornate style of title page decoration. “The first impression on seeing a Lucknow lithographed title page of the small folio size ... is a feeling of extreme heaviness-entirely too much decoration within the available compass', writes Diehl. "But looking more carefully at the detail, and holding the object at some distance, the effect is that of a Persian carpet, with its many themes and variations always regular and always neat' (Diehl 1973: 121). Although in the age of commercial printing title page drawings and illustrations were no longer as elaborate and refined as in the manuscript days, they still speak of aesthetic endeavours and artistic skill (Fig. 6). Woodcut illus trations were often inserted in commercially produced texts of the epic, romance, and fictional genres to enhance their attraction. To this purpose, Naval Kishore enlisted the services of a family of distinguished illus trators (naqāsh) and drawers (muşawwir), notably Munshi Amir Ali, his son Vazir Ali, and his brother Qasim Ali. Specimens of their artistry were exhibited at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London in 1886. Perhaps Qasim Ali's finest accomplishment was his illustration of Sa'di's Gulistān (Figs 7 and 8) produced in the same year. His art was held in such high esteem that Naval Kishore granted him monopoly rights on further editions of the Gulistān (Scheglova 1999: 21). 
The Hindu calligraphers employed at the press were almost exclus ively recruited from the two principal scribal and clerical castes in Avadh, the Kayasthas and the Kashmiri Brahmins. Both communities ranked among the traditional elites in the province; Kayasthas, in particular, had held high positions in the administration of the nawabs. 17 Not sur prisingly, then, many of the firm's Hindu scribes and calligraphers be longed to distinguished local families. Most were occupied in copying Persian and Urdu books, while others prepared drafts in the Nagari script. Naval Kishore's apparent difficulties in finding skilled Nagari scribes

are a significant illustration of the continuing prevalence of the Persian scribal tradition in Avadh.18 
A notable figure among the Kayasthas working at the NKP was the Urdu poet Munshi Govind Parshad 'Fiza', a pupil of Mendu Lal 'Zar' Lakhnavi. His poetic compositions include a divan, a Masnavi Gulzār e Fizā, and an oft-reprinted Urdu verse rendering of Sa'di's Būstān. 19 Govind Parshad had joined the press as a copyist of Persian, Urdu, and Hindi works. One of his calligraphic masterpieces is the first NKP edition of Rajab Ali Beg Surur's Fasāna-e 'ajāib, produced some time in the 1860s. Two lesser known Lucknow poets on the permanent staff were Munshi Tilakram 'Hosh' and Munshi Khairaqi Lal Shigufta', the latter a pupil of Nasim Dehlavi. Both had been trained in calligraphy by Amirul lah Taslim. Special mention must be made of Munshi Debi Parshad 'Sihr' Badauni (b. 1840), whose position as Deputy Inspector of Schools in the Aligarh District had brought him in close contact with the NKP. Upon his dishonourable dismissal from public service in 1875, he joined the press and was put in charge of the textbook publishing section. Debi Parshad was a prolific writer of textbooks and the author of two popular instructional manuals on calligraphy entitled Nazm-e parvin (1868) and Arzhang-e Cin (*1868).20 His poetic work was published in his Dīvān-e Sihr-e sāmiri (1893). 
As this brief overview has shown, the NKP's foremost calligraphers, if not scholars in their own right, were well-trained men firmly grounded in the literary tradition who often engaged in writing poetry themselves. Their tasks at the press were rarely confined to the copying of texts alone. Master calligraphers performed a variety of duties, including proofreading and emendation, editing, and translation. Many of them served in the Department of Composition and Translation, the creative heart of the publishing house.

The perhaps most distinguishing feature in the NKP's institutional setting was its Department of Composition and Translation (Shu'ba-e tasnif va tarjuma), itself a novelty in Indian commercial publishing. This literary workshop constituted the creative centre of the modern kārkhāna; it was a vibrant intellectual arena at the interface of tradition and modernity. 
edition, proofreading and emendation, the preparation of textbooks, and the compilation of lexicographical works. Its dual focus on text editing and translation is an authentic reflection of the way in which Naval Kishore interpreted his function as a publisher: it illustrates both his antiquarian interest in the recovery and preservation of India's literary heritage and his engagement with Indian modernity through the diffusion of 'useful' knowledge and the translation of works old and new into the modern languages. This dual concern with the promotion of traditional and modern learning in the name of Indian progress was neither new nor unusual. Sayyid Ahmad Khan's Scientific Society (est. 1864), for exam ple, expressed a similar concern in its bye-laws, its chief objective being, firstly, to translate into such languages as may be in common use among the people those works on arts and sciences, which being in English or other European languages are not intelligible to the Natives', and, sec ondly, 'to search for and publish rare and valuable oriental works ...' (Muhammad 1978.1: 4). The Scientific Society maintained a policy of religious neutrality and expressly forbade the translation of religious works. In sharp contrast, religious texts assumed central importance in Naval Kishore's scheme of promoting the classical literary heritage in Arabic, Persian, and Sanskrit among contemporary literate audiences. It was clearly not in the interest of a commercial publisher to exclude the most widely consumed form of literature from his list.

An Empire of Books 
(Ellis 1894–1901) will testify to the immense number of Arabic and Persian works that the NKP saw through the press in a laborious process that involved careful transcription, verification, and emendation, often on the basis of various manuscript copies. The firm's initiative in seeing a wide range of Arabic and Persian works into print, including both canonized and little-known authors of both foreign and Indian origin, is all the more remarkable in that it involved considerable expense and was rarely profitable. In the process, substantial numbers of rare works designed for an exclusive scholarly readership were rescued from obli vion. Evidently, Naval Kishore was not satisfied with being a large general publisher but sought to become one of the foremost scholarly publishers in India. In his efforts to make important works of classical scholastic literature accessible to the reading public, he looked to the past contri butions of Indian pioneers of print as well as colonial institutions. A considerable number of NKP publications were reprints of works published earlier in the century from Calcutta and other centres of print. At the same time, Naval Kishore began to systematically explore the vast storehouse of manuscripts that was India. In his antiquarian pursuits he placed himself on a par with British Orientalists and kept a close watch on the activities of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. This is suggested by a substantial number of Indo-Persian texts issued almost simulta neously from the NKP and from the Asiatic Society in its prestigious Bibliotheca Indica series (see below).22 It is also evident from the self assertive manner in which he, at one point, compared his efforts to those of the Asiatic Society, leaving no doubt that his initiative in preserving India's literary heritage could well vie with officially sponsored Orient alist undertakings: 'Even in Oudh, a large sum is annually set apart by Government for the Asiatic Society of Calcutta to help in the publications of books of ancient authors', Naval Kishore pointed out to the British authorities. “The work which that Society has done with the liberal assistance of the Imperial and Local Government in 100 years, has been 
22 The project of the Bibliotheca Indica series was started in 1847–8 at the Court of Directors' request with a view to publishing the literature of the Hindus', especially Vedic texts, and translations thereof. Publication of the Old Series began in 1849, a New Series followed in 1860. Given its initial focus on Arabic texts, the series in the 1850s came under heavy criticism from H.H. Wilson, the Asiatic Society's agent in England, who found it becoming more of a Bibliotheca Arabica, than a Bibliotheca Indica, inconsistent with the intention of the Bibliotheca Indica, which was to furnish scholars with books to read, not to provide students with the means of learning to read them' (Chaudhuri 1956: xi).

done by this press to a very great extent during the entire period of its existence.23 
Much of the NKP's lasting fame in the field of oriental book publishing rests on its editions of Islamic, Persian, and Indo-Persian literature. The large body of Arabic and Persian titles on religion, philosophy, law, historiography, medicine, sciences, grammar, lexicography, and belles lettres issued from the press during the period 1858 to 1895 deserves separate study and cannot be analysed here. What concerns us in the present context are the firm's efforts in making this corpus of knowledge accessible to the contemporary readership through translation. The 1860s saw the beginnings of a sustained scheme of translating classical works into the modern languages. A collective undertaking that involved the labour of a large number of scholar-translators, it remains unparalleled in Indian publishing. 
Translation was integral to the colonial encounter. Through its acti vities the House of Naval Kishore participated in the great translation venture that marked the nineteenth century. Translation from the English was germane to negotiating the terms of colonial modernity in India, while translation from the classical oriental languages was central to the dissemination of Indian religious and scientific knowledge and, ultimately, helped reassert Indian cultural identity in the face of colonial hegemonic claims. The mediation of ancient and modern knowledge through translation had received much initial stimulus from the pioneering efforts of Orientalists, Christian missionaries, and British scholar-ad ministrators-all pursuing their own agendas. By the second half of the century, translation was no longer confined to the initiative of prominent educational institutions such as Fort William College, the Calcutta School Book Society, or the Vernacular Translation Society (est. 1844) of Delhi College, but had turned into a widespread concern among learned indi viduals and indigenous voluntary associations 24 Emulating the model of the Aligarh Scientific Society, a proliferation of literary and reformist societies put translation on their agendas. 
It was only natural, then, that a large scholarly publisher should wish to make his own contribution to India's intellectual progress. In making the production of translations a substantial part of its operations, the House of Naval Kishore assigned itself a no less active role in the grand

task of disseminating general and scientific knowledge than did other institutions and bodies at the time. However, rather than making the translation of Western works his prime focus, Naval Kishore set out to promote oriental literature and Eastern knowledge traditions. The task at hand was to render classical and standard Islamic and Hindu works accessible to an audience of modern readers who no longer had a sound command of the classical languages. 
Considerable financial and human effort was invested in what was an intense and sustained intellectual engagement with the past. By 1886 Naval Kishore could pride himself on having produced 'for the benefit of all classes of our countrymen Urdu translations of 'no less than 500 
constituted a significant contribution to the consolidation of Urdu, not only as a religious idiom but also as a new language of academic, scientific and political discourse. More than just a reflection of the growing accept ance of Urdu, it helped enhance the new status of the language in the public sphere. If literary and cultural historians of Urdu have associated the NKP with the 'revival of all Eastern literatures' (Sharar 1975: 107 8) and referred to its foundation as the most important event in the hist ory of vernacular presses' (Saksena 1990: 268), it is largely on account of its unparalleled output of translations. 
What is obscured by the above reference to the '500 Urdu translations' is the fact that the activities of the NKP's Translation Department covered much wider cultural ground in also extending to the Sanskrit and Hindi literary traditions and, to a somewhat lesser extent, to works of English literature and learning. NKP translations and modern-language adapt ations created a textual bridge between the past and the present, Muslim and Hindu traditions, and Western and Indian knowledge. Representative of various intellectual contexts and their attendant theological, academic, and epistemological discourses, they fall into the following principal categories: 
(1) translations of Arabic and Persian texts into Urdu (2) translations of Sanskrit texts into Urdu and/or Hindi (3) translations or transliterations of Urdu texts into Hindi (4) translations or transliterations of Hindi texts into Urdu (5) translations or adaptations of English texts into Urdu 
Manuscript editions and, to an even greater extent, translations, were complex undertakings fraught with linguistic, religious, cultural, and

often political implications. Indian publishers operated in a multireligious and multilingual context, which required the skills of erudite experts of different denomination, linguistic background, and varying specialization. In order to ensure a high standard for his publications, Naval Kishore not only relied on his own permanent staff of translators but enlisted the services of reputed intellectuals from outside the firm. These external collaborators were usually hired on a temporary basis and paid on con tract. Extant sources do not always allow us to make a clear distinction between translators with fixed employment and those who were only loosely associated with the press and worked on commission. Represent atives of both categories will be introduced below. 
Preserving the Islamic Heritage: The NKP 
and its Ulama For Indian Islam, the spread of print in the nineteenth century resulted in a period of intense publication and translation activity. Along with the printing presses run by Culama or Islamic institutions in places like Delhi, Aligarh, Bareilly, Deoband or Lucknow, the NKP assumed a leading role in the preservation and dissemination of Islamic textual knowledge. Previously, large parts of Islamic scholastic literature had been available only in manuscript form. Even those works of which printed editions did exist-produced early on by Fort William College, the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and pioneering Indian presses-came in limited numbers and were hard to get hold of. If not the scarcity of copies, it was high prices that put these early editions beyond the reach of the average Indian scholar or student. Naval Kishore was acutely aware of this predicament. The financial aspect therefore became a chief concern in his endeavours to make classic Islamic texts accessible to a larger audience of literate Muslims in India and beyond. His efforts at popularizing the printed book were directed at two different audiences: the general public and ‘ulama. This point is best illustrated by what may be regarded as basic core of NKP Islamic publications, the more than seventeen different editions and approximately fifty commentaries of the Qur'an (Siddiqi 1981: 17). Naval Kishore, a Hindu, made his mark in the history of Qur'an publishing: he was presumably the world's first publisher to issue a finely lithographed Qur'an at the sensational price of Rs 1, O US, in 1868.26 This indeed was the first time that the holy book was rer

An Empire of Books 
accessible to a genuine mass audience. The low price had a strong symbolic ring to it, inviting Muslims of moderate means to acquire their own copy of the Qur'an. In the same year the firm issued one of the first Qur'an commentaries in Urdu, the versified Zād al-ākhirat by Maulvi Muhammad Abdus Salam Bada'uni. Clearly, the aim was to cater as much to the common man's desire to grace his home with a copy of the Holy Qur'an as to the specific religious and intellectual pursuits of Islamic scholars. 
As noted earlier, the NKP's outstanding role in Islamic publishing was largely based on the expertise of the numerous Islamic scholars employed or associated with the press. It would go beyond the scope of this study to fully assess their contribution to the intellectual renaissance of Indian Islam. While this topic still awaits study by an expert in the field, it must suffice here to give an overview of the scope and diversity of their activities through the example of a few prominent figures. In what seems a fitting reflection of the scholarly talent gathered at the House of Naval Kishore, Rahman Ali's standard collective biography of Indian Islamic scholars, Tazkirah-e Culamā-e Hind, was first published by the NKP in 1894. 
The way in which the publishing house engaged with Islamic scholasti cism can best be illustrated by the example of a celebrated work, Ihya' Culüm al-dīn (Revival of the Religious Sciences), by the great theologian and philosopher Iman Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (1058–1111). One of the most widely read works after the Qur'an, Ihya Culūm al-dīn has continued to exert immense influence in the Muslim world. In India, too, it was a standard piece of ethical reading and the subject of much comment and study. It formed the turning point in the spiritual life of an influential Cālim such as Maulana Abdul Bari of Farangi Mahall, who after studying the text was drawn away from the rational sciences towards mysticism (Robinson 2001: 82). Yet it was not the Arabic Ihyā to which the text owed its widespread popularity in India, but al-Ghazali's own simplified Persian synopsis entitled Kimiyā-e sa ādat (The Alchemy of Happiness). Naval Kishore played a key role in the dissemination of al-Ghazali's masterpiece: not only did he make the Arabic and Persian texts widely available in book form, he also supplied the first Urdu translations of both. 
price being further reduced to 13 1/2 annas. By this time, inexpensive editions of the Qur’an were flooding the market. British reports list an edition of 4400 copies brought out from Meerut and sold at 12 annas (RPIR 1876: 25).

In 1862 the NKP published its first edition of Kimiyā-e saʻūdat, pre pared by Maulvi Hadi Ali Ashk'. It was only the second time that the text had been circulated in print; an earlier edition of uncertain date had previously been published at Calcutta. The Arabic Ihya al-Sulūm followed in 1864 (1281 ah), being the second edition after the Cairo editio princeps of 1278 ah, and the first printed on Indian soil. Its editor Muhammad Muzhir had prepared the text from a collation of several manuscripts and the Cairo edition. Around the same time, Naval Kishore commissioned Maulana Fakhruddin Ahmad Qadri 'Fakhri Lakhnavi (d. 1892) with an Urdu translation of the Kimivā-e saʻādar. Fakhruddin was a scion of Farangi Mahall who was renowned for his rhetorical skills. He joined the NKP as a proofreader and translator and was for some time associated with the editorship of Avadh Akhbār (see Chapter 6). Published under the title Iksir-e hidāvar (The Elixir of Guidance, *1866), his translation of the Kimiya-e saʻādat was of a distinctly popular character. Written in a pleasant and lucid style, it came to be viewed as a text especially suited to the moral instruction of Muslim women and was to figure in several standard works on female education, notably Altaf Husain Hali's Majālis an-nisā and Ashraf Ali Thanawi Simon Zewar (Minault 1998: 46; B. Metcalf 1990: 378). It may have also been the version on which Claud Field based his first abridged English translation of Kimiya-e sa ādar, published from London in 1909 in the 'Wisdom of the East' series. While at the NKP. Fakhruddin contributed a second widely acclaimed translation in the form of Tafsir-e Qadri (*1879-80), an Urdu rendering of Tafsir-e Husaini, a commentary on the Qur'an by the fifteenth-century Persian moral philosopher Husain Va'iz Kashifi. With its lucid and simple style, the commentary was to head the list of books deemed suitable for women in Thanawi's Bihishti Zewar (B. Metcalf 1990: 376). In sharp contrast to the popular character of Fakhruddin's texts, the ensuing translation of the Arabic Ihya' 'ulum al-din clearly addressed an elite audience of learned scholars. The translation was done by Maulvi Basharat Ali Khan: it was published with the Arabic original as Mazāq al-'ārifin (Relish of the Wise, *1875) in four volumes of over 3000 pages. 
Nurani makes the ill-informed claim that Maulana Muhammad Ahsan Nanautawi (d. 1895), an eminent representative of the Dar ul-u Deoband and Arabic teacher at Bareilly College, assisted the some time in proofreading and editing Arabic texts. In actual fact, than enlisting the Maulana's services, the NKP seems to have obtaine permission to reprint several works that had been published previously

from his own press, the Matba -e Siddiqi in Bareilly.27 As these reprints indicate, Naval Kishore maintained close and friendly ties with the Deo bandi (ulama. In 1876 he reprinted Ghāyat al-autār, Maulana Khurram 
Ali's Urdu translation of Haskafi's authoritative Arabic law book Durt al-mukhtār, which had first come out from Bareilly in 1872.28 The reprint of over 2800 pages was appreciatively received by Indian scholars of Islamic law and British administrators alike. DPI White judged it a very useful work, and one which if translated into English would be of material help to our law-courts. 29 
Inspired in the sixteenth century by Shaikh Abdul Haq Dehlavi (1551 1642) and much enhanced in the eighteenth century by Shah Waliullah (1703-62), the study of Hadith (traditional sayings of the Prophet), conti nued to hold great importance for contemporary Indian Islam. Naval Kishore published most of the standard collections of Hadith in Arabic and Persian. His 1869 edition of Irshad al-sārī, a famous Arabic commentary on al-Bukhari by Ahmad Qastalani (d. 1517), was a landmark in Hadith publishing. A reprint of the Bulaq edition of 1868, the ten volume edition of 3833 pages sold at Rs 52. Other editions included the widely used Mishkāt al-Maşābih, a collection arranged by al-Tibrizi in 1336 on the basis of al-Baghawi's Masābih al-sunna, and its equally popular Persian translation cum commentary by Shaikh Abdul Haq Dehlavi, Ashisat al-lamaʻāt, issued in a fine edition of over 2300 pages in 1872–3. There was an obvious demand for the Mishkāt and its translation: a standard work in traditional Sunni education, it was the only text of Hadith prescribed in the Farangi Mahall's Dars-e Nizāmi curriculum.30 Several Hadith compilations were issued in Urdu trans lation. By far the most important was Mazāhir-e ḥaqq (*1870–3), a comprehensive translation cum commentary of the Mishkāt. With its high-flown style and Arabicized language this scholarly work had little appeal for the layman but was popular among students of Islam. Its author Maulana Muhammad Qutbuddin Khan Dehlavi (1804–72) was a noted scholar of Hadith and Islamic jurisprudence who spent part of his adult life in Mecca and Medina.31 Naval Kishore published most of

Qutbuddin's prolific oeuvre; the contacts between author and publisher, however, remain obscure. Other Hadith collections in Urdu included a translation of Mashärig al-anvār entitled Tuhfat al-akhyār by Maulana 
lurram Ali, and Shamim al-rivā: by Qazi Fazil bin Iyaz. Maulana Fazl Ahmad Ansari, a scholar associated with the NKP Lahore, translated al-Tirmizi in his two-volume Jūmie Tirmizi malarjuma-e Urdū(* 1891 
4). 
In the late 1880s the NKP's staff of Islamic scholars was joined by Maulana Sayyid Amir Ali Malihabadi (1858-1919), who would soon rise to fame as a leading authority in Qur'anic exegesis and Islamic jurisprudence. Prior to his appointments as head teacher at the Madrasah Aliyah in Calcutta and the Nadwat al-Ulama in Lucknow, Maulana Amir Ali served at the publishing house for some time. Upon joining the NKP on a monthly salary of Rs 50, he was assigned a special project: the editio princeps of the San'ati al-ilham (Brilliant Lights of Inspiration, *1888). This celebrated commentary on the Qur'an by Shaikh Abu'l Faiz Faizi, the great scholar and Poet Laureate at Akbar's court, is remarkable in that it does not make use of dotted letters. In his preface to the edition, Amir Ali adhered to the same principle. His second project involved the first Urdu translation of Fatāwā-e Alamgiri (*1890), an exhaustive and authoritative survey of Hanafi jurisprudence compiled during the time of Aurangzeb. Previously, Naval Kishore had reprinted the original Arabic text, Al-Fatānī al-Alamgirivat (*1875), from the Calcutta edition of 1828–35. In 1885 two volumes had been translated into Urdu and published in monthly instalments by Maulana Ihtesham uddin Muradabadi. 32 Completed in four volumes in 1890, Amir Ali's Urdu version was a substantial work of 4660 pages, priced at Rs Next, Amir Ali finished Ain al-hidāyah (*1896), a voluminous Urdu commentary of al-Marghinani's al-Hidāva, a twelfth-century standard work of Islamic law that formed part of the traditional Islamic curriculum His most outstanding achievement, however, is the Urdu translation of Tafsīr Mawāhib al-rahman (also known as Jāmi al-bayan), a vast commentary on the Qur'an compiled from various Arabic sources.

most comprehensive commentary on the Qur'an ever written in Urdu and is a hallmark of Islamic publishing in the subcontinent. 
While representing only a small proportion of Islamic works issued in Urdu translation, the foregoing examples indicate the NKP's wide ranging engagement with the Islamic textual tradition. Next to editions and commentaries of the Qur'an, it covered a variety of textual genres relevant to religious education and contemporary debate on theological and scholastic issues. In encompassing works of both manqūlāt, the 'transmitted' or 'revealed sciences' (including jurisprudence, principles of law, hadith, and Qur'anic exegesis), and ma'qūlāt, the 'rational scien ces' (including logic, theology, philosophy, and mathematics), of Shi'a and Sunni theology and of Sufi mysticism, the firm's list reflected contesting scholastic traditions within Islamic thought. 33 Significantly, some of the above-named titles reappear in the 1895 first-hand account by an Islamic scholar which Barbara Metcalf cites in her magisterial study of the Deoband seminary. The passage deserves to be reproduced in full here, for it vividly testifies to the profound impact of commercial print culture on Indian Islamic education and scholarship: 
Now God has been gracious by providing books. Books which one could not see in dreams or conceive of in imagination are now sold for cowries.... The [Fatawa-yi] Alamgiri used to be unavailable. The government published it in Calcutta before the Mutiny, but it sold for 90 rupees. Similarly, the Tafsir-i Kabir sold for 300. The king had a copy of it and when Shah Abdu'l Aziz needed it, he borrowed it from him. No one even knew the Fathul Bari, for in all of Delhi there were only parts of it, scattered among three places. There were only eighteen copies of Bukhari, and of these, generous people had divided copies into parts and distributed them among students so that they could study them. When I studied Tirmizi from Miyan Sahib [...] three of us shared one copy; and we three lived in different sections of the city. ... One of us would study it for a few hours, then another would carry it off.... No one had a chance to study a whole book. A copy of the Hidayat was divided among students: one would start it from one place, an other from another. ... Because of reading incompletely and out of order. [the study of] every book was deficient. If a person had even a faulty copy of a book, that was considered a great blessing and he was held to be very wealthy. (Metcalf 1982: 205-6) 
Moving away from strictly Islamic literature, the following sections will take a closer look at two textual disciplines that were paramount in reflect ing contemporary epistemological and cultural concerns: medicine and

historiography. An integral part of Indian and especially Indo-Persian intellectual traditions, the two disciplines figured prominently in the new interface of indigenous and Western knowledge systems generated by the colonial encounter. The large number of medical and historical works on the NKP list not only reflect this interface, they also illustrate the variegated Indian response to the hegemonic claims of colonial science and the British appropriation of the Indian past. In promoting these genres, the publishing house reacted to a discursive encounter between contesting knowledge traditions in the two areas where it was most significant and intense. 
5.3 Medicine and History for Lay and 
Scholarly Readers 
Revitalizing Indigenous Medicine From the outset, Naval Kishore made the publication of medical texts, primarily of works of the Greco-Arab Unani (vīnāni) system prevalent in the Islamic world, an important area of specialization. The number of ancient and contemporary medical treatises, materia medica, and phar macopoeias issued from his press in the original Arabic and Persian or in Urdu translation is estimated at over 130 titles (Siddiqi 1981: 15)." Such emphasis on medical publications was a corollary to the revival of the classical medical tradition within Indian Islam, itself a result of the interaction between Western and indigenous medicine. 
The encounter between Indian and Western medicine has generally been portrayed as part of a wider process in which Indian knowledge was transformed into colonial knowledge and subjected to the latter s empiricist trajectories. The early generation of British physicians and Orientalist scholars had professed a keen interest in the textual sources of Unani and Ayurvedic medicine. 'British physicians', writes David Arnold, 'were engaged in a typically Orientalist exercise, widening the bounds of Western knowledge by interrogating Oriental texts and native informants" (Arnold 2000: 66)." Colonial interest in indigenous medical knowledge, particularly its more 'sophisticated' textual tradition, was

partly a consequence of setbacks in fighting cholera, plague and other epidemic diseases, which 'not only challenged attempts to establish the superiority of Western medicine but also emphasized the physical frailty and political vulnerability of colonial rule' (ibid.: 198).36 By mid-century, British interest in Indian medicine had somewhat diminished and given way to a growing belief in the superiority of Western medical science. Indigenous scholars and practitioners responded to these hegemonic claims in a variety of ways. Championed by Hakim Ajmal Khan (1836– 1927) of Delhi and Hakim Abdul Aziz (1855-1911) of Lucknow, Muslim professionals both engaged with, and resisted, colonial medicine. Hakim 
Abdul Aziz proposed a reformed Unani medicine as a commonly ac ceptable national substitute for the colonizing drives of state medicine (Alavi 2003; 2005). In 1870 he set up a clinic to teach a reformed and standardized form of the Unani system. The revived interest in Unani medicine could also be seen elsewhere: in 1875 Shaikh Imamuddin Ahmad launched a monthly medical periodical in Urdu entitled A’ina-e Tibābat (Mirror of Physic) from Agra.37 In 1889 the first official school of Unani medicine, the Tibbi Madrasah, was opened in Delhi. Several years later, the 'ulama at the Deoband madrasah institutionalized Unani medicine in their curriculum in what was part of the larger Islamic revival generated from the seminary (Metcalf 1982: 103, 349). By the end of the century Unani medicine had come to hold a privileged role in the reaffirmation of Muslim identity since it proved 'the continuing validity of Islamic values in a changing context' (Vanzan 2000: 3). 
Yet the revival of Unani medicine also followed a different trajectory. There was a shift in emphasis from the mastery of the theory to the practice of Unani (Alavi 2005), which went hand in hand with a new con cern to simplify medical knowledge and render it accessible to the general public (Kumar 1997: 177). Medical texts were no longer intended to be 
powerful effect on the way Indian medicine was perceived and its relationship with Western medicine was understood. Medicine was one of the fields of inquiry through which Oriental scholarship sought to represent and capture the essence of Indian (especially Hindu) civilization, just as through their topographical exercises medical writers sought to define the nature of India's physical environment' (Arnold 1993: 44).

consumed by professional specialists alone. An increasing number of Urdu original tracts and translations addressed the new audience of lay readers. A manual like Zubdat al-hikmat (Compendium of Wisdom, *1869), by Hakim Sayyid Muhammad Qamar Ali of Mathura, was clearly designed for household use, giving instructions on how to employ items of daily life (rozmarra cizem) in the treatment of disease. The laicization of Unani medicine also extended into other genres: writers of educative fiction like Nazir Ahmad introduced a basic knowledge of medicine and hygiene as part of good housekeeping and mothering. Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanawi, in his classic of female education Bihishti Zewar, devoted a whole chapter to Unani medicine and health care (Vanzan 2003). 
Printed texts were central to these various manifestations of the revived interest in medicine. If the intense production of medical literature by the NKP reflected the general revival of Unani medicine, it also had to do with the firm's location in Lucknow, a stronghold of the medical profession. Headed by its famous Azizi family of Hakims, from the late eighteenth century Lucknow had been home to some of India's greatest Unani physicians. As Sharar with his usual hyperbole tells us, the science progressed to such a degree that there were few quarters ... which did not contain a celebrated family of professional physicians. Apart from those existing in the hundreds of quarters of the city itself, thousands of clinics had been set up in neighbouring villages and small towns. All the famous physicians practising at the courts or in the towns of India had come from Lucknow or its neighbourhood' (Sharar 1975: 97). Having published the great Persian classics of Unani, in the early 1870s Naval Kishore began to produce Urdu translations of popular medical texts. This was the time when Hakim Abdul Aziz, in an effort to standardize and institutionalize education in Unani medicine, opened his clinic and school in Lucknow. As Seema Alavi has shown, the Hakim enlisted the support of the NKP and the Nami Press in getting medical texts printed and supplied at reasonable rates (Alavi 2005). Underlying this collective effort at popularizing Unani knowledge in Urdu was a new self assertiveness vis-à-vis colonial medicine. Naval Kishore's Avadh Akhbār provided a forum for a lively debate on Unani versus English medicine (ibid.: 118). In July 1875, for example, a correspondent of the Allgarn Institute Gazette reported on a 'very sensible' article on indigenous 
was an

medical practice recently published in Avadh Akhbār, which made a strong case for the continuing usefulness of the Muslim and Hindu medi cal systems. These were said to enjoy widespread acceptance in spite of the 'sheer neglect and cold treatment' they met with on the part of India's present rulers.39 
NKP medical publications spanned across space and time, from the early Greek, Arabic, and Persian classics to the great physicians of the Mughal period and the works of modern authors writing in Persian or Urdu. While most titles were standard works used in the traditional Unani curriculum and in general practice, the publisher's list also included some rare and specialized works that had not been circulated in print before and were eagerly received by medical specialists.40 The sales aspect of medical literature must not be overlooked: in being in constant demand by a large class of professional practitioners and those interested in medicine, standard medical texts were profitable publications. 
In his scheme to popularize the key texts of Indo-Persian medicine, Naval Kishore first turned to the works of Muhammad Akbar Arzani (d. 1722), the celebrated Sufi physician of Aurangzeb's court. In 1867 Arzani's Mujarrabāt-e Akbarī, a formulary of compound remedies, was released in Hakim Wajid Ali Muhani's Urdu translation. It marked the beginning of an intense and prolonged effort to acquaint the Urdu readership with the glorious past of Unani medicine in India. Soon after wards, Naval Kishore acquired the copyright of an Urdu translation of Arzani's Tibb-e Akbar by Hakim Muhammad Husain Nanautawi. The text, revised and edited by the Hakim's brother Muhammad Yakub, came out in 1870. Around the same time Hakim Muhammad Nur Karim Daryabadi (d. 1878?), a reputed local physician and author of Shifā al amrāz, was commissioned to render into Urdu two of Arzani's hitherto

untranslated works. The first was Mufarrih al-qulüb, a Persian com mentary on Mahmud ibn Umar al-Jaghmini's Qanunchah, itself a popular epitome of Avicenna's Canon of Medicine. It was published as Iksir al qulüb(*1870). The second was Arzani's Qarābādin-e Qădiri, an elaborate pharmacopoeia, issued in Urdu as Kimiva e Canāsiri (*1870). Previously, Nur Karim had translated the Makhzan al-adwivah (The Storehouse of Medicaments, *1865?), a widely used eighteenth-century compendium on simple and compound medicaments by Muhammad Husain Khan Shirazi.41 His translation became one of the standard medical dictionaries in Urdu. 
Hakim Nur Karim was one of several reputed Unani physicians from Lucknow and its environs who assisted the publishing house in its translations of Arabic and Persian medical texts. Another was Hakim Ghulam Hasanain Allamah Kinturi (1831-1918), a distinguished scholar and pharmacologist.+? At the behest of Naval Kishore, he prepared the first full-length Urdu translation of the most celebrated of Unani classics, Ibn Sina's (Avicenna's) Kitāb al-Qānūn fi al-tibb or Canon of Medicine. In the reformed curriculum devised by Hakim Abdul Aziz, Ibn Sms encyclopaedic work held central importance. The Urdu version came out in five volumes in 1871-2. Following al-Qanun, Ghulam Hasanain translated al-Jaghmini's Qānūnchal (*1889) and Kāmil al-șināʻah al tibbīyah (Complete Book of the Medical Art, *1889), a systematic tenth century work by 'Ali ibn al-Abbas al-Majusi that had been the standard before Avicenna. His fourth important contribution was Mulaklıkhas-e Fuṣūl-e Buqrāti (*1872?), a translation into Persian of the Aphorisms of Hippocrates and Galen's commentary. 
A third and particularly prolific translator associated with the NKP was Hakim Muhammad Hadi Husain Khan Muradabadi, author of a Persian medical catechism entitled Kanz al-asrār (*1871). His Urdu translations of standard Persian works include the following titles: (1) Qarābādin-e Shifāi(*1870), a sixteenth-century pharmacopoeia by Muzaffar Shifa'i Kashani; (2) Qarābādin-e Zakãi(*1871), an eighteenth century work by Hakim Zakaullah Khan; (3) Zakhirah-e khvārazm-shahi (*1878), a comprehensive twelfth-century medical encyclopaedia by Isma (il ibn Hasan al-Jurjani, said to be the most important systematic

Muhammad Hadi Khan) Shirazi; and (6) Tlāj al-amrāz by Muhammad Sharif Ali Khan of Delhi. Directed at a more general readership was his Urdu rendering of Zād-e gharib (*1885), a con temporary Persian medical handbook for travellers by Sadiq Ali Khan of Delhi.43 
The NKP's sustained efforts in making Unani classics widely available in print did not go unnoticed by the British authorities. The 1880 edition of Makhzan al-adwiyah, for instance, was approvingly acknowledged as one of the series of old elaborate standard works of the Greek system of medicine, hitherto unpublished and scarcely procurable, which are being printed by Munshi Naval Kishore'. Scholarly interest and acute concerns about public health combined in attracting government patronage for such publications. In the intensified interaction between Western and indigenous medical systems, pharmacopoeia and medical treatises had indeed come to serve as 'a textual window between Europe and Asia'(Bayly 1996a: 266). 
As will be shown in Chapter 7, the NKP's specialization in medical texts was not confined to Unani works but also extended to Ayurvedic medicine. Once the firm began to produce books in Hindi and Sanskrit, Ayurvedic works appeared as a distinct category on its list. In sharp contrast to the creative interface that Unani and Ayurvedic medicine had enjoyed well into the eighteenth century (Arnold 2000:4), the translation of medical classics followed clear cultural demarcations and allowed for little interchange between the two systems: Unani works were gener ally rendered into Urdu, and Ayurvedic works into Hindi. Significantly, the only exception to this pattern were the firm's two medical bestsellers, both of recent origin: the first was the Persian Ilāj al-ghurabā (Aid to the Poor), a popular medical treatise compiled by Hakim Ghulam Imam around 1847. Its Urdu translation, Tashil al-shifā (* 1865) by Hakim Asghar Ali Khan, was highly acclaimed and had gone through seven

editions by 1881. Such was its popular appeal that Naval Kishore deemed it expedient to invest in a Hindi translation. Prepared by Pandit Pyarelal in 1882, Ilāj al-gurabbā bhāsa arthāt din jan cikitsā was equally well received and frequently reprinted. In a similar fashion, the first Urdu translation in 1878 of Amrisūgar (Ocean of Nectar), a medical bestseller on the NKP Hindi list, was the result of a market-oriented decision on the publisher's part. 
What about translations of Western medicine? The relationship be tween Western colonial and indigenous medicine has often been portrayed as antagonistic. As Mark Harrison notes, there was 'a widespread distrust of Western medicine stemming from its association with an alien regime (Harrison 1994: 19). State medical intervention, as in the case of coercive smallpox vaccination, was strongly resented (Arnold 1988). Yet over time colonial public health policy and the movement for sanitation did make some inroads into indigenous society. According to Deepak Kumar, they generated a heightened awareness of health issues among educated Indians and entailed a demand for 'greater availability of Western medicine' (Kumar 1997: 177). There is, however, little indication of this at the textual level. Judging by the market, it was only towards the close of the century that Western medical knowledge had begun to gain enough public acceptance to make the translation of English medical treatises commercially viable. Naval Kishore only invested in two such translations; the first was the Sanitary Primer (*1886) by J.M. Cunin gham, the Government of India's Sanitary Commissioner, the second Samuel Osborn's widely used Ambulance Letters, First Aid to the Injured (1885), issued as Ilāj bar mahall in 1896. If the publisher showed no apparent interest in promoting works of allopathic medicine, he certainly did not hesitate to promote western-style pills and patent medicines 
Engaging with the Past: Works of 
Indo-Muslim Historiography 
Much recent scholarship has sought to explore the way in which colo nialism engaged with and appropriated Indian history. The study of the Indian past through its historiographic textual sources was a major imperative in British efforts to secure information about the country; it was key to establishing and maintaining colonial rule in India. As Bern hard S. Cohn has argued, among the different investigative modant devised by the British to rule India, the historiographic modality the most complex and pervasive mode of probing India's past an ization: ‘Knowledge of the history and practices of Indian state 
ates

seen as the most valuable form of knowledge on which to build the colo nial state' (Cohn 1997:5). Academic debate has centred on the variegated Indian response to the hegemonic claims of colonial historiography, as formulated in the works of James Mill, Mountstuart Elphinstone, James Tod, John C. Marshman, and Henry M. Elliot's and John Dowson's monumental History of India as Told by its Own Historians (1867–77). Implied in the debate is a strong refutation of the colonialist notion of an Indian ‘lack of historical consciousness'. While the existence of historical sensibilities has been traced back to premodern India, 45 it has been argued that the rationalist principles of modern European historiography were readily embraced by sections of the Indian intelligentsia; over time they would exert a formative influence on the development of historiography as a modern academic discipline in India. At the same time, the appro priation of India's past by colonial historiography was vigorously con tested and resisted. Faced with the bias and distortions of colonial history writing, educated Indians engaged in developing an agenda for an alternative and authentic indigenous historiography of their own (Guha 1988). In Bengal, English-educated authors of textbooks were the first to openly contest the colonialist interpretation of Indian history (Chatterjee 1993: 76-94), long before the great spokesman of the Bengali intelli gentsia, Bankimchandra Chattopadhyaya, launched his famous nation alist appeal in 1880, urging his compatriots to join together and write 'their own history' (Guha 1988: [1]) Meanwhile, in North India eminent Muslim reformers like Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan and Maulana Shibli Nomani became the chief advocates of a new Islamic historiography, responding to the challenges of both colonialist and incipient Hindu nationalist historiography.40 
The various ways in which Indians engaged with and simultaneous ly resisted the dominant discourse of colonial historiography and its 'hegemonic texts' underscore the existence of an already vibrant indi genous debate. Historians like C.A. Bayly have strongly argued against 
* See, especially, Narayana Rao, Shulman, and Subrahmanyam 2001. Among the increasing number of studies describing the Indian contestation of colonial historiography and the formation of an indigenous nationalist historiography, see, e.g., Sen 1973; Chatterjee 1993; 1995; Guha 1988; 1997; Kaviraj 1995; and Ludden 1996. 
The promotion of Islamic historiography remained a concern of Muslim re formers into the twentieth century. It was a professed aim of the Lucknow Nadwat al- ulama's journal Al-Nadwa. launched in 1902 with a view to fostering Muslim sell-confidence and counteracting the ill-informed and prejudiced portrayal of Islam in official school textbooks Details in Malik 1997: 438-9: 465-6.

an understanding of indigenous historical consciousness that dates the beginning of modern Indian historiography to the needs of the modern, that is colonial state. A self-consciously modern history', contends Bayly, had already begun with the attempt of the post-Mughal elite to adjust to the rise of Hindus and the British (Bayly 1996: 84). His argument that historical memory was paramount in shaping the identity of this elite is corroborated by much textual evidence. The collective concern with the past manifested itself in a variety of literary forms, some of which were vigorously dismissed by colonialist historiography as irra tional and lacking factual accuracy. Its most overt expression was the proliferation of historical and topographical writing in Persian and Urdu chronicles, generally denoted as tārikh. Other manifestations were the tazkirah, or collective biography, and the Persian/Urdu lyrical genre known as shahr āshob ('city destruction'), that is poems invoking the erstwhile greatness of the Mughal civilization, which were infused with a strong sense of collective loss. Within the Hindu tradition, historical memory was contained in the Purānas and in genealogical texts known as vamśāvali and khyāt, written in Sanskrit and the regional languages. Up to the early nineteenth century Puranic history remained a valid form of retelling the political history of Bhāratavarsa' (Chatterjee 1993: 
79). 
These different genres, supplemented by an increasing number of latterday tārīkh writing in Urdu, were widely consumed by Indian readers. On the NKP list, historical writing in Persian and Urdu was classified under the subheadings of Tazkirah', 'Biographies of Saints and Pro phets', 'Histories of Prophets', and Histories of Kings and Emperors , forming a distinct category alongside the obvious history textbooks prescribed in colonial education. By contrast, among Sanskrit and H titles, there was no special category for 'historical works', which still belonged within the traditional forms of 'itihās', that is the great epics, and the Purānas. Leaving aside textbooks such as Shiva Prasad silinas timir nāśak (History as the Dispeller of Darkness, 1864–73), in Hindi commercial publishing there was still little sign of the abandonment of Puranic history in favour of a rational historiography as described by Chatterjee for Bengal (Chatterjee 1993: 76-115).48

In this climate of heightened historical consciousness and increased activity in historiographical writing, it comes as no surprise that history titles should constitute an important part of an Indian publisher's list. What is more remarkable is the pioneering spirit and untiring zeal dis played by Naval Kishore in recovering a variety of medieval Persian sources hitherto unpublished or existing in rare early-nineteenth-century editions only. His strategy in promoting works of Indo-Persian historiography was the same as previously encountered in the case of medical texts: firstly, to make the Persian classics widely accessible, and secondly to have them translated into Urdu to meet the growing de mand for historical knowledge among the vernacular readership. 
At first Naval Kishore turned to the same sources that nineteenth century colonialist historiography had increasingly come to rely upon, that is, the works of the great medieval Indo-Muslim historians.49 Whether or not he did so at British instigation is difficult to say in hindsight. He was certainly aware of British historians' work. The beginning of the NKP's engagement with Indo-Persian historiography in the mid-1860s was marked by the reprints of two famous works that had, early on, at tracted Orientalist attention. The first was Tārīkh-e Firishta, a general history of India down to the year 1612, written by Muhammad Qasim Hindushah (commonly called Firishta) during the reigns of Akbar and Jahangir. As early as 1768, select portions of the text were available in an English translation by Alexander Dow, who relied heavily on Firishta in compiling his History of Hindostan (1768-72). The complete text was translated by John Briggs in his History of the Rise of Mahomedan Power in India in 1829. Soon afterwards, the first editions of the original Persian 
particularly regarded textbooks authored by Indians who, themselves products of the colonial education system, perpetrated the biases of colonial historiography. Shiva Prasad's Itihās timir nāśak, the first history of India written in Hindi, is a famous case in point. It was widely disseminated in M. Kempson's English translation, A History of Hindustan (1866), and the author's own Urdu version A'ina-e tarikh numā (1867–74). An open appraisal of the benefits of British rule which had rescued India from the darkness of centuries of Muslim despotism', the book came under heavy criticism for its vehemently anti-Muslim stance. Hindus, on the other hand, attacked it for its anti-Brahminical invectives. It was eventually replaced by W.W. Hunter's Brief History of the Indian Peoples. Its reintroduction into the curriculum in 1890 provoked fierce criticism in the media. See SVN 1890: 267 and 370; Powell 1999; Dalmia 1997: 330–2.

text were issued from Bombay and Poona in 1831-2. However, over thirty years went by before Tarikh-e Firishia was reissued from Lucknow in 1864. Prepared by Munshi Kaliparshad, the NKP's two-volume litho graphed edition was sold at the reasonable price of Rs 4, as 8. As befitted the momentous occasion, Naval Kishore presented Sayyid Ahmad Khan's Scientific Society with a complimentary copy. 
The second work was Sivar al-mula akhkhirin (Overview of the Modern Age, *1866), a history of India in the eighteenth century written by Ghulam Husain Khan Tabataba'i around 1783. With its lucid critique of British Company rule in Bengal and Bihar, this text presents an im portant example of the early indigenous discourse on colonial rule in India.So Its publishing history much resembles that of Tārikh-e Firishta: like Firishta, Sivar al-mufa'akhkhirin was first circulated in print in an English translation prepared in 1789. The editio princeps of the Persian text was printed at Calcutta in 1832. Again, the text had been unavailable for more than thirty years when, in the 1860s, Naval Kishore decided to invest in a reprint. 
In his scheme of promoting the key texts of Indo-Persian historio graphy, Naval Kishore looked closely to the activities of the Asiatic So ciety of Bengal. The near simultaneous release of a number of important works suggests that he even entered into some sort of tacit competition with the Asiatic Society. One particularly notable instance of his suc cessfully pre-empting British Orientalist efforts is Abul Fazl's celebrated Akbarnāma, the most influential historical work of medieval India. The publication of Akbarnāma from the NKP in 1866–7 was a momentous event: it was the first time that this important text appeared in print. The three-volume lithograph edition of over 1800 pages was sponsored by the Maharaja of Patiala. Its small print run of 275 copies and high price of Rs 50 (low compared to the £12, s. 12 it would later be advertised for in Trübner's Catalogue!) suggest a deluxe edition; so does a rather disparaging comment in Elliot and Dowson's History of India: 'It is a handsome and costly work, and it is greatly to be regretted that its literary value is by no means commensurate with the money expended upon it (Elliot/Dowson 1875: 8-9). It is important to note that, subsequently, Akbarnāma was sold to the general public at a substantially reduced price of Rs 20 (Fihrist 1879). 
The NKP Akbarnāma preceded the Bibliotheca Indica edition (1873 86) by several years. Yet Naval Kishore hardly found time to contemplate his achievement. In 1867, assisted by a sumptuous government

Rs 5000, the Asiatic Society commenced its critical edition of Abul Fazl's A’in-e Akbari (Institutes of Akbar). Soon after the first fascicles had appeared in the Bibliotheca Indica series, Naval Kishore launched a reprint of Sayyid Ahmad Khan's early critical edition of A’in, previously issued in an incomplete version only. Complete in three volumes, the NKP edition of 1869 was 'copiously illustrated and produced with im pressive thoroughness and clarity' (Lelyveld 1996: 73).51 At Rs 30 it was only marginally more expensive than the Calcutta edition of 1877, which sold at Rs 27, as. 8. More of this seemingly competitive' publishing followed: shortly after the Asiatic Society had begun its edition of Abdul Qadir Bada’uni's Muntakhab al-Tavārīkh (1864-9), Naval Kishore brought out his own edition in 1868.5-H. Blochmann, in an introductory article on Bada’uni appearing in the Journal of the Asiatic Society in 1869, commended it as being 'a very fair edition' (Blochmann 1869: 144). In terms of price, too, the NKP text compared favourably with the Calcutta edition. At Rs 9, as. 6, the three-volume Calcutta edition was priced almost twice as high as the NKP edition, which sold at Rs 5. 
Conversely, in the case of Iqbālnāma-e Jahāngiri, the Bibliotheca Indica edition preceded the 1870 NKP edition by five years. Composed by Nawab Mu'tamad Khan (also known as Muhammad Sharif), a high officer at Jahangir's court, Iqbālnāma was famous for its third part, which was based on the Emperor's own memoirs and covered his entire reign in the form of annals. Several years later, the NKP was again a step ahead of the Asiatic Society when it brought out the first lithographed edition of Tabaqāt-e Akbari(*1875), a general history of India from the beginning of Muslim rule to the 38th year of Akbar's reign. Composed 
According to his biographer Altaf Husain Hali, Sayyid Ahmad Khan had first been approached with the request of preparing a critical edition of A’in-e Akbari by Haji Qutbuddin, a rich Delhi merchant, who also promised a lavish remuneration of Rs 1600. Sayyid Ahmad declined, but after his transfer to Bijnor returned to the idea of editing the text. A first incomplete edition was published from Delhi in 1856 (Hall 1966: 102). It seems that the 1869 NKP edition of the A'in was issued in two different versions. Arberry's catalogue lists an illustrated text of 1205 pages, whereas the edition mentioned in the 1879 NKP catalogue, 'complete with illustrations and maps, is said to comprise 1342 pages (Fihrist 1879: 66). 
» Bada'uni's general history of India from the Muslim conquest to the reign of Akbar forms an important contrast to Abul Fazl's chronicles. It is not to be confused with Muntakhab al-tavārikh (*1860) by Javahirlal Akbarabadi, an abridged Urdu translation of Makhzan al-tavārikh. Its author, a hakim and newspaper editor of Agra, translated a number of Persian historical works into Urdu (HLHH II: 91).

towards the close of the sixteenth century by Khwaja Nizamuddin Ahmad, the work served as a model for later writers of Mughal history. It was not until the year 1911 that the Persian text, together with an English trans lation, was taken up for publication in the Bibliotheca Indica series. Its editor B. De, in addition to three manuscript copies, relied heavily on the NKP edition. 
While this completes the list of works published from both the Asiatic Society and the NKP, it does not exhaust the Lucknow publisher's reper toire of Persian historiographical titles. 54 In 1871 Naval Kishore issued Jami' al-tavārikh, a contemporary world history by Faqir Muhammad. Other works of importance followed, among them Tavārikh-e ?abari (1874), an abridged Persian translation of Tabari's universal history, and Rauzat al-safū (Garden of Purity, *1874), a celebrated fifteenth century work by Mir Khwand. Despite its enormous prestige-- "There is no Oriental work that stands higher in public estimation than the Rauzat al-safā' (Elliot/Dowson 1872: 129)-Rauzat had only been printed once in the 1840s in Bombay. Again, Naval Kishore was the first to reprint it. The lithographed edition of over 1500 pages (3 vols) sold at Rs 12. 
Despite several flaws and imperfections, Naval Kishore's editions of Persian historiography achieved a certain standing as authoritative sources. While they may not have matched the standards of modern critical editing, they were certainly consulted by British Orientalists. Frequent references to the Lucknow edition of Firishta, Bada’uni or Abul Fazl suggest as much. In the case of the NKP Akbarnāma, Orientalist usage of the text was accompanied by harsh criticism. Dowson noted the abundance of gross and obvious errors and the want of entire pas sages (Elliot/Dowson 1875: 9); H. Blochmann dismissed it as worse than the worst possible MS.' (Blochmann 1872:52). Likewise, the Biblio theca Indica editors of Akbarnāma, who consulted the NKP text alongside various manuscripts, heavily criticized its shortcomings. It was only later that H. Beveridge, the English translator of Akbarnāma, gave a more impartial assessment of the respective achievements of the Biblio theca Indica and NKP editions: 
The Bibliotheca Indica edition is by no means so good as it might have been, for the learned native editors were destitute of geographical or hist orical knowledge. Hence they have often made mistakes in the names of 
34 A work of Arabic historiography also deserves mention here: In 1870, th issued Futūḥ al-shām(also called Maghāzi al-Rasul), a history of the Syrian conquest ascribed to al-Waqidi. It was first edited by W. Nassau Lees for the Bibli Indica in 1858–62.

persons and places. They have also no explanatory notes. In their preface they are severe upon the Lucknow edition. No doubt that edition has many faults, but it was the first in the field, and it is on the whole a creditable monument of the enterprise of the publisher, Munshi Newal Kishor, and of the liberality of the Maharajah of Patiala.55 
Naval Kishore's growing reputation in the field of Persian history pub lishing also attracted the patronage of British officials. William Young, Judicial Commissioner of Avadh and a member of the Asiatic Society, chose to commission the Lucknow publisher with the edition of his English translation of Tauqi āt-e kisrawīyah (*1892), a sixth-century work on early Persian history and geography attributed to King Khusrau Anushirwan. The Persian text, itself a translation from the Arabic, had already been published by the NKP in 1870. The English translation posed a challenge to the firm's editorial office, for it was the first time that a Roman transliteration from Persian had to be prepared. Young was clearly satisfied with the result: in the preface to his work he pro fusedly thanked Naval Kishore 'for the hearty aid he has given me throughout and that moreover in a matter not within his ordinary scope as a printer and publisher. 56 
From the 1870s onwards, the preoccupation with the past was also reflected in a spate of works on regional and local history written in Urdu.57 In 1876 Naval Kishore issued Şaulat-e Afghani, a substantial work of over 700 pages by Muhammad Zardar Khan, which provided a historical account of the Afghan people and its clans. A British reviewer considered it 'well worthy of the study of those who are interested in frontier politics.'58 Not surprisingly, in promoting contemporary historio graphical writing the NKP placed a certain emphasis on the history of Avadh. Its most important publications on local history were Qaisar al tavārīkh(*1879) and Savānihāt-e salātin-e Avadh (*1879) by Kamaluddin

Incidentally, one of the earliest historical works on the NKP Urdu list was Tarikh-e mumālik-e Cin(*1864), a history of China authored by the Indo-British poet James Cochrane, poetically surnamed 'Karkaran'. Cochrane, a former translator at the High Court of Bengal, was a lawyer at the Allahabad High Court (Saksena 1941: 145-6).

Haidar, the foremost chronicler of navābi Avadh.59 In a telling indication of his pronounced interest in history, Naval Kishore himself chose to enter the fray of writers with a work of history. His Tarikh-enādir al-asr (Chronicle of a Singular Period, *1863) combined a brief account of the administration of his patron. Colonel Saunders Abbott, with a sketch of the local history and topography of Lucknow. In calling his account a tarikh, the publisher consciously placed himself in the tradition of local historians. 
Naval Kishore's objective of enhancing historical knowledge by making the principal works of Mughal historiography available in Urdu translation tallied with colonial efforts. Hence, it is often difficult to determine whether specific translations were undertaken at his own ini tiative or prepared under the aegis of the British authorities. The total of original and translated historiographical works in Urdu on the NKP list easily surpasses fifty titles. Included in it are a number of translations of European works, which will be dealt with separately below. Among the firm's first history texts in Urdu translation, proudly announced in the Avadh Akhbār of 31 October 1865, was Tārīkh-e Rum, a history of Greece translated from the Arabic by Muhammad Qudratullah Khan (LLH 1805: 317). Another translation of an Arabic classic followed in the form of Futūhāt-e Wāgidi (* 1870-4), a history of the Islamic conquests ascribed to al-Waqidi. The bulk of translations, however, related to the above named works of Indo-Persian historiography. By 1874 Urdu versions of Tavārīkh-e Tabari. Jāmi al-tavārikh, Tārikh-e Firishta, Muntakhab al tavārikh and Siyar al-muta akhkhirin were ready. It is important to note that most of these texts had not been translated before. Various translators were involved in the effort: Maulana Ihteshamuddin, a scholar of Murada bad who had previously assisted the NKP in translating Fatawa-e 
Alamgirī, translated Tavārīkh-e Abd al-Qādir Badaunī (*1874). The translation of Siyar al-muta akhkhirin was entrusted to Munshi Gokul Parshad, a Srivastava Kayastha of Kanpur. Published in three volumes as Mirāt as-salātin (*1874), it earned him steady employment in the NKP's translation department. Gokul Parshad also composed poetry under the pen name 'Raza'. He was in many ways typical of the firm's

5.4 A Transition in Print: From Persian 
to Urdu 
The nineteenth century witnessed the gradual replacement of Persian by Urdu, both in its official role of court and administrative language, and as a medium of poetry and of journalistic, scientific, and fictional prose. The new public role of Urdu and its growing prestige as the new lingua franca of northern India entailed the slow but steady decline of Persian. While Persian literature continued to be held in high esteem among the educated classes, and there was still a considerable market for books in Persian, by the end of the century the transition from Persian to Urdu had led to a quantitative reversal in the number of Persian and Urdu books produced in North India. It had also led to a proliferation of translations and bilingual formats. 
In a reflection of the cultural continuum that Persian and Urdu pre sented, Naval Kishore, like most North Indian commercial publishers, produced books in both Persian and Urdu from the very beginning. The large number of Persian works continuously emanating from his press mirrors the still vigorous tradition of Persian scholarship and its con tinuing importance in Indian intellectual culture, while also reflecting the literary tastes of educated Indians. Naval Kishore catered to prevailing interests through a wide range of inexpensive reprints of Persian religious and literary classics. Yet he was seemingly not satisfied with doing so, for he also sought to assume a more prominent role in Persian publishing, acting as a custodian and preserver of the rich tradition of Persian and Indo-Persian literature in the subcontinent. To this end, he produced an unparalleled range of scientific, historiographical, legal, lexicographical, and medical titles, including a substantial number of works lithographed for the first time and circulated in India even before they appeared in print in the Middle East. Others, as has been shown, were reprints of rare editions published early in the century and no longer available. It would go beyond the scope of this study to give a comprehensive overview of the vast array of both popular and scholarly editions of Persian literature issued from the NKP. Instead, we shall continue to concentrate on the publisher's grand cultural project: the promotion of Persian and the Indo Persian literary heritage through Urdu translation.

For a long time the House of Naval Kishore followed a dual language' policy, according equal status to the literatures of northern India's old and new lingua franca and promoting them side by side. It was only at the end of the nineteenth century that the dwindling position of Persian in the public sphere and the attendant decline in the demand for Persian books became visible in NKP publication figures, when the ratio between Persian and Urdu publications shifted noticeably in favour of Urdu.' It would be wrong to attribute this shift to a deliberate departure from the earlier policy or an intentional relinquishing of Persian on the publisher's part. On the contrary, the NKP continued to remain a supplier of high class editions of Persian works well into the twentieth century. It played a decisive role in upholding the position of Lucknow as the main strong hold of Persian publishing in the United Provinces. The city still accounted for 41,000 copies of Persian books in 1900 and over 10,000 in 1914 (King 1994: 41). 
On the NKP list, the linguistic transition from Persian to Urdu found its immediate expression in a host of formats designed to facilitate comprehension, that is translations, popular reworkings, and comment aries on Persian texts, as well as annotated and bilingual editions. While encompassing a variety of genres, the majority of such titles pertained to the canonical texts of the Persian intellectual tradition, including epics and poetry, history, akhlāq (a genre of ethical literature encompassing both politics and ethics), and inshā (the art of composition and letter writing). A typical publication in the latter category was Inshā-e Safdari (*1872), a collection of Persian model letters with Urdu versions by Ghulam Safdar. Like other publishers, Naval Kishore reprinted popular works like Gulistan-e mutarjim (*1867), an edition of Sa'di with inter linear Urdu translation and marginal notes. 62 However, the demand for Urdu versions was such that he decided to also invest in producing his own translations and commentaries. 
In the book trade, as elsewhere, the transition from Persian to Urdu was gradual. Its living embodiments inside the publishing house were 
60 This tallies with King's observation that the overall number of Persian publications in the NWP&Oudh only fell precipitously around the turn of the century (King 1994: 41).

An Empire of Books the large numbers of bilingual Munshis engaged in proofreading, editing, and translating Persian texts into Urdu. Some of them were poets in their own right. Like their archetypal representative Mirza Ghalib, these men belonged to a generation of north Indian literati who were fluent in Persian and deeply steeped in its literary traditions, at the same time, they in creasingly took to Urdu for private and social communication and began to adopt the modern language for their own literary compositions. 
The first prominent figure on the NKP's team of Persian translators was the Urdu poet Totaram 'Shayan' Lakhnavi (d. 1879). He belonged to an eminent family of Srivastava Kayasthas of Ayodhya; his grandfather Mansukhrai and father Atmaram had been important courtiers of the Avadh nawabs. Fate ordained that Totaram should live in much humbler circumstances: in the early 1860s he joined the NKP as an editor translator. Totaram was a versatile author whose poetical works include Wāsokht-e Shāyān (*1869) and Farhang-e ishq (*1868). He also estab lished himself among local historians with two brief histories of Avadh entitled Tārīkh-e Sitāra-e Hind (*1871) and Tilism-e Hind (*1874).63 His fame, however, rests largely on his work as a translator. At the behest of Naval Kishore he prepared Urdu translations of several great Persian texts, starting with Mahābhārat manzūm, a verse rendering of the Persian Mahābhārat prepared at Akbar's court by Abul Fazl, Abdul Qadir Bada’uni, and others, itself a celebrated example of the splendid tradition of translation at the Mughal court. Totaram's abridged Urdu version appeared in 1862; the edition was richly illustrated with woodcuts. In the same year, he completed a verse rendering of the Hamzah romance known as Tilism-e Shāyān (*1862). With its 30,000 lines this version of Dāstān-e Amir Hamzah is one of the longest Urdu maşnavis ever written in North India (Pritchett 1991: 23–4). It was also the first step in the NKP's sustained efforts towards popularizing the dāstān genre (see below). Totaram's second translation was of another classic of oriental literature, Alif Laila or Arabian Nights (*1867). Two existing previous Urdu versions of the Arabian Nights, prepared by Munshi Shamsuddin Ahmad Shirvani and Munshi Abdul Karim for the use of Fort St George College and Fort William College, were meant for European learners of Urdu and written in a simple prose style.64 By contrast, Totaram's version of 1867 was the first Urdu prose rendering designed specifically for a

64 Shamsuddin Ahmad Shirvani, Hikayat al-jalilah (Madras 1836); Abdul Karim's translation (Kanpur 1847) was apparently based on Edward Foster's English version of the Arabian Nights.

readership of Indian connoisseurs. Comprising over 1000 pages, his Hazār Dāstān was much closer to the original text in retaining the arrangement of the narrative into nights and adopting a highly meta phorical and ornate style replete with Persian and Arabic idiom. While for that very reason the translation did not find favour with the British Orientalist James Blumhardt, it was well acclaimed by the Urdu read ership.65 
Significantly, Naval Kishore did not leave it at that. Given the popular demand for poetry, the prose version of the Arabian Nights needed to be complemented by a verse rendering. The task was assigned to Muhammad Asghar Ali Khan 'Nasim Dehlavi (1794-1864), a poet of repute emp loyed at the NKP. On completing the first volume Nasim apparently fell out with the publisher, who found his progress too slow. The translation was handed over to Totaram, who undertook the second and third volumes; the last two volumes were translated by Shadi Lal 'Chaman'. Complete in 1244 pages, Alif Lailā nau manzüm (*1861-8) was widely advertised in the columns of Avadh Akhbārand various other newspapers, The publication notice in Mufarrah al-Qulub, a Persian paper of Karachi that regularly carried announcements of NKP titles, is worth quoting, for it nicely illustrates the emphatic and flowery rhetoric of book advertising at the time:

Scarce, exceptional and select are the people in this age whose natures have experienced Pain, whose hearts are familiar with Love, who are fond of the sweet pleasures of Poesy and take interest in listening to tales and fables. True it is that consciousness comes by learning of the conditions of the Past; the curtain of Ignorance is thus removed from the mind and 
65 Blumhardt wrote: 'The translation is virtually in prose, but it abounds in snatches of poetry, songs and couplets taken from the writings of Persian poets, and here and there a verse-rendering of bits of the story. This translation, though substantially agreeing in the main with that of Abd al-Karim, yet differs widely from it in the treatment. It is full of flowery metaphors and is written in a rich, ornate style full of Persian and Arabic words and idioms, which renders it far less easy to understand than the simple language of Abd al-Karim. Some passages have been considerably enlarged and sometimes contain quite different reading from that of 'Abd al-Karim with occasional additional matter. In other places descriptions have been much curtailed so that although the thread of the story may be the same in both translations, it is hard to believe that the two translators worked from the same version. Unfortu nately Totaram Shayan makes no mention at Ali [sic] the source whence he made his translation whether English or Arabic. This translation reached its fourth edition in 1883, and has been published with the addition of several badly executed full-page illustrations evidently taken from English prints.'

heart. Is it ever possible for the Men of Insight to be satiated with the Sight of books? Are men of wisdom ever too contented with tales and stories? There are stories, creations of poets, but this story of a thousand and one nights is pleasantly provocative of Love. Where else can anyone get a more interesting story? To the lovers, every night of this attractive Laila brings the delights of the night of meeting with the beloved. Every morning of this attractive Salma is an exegesis of the Surah 'wa-alshams'. First it was printed and liked in the Arabic tongue. Then it was translated into English: the high and the low liked it. Next, it was put into Urdu prose which was praised by everyone ... Wits and men of insight prefer the verse form of ‘mathnavi’. Therefore, this humble man, Naval Kishore, the owner of Matba' Avadh Akhbar, asked the poets associated with the Matba to raise an edifice of poetry in such a way as to make this attractive Mistress ... beautified by verse. First of all ... Janab Mirza Asghar Ali Khan tried his hand at it. The stories of the first two hundred and fifty nights were versified ... The next five hundred nights were put into verse form by Munshi Tota Ram 'Shayan'. He had already made his mark by translating Mahabharat and Dastan-e-Amir-Hamza into Urdu verse. The remaining story of the last two hundred and fifty nights were put into poetic form by Munshi Shadi Lal Chaman, the disciple of the late Mirza Nasim. (cited in Khan 1991: 292-3). 
No history of the NKP would be complete without describing the firm's singular role in the preservation and promotion of the traditional Persian and Urdu prose narrative known as qissa and dāstān. 66 In the case of the dāstān, the transition from Persian to Urdu antedated an even more significant transition from orality to written texts. There is no other literary genre in which the NKP's role at the interface between the oral and the written has been so well explored as in the case of the qissa and dāstān. Frances Pritchett (Pritchett 1985; 1991) has documented in great detail how, on a single publisher's initiative, a hitherto oral tradition was complemented by a written one, which through its printed texts ultimately outlasted the former: 'In the long run, Naval Kishor turned out to be a more important patron of the Urdu dastan than any prince or aristocrat: he was responsible for creating and preserving most of the texts which today provide our only real access to the tradition' (Pritchett 1991:29). 
Persian qissas and dāstāns were well-established and popular genres in India by the beginning of the Mughal period, particularly in the form 
66 Whereas in Persian the terms qissa and dāstān describe the same romance genre, in Urdu they came to be differentiated on the basis of length, dāstāns being, as Frances Pritchett puts it, 'long qissas' and qissas 'short dastans' (Pritchett 1985: 
4).

of Dāstān-e Amir Hamzah, a vast cycle of romances about the life of Hamzah, the uncle of the Prophet and legendary champion of Islam. Transmitted orally, the dāstān developed its own Indo-Persian tradition and subsequently established itself as a genre in Urdu literature. By the latter half of the nineteenth century the narration of Urdu dāstāns by professional storytellers (dāstān-go) enjoyed enormous popularity. Lucknow became the single most important centre in the cultivation of oral dāstān telling.67 It comes then as no surprise that the most conse quential undertaking in fixing the popular genre in print should be initiated by an enterprising local publisher such as Naval Kishore. Significantly, his pivotal role in promoting the dāstān in print was not limited to Urdu but also extended to the popularization of qissa and dāstān texts in Hindi (see Chapter 7). 
Qissas and dāstans were first printed at Fort William College. Next to the well-known qissas of Cahār darvesh (Bāgh o bahār), Gul-e bakāvali, Hātim Ta’i, and so forth, in 1801 the college also published one of the earliest written versions of Dāstān-e Amir Hamzah, composed by Khalil 
Ali Khan Ashk. More than half a century later, the history of dāstān publishing shifted to Lucknow. Having issued a reprint of Ashk's text in 1869, Naval Kishore soon deemed it expedient to replace it with an improved and updated' version that would appeal to the changed literary tastes of the contemporary Urdu readership. The task was entrusted to Maulvi Hafiz Abdullah Bilgrami, a teacher at the Arabic school of Kan pur. Working on an earlier version by Ghalib Lakhnavi, Bilgrami delivered a much improved and revised text which was free of archaisms and wri tten in ‘a grandiose and highly ornate language' (Farooqi 2001: 169).68 The title page of this Dāstān-e Amir Hamzah Şāhibqirān (*1871), as translated by Pritchett, offers some interesting publication details: 
67 'For ordinary people, there were almost daily public performances by dastan gos in Chauk, starting "when the lamps were lit". And for the elite, there were private sessions-even for ladies. Upper-class women kept their own female dastan-gos and storytellers, who were treated with real respect. Story-telling sessions often went on and on in the early evening until the dining cloth was spread" (Pritchett 1991: 15). See also Sharar 1975: 91-4 for a graphic account of dāstān cultivation in Lucknow. 
68 Bilgrami's Dāstān was first translated into English by Pritchett on the basis of its revised and expurgated eleventh edition of 1969 (Pritchett 1991). Pritchett's choice of source came under heavy criticism by M. Farooqi who supplied a new translation of the text in the AUS on the basis of Bilgrami's original 1871 version (Farooqi 2000).

An Empire of Books 
Although the Ashk version), because of its appeal to great and small, has been printed in thousands of copies in Calcutta, Bombay, and Delhi, and at the Avadh Akhbār Press, it has always been disliked by purists for its archaic idioms and convoluted style. With the greatest effort and energy Maulvi Hāfiz Abdullah Sāhib, teacher at the Arabic school (madrasah) of Kanpur, has made modern additions and alterations and corrections in the language and idioms, at the desire of the Master of the Press. And under the supervision of the employees of the press of Munshi Naval Kishor, situated in Lucknow, in the month of November 1871 AD, at the special request of Janāb Maulvi 
Abdul Aziz Sāḥib Bookseller of Lucknow, who has generously promised before publication to buy a great number of copies, with the greatest haste it has undergone publication. (Pritchett 1991:29) 
Bilgrami’s modernized version was, in turn, revised by the NKP emenda tor Tasadduq Husain Rizvi, who was in charge of the fifth edition of 1887. Variously revised and simplified over the years, it continued to sell extremely well and was kept in print at the Tej Kumar Press until the 1990s. 
The publication of the Bilgrami version was only the beginning of the NKP's sustained efforts in preserving the Urdu dāstān, which culminated in the firm's celebrated edition of the complete Amir Hamzah cycle. In 1881 Naval Kishore hired the most reputed dāstān-gos of Lucknow, notably Shaikh Tassadug Husain, Munshi Ahmad Husain Qamar, and Munshi Muhammad Husain Jah, who recited their stories in the presence of scribes or else wrote them down themselves. The outcome of this singular collective effort was a monumental 46-volume edition of Dāstān e Amir Hamzah, issued from the press between 1883 and 1917. The first seven volumes to be completed in 1883-93 were Tilism-e Hoshruba (The Stunning Enchantment), the fifth book of the Dāstān, which came to enjoy immense popularity in its own right. Since Muhammad Husain Jah fell out with Naval Kishore at an early stage of the venture, most volumes were edited by Tassaduq Husain and Ahmad Husain Qamar. Dastān-e Amir Hamzah represents a unique achievement in the history of Urdu publishing. Ironically, it also marked the end of dāstān writing in Urdu, for the traditional narrative genre was soon to be replaced by the modern novel. The NKP edition of the dāstān remained, as Pritchett has so aptly put it, both its crowning glory and its coup de grâce (Pritchett 1985: 6). 
Reverting our attention back to the late 1860s, the project of translating the Persian classics into Urdu started in earnest in 1868-9, with two unterent renderings of Firdausi's great epic Shāhnāmah. One was 
313 
Calligraphers, Scholars, and Translators 
prepared by Munshi Fida Ali Aish', an Urdu poet employed at the press, the other by Munshi Gokul Parshad Raza', who has already been introduced as the translator of Sivar al-mufa'akhkhirin.69 As the NKP's new Persian head translator. Gokul Parshad contributed an Urdu re working of Nizami's Sikandarnāmah entitled Kārnāma-e Sikandarī (Chronicle of Alexander the Great, *1873).70 He also translated two rare Persian texts that commanded high prestige in learned circles: Nür-e 'ain (Light of the Eye, *1872), a translation of Dara Shikoh's famous metaphysical discussion of Susism and Vedanta known as Majma' al bahrain (The Meeting-Place of the Two Oceans); and Ajāibal-makhlūgāt (The Wonders of Nature, *1877), itself a Persian version of Qazwini's Arabic cosmography. Gokul Parshad's Urdu translation sold so well that in 1886 it was complemented by a Hindi version entitled Adbhut srsti caritra. 
Gokul Parshad was also one of the many Indian translators of Jalal al Din Rumi's Masnavi-e ma'navi, a celebrated work of Sufi mysticism that commanded immense popularity and was the focus of much study in India. The range of NKP editions, translations, and Persian as well as Urdu commentaries on Rumi's mystical poem provide a good example of how the same text was offered in various formats to appeal to different audiences: for the sophisticated scholastic reader and learned mystic the most important publication by far was the NKP's three-volume edition (1873) of the Arabic commentary of the Masnavi by the famous Farangi Mahall scholar Abdul Ali Bahral-Ulum. Abdul Ali interpreted Rumi in the light of the teachings of Ibn Arabi; his study became a Sufi classic and an important point of reference in the development of nineteenth century Indian Sufism (Robinson 2001:24, 82). Readers not classically trained could choose between two different Urdu translations by Gokul Parshad and Ghulam Haidar; or else resort to Latā if al-lughāt (* 1871) and Latā if-e ma'navi (*1877), a dictionary of expressions and com mentary by Abdul Latif; Pirāhan-e Yusufi (* 1889), a translation-cum commentary by Muhammad Yusuf Ali Shah: and Būstān-e ma'rifat 
69 Gokul Parshad had come to Lucknow from Kanpur in search of a living. After a temporary job in the Education Department he was facing unemployment and was about to return to his native place when Naval Kishore offered him employment at his firm (Mirāt al-Salatin, *1874, translator's preface). 
70 The translation was submitted under the Allahabad Government Prize Notification but returned as 'unworthy of notice' (PGNWP. Educational Dep., Oct 1873, No. 23 B). By contrast, Garcin de Tassy applauded Naval Kishore's initiative in the translation (LLH 1873: 21).

(*1894-5), a voluminous Urdu commentary by Abdul Majid Khan of Pilibhit. 
Like translations, Urdu commentaries of the Persian classics were in high demand. In 1876 Naval Kishore commissioned Maulana Sayyid Muhammad Sadiq Ali Rizvi to prepare a commentary on the collected verse of Hafiz. In 1882 there followed Guldasta-e khayāl, a comment ary on Sa'di's Gulistan by Maulvi Sayyid Razak Bakhsh of Jaunpur. Meanwhile, the firm had enlisted the services of another experienced Persian-Urdu translator, Maulana Abul Hasan Faridabadi. Abul Hasan, who combined a background in Islamic scholarship with excellent English skills, had worked for the Education Department and also served as official translator to the Avadh ta'alluqdārs' British Indian Association (Anjuman-e Hind). His Minhāj al-sālikin(*1871), an Urdu translation of the celebrated Persian Yogavāsistha composed under Dara Shikoh, was widely acclaimed. In the 1880s the Maulana prepared a series of trans lations of standard Persian commentaries on the panegyric poems by Urfi, Jami, and Badr-e Chach for the press. He also rendered Riyāz-e rizvān, a famous commentary on Sa'di's Gulistān, into Urdu.? As will be shown later, his skills were also sought in a special undertaking of cultural translation—that of English works into Urdu. 
Mediating between the vanishing world of Persian and the new verna cular cultures, these bilingual scholars and munshis worked side by side and, occasionally, in close interaction with another group of cultural intermediaries serving the publishing house: its Hindu pandits. 
5.5 Sanskrit Shastric Texts for the 
Modern Reader 
Although the province of Avadh was a treasure trove of Sanskrit manus cripts (Nesfield/Deviprasad 1874-93), no significant contribution to Sanskrit publishing emerged from Lucknow until the late 1860s, when 
e NKP began to systematically engage in the publication and translation of Sanskrit texts. Naval Kishore deserves credit for being the first pub lisher in the city to promote Sanskrit works on a commercial scale.' 
“Tarjuma-e Urdū-e sharh-e Yusuf Zulaikhā (*1890), Tarjuma-e sharh-e qasā'id e Badr-e Cāc (*1889). Sharh-e mutarjim qasā'id-e Urfi (*1887), Tarjuma-e Urdū Riyāz-e rizvān sharh-e gulistán (*1884). 
i ne only other Lucknow press to occasionally bring out Sanskrit texts was the amar-e Hind Press of Pandit Baijnath. One of its earliest publications was the Yajurveda Samhita (1869).

Since nineteenth-century Lucknow is hardly associated with Sanskrit cultural production, his contribution to the revival of the Sanskrit heritage and the promotion of Hindu shastric texts in the modern languages has escaped scholarly attention altogether. Even if largely reproductive in nature, this contribution deserves to be noticed, for it was substantial and did not lag behind similar efforts undertaken at the main centres of Sanskrit publishing. 
Naval Kishore's approach to the Sanskrit canon was in keeping with the firm's overall policy of popularizing religious classics among a wide section of the contemporary readership. His target audience was the general reader rather than the Sanskrit scholar, whose needs were in creasingly met by specialized Sanskrit publishers in the metropolises of Bombay and Calcutta, as also the nearby Hindu pilgrimage towns of Benares and Allahabad. Naval Kishore had no ambition to compete with their vast and variegated output of Sanskrit scholastic and scientific literature. His objective clearly was to promote the classics in inexpensive editions, while simultaneously producing a body of standard works in translation that were easily accessible in terms of both cost and content." At the time, notions of what constituted the canon of Sanskrit literature, both sacred and profane, were by no means uniform. While we have a fair picture of those Sanskrit scriptures regarded as authoritative by eminent contemporary Hindu reformers and nationalists, it is no less interesting to take a look at the texts selected for publication and trans lation, that is, in other words, considered representative of the 'perpetual Hindu tradition, by a commercial publisher. The publisher's choice was based on market demand, itself indicative of a common consensus of what constituted the Sanskrit tradition for the majority of the Hindu lite rate public. Rather than reflecting sectarian or scholarly interests, it featured a much more popular' canon of Hindu texts. 
By the time Naval Kishore turned his attention to the Sanskrit literary heritage, there was considerable activity in translating Sanskrit texts into the modern languages.76 His own engagement in promoting Sansk 
73 See Appendix V for a list of NKP Sanskrit publications. 
74 Consequently, there are no overlappings between NKP Sanskrit titles and the scholarly publications contained in the Benares Sanskrit Series, published from 1880 by the pandits of the Benares Sanskrit College.

works in Hindi cannot be viewed in isolation from the pervasive cultural process that Vasudha Dalmia has described as the 'nationalization of Hindu traditions' (Dalmia 1997). Instigated by Hindu nationalism and revivalism, this complex process involved the construction of a cultural and ideological configuration in which Hindi, the proclaimed national language of the modern Hindu nation, was linked with its Sanskrit, pre Muslim past, perceived as the glorious and untainted Golden Age of Hindu civilization. As Dalmia has shown, the historicization of Hindi' took place as much at the linguistic level—that is by way of the deliberate Sanskritization of the language and insistence on its Aryan pedigree as through the construction of its literary tradition. In the retrospective canonical search for the 'true' corpus of Hindi literature and the attendant creation of a national literature, the proponents of the new Hindu cultural consciousness looked beyond medieval Hindi texts to the classical models of Sanskrit literature. Underpinning the narrative of continuity from Sanskrit to Hindi, Sanskrit texts in translation came to form an essential textual link between the present and the past; once easily ac cessible in mass-printed editions and an idiom intelligible to the common people, they formed one of the key elements in the construction of the religio-cultural identity of the new Hindu nation. 
Providing a good illustration of this linguistic-ideological bridging, a standard format adopted by commercial publishers was the bilingual edition, in which the Sanskrit text was accompanied by a modern-langu age translation, commentary, or simple prose paraphrase. Needless to say, the bilingual format was not exclusively motivated by Hindu revival ist considerations; it was also a pragmatic reaction to the noticeable decline in Sanskrit knowledge. In his analysis of publishing patterns in the NWP&Oudh, King points to the disproportionately high increase of such dual-language works, which multiplied 'at a greater rate than any other language or language combination (King 1994: 41). That a large proportion of Sanskrit-Hindi and Hindi-Sanskrit titles were school textbooks explains their significant statistical impact: 7200 copies of bilingual works were issued from Lucknow in 1884, as opposed to 2000 from Allahabad and 1500 only from Benares. By 1900 the figures had risen to over 14,000 for Lucknow, compared to 6000 in Allahabad and 2750 in Benares (King 1994: 43). 
It is no coincidence that the NKP's expansion into the field of Sanskrit publishing was inaugurated with the publication of one of the most revered Hindu scriptures, the Bhāgavata Purāņa, in 1868-70. Sponsored by the Raja of Patiala, the two-volume edition of nearly 1300 pages included 
Calligraphers, Scholars, and Translators 
317 
the standard commentary by Shridhara Svamin. It was issued in a run of 1375 copies and sold at the rather high price of Rs 15. The Bhāgavata Purāņa not only provided the religious auspiciousness befitting the start of a venture into Sanskrit publishing, but, as a key text of Vaishnavism, it also set the tone for much future publishing of Hindu religious texts at the press. An edition of the Bhagavad Gita with the Hindi commentary by Harivamsh Lal followed in 1875. It was supplemented in 1888 by Srimadbhagavadgitānavalbhāsya, which assembled the standard com mentaries by Shankara, Anandagiri, and Shridhara, and also contained a translation of Shankara's commentary in 'easy national language (saral desbhāṣā), composed at the publisher's instance by Pandit Umadatt Tripathi of Farrukhabad.77 As stated in the publisher's notice, Naval Kishore had spared no expense in having the new commentary produced specifically for those who only knew Hindi (bhāṣā)'. 
Prior to launching its Sanskrit Bhāgavata Purana, the NKP had already made a momentous contribution to the diffusion of this most widely cherished scripture of Krishna devotionalism with its reprint of Sukhsāgar (Ocean of Bliss, *1866). Composed in 1846–7 by Makkhanlal, a Panjabi

77 I follow Dalmia in translating desbhāṣā', lit. 'language of the region/country', as 'national language' (cf. Dalmia 1997: 192). In the early nationalist rhetoric of the nineteenth century, desbhāṣā was indeed the common precursor of the later current term 'rāştrabhāṣā', which, however, carried much stronger Hindu nationalist connotations.

Khatri settled in Benares, Sukhsāgar appears to be the earliest Hindi prose translation of the complete Bhāgavata Purāna. The text was first released in 1854; no copies of this edition have survived. It was only with the 1866 NKP edition of Sukhsāgar that the Bhāgavata Purāna was for the first time made available to Hindi readers in its entirety. The pub lication found a prominent sponsor in Maharaja Mansingh of Ayodhya, who may have also been the channel through which the NKP acquired the copyright of the text. Sukhsāgar was clearly designed for the pious lay reader and was not overly concerned with the theological intricacies of the text. Written in remarkably simple and fluent narrative prose, it became a perennial favourite with Hindi readers. The text owed much of its popularity to the fact that it was particularly well suited for a female readership and for being read to children.78 
From the early 1870s Naval Kishore began to produce his own trans lations and commentaries of Sanskrit texts. In the absence of programma tic statements it is difficult to determine to what extent he was motivated by commercial considerations or whether Hindu revivalist and nationalist ideology played any part in his decisions. Garcin de Tassy in his lecture of 1873 posited a direct connection between the NKP's translations of the ‘Puranas and Vedas' and the concerted effort at promoting the shastras by several learned societies of Mirzapur, Benares, Patiala, and Lucknow at the instance of one Pandit Indra Prakash. The pandit, according to the French scholar, had argued the necessity of translating not only works of the arts and sciences, but also religious scriptures, into Hindi, so that 'the name of the Hindu nation remain on the pages of history' (LLH 1873: 60–1). Such considerations notwithstanding, the sales aspect cer tainly played a substantial part in the selection of titles, for the corpus of NKP Sanskrit works in translation consisted almost exclusively of titles with a reasonably assured market potential. Besides the classics of shas tric literature, it included works of traditional Hindu medicine and astro logy, two textual categories that served the practical needs of the large professional groups of medical practitioners and astrologers, while also being increasingly consumed by lay readers. In sharp contrast, Sanskrit philosophical, poetic, and scientific works that appealed to a select audi ence of scholars and literary connoisseurs only, rarely made it onto the Lucknow publisher's list. The market demand for such titles was too limited, their publication better left to those who specialized in Sanskrit literature. Similarly, Sanskrit texts of the poetic (kāvya) or dramatic

(nātya) genre, which did not lend themselves easily to translation, scarcely figured in NKP catalogues. Exceptions to the rule were almost certainly instigated by pragmatic reasons, as demonstrated by the translations of Kalidasa's Kumārasambhava and Magha's epic Siśupālabadha in the early 1890s. What prompted the translation of these texts was their incorporation into the syllabus of the Calcutta University Examination. They are a typical example of a publisher providing comprehension aids to a student readership with an increasingly defective knowledge of the classical language. As the NKP translator Pandit Kalicaran asserted in the preface to the Hindi Sisupalabadha, 'by reading [this work] those with little knowledge of Sanskrit as well as those gentlemen connoisseurs of poetry who are fluent in the Khari Boli of Delhi and Agra will easily be able to understand the purport of the slokas. It is hoped that this book will also be of great assistance to students undergoing university examin ations, for there will be no necessity to consult any other commentary in order to understand the implied meaning (of the slokas)."79 In his preface to the Hindi Kumārasambhava, Kalicaran went even further in reassuring students, claiming that they would get much help from the translation and would not even have to read the Sanskrit original: 'By studying this one book alone they will be able to pass their exams.' Surely an attractive proposition! 
Another factor underlying the selection of Sanskrit texts for translation was private patronage (Table 5.0). Substantial numbers of works were commissioned by connoisseurs of Sanskrit from among the affluent urban intelligentsia or the ranks of the Avadh ta'alluqdārs, who in creasingly served as patrons of Hindu culture. Some sponsors had a personal interest in seeing a particular text into print: when Raja Shiva Prasad sponsored the publication of Gitāgovindādars (*1875), a Hindi translation of Jayadeva's famous twelfth-century lyrical poem, he wished to publicize a work that had originally been commissioned by his great grandfather Raja Dalcand, one of the Jagat Seths of Murshidabad. The Lucknow advocate and Kayastha leader Munshi Kali Prasad patronized an extraordinary publication in the form of the Persian version of the Mitāksarā (*1879), a standard text of Hindu law, and also sponsored the translation into Hindi of Sukraniti (*1881), a 'Mirror for Princes' and standard work in the science of Hindu political ethics (nīti) by Shukra. What was true for ta'alluqdārs and other private patrons also applied to the publisher. If, from a commercial point of view, translations from

Sanskrit into Hindi or Urdu were not always profitable, they were certainly an avenue for Naval Kishore to accumulate cultural capital as a patron of Hindu literature. Title pages of NKP shastric texts routinely eulogized him as a ‘munificent well-wisher of Hindu culture and religion' and em phasized the publisher's readiness to incur large personal expense in seeing a particular text or translation into print. 
Private patronage was also crucial to a major publishing venture of the early 1870s: the reprint of the Mahābhāratdarpan (Mirror of the Mahābhārat, *1874). This earliest comprehensive translation of the Hindu epic into Brajbhasha verse had been initiated in the 1820s under the aegis of the Maharaja of Benares. The first publication of the text along with its supplement—Harivamsadarpan, from the Calcutta Shastra Prakash Press in 1829-30—had constituted a landmark in early Hindi publishing. Garcin de Tassy hailed it as one of the most important Hindi works to have appeared in print and commended the translation for its elegance and exactitude (HLHH I: 499-500). When, over forty years later, Naval Kishore embarked on the awesome task of reissuing Mahā bhāratdarpan he did so at the instance, and with the financial assistance, of Raja Madhav Singh of Amethi, a prominent patron of Hindu culture among the Avadh ta'alluqdārs.80 Apparently, by that time, copies of the Calcutta edition had become so rare that they could not be procured

even if one was willing to spend fifty rupees'. The new edition, thoroughly revised by the NKP's head pandits Pyarelal and Ramratan Vajpeyi, was ready in 1874. With over 6000 pages in four volumes, it was a monumental scholarly achievement. Each volume was supplemented by an elaborate index, permitting a more systematic use by readers. Reasonably priced at Rs 12, the edition was a runaway success and was swiftly sold out ("grāhakom ne hāthom hūth livã, as the more graphic Hindi has it). The British publication report acknowledged it as the most important event in Hindi publishing during the year 1874.81 Second and third editions followed in 1883 and 1891. Observing the swift sale of the Mahābhārat darpan, in 1881 Naval Kishore invested in another well known but hitherto unprinted Brajbhasha adaptation of the epic, composed in doha and caupāi verses by Sabalsingh Chauhan towards the end of the seventeenth century. For reasons not known, this edition remained incomplete. 
The great success of the Brajbhasha Mahābhāratdarpan encouraged Naval Kishore to engage in another herculean venture, the translation of the Mahābhārata into modern Khari Boli prose. By the 1880s the time was certainly ripe for such a project. Indeed, he was not the first to popularize the great Hindu epic in Hindi. Previous efforts highlight the increased use and acceptance of Hindi prose in the context of epic and religious literature: in 1872 the Agra publisher Jvala Parshad Bhargava had launched two monthly series consisting of portions of the epic, with a Hindi and Urdu translation, respectively. The Urdu series, Makhzan e Mahābhārat, was priced at Rs I per monthly copy; the Hindi version, Saddharmāmrt vārșiņi, was slightly cheaper at 8 as. Each enjoyed a circulation of 250 copies. In 1875 the first comprehensive Hindi prose Mahābhārat, by Krishna Chandra Dharmadhikari of Benares, had been issued in a three-volume edition from Calcutta. The existence of this widely publicized work, which even appeared in Trübner's Oriental Cata logue, raises the question of why Naval Kishore thought it expedient to invest in his own Hindi Mahābhārat in 1886. Was Krishna Chandra's translation out of print? Was it too expensive or was its style too difficult? The NKP's own translation was composed in 'pure' Hindi, sanitized of any vocabulary of Arabic or Persian origin. At the same time, the language was kept fluent, avoiding heavy Sanskritization and excessive ornation.82 Begun by Pandit Kunjbihari Lal and completed by his uncle Pandit Kalicaran, it constituted an unprecedented effort on both the translators'

and the publisher's part, involving the collective labour of the NKP's Hindu scholar-translators.83 A team of more than eight pandits was cons tantly engaged in proofreading. If the prose Mahābhārat was a major event in early Hindi publishing, the financial risk involved in the publi cation was considerable. The four-volume edition comprised an un precedented 7284 pages. To make it affordable for the general readership, the volumes were further divided into individually sold parts cor responding to the eighteen books (purvvas) of the epic. Moreover, Naval Kishore, with his customary caution, limited the first edition to 600 copies. In order to prevent piracy, he also took care to have the copyright regis tered. 
Before continuing this account, some remarks on the Hindu scholars associated with the NKP's Department of Composition and Translation seem in order. Not surprisingly, their identities and range of activities are less well recorded than those of their Muslim counterparts. While the number of pandits on the publisher's permanent staff was compar atively small, Naval Kishore had recourse to a wide circle of scholars in Lucknow and beyond who regularly assisted the NKP in its Sanskrit editions and translations. These external translators of Brahmin or Kayastha background were mostly employed in the educational sector, constituting a further link between the publishing house and the colonial administration. Like Naval Kishore himself, many of his Hindu scholar translators exemplified the composite culture of the upper Gangetic region—firmly rooted in their own Hindu culture, they used Urdu for their social communication and were conversant with the Persian literary tradition. Their linguistic versatility made them a special asset to the publishing house. 
The firm's head pandit, Pyarelal Ruggu, son of Bhavani Prasad Sharma Suri, is a case in point. Born in a Kashmiri Pandit family of Lucknow, Pyarelal was well-versed in Persian, Sanskrit, Hindi, and Urdu. Upon joining the NKP in the early 1870s, he became involved in a great variety of editing and translation projects, some of which have already been noted. He deserves special credit for preparing the first modern Hindi translation of Yogavāsiştha (*1877), a famous soteriological text of disputed date in which Vedanta philosophy found a popular exposition. Traditionally attributed to Valmiki, Yogavāsistha had in the course of its

history been accepted as a standard canonical text of Hindu scholarship and continued to be of central importance to the living traditions of monis tic advaita. It was transmitted in various recensions and had seen several translations into Persian during the Mughal period.84 Yet by the 1870s there existed no Hinditranslation of the text but for an eighteenth-century version in archaic language by Ram Prasad Niranjani, a priest attached to the Patiala court. Pyarelal revised the text and purged it of its Panjabi element, making it suitable for contemporary Hindi readers.85 The mod ernized version became so popular that in 1890 it was supplemented by an Urdu translation, Tarjuma-e Jogbāsisht. Pandit Pyarelal also contributed to the firm's Purāna series with an Urdu prose rendering of Devībhāgavata (*1874) and a Sivapurāna (*1886) in Hindi. His various translations from Urdu into Hindi and vice versa will be examined in Chapter 7. 
Perhaps the most prolific among the NKP's external Sanskrit trans lators was Pandit Kalicaran Sharma, mentioned above as the translator of the Hindi prose Mahābhārat, Kumārasambhava, and Siśupālabadha. Kalicaran, a Gaur Brahmin from Pipalmandi near Agra, was a Sanskrit teacher at the Lucknow Canning College.S0 He further contributed a Hindi version of Bhāva Prakās (*1894), a famous medical encyclopaedia, and was also engaged in preparing modern Hindi versions of Brajbhasha texts. 
The reprint of Mahābhāratdarpan and the ensuing Hindi prose Mahā bhārat were not the only large projects started by Naval Kishore in the mid-1870s. Inspired by the success of Sukhsāgar, which had quickly become one of the NKP's best-selling Hindi titles, in 1875 he set out to produce an entire series of Hindi Purānas. Though frequently condemned by European Orientalists and vehemently rejected by eminent Hindu reformers—above all by the Arya Samaj leader Svami Dayanand Saras vati—the popular appeal of the Purūnas was unabated.87 As is well known,

85 Issued from Bombay in 1865, Ram Prasad's early version showed appreciable Panjabi admixture and some marginal Brajbhāṣā features' (McGregor 1984: 214). Another Hindi translation in Urdu script by Shyam Lal was printed at Kanpur in 1868. The British report deemed it unintelligible to persons who are acquainted with the Court Urdu only (PGNWP. General Dept., March 1869: 3). 
86 Pandit Kalicaran is most probably not identical with his namesake, the translator of the Hindi Dāstān-e Amir Hamzā. 
87 See his attack on the Bhāgavata Purāņa in his early pamphlet Bhāgavata khandan (Refutation of the Bhāgavata, 1866) and his wholesale condemnation of the Purānas in his principal opus Satyārthaprakāśa.

Lalluji's Premsāgar, a Hindi version of the celebrated tenth chapter of the Bhāgavata Purāņa, was one of the most widely consumed Hindi texts in the nineteenth century.88 Naval Kishore would hardly have in vested in an entire series of Purānas in translation had there not been a demand by the market. The scheme seemed especially promising since several Purāṇas had not been translated before. That Naval Kishore ex pected swift sales is suggested by the fact that the first title in the series, an abridged translation of the Devībhāgavata (*1876), was issued in a high print run of 1300 copies. The choice of the Devibhāgavata (Fig. 10) is an interesting one, for its status among the major Purānas was contested and had formed the subject of a prolonged controversy among pandits in the 1840s (Bayly 1996a: 241).What prompted Naval Kishore to inaugurate his Purāna series with this controversial text? Perhaps it was simply the fact that he was in possession of a rare Sanskrit manuscript of the text, including a commentary by Nilkanth Shashtri. It had been presented to him by Raja Madhav Singh of Amethi, who had already sponsored the publication of the Sanskrit original in 1870. 
The Hindi Devibhāgavata was prepared by Pandit Maheshdatt Shukla, one of the firm's regular external translators. Shukla, who is also known as the author of a Hindi poetical anthology entitled Kävyasargrah(*1874), belonged to Dhanauli in Barabanki district and worked as a teacher at the Ayodhya Sanskrit pāțhśālā. Next to several titles of the Purāna series, he translated Amarsingh's classic vocabulary of Sanskrit nouns Amarakośa (*1875) for the press. His most voluminous contribution, however, remains his Hindi rendering of the Valmiki Rāmāyana, issued in seven volumes in 1882–3. The second scholar involved in the Purāna project was Pandit Durgaprasad Sharma, a Kashmiri Brahmin whose father had been chief astrologer to the Maharaja of Kashmir and who was himself attached to the court of Maharaja Ram Singh of Jaipur. This circumstance and the fact that the Hindi Devībhāgavata was dedicated to the maharaja, strongly suggest Ram Singh's patronage of the Purāņa series. 
Published between 1876 and 1884, the NKP Purāna series came to include Hindi versions of the Bhavisya-, Devibhāgavata-, Garuda, Linga-, Skanda-, Varāha-, and Visnupurāņa. It constituted a major step towards the popularization of Puranic literature in Hindi, while also visibly reflecting the new status accorded to Hindi as the cultural link language of Hindu India: on some of the title pages, Hindi was for the first time

denoted as 'ārya bhāsā', echoing the new cultural consciousness propagated by the Arya Samaj and Hindu revivalism.89 In his preface to Lingapurāna, Durgaprasad underscored the necessity of translating the

Purāņas into Hindi. His statement provides a characteristic example of how Hindi was now taken to perform an essential role in upholding Hindu dharma and fostering Hindu culture: 
In the present time the Aryans generally are no longer familiar with Sanskrit. Hence, they cannot study the Purūnas, etc., and do not know the varṇāśrama dharma. When the knowledge of dharma is wanting, how can there be righteous conduct? Without righteous conduct they have become devoid of longevity, intelligence, strength, majesty, energy, knowledge, wealth, vigour, offspring, fame, etc., and are becoming more so by the day. Seeing his fel low Aryans in this pitiable condition, and knowing that wise and righteous conduct is the root of the attainment of all objects of human existence, and that a thorough study of the Purānas, epics, etc., is the root of knowing dharma, but also realizing that the Aryans are generally unfamiliar with Sanskrit, the wise and knowledgeable eminent well-wisher of Bhāratvars, who is intent on the prosperity of the Aryans, the very capable ornament of the Dhusar caste, the honourable Munshi Naval Kishore, editor of Avadh Akhbār, has expressed his desire that all Purānas be translated into ārya bhāṣā, so that all Aryans can easily understand their meaning and by realizing the essential nature of true dharma abstain from bad conduct and engage in virtuous actions. With this purpose in mind the Munshi Sahib has res pectfully entrusted us with the task. 90 
Predictably, and at the same time ironically, neither the invocation of puranic texts as sources of 'true Arya dharma' nor the Hindu nationalist rhetoric and reference to Hindi as 'ārya bhāṣā' sufficed to prevent the Arya Samaj from taking objection to the NKP's Purāna series. In what seems a poignant reflection of the lasting popularity of the series, as late as 1899 the leading Arya Samaj journal Saddharm Pracārak deemed it necessary to publicly denounce it as obscene and especially endangering the virtue of female readers. 'If ... the Hindus wish to see members of their society tread the path of virtue and morality, they should lose no time in discarding these books', the Saddharm Pracārak warned. Otherwise, the day is not distant, when under the pernocious teachings of the Puranas the little morality the Hindu females now possess will vanish.91 
The great success of the Purāņa series encouraged Naval Kishore to engage in another ambitious venture and launch a series of Upanişads

327 
with Hindi translation. Unlike the Purānas, the status of the Upanişads as essential and authoritative texts of Hinduism was largely uncontested. Earlier on, Devendranath Tagore had called on his compatriots to turn away from the Purūnas 'which were all divisive, toward the Vedas, i.e. the upanişads, in order again to unite all Hindus into one religion (Rocher 1986: 9). For the Upanişad series Naval Kishore reverted to an extant collection of texts prepared by Pandit Yamunashankar Pancoli, a Nagar Brahmin from Kolakhya and author of various philosophical works. 92 This collection included Hindi versions of the Aitareya-, Atharvave diya-, Chāndogya-. Isa-, Kahvalli-, Kena-, Māndakya-, Mundaka- and Prasna-upanişad. The titles were thoroughly revised by the NKP's pandits and reissued in the early 1880s, each containing the Sanskrit original along with Yamunashankar's Hindi paraphrase in 'simple national langu age' ("saral desbhāsā). 
The insistence on 'saral desbhāṣā is significant. In a deliberate depar ture from the linguistic agenda of Hindu revivalism and nationalism, most NKP translations eschewed the highly Sanskritized style of Khari Boli favoured by many proponents of the Hindi movement. NKP texts neither tried to emulate the model translations of Kalidasa by Raja Lakshman Singh, a chief advocate of Sanskritized pure ("suddh') Hindi, nor discarded the Sanskrit element altogether in favour of an overly Persianized style.” Instead, they opted for a middle ground. The chief imperative was to produce modern-language versions in an idiom that would appeal to a broad spectrum of contemporary readers by being at once easily intelligible and aesthetically pleasing. References to the language being 'simple' (saral) were as much a recurring feature on NKP title pages as was the claim to the translations being beneficial to all' (sarvopakārak). The propagation of the classical Hindu heritage and the greatness of the Sanskrit literary tradition notwithstanding, at the level of language the Lucknow publishing house maintained its own distinct policy. 
By and large, NKP translations of Sanskrit religious classics fulfilled both the linguistic and material criteria for a truly 'popular' kind of religious literature, composed in an idiom that could be understood by the common people, and circulated in large and inexpensive editions. At

a time of vigorous efforts to revive, reform, and nationalize the Hindu religion, they assumed an important function in the democratization of religious knowledge (Dalmia 1997: 225). 
Besides religious texts, Naval Kishore published a series of standard Hindu works on sacred law and ethics, which assumed significance in the ongoing discussion revolving around the reformulation of Hindu dharma. At the publisher's behest, Pandit Durgaprasad prepared a Hindi translation of Mitākṣarā, a celebrated twelfth-century commentary on Yājñavalkya smrti by Vijnaneshvara. First translated into English by T.B. Colebrooke in 1810, Mitākṣarā had been used as a textbook on Hindu inheritance law in NWP schools and colleges since the 1840s.94 The Hindi translation, which was sponsored by Maharaja Sajjansingh of Udaipur, took fifteen years and finally came out in 1888 (Dalmia 1997: 355). In the 1880s Naval Kishore also acquired exclusive copyright of Mānavdharmsār (Essence of Manu's laws), a popular abridged Hindi version of the Manu smrti by Raja Shiva Prasad. Following its first edition from the Benares Medical Hall Press in 1857, Mānavdharmsār had been adopted as a textbook and variously reprinted. It did not remain confined to school use for long, but was widely consumed and came to serve the need of new dharma sabhās in presenting basic tenets of Hindu dharma in an easily intelligible fashion. This usage was well in keeping with the author's intentions. 'It is a matter of regret that our country men, though called Hindus, know not their own Institutes of Manu. So that all they do is contrary to them', wrote Shiva Prasad, bemoaning the decline of righteous conduct among his Hindu compatriots. His express purpose in supplying a Hindi version of Manu smrti was not simply to make the text generally accessible to those with little knowledge of Sanskrit, but to enlighten his countrymen on its contemporary relevance, 'So that it become apparent to them what the original dharma of the Hindus is. And the nature of the actions of those who now call themselves Hindus.'95 
Yet Hindi was not the only language used in popularizing classic Hindu texts among contemporary readers. With an estimated total of 124 titles (Siddiqi 1981:16), translations and renderings into Urdu formed an equally important aspect of the NKP's promotion of the Sanskrit legacy. Sanskrit-Urdu translations basically extended to the same textual

categories as outlined above, that is the epics and Purānas, works of Hindu dharma and ethics, ritual and prayer books. Only a few Urdu renderings--the Bhagavad Gitā by Shyamsundarlal (*1881), the Valmiki Rāmāyana by Parameshvar Dayal (*1884),% and Lālcandrikā (*1886), a translation of Chanakya's Nitisāstra by Lal Singh-appear to have been direct translations from the Sanskrit. Most works were translations or transliterations into Persian characters, prepared from extant Brajbhasha or Hindi versions, which in the process underwent a certain amount of linguistic modification.97 
Naval Kishore was the first to widely promote the Purānas in Urdu. Like the Hindi series, the NKP's Urdu Purānas enjoyed widespread popularity among Urdu-speaking Hindus, one of their most prominent readers being the young Munshi Premchand (Amrit Rai 1991: 18). To what extent educated Hindus relied on Urdu even in a Sanskritic literary context is exemplified by the first Urdu Purāna to appear on the NKP list in 1871, a translation of the Sivapurāņa by Shivsingh Sengar. To Sengar, better known as the author of the famous Hindi anthology Sivsimh saroj (see Chapter 7), it was nothing out of the ordinary to translate the text into both Urdu and Hindi. At the time, Naval Kishore only published the Urdu version (it was retranslated into Hindi much later).98 
Not surprisingly, the successful format of the bilingual edition was adopted for Sanskrit-Urdu, too. Texts widely used in Hindu ritual practice such as Mahimnastotra (*1879), a famous panegyric hymn to Shiva, and Vratārk (*1877), a seventeenth-century treatise on votive rites by Shankar Bhatt, were published in dual-language editions. 99 In addition, the firm offered as a special feature trilingual editions, which next to the original Sanskrit text included translations or commentaries in both Hindi and Urdu.

97 For other genres see, for instance, Sakuntalā nātak, trs, from a Hindi version into Urdu by Kazim Ali Jawan (*1875). 
98 The genesis of Sengar's translation of the Sivapurāna is also of some interest in that it throws light on the difficulties experienced by author-translators in locating manuscript copies. For ten long years, Sengar had tried in vain to get hold of a complete copy (koi pūrī pustak') of the text and had ended up with a collection of ten different manuscripts, none of which appeared suited for translation. It was only in 1869 that he acquired a decent manuscript from a Hindu scholar of Rai Bareli who, in turn, had procured the text from South India. 
99 The Urdu Vratārk, a transliteration of a simultaneously issued Hindi version, was prepared by the NKP translator Pandit Maheshdatt Tripathi, a Brahman from Nandapur (Sultanpur district).

Underlying such publications were pragmatic and economic considerations; to have one text for Nagari and Urdu readers was the cheapest solution for the publisher. Arguably, the texts were also meant to acquaint Urdu readers with the increasingly important Nagari script-how else should one interpret the fact that the text portion was preceded by a table showing the Hindi and Urdu alphabets? Four more works were edited in similar fashion: the two most revered scrip tures on sacred Hindu law, Manu smrti (*1871) and Yājñavalkya smrti (*1880), Mārkandeyapurāņa saţik (* 1884), and Mithilāmāhātmya satik (*1884).100 The polyglot formula certainly worked well: by 1889 the trilingual Manu smrti had gone through five editions. 
As will be shown later, another form of popularizing the Sanskrit heritage through the medium of Urdu was to promote contemporary Hindu poets of Urdu, who produced a great number of verse renderings of the epics, Purānas and other religious classics. Among NKP staff members, the translator and later biographer of Naval Kishore, Lala Lalji Munshi-a Kayastha belonging to Kakori-provided a series of Urdu works on Hindu religious themes, including a collection of puranic tales, Majmū'ah-e şifāt-e insāni (*1874), an Urdu Gayā māhātmya (*1876), and a translation of Bhāminivilās, a seventeenth-century col lection of allegorical and erotic verse by Jagannath, entitled Zakhirah-e saʻādat (*1875). 
To understand both the pragmatic and ideological implications of this body of Sanskrit texts in Urdu, one has to bear in mind that, during the period under review, an influential section of educated North Indian Hindus, notably Kayasthas, Kashmiri Brahmins and Khatris, were not familiar with the Nagari script, nor felt any strong religio-cultural affili ation with it. Tol The NKP continued to cater to this substantial clientele throughout the nineteenth century. However, against the backdrop of the Hindi-Urdu controversy, the firm's sustained engagement in promoting Sanskrit classics in Urdu cannot merely be viewed in commercial terms, but also has wider significance. One of the most far-reaching consequen ces of the debate over Hindi and Urdu was the dichotomization of the 
100 The transliteration of the Yājñavalkya smrti was based on an earlier Hindi translation (Lahore: Mitra Vilas Press 1871) by Pandit Guruprasad of Lahore University College. 
101 As King has pointed out, the Hindu community was divided in another respect, too, i.e. the competition between Nagari and Kaithi, a variant script used by a number of Hindu business and trading castes (King 1994: 65-75).

two languages and scripts by way of an exclusive ideological identifi cation with Hindu and Muslim culture, respectively. 102 The NKP's pro motion of Sanskrit works in Urdu was, in part, an attempt to counteract this process. Needless to say, the circulation of Hindu religious texts in Urdu or Urdu-script versions had a long tradition and was nothing out of the ordinary in the 1860s and 1870s, when the language controversy first gained momentum. However, the fact that the NKP continued to assidu ously produce such titles well into the 1890s implied a clear statement against the essentializing equation of language with religious community. While the firm's policy with regard to Hindi and Urdu will be discussed in Chapter 7, it should be pointed out here that the Lucknow publishing house put a clear emphasis on assimilation rather than differentiation. Underlying its policy was the desire to perpetuate the shared and composite culture that had shaped North Indian intellectual traditions for centuries. 
In this context, one of Naval Kishore's cherished projects assumes distinct significance, notably his efforts in recovering some of the cele brated translations and adaptations of Sanskrit classics into Persian that had been prepared during the Mughal period. Some of these works had never been consigned to print. In 1863 Naval Kishore issued a famous Persian verse translation of the Bhagavad Gitā, composed at the behest of the Mughal emperor Akbar by his Poet Laureate Abu'l Faiz Faizi. Two verse renderings of the Bhāgavata Purāna and the Valmiki Rāmāyana by Amanat Rai Dehlavi, entitled Bhāgavat manzām fārsi (*1868) and Rāmāyan manzām farsi (-1872), followed. Next, the publisher edited Nargistān(*1875), a Persian verse translation of the Rāmāyan composed under Aurangzeb by Chandarman ‘Bedil', and the Rāmāyan-e Amarpar kāsh(*1877) by Amarsingh. Both works were for the first time circulated in print.103 The Persian version of the Sanskrit allegorical drama Prabo dhcandrodaya by Banvali, a poet in Dara Shikoh's service, came out in 1877. The series was completed by a four-volume collection entitled Majmū'ah-e Vedānt sār (Collection of the Essence of Vedanta, *1877), which assembled abridged Persian renderings of the Yogavāsiştha, Bhagavad Gitā and Bhāgavata Purāņa. In the heated atmosphere of the late 1860s and 1870s, to rescue these textual witnesses to a great tradition of cross-cultural and interreligious dialogue from oblivion was to make a powerful cultural statement. 
102 This process of differentiation has received much scholarly attention. See, e.g., Amrit Rai 1884; King 1994; Dalmia 1997.

5.6 Selective Encounters with the West: 
Translating English Works The colonial encounter and the growing prestige of English education had generated an interest in Western thought and knowledge among educated Indians, which led to an intense translation activity. By the mid-nineteenth century, the task of disseminating Western knowledge through Indian languages was no longer left to missionary and colonial agency or to eminent educational institutions alone. Indian learned asso ciations, private scholars, and commercial publishers increasingly en gaged in the translation of English works. In the commercial market, the rapidly rising popularity of works of Western fiction made their translation a viable proposition for publishers. 
Whether undertaken under colonial aegis or as independent projects by members of the new bilingual elites, translation in the colonial context was rarely a simple linguistic transfer. In cutting across cultural divides, it was invested with ideological and political meaning. 104 As cultural translation, it was a creative process that implied selection, assimila tion, or rejection at every stage of the venture. Translation, therefore, constituted a “transaction' in the sense proposed by Harish Trivedi and others with respect to the cultural encounter at large. The literary and cultural exchange between India and the West was not a unidirectional imposition of dominance. Rather, it was an 'interactive, dialogic, two way process ... involving complex negotiation and exchange (Trivedi 1993: 1). 
In looking at NKP translations of Western works, it is important to distinguish between two categories of texts: those that were government commissions, hence a by-product of the firm's collaboration with the colonial administration, and those that originated in an independent decision on the publisher's, patron's, or translator's part, each coming with its own specific intentions. In the first category we find translations of official documents or government reports pertaining to the legal, reve nue, or administrative sector, which were considered of particular rele vance to the Indian audience. The Report on the Trade and Products of the North-Western Provinces by Sir Robert H. Davies, of which Naval 
104 Naregal discusses colonial translation as a hegemonic project 'endemic to the construction of colonial discourse', which, while pretending that the English and vernacular publics could be endowed with 'symmetrical expressive and cognitive repertoires', actually placed Indian languages in a relation of subordination vis-à-vis English (Naregal 2001: 102-4).

Kishore issued an Urdu version in 1871, is a typical example. 105 Of greater interest—because reflecting a deliberate selection on the publisher's part—is the second category. Here, translations of historio graphical and political works assumed prominence. As outlined in Chapter 2, Naval Kishore patronized several learned societies devoted to the promotion of Western knowledge in the modern Indian languages. His association with the Aligarh Scientific Society, in particular, may have provided the initial impetus for him to produce his own translations of English works. The Society aimed to render 'those works on arts and sciences, which being in English or other European languages are not intelligible to the Natives' into Indian languages; from the outset it focused on historiographical writing, 106 Rollin's Ancient History of Egypt, his Ancient History of Greece, and Elphinstone's History of India were among the first texts to be taken up for translation (Muhammad 1978 [1]: 147– 8). On at least one occasion, notably the publication of the Urdu translation of the Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (1835), the Society enlisted Naval Kishore's services as a printer. The book was issued in 1871 as Sargu zasht Napoliyan Bonāpārt shahanshāh-e farāns. The Education Depart ment bought one hundred copies for distribution as a prize book and rewarded its translator Muhammad Mushtaq Husain with Rs 100.107 
If Naval Kishore was inspired by the Scientific Society's work, he was not to be outdone by it. Before long he was able to boast his own collection of Western works in Urdu translation. Though small in number, it included some important titles. By far the most consequential was the first Urdu translation of James Tod's influential Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan (Fig. 11). The project was initiated in 1871 on the suggestion of Nawab Muhammad Mardan Ali Khan 'Ra'na', a longstanding asso ciate of Naval Kishore who had risen to the position of chief minister in the princely state of Marwar. Since its first publication in 1829–32, Tod's Rajasthan had been widely acclaimed in colonial India, where it had a marked impact on both British and indigenous public debate. With its glorification of Rajput valour and Romantic pan-Indian nationalism' (Peabody 1996), it became a key text in the process of national identity formation and was eagerly appropriated by the Indian nationalist move ment. The quasi-canonical status it enjoyed among Indians is borne out by the name it was generally referred to: 'Tadnāma'. Tod's Rajasthan inspired several Bengali novelists and was the first book to receive a

raving review in Harischandra's Magazine in 1873.108 It was also of specific importance to Hindi literary history, for the author's glorification of the epic poet Chand marked a decisive step in the construction of an early canon for Hindi (Dalmia 1997: 194). 
To provide the first translation of Tod in an Indian language was therefore a significant undertaking. In order to ensure a high-quality translation, Naval Kishore commissioned two veteran translators: the preparation of the first volume was assigned to Pandit Ajodhya Parshad, the translator of Davies's Trade Report and other works. The second volume was prepared by Pandit Kanhaiyalal, the estate manager of Raja Madhav Singh of Amethi, and former translator in the Chief Commis sioner's Office. Naval Kishore was well acquainted with Kanhaiyalal's skills, having acquired the copyright of two of his earlier translations, notably Tārikh-e baghāvar-e Hind (*1861), an account of the 1857 uprising compiled from English sources, and Ahd nāmajāt va iqrār nāmajāt (*1866), a voluminous collection of treaties concluded by the East India Company and the British Government with different Indian states and principalities. Kanhaiyalal also figured on the NKP list as an Urdu poet in his own right. He wrote under the pen name 'Ashiq' and has a Dīvān e Ashiq (*1877) and a local history called Tārīkh-e rāj-e riyāsat-e garh Amethi (*1882) to his credit. 
Completed in 1877, the Urdu Tarikh-e Rājistān comprised almost 2000 pages, including maps and illustrations. It was issued in a two volume deluxe edition on high-quality glossy white paper. Heavily priced at Rs 50, it clearly targeted the Indian gentry and nobility. There seems to have been no dearth of advance subscriptions. Having examined the translation, and finding it accurate and idiomatic', DPI Kempson noted: “The enterprize of the great publisher of Upper India, and his judgement in the selection of this work are commendable. I understand that the Native Chiefs of western India are much interested in the issue of this publication.'109 The joint dedication to Maharana Sajjansingh of Udaipur

109 RPIR 1877: 113. Much later, Dvarkaparshad 'Ufuq' Lakhnavi (1864-1913), a poet and prose writer of Urdu and Persian associated with the NKP, prepared another Urdu translation of Tod, published in twelve volumes as Țād Rājistān from Lahore in 1909. Ufuq belonged to a learned Kayastha family of Lucknow. His elder brother, Ramsaha'e 'Tamanna' (1854–1932), was a prolific poet and local historian. His younger brother, Mataparshad 'Nizam', also worked for the NKP. Ufuq himself joined the press in the 1880s as an assistant editor of Avadh Akhbar. In 1888 he336

and Charles Herbert, the Political Agent of Mewar, suggests the patronage of these two influential figures. Naval Kishore also took a personal interest in the translation. As he explained in his editorial preface, his maternal grandfather Rai Bindravan had served as head clerk (mir munshi) to James Tod. The release of the translation was nicely stage-managed and implied a symbolic tribute to colonial rule: the book was launched on 1 January 1877, the day that Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India at the first Imperial Durbar in Delhi. 
A second translation of immediate political relevance followed in the mid-1880s, when Naval Kishore decided to bring out Donald Mackenzie Wallace's highly successful Russia (1877) in Urdu. With memories of the Turko-Russian war still fresh, and Russian expansionism continuing to pose a threat on the north-western borders of the Indian empire, he anticipated a wide Indian interest in a book whose author, moreover, oc cupied the high position of Private Secretary to the Viceroy and Governor General of India.110 In his long preface (in English), Naval Kishore eulogized Wallace's first-hand account as a work of great authenticity, written by an author who possessed 'a personal knowledge of the sub ject... having lived as he did among all classes of the Russian community low as well as high'. The book was recommended to all those 'desirous of knowing what Russia and the Russians are like: ... for no other book will give an equally true insight into the administration of the Empire, the social condition of the people, and the iron hand with which the Muscovite Government rules the country.'11 Involved in the Urdu translation were two prominent contemporaries, one Indian, the other British: the main translator was Pandit Ratan Nath Dar 'Sarshar', the famous Urdu prose writer and former editor of Avadh Akhbar, whose long-standing asso ciation with the NKP will be examined in more detail in the next chapter. For the proofreading of Sarshar's translation Naval Kishore enlisted the British scholar and Member of the Royal Asiatic Society William Hoey, stationed in Lucknow as city magistrate and license tax officer. To rely on an Englishman, however learned, to go over the work of one of the foremost prose writers in Urdu was not exactly a wise choice. Indeed, 
launched his own Urdu paper, Nazm Akhbār, but returned to the NKP in 1895 as a translator and editor. Next to works of Western fiction, he translated R.F. Burton's English Aliflaila into Urdu. The translation, however, remained unpublished (Nurani 1995: 141). 
To For this perceived threat, see e.g. the contemporary pamphlet by Charles Marvin, Russia's Power of Attacking India (London 1885).

Hoey committed several linguistic blunders in correcting Sarshar's Urdu (Saksena 1941: 47-8). Tarikh-e Rūsiya was completed in 1887. It was sold to the nobility and gentry at Rs 50 a copy and to the general public at Rs 10.112 Wallace gratefully acknowledged the book's release in a letter to the publisher, expressing his hope that '[it] may be a success and that I may have the pleasure of seeing my child dressed not only in Urdu costume but also in that of other vernacular languages.'113 It would seem that official patronage was at work in granting his wish—within two years the NKP Tārikh-e Rusiva was followed by versions in Bengali, Hindi, Panjabi, and Persian.114 
The market response to translations of English works was not always as enthusiastic as in the case of the above-named titles, especially if the works selected for translation were more suited to ingratiate Naval Kishore with the colonial authorities than cater for the interests of Indian readers. This is borne out by a series of works-in-translation commemo rating the life of senior officials of the Indian Empire. Again, it is difficult to determine whether these publications were initiated and financed by the publisher, individual patrons, or the government. Some projects, such as the Urdu translation of R. Bosworth Smith's Life of Lord Lawrence (*1886), were joint ventures. Sponsored by Naval Kishore at the sugges tion of A.J. Lawrence, the late John Lawrence's nephew, the translation was done by the NKP translator Sayyid Zavvar Husain and revised by Raja Shiva Prasad.115 It was dedicated to the Viceroy and Governor General Lord Dufferin. The translation illustrates the considerable finan cial risk incurred by the publisher in producing such titles, for it involved a large expenditure of Rs 3000 for copyright fees payable to its British author. A subscription notice was published in Avadh Akhbār invit ing the Indian nobility to sponsor the publication with subscriptions of Rs 100 each. Foremost among those who responded was the Maharaja of Kashmir, who alone subscribed to ten copies.116 Moreover, Naval Kishore personally went on a 'promotion tour of the Punjab to ensure the patronage of Punjabi notables. He carried two letters of introduction

written by A.J. Lawrence, who warmly recommended the project to the addressees, one an unnamed maharajah, the other a senior government official at Lahore, urging them to assist the publisher in introducing the translation to the Punjab nobility and gentry'. 117 Yet Naval Kishore had obviously misjudged the book's appeal. In his preface to the edition, A.J. Lawrence noted: 
As yet there has been little or no response to the advertisements of the more elaborate addition (sic) of the Life. The Munshi must therefore look to the masses for that support, which the classes have failed to afford him. But book buying is not an Indian custom. The non-existence of books worth buying, the general poverty, and the habits of the richer classes account for this. The Munshi is however actuated more by the desire of making known to his countrymen what manner of man the late John Lawrence was than by the hope of gain. His wellwishers, and those who think that his efforts de serve encouragement will join me in hoping that he may not fail of material reward. 
The alleged lack of interest on the publisher's part should not be taken at face value, for the tepid public response must have been compensated by the government patronage that such publications were bound to attract. Even if he did not recoup his investment on this occasion, Naval Kishore was far from being discouraged and had the Life of Lord Lawrence follow ed by more translations in the same vein. In 1887 he launched Kalām al malūk malūk al-kalām, a collection of the speeches of Sir Alfred C. Lyall, Lieutenant Governor of the NWP and Chief Commissioner of Avadh. Compiled to commemorate the distinguished services rendered to the country by his Honor', the volume paid overt homage to British rule. The same purpose was served by the publication in 1888 of Maktūbāt e Lard Dafrin and Savānih-e "umr-e Lärd Dafrin, being a translation of the Letters from High Latitudes (1857), and a biography of the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava, Viceroy of India from 1884 to 1888. The first work was translated by Pandit Ratan Nath Sarshar, the second by Maulana Abul Hasan Faridabadi. Naval Kishore himself wrote a laudatory preface to the biography, in which he asserted that 'Lord Dufferin's administration of India can only be revieved in panegyric', for the great hopes that were entertained of Lord Dufferin's rule in India have been more than realized.' The series was rounded off by Kārnāma-e Colvin (*1893), a brief account of the administration and selection of the speeches of

Sir Auckland Colvin, Lieutenant Governor of the NWP&Oudh from 1887 to 1892. From a commercial point of view, such publications were almost certainly unprofitable. While targeting a select elite of the politi cally minded or those actively involved in colonial politics and adminis tration, they held no attraction for the general readership-indeed, none of them saw a second edition. 
From the 1880s the range of titles selected for translation expanded slowly, suggesting a more diversified interest in European thought on the part of the readership. In 1881 Naval Kishore invested in a translation of John P. Brown's The Dervishes, or Oriental Spiritualism (1868), a pioneering study on Sufi orders published by Trübner & Co., from whom he obtained the copyright. The translation, entitled Kashshāf-e asrār al mashā'ikh (Revelations of the Secrets of the Dervishes, *1881), supple mented the great number of works on Sufism and the Sufi literary tradition in India that Naval Kishore had seen into print over the years. 118 Several years later, he took up John Stuart Mill's classic Principles of Political Economy (1848) for translation. From the outset, Mill's work had been accorded considerable importance in colonial society. A first attempt to translate Mill into Urdu had been made by Wazir Ali for the Vernacular Translation Society of Delhi College in the 1850s. 119 It was not well re ceived, with a member of the British evaluation committee judging it'a wretched piece of Oordoo'. 120 Next, it was Sayyid Ahmad Khan who emphasized the need for the Indian public to become acquainted with the science of political economy and urged that Mill's Political Economy be among the first texts to be translated by the Scientific Society. He was dissuaded by British members of the society's directing council, who judged the work too voluminous, too complicated, and generally unsuited for an Indian audience (Muhammad 1978.1: 16-22). While the society settled for N.W. Sender's Political Economy, the task of publicizing Mill in Urdu fell to the NKP. Mu'allim al-siyāsat (Instructor of Govern ance) was completed in 1890. Addressing an elite audience of the educated and politically conscious, Mill's translator Maulana Abul Hasan Faridabadi reiterated Sayyid Ahmad Khan's arguments regarding the importance of the text in his preface. In a typical articulation of indigenous concern, he argued that the availability of modern scientific knowledge in Indian languages was a basic prerequisite for national progress:

I am helpless with regard to those gentlemen among our respected readers who apart from poetry, romances, etc. or religious writings do not take an interest in any other sort of subject. But usually those gentlemen who have a habit of reading newspapers and are fond of reading books, who understand or try to understand the mood of our times and who want to be conversant with the social and political situation, that is with the social structure and political organization of the gifted, spirited and mighty nation on whom the Almighty has bestowed the reins of power over the Indian Empire, will find this treatise extremely interesting and profitable. And, to tell the truth, in the present time this book is really a boon, because from casting a discri minating look at its contents it will become apparent what the political ideas and opinions of our Indian patriots and well-wishers of the country are, and to what extent they are applicable. Apart from this, it is also imperative that the translation of such a rare book in this extraordinary science be included in our language. Because it is due to the want of such scientific books that our language is not counted among the world's important scientific langu ages: as long as there are no modern sciences in our mother tongue how can the sciences in our country progress?l21 
The 1880s also saw the first translations of Western fictional literature, even though it was not before the close of the century that the NKP would respond to the rapidly growing demand for entertaining fiction on a larger scale. Perhaps the earliest title of European fiction on its list was Ekrūsī zāmīndār ki qissā (Story of a Russian Landlord, *1880), translated from an English version of the French novel by Henry Greville.122 The

Not surprisingly, the first translations of English literature appearing on the NKP list related to the plays of William Shakespeare, the most admired and frequently translated of English authors. 124 In 1890 Naval

Kishore commissioned Maulvi Muhammad Ahsanullah to translate Charles Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare (1886), an immensily popular compilation of easy prose adaptions from Shakespeare. The Urdu Tales came out in a small series entitled Afsāna-e dilpazir (Pleasant Stories, *1890), including renderings of The Winter's Tale, Cymbeline, Macbeth, Pericles, Romeo and Juliet, and The Two Gentlemen of Verona. Soon afterwards, Naval Kishore began to bring out the first translations of Victorian entertainment novels, which by the end of the century had come to constitute a favourite leisure-time reading in India. In doing so, he hoped to give a boost to Urdu prose fiction. As a contemporary editor put it, 'The chain of progress in Urdu literature which has been set in motion by the translation of English novels must not be stopped' (cited in Oesterheld 2004: 209). However, it was not until the turn of the century, that is after the period under review here, that the novels of G.W.M. Reynolds and other popular British fiction writers appeared on the NKP list on a larger scale. 125 
5.7 Coping with Multilinguality: Dictionaries 
and Vocabularies 
In dealing simultaneously with texts in various languages, both Indian and foreign, classical and modern, the editors and translators at the House of Naval Kishore daily faced the complexity of India's linguistic hetero geneity—unlike most of their compatriots, however, they were in the privileged position of having direct access to lexicons, grammars, and other linguistic tools. From the outset, Naval Kishore specialized in works of lexicography. In making the provision of lexicons and dic tionaries a pronounced focus on his agenda, he not only responded to the specific exigencies created by the polyglot setting of nineteenth-ceniury India, but also strove to uphold a long and eminent tradition of indigenous lexicography in the subcontinent. 
The multilingual situation generated various requirements that, from the late eighteenth century, forced British scholar-officials into action and entailed an increased activity in the field of lexicography. To the colonial rulers, knowledge of the classical and spoken Indian languages was 'the prerequisite form of knowledge for all others' (Cohn 1997:4). 
125 For a list of modern fiction titles in Urdu, see Nurani 1995: 306–9. The NKP catalogue of 1929 includes, among others, Urdu translations of Reynold's Faust: A Romance of the Secret Tribunals; Leila, Star of Mingrelia; The Seamstress; Rye House Plot; Pope Joan, the female pontiff; The Necromancer; Rosa Lambert; Margaret; and Wagner, the Wehr-wolf.

An Empire of Books As Cohn has outlined in a seminal essay on the languages of command (Cohn 1997), the colonial state's need to familiarize itself with India's spoken idioms—in order to effectively rule over the country and command an army of Indian soldiers-constituted a major impetus for lexicographi cal production in Persian and Hindustani (Urdu).126 At the same time, colonialism advanced English as the language of power and prestige, introducing far-reaching changes in existing language hierarchies. Emp loyment in higher public service came to presuppose a knowledge of English. Educated Indians needed to familiarize themselves with it, should they wish their social and economic aspirations to materialize.127 Follow ing the English Education Act of 1835, the classical languages of Arabic, Persian, and Sanskrit lost official support. Regarded as dysfunctional by the colonial rulers, they found themselves relegated to the sphere of religion, literary culture, and traditional scholarship. This process was much enhanced by the replacement of Persian by Urdu as official language in the NWP in 1837, and by the Education Despatch of 1854, which en tailed an institutional cutback in education in the classical languages. While Arabic, the language of the Qur'an and Islamic law, and Sanskrit, the repository of Hindu culture, remained sources of cultural pride for Indians, by the 1870s they had became marginalized subjects in state institutions and were no longer mastered by students (Rahman 2002: 88). Their importance as markers of cultural and religious identity lasted somewhat longer in indigenous higher education, but was also in decline. Urdu and, at a later stage Hindi, assumed a steadily more important function and prestige in the public domain. Hindi, for all its claims to serve as the new national language, was still in the process of being codified and standardized. 128 
In this situation of linguistic transition and contest, where classical languages competed with modern ones, Indian languages with English, and Urdu with its new rival Hindi, language remained a highly political and ideologically charged issue. The multifaceted problem of language

affected individuals and knowledge communities at many different levels. Over time, new linguistic requirements in educational, administrative, and other public contexts generated transformations in the linguistic competence of an entire section of Indian society. At the most pragmatic level, they entailed a growing need for lexicographical tools. 
After mid-century the new colonial engagement in vernacular edu cation created an urgent demand for practical dictionaries and teaching aids for students'use. As a result, lexicographical production underwent significant changes: from being sophisticated repositories of linguistic knowledge, refined taste, and correct poetic usage, lexicographical works were gradually transformed into easy-to-use reference works for students and those speakers of Urdu and Hindi who were no longer conversant with the classical languages. The perennial lament of British educators regarding the dearth of suitable textbook material makes us forget that the demand for lexicographical aids was not only felt in public instruction but also in other educational contexts. Indian Islamic scholars, for exam ple, often faced the problem of gaining access to the standard Arabic and Persian lexicons due to the rarity and costliness of printed copies. 
Given the strong traditional nexus between publishing houses and lexicographical production, it comes as no surprise that North India's foremost general and scholarly publisher should offer a broad and diverse range of dictionaries to the literate public. The NKP's shifting focus in dictionary publishing provides a good illustration of the transformations taking place in the field of lexicography as a result of shifts in both edu cational policy and linguistic competence: the firm's initial focus was on the great scholastic tradition of lexicography in the classical languages, as evident from a series of standard works of ancient and medieval Arabic and Persian lexicography. Some of these were rare works, circu lated in print for the first time; others were reprinted after a long period. At a later stage the firm reacted to the growing public importance of the modern languages. It not only began to reprint a wide range of existing lexicographical works in Hindi and Urdu, but also invested in the pro duction of its own dictionaries. 129 
Even by the 1860s, printed dictionaries were still rare and costly. With its Arabic and Persian dictionaries the NKP responded to an urgent demand among indigenous scholars. Naval Kishore deserves special credit for issuing the first mass-printed editions of two of the most im portant monolingual Arabic dictionaries, al-Qāmūs (*1872) and Asās al-balāgha (*1893). Al-Qāmūs was a standard work of Arabic idioms

An Empire of Books and figures of speech compiled by Muhammad Ibn Ya'qub al-Firuzabadi during the early fifteenth century. The text was first printed at Fort William College in 1817, and reprinted at Bombay in 1855. Both the Calcutta and Bombay edition remained confined to a small number of Orientalists and well-to-do Indian scholars. It was only in its 1872 NKP reprint that al-Qāmūs became widely accessible to Indian scholars and students of Arabic. Reasonably priced at Rs 5, as. 10, the two-volume edition was eagerly received. 130 Owing their first printed copy of al-Qāmūs to a gift by Munshi Naval Kishore, the 'ulama at the Deoband seminary warmly congratulated the publisher on his initiative in issuing a dictionary ‘so much in want that every madrasa and every student remains in need of it.'131 The second important publication in Arabic lexicography followed two decades later in the form of Maulvi Abid Husain Lakhnavi's edition of Asās al-balāgha, a twelfth-century thesaurus by Mahmud Ibn Umar al-Zamakhshari, which was largely concerned with the language of rhetoric. It had first been printed in Cairo in 1882. In making this important work accessible to an Indian audience, the 1893 NKP edition was a milestone in Arabic book publishing in the subcontinent. 
The continuing importance of Arabic in Indo-Islamic scholarship could also be seen in the demand for bilingual Arabic-Persian dictionaries. Naval Kishore's perhaps first lexicographical publication, undertaken as early as 1859, was a reprint of a work of precisely this kind, the cele brated Muntakhab al-lughāt-e Shāhjahāni (commonly known as Rashidi e Carabi). Compiled during the reign of Shahjahan by Abdul Rashid Tatawi, it had first been published at Fort William College in 1808 and had seen several editions since then.132 The second work was as-Surāh mā farhang-e qarāh (*1872), a thirteenth-century abridged version by Abul Fazl Muhammad bin Umar Qurashi of al-Jauhari's famous Arabic dictionary, to which a later Persian glossary was added in the margins. 133 
Spanning the medieval and modern periods, the NKP's contribution to Persian lexicography was equally impressive. With a wide range of dictionaries and vocabularies, the firm paid tribute to and reinforced India's traditional role as 'the home of Persian lexicography'.134 Among its various publications the following five works deserve special mention:

(1) Ghiyās al-lughāt(* 1863–4), a nineteenth-century dictionary by Maulvi Ghiyasuddin Rampuri which enjoyed great popularity in both India and Iran. The NKP edition in its margin included Chirāgh-e hidāyat, an eighteenth-century work by the great Indian lexicographer and poet Sirajuddin Ali Khan Arzu', which dealt with words and figures of speech of post-classical poets not mentioned in earlier dictionaries. (2) Burhān-e qāri(*1871), one of the most widely used Persian dictiona ries in India. It was compiled during the mid-seventeenth century by Muhammad Husain Tabrizi Burhan in the Deccan, and had first been issued in print by T. Roebuck in 1818.(3) Farhang-e Jahāngiri (*1876), a dictionary and synopsis of Persian grammar compiled by the Persian scholar Mir Jamaluddin Husain Inju during the reigns of Akbar and Jahangir. The NKP edition of Muhammad Sadiq Ali Ghalib was the first time this work appeared in print. (4) The monumental Bahār-e 'ajam (*1879), compiled over a period of twenty years by Lala Tekcand 'Bahar and completed in 1739. It was edited by Maulvi Hadi Ali from an auto graph copy by Lala Tekcand. (5) Haft qulzum (*1879), a dictionary and grammar in seven volumes compiled by Qabul Muhammad, a courtier of Nawab Ghaziuddin, and first printed in Lucknow at the Nawab's Royal Press in 1822. Naval Kishore reportedly got hold of a copy of this rare work from the Madrasah Aliyah in Calcutta (Ali 1980: 94).135 
At a time when the notion of 'pure' Persian and its 'proper' usage were vividly discussed, and different literary styles competed with one another, dictionaries became the object of linguistic debate. 136 When, in 1861, the NKP published Mirza Ghalib's Qāti-e burhān (The Chopper of the Argument), a harsh critique of Tabrizi's above cited Burhān-e gāti (The Cutting Argument), a fierce controversy arose in learned cir cles. Ghalib, the foremost among contemporary Indian poets of Persian, had listed numerous inaccuracies and errors of derivation in Tabrizi. More importantly, he rejected Tabrizi's work for its many 'Indianisms'. No sooner had Qāti-e burhān come out than passionate rejoinders appeared in defence of Tabrizi, an authoritative source to many. Gha lib and his supporters, among them his friend and later biographer Altaf Husain ‘Hali', responded in kind. Having produced nearly a dozen

refutations and counter-refutations, the affair culminated in a case of libel instigated by Ghalib against one of his antagonists. 137 Halichose to dismiss the uproar caused by Ghalib's critique as 'a blind acceptance of tradition' (Russell/Islam 1994: 358) on the part of the conservative ele ment among poets and scholars. His explanation failed to acknowledge that the indignant response to Ghalib was in direct retaliation to his cal ling into question the legitimacy of words and expressions in common use among Indian poets of Persian (Rahbar 1987: 617). To them, Ghalib's rejection of Burhān-e qāti amounted to nothing less than a denigration of their own Persian usage as inauthentic and defective. 
Hardly prone to excite such intense confrontations over language usage was a different category of lexicographical publications, namely special glossaries of the famous Persian classics. These usually uni lingual comprehension aids were in acute demand, as indicated by high print runs and frequent reprints. At first Naval Kishore resorted to older titles such as Farhang-e Gulistan (*1869), a concise gloss of difficult Persian words and Arabic quotations in Sa'di by Junaid Abdullah al Musawi, or Latā'if al-lughāt(*1877), a seventeenth-century vocabulary of Sufistic idioms occuring in Rumi's Masnavi-e ma'navi by Abdul Latif Abbasi. Later, he produced his own small series of modern glossa ries. Prepared by Mir Ibn Hasan Maududi, it included Farhang-e Sikandar nāmah(*1879), Farhang-e Būstān(*1880), and Farhang-e Yusuf va Zulai kha (*1882). 
As for Urdu, there was little indigenous lexicographical activity before the mid-nineteenth century. One only has to recall the difficulties experi enced by John Gilchrist who, when compiling his Dictionary English and Hindoostanee in the 1780s, found that his Indian collaborators were neither able to supply him with a dictionary of their language nor under stood the pressing need for it. Rather, he was asked 'if it was ever yet known in any country that men had to consult vocabularies and rudiments for their own vernacular speech' (cited in Cohn 1997:35). Lexicographical production in Urdu remained for some time dominated by the colonial state and its needs. Many early Urdu lexicographers were employed in the state educational sector. 
137 AUS 3, 1983: 99-100. For further details, see Lakhanpal 1960: 122-5 and Rahbar 1987: 359–60; 509. Ghalib's wholesale condemnation of Indian lexicographers is evident in the following statement of 1865: 'Native writers of Persian lexicons rely for the most part on conjecture. Whatever strikes them as right, they put down on paper. Now, a lexicon written by Nizami or Sa'di or their like would be acceptably authoritative to us. Why should we consider Indian authors of dictionaries as authentic?' (Ibid.: 79-80).

Reflecting the transition from the old to the modern lingua franca, much lexicographical production in Urdu during the second half of the century took the shape of Persian-Urdu dictionaries. Hitherto, the stand ard vocabulary for beginners of Persian had been Khāliq bārī, a rhymed vocabulary of Arabic and Persian words with Urdu meanings, generally ascribed to Amir Khusrau. After 1860 it was supplemented by several new works designed for use in Persian and government schools. The most popular was Karim al-lughār, a Persian-Urdu dictionary for beginners compiled in 1861 by Maulvi Karimuddin at the instance of the Punjab Educational Department. While these works continued to feature on the NKP list, the firm invested in several new students' dictionaries, including Nafā'is al-lughāt (*1869), a dictionary of Urdu words and phrases explained in Persian by Auhaduddin Bilgrami, and two works by Maulvi Muhammad Aman al-Haq entitled Aman al-lughāt (*1870) and Lughāt-e fārsi (*1874). Naval Kishore acquired the copyright of Amān al-lughāt from the author, a teacher at the Lucknow Model School. One would expect that, as the copyright owner, he would have had a vested interest in selling the largest possible number of copies. Yet it seems that he was acutely aware of the shortcomings of both Amān al lughāt and the other Persian-Urdu dictionaries on his list, for shortly afterwards he decided to invest in the production of a new unilingual Urdu dictionary which was to surpass all existing works in quality and scope. The person entrusted with its compilation was Maulvi Tassaduq Husain Rizvi, a scholar from Kinturi on the NKP's staff of translators and editors. 138 The new dictionary was ready in 1877. It was named Lughāt-e Kishori in tribute to the publisher. In the preface, Tassaduq Husain heavily criticized earlier lexicographical works, particularly Karīm al-lughāt. Scholars and students, he contended, had been com plaining for a long time that on account of its conciseness Karim al lughāt was unable to satisfy their needs—it .contained too few entries, failed to include metaphors, idioms or technical terms and gave too few explanations of the words listed.139 The first Urdu dictionary of its kind, Lughāt-e Kishori professed to remedy these deficiencies and comply with the requirements of modern speakers of Urdu. It lived up to its pro mise and became so popular with students that is was kept in print at the Tej Kumar Press until recently, seeing its twenty-sixth edition in 1994.

Mi yār al-imlā (*1876), a treatise on Urdu orthography, with a list of in correct words in ordinary use, their meaning, and correct modes of spel ling. Arba'-e'anāşir, a compilation in four columns of Urdu words with their Persian, Arabic, and English equivalents by Muhammad Nasir Ali followed in 1878, and the same author's Lughāt-e Nāsiri in 1880. In 1883 the NKP issued Nasir al-lughāt, a translation into easy Urdu by Muhammad Nasiruddin Ahmad Khan of Ghivās al-lughāt. From Mufti Ghulam Sarvar Lahori, mentioned earlier as one of the Islamic scholars associated with the press, Naval Kishore obtained the copyright of two dictionaries, namely Zubdat al-lughāt (also known as Lughāt-e Sarwari, *1877), a student's dictionary of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish words used in Urdu, and the more elaborate Jāmi al-lughāt-e Urdū (*1892) which was designed for an advanced readership. 
Compared to this proliferation of Urdu titles, Hindi lexicons and dic tionaries were slow to appear on the NKP list. The first title produced by Naval Kishore in 1874 was a Hindi translation of Amarakośa, a popular early Sanskrit thesaurus, which served as an important model for Hindi lexicography. There followed Rāmāyansabdārthkoś (*1875), a special glossary on Tulsidas's Rāmāyan by Raghunath Das. The Hindi lexico graphical tradition was represented in a joint edition of Anekārtha and Nāmamālā (* 1875), two of the earliest lexicons in the Hindi language composed by the sixteenth-century Vaishnava poet Nanddas. The back drop to this particular publication was the firm's scheme of promoting works of Hindi poetics and rhetoric started in the 1870s: both Anekārtha, a versified glossary of words with their various possible poetic meanings, and Nāmamālā, a similarly versified thesaurus of synonyms which drew largely on Amarakośa, were scholastic works designed for those poetic connoisseurs of Nanddas's time who did not understand the Sanskrit terms in Brajbhasha poetry (McGregor 2003: 943). They were of little practical use to contemporary Hindi readers. 
Indeed, had Naval Kishore wanted to supply the Hindi audience with a modern Hindi-Hindi dictionary, he would not have found an extant work to turn to. Prior to the 1870s the only dictionaries devoted specifically to the Hindi language were bilingual productions designed for students of Hindee, both native and European', notably the Reverend M.T. Adam's Hindi Kosa or A Dictionary of the Hindee language (1829), his Dictionary, English and Hinduwee (1829), and J.T. Thompson's Dictionary in Hindee and English (1846).140 In the wake of these pioneering efforts by European

lexicographers, an indigenous Hindi lexicography was slow to develop. The first major achievement and simultaneous culmination point in this field was reached only in the twentieth century, in the form of the still un surpassed Hindi sabd sāgar (Ocean of Hindi Words, 1912–27), edited by Shyamsundardas under the aegis of the Nagari Pracharini Sabha.141 Compared to this momentous scholarly achievement, previous nineteenth-century Hindi lexicons seem minor and insignificant undertakings. Yet, even if for the most part commercial rather than lite rary enterprises' (Bahri 1948:91), they did exercise an important function of their own, being the first reference works available to the newly edu cated Hindi readership. In assessing their impact, one has to bear in mind that simultaneous official or missionary productions, such as Rever end J.D. Bate's Dictionary of the Hindee Language (Benares: Medical Hall Press, 1875), were unaffordable for the majority of Indian students. This fact was remarked upon by a British reviewer, who, while judging Bate's dictionary 'extremely useful to students of Hindi' and a major improvement on Thompson, criticized its rather high price' of Rs 15.142 
Given the small output of the period, two NKP titles come into promi nence. One was the two-volume Sanskrit-Hindi dictionary Margalkoś (*1875), the first of its kind. Compiled by Mangalilal, a teacher at Painte purin Sitapur district, Margalkos was designed for students; in providing Hindi explanations and synonyms of difficult Sanskrit words, it was meant to assist in reading the classics and became a standard work in public schools. It was only in the 1890s that the NKP came out with its first commercially marketed Hindi-Hindi dictionary, Sridhar bhāṣā koś (*1894). This compilation by Pandit Shridhar Tripathi is one of the more noticeable achievements of the pre-Hindi sabd sāgar period: a large lexicon of almost 20,000 entries, it was supplemented by an introduction on grammar and two appendices containing geographical names and short biographical notices of Sanskrit and Hindi poets. 
In the course of almost four decades, the NKP adapted its repertoire of lexicographical titles to changing linguistic and educational needs. Its expanding range of dictionaries catered to diverse audiences of advanced 
and Hindi (1865), the first major work compiled by an Indian, was primarily an English dictionary designed for English-reading native students'. Its author was a teacher at Queen's College, Benares.

scholarship, literary connoisseurs, and students of public and indigenous schools. From the initial antiquarian emphasis on the preservation of the great lexicographical tradition of the Orient and, particularly, the subconti nent, the focus shifted to contemporary lexicographical production in the modern languages. With the rapid spread of formal education, the promotion of a new genre of student's dictionaries became paramount. A corollary of the ongoing lexical separation between Hindi and Urdu was the production of easy-to-use dictionaries in both languages. To provide the growing readerships of Hindi and Urdu with such tools was not only a sound commercial investment. For an educationally minded publisher like Naval Kishore it also meant fulfilling his duty in the cause of Indian modernity.
