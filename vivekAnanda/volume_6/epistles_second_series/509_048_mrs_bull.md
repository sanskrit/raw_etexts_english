## XLVIII

BOSTON,  
*26th Sept., 1894.*

DEAR MRS. BULL,

I have received both of your kind notes. I will have to go back to
Melrose on Saturday and remain there till Monday. On Tuesday I will come
over to your place. But I have forgotten the exact location. If you
kindly write me that, I cannot express my gratitude for your kindness.
For that is exactly what I wanted, a quiet place to write. Of course,
much less space will suffice me than what you have kindly proposed to
put at my disposal, I can bundle myself up anywhere and feel quite
comfortable.

Yours very sincerely,  
VIVEKANANDA.
