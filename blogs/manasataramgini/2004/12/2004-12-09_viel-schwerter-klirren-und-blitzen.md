title = "viel Schwerter klirren und blitzen"

+++
So will ich liegen und horchen still,  
Wie eine Schildwach, im Grabe,  
Bis einst ich höre Kanonengebrüll  
Und wiehernder Rosse Getrabe.

Dann reitet mein Kaiser wohl über mein Grab,  
Viel Schwerter klirren und blitzen;  
Dann steig ich gewaffnet hervor aus dem Grab,  
Den Kaiser, den Kaiser zu schützen.

Around midday we hear a huge explosion on the western ramparts. An
enormous hostile horde was trying to make its way through the western
wall. We retaliated with rocket fire and advanced a wing of our
wall-guards to kill the enemy sappers and fusiliers. While the rockets
broke down and blew away many of the hostile climbers quite a few made
it to the lower point in the fort via the gapping irrepairable hole we
had talked about. A fierce hand to hand fight was fought there. Our men
retreated under the intense assault and the foes started aiding a second
sapping party. We were suffering from fever like Lachit Barphukan on the
day of that historic encounter on the Brahmaputra against the army of
Awrangzeb. We despatched our sachiva with a force counter the thrust at
the breach. 15 minutes later I noticed the tide turning and our men were
driving them out. We rolled in some rockets to hold the breach. The
enemy had erected a 200 feet tower with platforms across the lower
battlement and was preparing to launch rockets. There was an immense din
on the walls of the lower fort as the storming parties were clashing
swords with our men. Heads, arms, bodies were being hacked and streams
of blood were flowing. We ordered an attack with trebuchets on the
tower. The tower was hit twice but they quickly raised two new ones for
the attack.

Our forces had repulsed the attack on the lower battlement. We were
distracted momentarily by this success. Just then the foes began a
bombardment from one of the towers and under the covering fire from the
rockets on the fort walls their sappers moved foward. I suddenly
realized the magnitude of the enemy armies, which we had vastly
underestimated. The whole atmosphere was reverberating with the
explosions of the cannonade. We saw their sappers trying to mine under
our fort. I needed to send a party out destroy the miners.

I remembered that eerie statement: “The one mantra that completes the
sattra successfully may be missing”
