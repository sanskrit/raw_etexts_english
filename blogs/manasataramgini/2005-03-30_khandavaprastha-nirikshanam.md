The critical time for khANDavaprastha had come. We were seeing signs of
revolt. We deployed the dual saMGNYAnaM and kAmaM. We heavily rely on
that. It had temporarily veiled the other party. But the true effects we
will have to wait and see. We also need to spend a few days doing
tarpaNaM to strI on laukIka matters (I wonder why women are so
exaggerated in their mundane laukIka interests). Like the wandering yogI
needing to please the gR^ihastrI or more precisely agastya maitrAvaruNi
needing to pacify lopAmudra vaidharbhi. The grand dance and drama had to
be arranged to be played out by the nATI who never learned nATya. To add
to this enchanting Hayasthanika came with her “grandmother” asking for
help on “hahahaDakShaDa”. On other occasions I would easily been
smothered by her great charm and done anything for her but with a more
important strI on the line Hayasthanika was asked to attend to her own
business.
