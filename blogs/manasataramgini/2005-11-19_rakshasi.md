title = "rAkShasi"

Long after the cell phone had exploded violently we lay unable to make
sense of what happened in the daze of the blast. We then saw that figure
moving like dhumAvati. It was laughing loudly and had all manifestations
of alakShmi. We longed for the lengthy conversations with the muni. We
marched through beaten path of the evil turuShka sultan with the low sun
beating down upon. Having reached an appropriate bend we made our
offerings of savitar and varuNa.

We were walking down the svApana path in late 1998 when the rAkShasi
seized us. Now we were taking the second path and saw another rAkShasi
waiting there.
