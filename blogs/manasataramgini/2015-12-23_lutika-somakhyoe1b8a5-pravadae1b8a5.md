It was probably one weekend after the tumultuous incidents concerning
the gifts of Vidrum. Somakhya’s cousin Saumanasa and her husband
Matidhvaja had visited him and Lootika. Saumanasa had spent a good deal
of the time with Lootika in the kitchen learning various tricks from
her. They had also spent some time talking about science and visiting
the museums in the city. They had just left that morning and later in
the afternoon Somakhya and Lootika had biked to the lakeside in woods in
the vicinity to observe the Comb Ducks. Having chained their bikes to
tree behind screening bushes they took up their gear and started
climbing up the incline to reach their observation point that afforded a
commanding view of the dinosaurs.

Lootika: “Oh Bhṛgu I wish life froze for ever like this.”  
Somakhya smiled and said: “And Gautamī you are saying this? Are we not
headed to see the Comb Ducks; would it not teach us of the ephemerality
of all of this.”  
Chuckling Lootika said: “buddhyā na jāyate sā cintā |indriyāṇām
autrakoṣāt udeti, śāstra-gaṇḍānaṃ bhāṣaṇam iva, priyatama |”  
Then she added: “kaṃ mantrapadaṃ pradhyāyase?”  
Somakhya: “varārohe: īśānāso naro amartyenāstāvi jano divyo gayena |”  
Lootika: “Ain’t it strange that our Gaya is amartya whereas that of the
Iranians of Zarathustra is martya.”  
Somakhya: “Good point. Have always wondered why Zarathustra had to
invert even this one.”  
Lootika: “Indeed, that too have Gayo Maretan created on the banks of the
good river Daitya to be specifically slain by the daeva-s.”  
Somakhya: “But there seems to be something he left alone. Our Gayo
Amartya has a special link to the Marut-s. Their Gayo Maretan, while
placed against the daeva-s, and in someways Zarathustra specifically
implied those of the Rudriya class, is still associated with Sraosha,
the cognate of our Skanda, the only deity of the Rudriya class left
alone by the old camel.”  
Lootika: “This seems like a much ignored facet of Indo-Iranian
miscellany that we ought to explore in greater detail someday.”

They had reached their spot on the elevation and started surveying the
bank of the lake below to catch sight of the Comb Ducks. They saw a
prominent male duck strutting about the bank with a bevy of females all
around him.

Lootika: “Talk of ignoring the pratyakṣa for the parokṣa: The amount of
ink people have spent on things like theropod ornamentation, or for that
matter the hadrosaurian equivalents, without bothering to look at the
living theropods as this Comb Duck.”  
Somakhya: “Indeed, that crest of his might have made Monolophosaurus or
Guanlong proud”.

By then Lootika had taken in their social structure: “Somakhya, it looks
as though he is monopolizing a large harem like tyrant Akbar.”  
Somakhya: “It appears that it has taken him some effort to get there.
That sulking male in the distance appears to have been trashed by him
and the former’s females have been attached to his harem.”  
Lootika: “That seems rather different the Steamer Ducks I saw while
visiting dakṣiṇa-krauñca-dvīpa after graduating. There a male-female
pair defends their territory against other such. But in the combat the
male battles the male from the invading pair and the female battles the
corresponding female. The male there has a bony knob on his wrist which
allows him to use his wing as a club. We also witnessed a gory battle
where one of the Steamers struck down another duck may be Shoveler with
a blow from his club.”  
Somakhya: “These Comb Ducks are not strictly harem-forming. They are
more like human society. Some big men hold a harem, some are monogamous,
while others have a different female each season… Ah it seems like we
are going to catch some action.”

A male Combed Duck had flown into the big man’s territory and was
attempting to rape one of the females in the harem. The holder of the
harem flapped his wings exaggeratedly and vocalized. But the intrusive
male continued with the rape. Flying up the lord of the harem landed
beside the intruder and tried to strike him with his foot. Stopping his
act the intruder returned the challenge by raising his wing deploying a
knob on his wrist as a club.

Lootika: “Ah\! Never knew even this guy wielded his wing as a club.”  
Somakhya: “Yes, I was not aware of this too till I read about it in an
old work of the paleontologist Lydekker. That’s why I started observing
them more closely. Look…”  
The harem-guarding male was clearly no slouch. He met the attacker’s
wing with is own and the two sparred for some time using their wings as
well as rising up assisted by their wings to deliver kicks. Finally, the
defending male delivered a blow on the neck of the intruder followed by
a kick and a bite. Probably injured the intruder flew away in a haste.

Lootika: “That was dramatic. My second in terms of angry ducks, though
we had seen the lapwing use its sharp wrist spur before.”  
Somakhya: “A relative of these ducks,the Spur-winged Goose from Africa,
has a sharp spur instead of the knob and uses it as a dagger in
attacking and killing other birds of the same and different species.”  
Lootika: “There we have an analog for the spike thumbed iguanodonts
among these modern dinosaurs. ”

Just then a feral buffalo entered the quiet lake causing a bit of a
stir. Somakhya: “What does that remind you of?”  
Lootika: “We have been lucky in our sightings today:  
“un madhva ūrmir vananā atiṣṭhipad  
apo vasāno mahiṣo vi gāhate |”  
\[Indeed, the wave of honey has raised the desires, clothing himself
with the waters the buffalo plunges into them.\]

They hi-fived and then wandered into a deep and secluded spot in the
woods, the entry to which few knew, and had some fun shooting targets
for a while. As the sun was dipping towards the pascima-mayūkha they
started walking back to their bikes. Lootika checked her phone and
sending off a message said: “Saumanasa says that they have reached their
place safely.”  
Somakhya: “Good”.  
Lootika: “You never said anything much of this cousin of yours beyond
the fact she existed. You never tried to collaborate with her?”  
Somakhya: “Why would I?”  
Lootika: “Why not, she has become a superstar and seems to have won lot
of yaśas.”  
Somakhya: “That would be like Arjuna seeking the gopāla-senā instead of
Kṛṣṇa.”  
Lootika smiled: “Why? You seem unimpressed but then we got along very
well with them.”  
Somakhya: “No doubt we had a good time and I do value Saumanasa as a
relative, and as someone who might further a fraction of my genes. But
then, when I have Indrasena, you the descendant of Vāmadeva, and your
formidable sisters, why would I seek her, be she a jāmi or an ajāmi, to
collaborate. When it comes to karman one has to associate with people
with viveka rather than just buddhi.”  
Lootika: “Ouch\! If I may comment on your kinswoman, I too perceived
some jagged ends in her thought process.”  
Somakhya: “How would you not jālikā? I overheard you last night in the
kitchen telling her the tale of the four brāhmaṇa-s and the resurrection
of the lion. That tale in itself would be diagnostic of an avivikti. And
I guess you remember the discussion we had in the museum where we saw
her, a superstar scientist, expressing doubt that the sauropods ever
walked on land as adults.”  
Lootika: “Yes that was funny. She and Matidhvaja even started doing
calculations to show that the sacrum of the sauropod was too heavy for
the legs\! And by the way I did have some fun arguing with her about all
kinds of things, including free-trade, openness in presenting
unpublished research, attitudes towards mleccha-s, and all that.”

As they unchained their bikes and started on the way to their respective
labs that conversation suddenly dropped off. Later that night on the way
back home both were lost in thought about their respective
investigations until they reached the market to pick up some vegetables
and fruits. As they resumed their homeward ride Lootika broke the
silence: “I was thinking about this issue of viveka and buddhi inspired
by Saumanasa’s case, and it struck me how these things are actually
distinct vectors. While people like the Americans became good at
quantifying and testing for buddhi, they seem to have largely ignored
viveka. I would think the difference between a Timur and Chingiz stemmed
from the latter being endowed with a much greater reservoir of
viveka.”  
Somakhya: “Or closer to home both Śivājī and Śaṃbhūjī were endowed with
great bravery and intelligence but the latter was an embodiment of
aviveka. You may also remember our classmate from school days,
Hemalinga, who despite his enormous endowment in mathematical capacity
was rather incapable of discerning where his numeracy might be most
useful.”  
Lootika: “That indeed was a line of thought I had – we episodically see
mathematicians act as though they can smash biological problems even as
they have reduced redoubtable fortresses of physics with their fire
power. But in reality they fail in a rather pedestrian fashion despite
their superior buddhi. I would conjecture that this is due a certain
autistic nature of their intelligence, which at the same time proves to
be their advantage and failing.”  
Somakhya: “One may postulate that there two poles here. The metaphorical
pole and the literal pole. Many with high intelligence have tendency to
be close to either pole. Those close to the literal pole tend to see
things too literally to perceive subtle connections that accompany
discernment. Those close to the metaphorical pole are literally swamped
with metaphors; seeing a profusion of connections without being able to
weed out the meaningless from the meaningful, they too tend to be low on
viveka. Having high IQ and also being at the sweet spot between the
poles does not seem to be a common trait in that already rarefied
subset.”

By then they were home and continued their chatter seated on the mat in
their fire-room.  
Lootika: “I would say Hemalinga sat more on the neuro-typical side of
the autistic spectrum, for I heard via Vrishchika that he is doing well
as a gambler.”  
Somakhya: “There seems to be a segment closer to the neuro-typical side,
where one is not as unempathetically literal as on the far end, but
still one tends to be more comfortable with well-defined parameters.
These are whom I call the crackers. Hemalinga is a good example cracker.
They are great at cracking already defined problems that have been laid
out others – like exams, quizzes or for that matter gambling. They are
not those who will create new question, which no one had thought about,
and try to solve it thereafter – they are not very effective at creating
new knowledge though they might be good at applying knowledge.”  
Lootika: “This might also account for the relative failure of
mathematicians in their invasions of biology as opposed to physics. In
physics, the problems are already present in a well-defined
mathematicized language into which they simply need to float in their
artillery in the form of earlier mathematical developments in the
abstract realm.”  
Somakhya: “O Gautamī, more philosophically we could say that those who
are further out on the mathematical spectrum are good with manipulating
the crisp, ideal Platonic entities and discovering such in the realm of
abstraction but not necessarily good at at recognizing and playing with
their smudged out counterparts seen in real life.”

Lootika: “In terms of neural function could this be related to the
quantitative and verbal IQ of the population not being exactly aligned
vectors despite being positively correlated. Perhaps, this idea is
supported by the observation that the angle between the QIQ and VIQ
vectors seems to be different in different populations. Some researchers
have previously pointed that the cīna-s, cīna-bhṛtya-s and sūryadhvaja-s
have a pronounced angle between their QIQ and VIQ vectors, being more
quantitative than verbal as a people.”  
Somakhya: “Anecdotally this might seem even more exaggerated for the
cīna-s and cīna-bhṛtya-s than for the sūryadhvaja-s, which in turn
seems to reflect the knowledge-production trajectories of those
prācya-s. Whereas the sūryadhvaja-s have exhibited remarkable
originality in various spheres, the other two prācya-s have tended to be
more of the cracker-type laboring effectively only when a new path has
been shown to them, notwithstanding what the naked Needham might have
built up for them.”

Lootika: “But then O Bhārgava, we are back to IQ; returning to where we
started, is there not something in this regard that is not entirely
capture by this whole IQ thing: The viveka-buddhi-viccheda?”  
Somakhya: “Like the poles of the metaphorical and the literal there are
other poles that define a space within which power of IQ can act.
Another such dyad of poles is that of empiricism and derivationism. At
the former pole is the person with a tendency to approach a problem by
first accruing a body of actual observations on the problem either in a
naturalistic context or via controlled experiments. At the latter pole
is the person with a tendency to approach a problem by trying to derive
a solution for it from first principles or a set of axioms.”  
Lootika: “Saumanasa seems to be of the derivationist type placing much
faith in derivation from first principles – like arguing that the adult
sauropod could not be terrestrial. Or for that matter her arguments
regarding why the failure to adopt free-trade was the cause of the
failure of our people rather than the opposite.”  
Somakhya: “One may discern different types of aviveka in this domain: 1)
the failure to apply the appropriate axioms for the world in which they
are operating – like assuming the triangles are on a plane when in
reality they lie on a sphere. 2) faulty first principles. 3) Lack of
sufficient knowledge; hence, they are only in possession of a limited or
incomplete set of first principles. When your high intelligence is
geared towards solving things from first principles rather than
gathering all the useful data on the system at hand, then, I would
postulate, that you develop a certain carelessness towards the first
principles themselves.”  
Lootika: “Here too one tends to have a sweet spot between the poles for
the excessive empiricist would be paralyzed by the inability of knowing
when to stop gathering data and start building a useful model. It seems
to me that finding this sweet spot is hardly a trivial operation.”  
Somakhya: “Hardly trivial indeed, but if we need an ideal we may turn to
the great sage Pāṇini – he first went about data collection to the point
he had good enough coverage in his gaṇapāṭha and then came up with an
appropriate number of first principles to completely describe his data.
With that we may lay down our sūtra-s in regard to this discussion, O
Bārhadukthī: parokṣa-pratyakṣav ālocanādiniyama-vādav ityādi dvandvāni
| anyatarasyātiśayenāvivekaḥ |

Lootika: “O kānta, to collect gaṇapāṭha-s one needs a proclivity for
abhyāsa. Is it not sort of paradoxical that despite their buddhi the
ādiniyamavādin-s might avoid doing so?”  
Somakhya: “If I might go as far as to psychoanalyze them a bit, the
ability to build models from ground up results in a certain assuredness
in a buddhimat. Along with this their fast-working mind is also less
inclined to pursue more laborious tasks because they see that as the
thing for the less-endowed. After all even we give the less-endowed
students, whom we might get saddled with, tasks of labor, the purpose of
which they don’t fully grasp. Hence, it is not uncommon for a buddhimat
to leap to making a model even before the data is all gathered. Thus, it
is perhaps not a surprise to see many of them get ensnared in a certain
class of constructs that are wrong but appear reasonable or perhaps even
fancy to them.”  
Lootika: “If one were to make a list of such ensnarements I would place
in it Marxism, new atheism, liberalism, egalitarianism,
metempsychoticism … and while we are perhaps rather removed from that
science, I would say a sizable body of economic theorizing would slot
right in here. Any more to add to the list?”  
Somakhya: “Why not, Indian secularism, spiritualism sans religion,
feminism, Aryan autochthonism, convergent evolution of P-loop NTPases or
any other such group of proteins. I don’t know, the list certainly does
not end there.”

Lootika: “All this still seems to be rational. Let’s not leave out yet
another axis, which perhaps is poorly correlated with IQ but there
nevertheless – the proclivity for belief. Once you are high on that axis
you don’t need to have a reason to accept an ensnaring construct and
your IQ won’t interfere either.”  
Somakhya: “That’s why I said dvandvāni – this is one more of them. No
doubt being high on both ādiniyamavāda and belief can be a veritable
thermobaric blast. But all of us are perhaps at least a little
influenced by are beliefs for if it was entirely bad that tendency
should not have survived selection, rather it should have been
rationalism all the way.”

Lootika: “ity alaṃ pravādena | Coming back to business, my student and I
have successfully purified three of the deoxyribohydrolases, three
REases, and four active TIR domains from bacteria that you had
identified. We are all set to test your predictions starting tomorrow.”
