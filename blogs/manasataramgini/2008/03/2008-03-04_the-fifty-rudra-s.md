title = "The fifty rudra-s"

+++
kalashajA had asked me the list of the rudra-s and their shakti-s
associated with the smArta shabdarAshI maNDala. Each rudra is worshiped
with their particular mantra during the installation of the
shabdamaNDala of equilateral triangles and then the yantra is turned
around and the shakti-s are invoked. Then it is placed back in the rudra
configuration and worshiped as the whole shabdarAshI. The common smArta
system of nomenclature goes as appended below, and is seen in two nearly
congruent to the lists provided by the prapa\~nchasAra and
shArada-tilaka (2.29-35) tantra-s. The rudra-s are meditated as having
two hands respectively with a trident and skull. Their shakti-s are
mediated as having two hands bearing a red lotus and skull in each. They
are both conceived as being the color of scarlet lead (Pb3O4).

The 50/51 rudra-s (and their shakti-s) of the trika system are mentioned
in the mAlinI-vijaya 3.13 beginning with shrIkaNTha as a part of the
mAlinI-gahvara in the na-\>pha configuration. The 50/51 rudra-s/shakti-s
of the pashchimAmnAya (kubjikA) tantras are similar and are mentioned in
the kubjikAmata tantra (24.1-57; kulAlikAmnAya version). Similar lists
of the kubjikA tradition are also mentioned in the agni purANa 145 and
293. These are in relationship to the tadgraha structure of the
pashchimAmnAya, which is homologous to the mAlinI-gahvara. The rudra-s
in the lists of trika and pashchimAmnAya, while closely resembling the
smArta list, are arranged in prayoga to suit the mAlinI order. The
associated shakti-s however differ considerably vis-à-vis the smArta
equivalent (the pashchimAnAya list is appended after the smArta list. As
shrIkaNTha is the first rudra of these lists the nyAsa-s in these
traditions which place the rudra-s on various organs are called
shrIkaNThAdi nyAsa. The saiddhAntika system of 50 rudra-s is provided by
the makuTAgama, charyApAda 6.14-20. This saiddhAntika list while having
most of the names seen in the above systems is different in its order to
correspond with the gahvara of this srotas. Kasmirian tradition records
another list that appears to be associated with amR^iteshvara or
tryambaka rudra of the netra-tantra—it has names that are very different
and have been appended after the pashchimAMnAya list.
