entirely covered with tracks of tiger footprints,  
where sinkholes have opened in the wet mud,  
evoke terror\! \[perhaps by abhinanda\]

Banks of autumnal rivers, with their line of brilliant white herons,  
with their necks stooping forward, currently engaged in probing,  
with the tips of their beaks, a school of fish lurking within the
waters,  
with wagtails wandering around, and their environs covered  
by rows of quacking ducks, with arrays of Barleria cristata  
pleasantly buzzing with intoxicated bees, are the cause of much
pleasure\!

These poetic sketches belong to that large body of kAvya which we have
repeatedly alluded to on these pages – sketches which bring out the kavI
as a naturalist.  
Some earlier examples might be revisited here:

We thought of our own tumultuous life and realized that we experienced
some of these sights as of few years ago. More than two decades ago we
saw the crocodiles. As of just over an year ago we saw the bumble bees
enter the *Barleria cristata* flowers. From the earliest days from when
we started observing the dinosaurs of the current era, aided by the man
from the puraMdara fort, we noted the herons probing the autumnal
streams for guppies and doves building their chaotic tangles of nests.
We have seen many a towering termite mound throughout our existence. But
three sights are no longer the share of the sAdhAraNa mAnava of
bhAratavarSha: The tiger, or even is spoor, the boar or the jackal. For
these one needs to stray far from the overgrown urban sprawls and
journey to those inaccessible refugia that may be counted on ones
fingers. This indeed marks the change from the bhArata of the kavI-s to
that of today’s mahAnAgarin-s.
