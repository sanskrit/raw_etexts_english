title = "aghora bhairava prayoga"

+++
When the bhairava mantras are appropriately discharged they are like
arrows whizzing from the pinAka. The shatru senA is as though rushing
forward when it is suddenly attacked from the flanks by flaming missile
shot by the agents of rudra. Each bhairava mantra is like a shower of
fatal arrows raining on them with unstoppable fury.

Meditate upon the Adi-guru, the kShatriya woman, lakShmI\~nkarA, who is
the founder of the lineage of teachers of the lore of the bhairava in
the kali yuga, the great princess, the sister of the noble rAjan
indrabhUtI. She is of lotus complexion, of splendid beauty, seated in in
padmAsana, graced by a crimson tilaka, with her long eyes painted with
black collyrium, showing the gyAna mudra surrounded by students
receiving the bhairava vidyA from her. She has condensed the secret
vidyAs of bhairava of gAlava, vishvAmitra, bhArgava, yamoghaNTa, shUka,
shikhin and others.

medholkAya svAhA ||  (utter) X 4 and worship the awful vinAyaka tightly
embracing his blue-hued shakti madadravA.

Then the 6-fold tarpaNaM is offered with the following formulae:

ShphAM phaT phAM phIM hrIM shrIM aghoraM bhairavaM tarpayAmi |   
phreM phaT phAM phIM hrIM shrIM khachakra-bhairavaM tarpayAmi |

Then water oblations may be made (before the idol or a bimba of aghora
bhairava)

(water oblation)

Sprinkle water on head with the following formula:  
tIkSNa daMShTra mahAkAya kalpAnta dahanopama manthAna bhairavAya
namastubhyaM anuGYAM dAtumarhasi 

\-Sit in padmAsana and concentrate for some time on sahasrAra  
\-conceive aghora bhairava thus: He is dressed in the skin of tiger and
elephant and holds in his hands trishula, pinAka, chakra, pAshupata,
khaTvA\~Nga, khadga, tomara, bhindipAla. He is surrounded by 7
dhUmAvatIs, each with 4 canine teeth, holding skull bowls with red mada
and cleavers, crows are perched on their shoulders, they wear clothing
of pretas, and are howling hideously.

One may use the following gAyatrI for meditation:  
oM shvanadhvajAya vidhmahe| shUlahastAya dhImahi | tanno bhairavaH
prachodayAt ||

\-Meditate on the mahAmantra:  
oM namo mahAbhairavAya vikR^ita daMShTrogra-rUpAya pingalAkShAya

vighna-vinAshAya oM hrUM phaT | 

\-followed by:  
oM skhAM skhIM skhauM mahAbhairavAya namaH | 

Then utter the following incantations (+water oblation) and conceive the
pArShadas of dAkinis and chaNDeshvara rushing forth to devour the
shatrUs:

oM ChaH ChaH ChaH DAkinImata bandhu namaH |   
oM namo bhagavate vajrAya chanDeshvarAya IM IM phaT svAhA |  
oM strIM strIM valIM valIM IM aH phaT svAhA |   
(water oblation – prevents mR^ityu sent by the dhUmAvatI deploying
attacker and hurls it back)  
oM namo jale mohe kule phalAni saMkule svAhA |   
oM namo jale mohe drAM abjini phaT svAhA |   
oM bhUr-bhuvas-svaH svAhA |

Then kindle fire with:

raM saM sIdasva mahAn.h asi shochasva deva vItamaH |   
vi dhUmaM agne aruShaM miyedhya sR^ija prashasta darshataM vaShaT.h || 

Make fire oblations 10 or 108 times with ghee, white tila or gavedhuka:

Of the second mantra the R^ishyAdi is thus stated:

The 6-fold nyAsa may be done with:prá vaH paántaM; raghumanyavó .andho
