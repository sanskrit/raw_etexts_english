*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

GOPAL LAL VILLA, BENARAS CANTONMENT

*7th Feb*. *1902*.

MY DEAR JOE —

We have safely reached Benaras, and Mr. Okakura \[Kakuzo\] has already
done Benaras. He goes to see *Sarnath* (the old Buddhistic place) today
and starts on his tour tomorrow.

He has asked Niranjan \[Swami Niranjanananda\] to accompany him and he
has consented.

Kanay \[Nirbhayananda\] has supplied him with everything he asked for —
and he asks me also to send you the accounts. This, on the other page.

I hope Nivedita and Mrs. \[Ole\] Bull have safely arrived. I am rather
better than at Buddha Gaya. This house is nice — well furnished and has
a good many rooms and parlours. There is a big garden all round and
beautiful roses — and gigantic trees. It is rather cooler here than at
Gaya. There was no hitch to our friends being admitted into the chief
temple and \[allowed to\] touch the Sign of Shiva and to worship. The
Buddhists, it seems, are always admitted.

With all love and welcome to Mrs. Bull and Nivedita — if they have
arrived — and all to you,

VIVEKANANDA
