The need of a critical or as it was sometimes called a correct edition
of the Mahabharata has been felt (at first, of course, rather vaguely) by
Sanskritists for over half a century.^ It was voiced., however, in a clear and
emphatic manner, for the first time, by Professor M. Winternitz, at the
Xlth International Congress of Orientalists., held at Paris, in 1897, when he
read a paper drawing attention to the South Indian manuscripts of the
Great Epic and ending with the remark that a critical edition of the Maha-
bharata was “ wanted as the only sound basis for all Mahabharata studies,
nay, for all studies connected with the epic literature of India The idea
received a concrete shape in his proposal for the foundation of a Sanskrit
Epic Text Society, which he laid before the very next session of the Oriental
Congress (Xllth), held in Rome (1899). Again, three years later, at the
following session of the Congress (Xlllth), held in Hamburg (1902), Pro-
fessor Winternitz reiterated his requisition and endeavoured to impress
again upon the assembled savants that a critical edition of the Mahablia-
rata was a sine qua non for all historical and critical research regarding the
Great Epic of India

The reception accorded to the! various proposals made by Professor
Winternitz in connection with his favourite project was not as cordial as
might have been expected from an enlightened, international assemblage of
Sanskritists. “ At first ”, writes Professor Winternitz himself,'^ “ the idea
of a critical edition of the Mahabharata met with great scepticism. Most
scholars were of opinion that it was impossible to restore a critical text of
the Great Epic, and that we should have to be satisfied with editing the
Scuth Indian text, while the North Indian text was represented well enough
by the Calcutta and Bombay editions. Only few scholars were in full agree-
ment with the plan of one critical edition”.

Notwithstanding this general apathy, a committee was appointed by the
Indian Seclion of the International Congress of Orientalists in Rome (1899)
to consider the proposal of Professor Winternitz for the foundation of a
Sanskrit Epic Text Society, already mentioned. This committee was not in
favour of the said proposal. It recommended instead that the work of
preparing the critical edition should be undertaken by the International
Association of Academies. The London session of this Association, held in

1904, adopted the above suggestion and resolved “to make the critical edi-
tion of the Mahabharata one of the tasks to be undertaken under its auspices
and with the help of funds to be raised by the Academies.” In pursuance
of this decision, the Academies of Berlin and Vienna sanctioned certain
funds earmarked for the Mahabharata work, with whose help the prelimi-
nary work for the critical edition was actually begun.

£2} In furtherance of this project, then, Professor H. Luders prepared
a “Specimen” of a critical edition of the Mahabharata (Druckprobe einer
kritischen Ausgabe des Mahabharata, Leipzig 1908) with the funds provid-
ed for the purpose by the Konigliche Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften in
Gottingen.^ The Specimen, which was meant only for private circulation,-
consisted of 18 pages, comprising the constituted text (pp. l-ll)of the first
67 stanzas of the Adiparvan with their various readings (printed as foot-
notes), an Appendix (pp. 12-17), on a similar plan, containing the text of
the Brahma -Ganesa interpolation (with its variants), and finally a list
(p. 18) of the 29 manuscripts, selected exclusively from European libraries,
which formed the specimen apparatus criticm^'^ This little brochure, which
must rank in the annals of Mahabharata studies as the first tentative criti
cal edition of the Mahabharata, was laid before the Indian Section of the
XVth International Congress of Orientalists, held in Copenhagen (1908).
The tender seedling, planted with infinite care, did not, however, thrive in the
uncongenial European soil. Twenty years later, in 1928, at the XVIIth
International Congress of Orientalists, held at Oxford', Professor Winter-
NiTZ reported that, under the scheme of the International Association of
Academies, “except this specimen (Druckprobe) nothing has been
printed ”.^

However, in the interval some preliminary wwk, such as the classifying
and collating of manuscripts had been done by Professor Luders and some
of his pupils (among them my fellow-student and friend Dr. Johannes
Nobel, now Professor in the University of Marburg), by Professor Win-
TERNITZ and his pupil Dr. Otto‘ Stein, and by Dr. Bernhard Geiger
(Vienna). The last great World War gave its quietus to this ambitious
project, sponsored by the Associated Academies of Europe and America, and
finally diverted the attention of European scholars from the Mahabharata
Problem.


^ It was printed by the firm of W. Drugulin.

2 Professor Winternitz had sent me, in 1926, his copy, on loan, for perusal,
which I returned to him almost immediately afterwards.

^ The brochure did not contain any preface, or explanatory notes.

After the war, the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, then in its
early infancy, enthusiastically undertook the work, making a fresh start,
fortunately without realizing fully the enormousness of the project or the
complicacies of the problem. At a meeting of the General Body of the
Institute, held on July 6, 1918, Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, Chief
(now Ruler) of Aundh — the liberal and enthusiastic patron of diverse' projects
calculated to stimulate research, advance knowledge, and enhance Indian
prestige — the president elect on the occasion, easily persuaded by a band of
young and hopeful Sanskritists who had returned to India after completing
their philological training abroad, with their heads full of new ideas, urged
upon the audience the need of preparing a Critical and Illustrated Edition
of the Mahabharata, offering to contribute, personally, a lakh of rupees, by
annual grants, towards the expenses of producing the edition.^ The donor
was warmly thanked for this princely {3} gift and the offer was gratefully ac-
cepted by the spokesmen of the Institute, who in their turn undertook to
prepare an edition that would: meet with the high requirements of modem
critical scholarship. In accordance with this decision of the General Body
of the Institute, the late lamented Sir Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, the
doyen of the Sanskritists of Western India and' the inspirer of the critical
and rigorous scholarship of the present day, inaugurated, in April 1919, this
monumental work by formally beginning the collation of the opening jnmt-
tra of the works of the ancient Bhagavata sect, which is found also at the
beginning of sotne manuscripts of the Mahabharata

Then, on the basis of the premise of the donation of a lakh of rupees by the
Ruler of Aundh, the Institute appealed for the very large financial support
needed to Indian governments, princes, and men of wealth. Not as many
favourable responses were received as might have been expected ; but very
generous aid wais and is being given by some, whose names are recorded
elsewhere.

The reasons which have induced Sanskritists both here and abroad to
undertake Ihis gigantic enterprise are easy to understand. The pre-emi-
nent importance of the epic is universally acknowledged. Next to the
Vedas, it is the most valuable product of the entire literature of ancient
India, so rich in notable works. Venerable for its very antiquity, it is one

of the most inspiring monuments of the world, and an inexhaustible mine
for the investigation of the religion, mythology, legend, philosophy, law,
custom, and political and social institutions of ancient India.

As a result of researches that have been carried on during the last
thirty-five years or so, there is now no doubt whatsoever that the text of
the Mahabhiarata has undergone numerous changes.^ The texts of the
Northern and Southern manuscripts — ^to mention only two of the manus-
cript classes — are widely divergent, and much uncertainty prevails regarding
the correctness and originality of the texts preserved by them. The exist-
ing editions — which either merely reproduce the version of a particular type
of manuscripts, like the Bombay edition,^ or else are eclectic on no recog-
nizable principles, like the Kumbhakonam edition — fail to remove the uncer-
tainty of the text.

The present edition of the epic is intended chiefly to remedy this un-
satisfactory state of things. What the promoters of this ^heme desire to
produce and supply is briefly this : a critical edition of the Mahabharata
in the preparation of which all important versions of the Great Epic shall
have been taken into consideration, and all important manuscripts collated,
estimated and turned to account. Since all divergent readings of any im-
portance will be given in the critical notes, printed at the foot of the page,
this £4} edition will, for the first time,, render it possible for the reader to have
before him the entire significant evidence for each individual passage. The
value of this method for scientific investigation of the epic is obvious.
Another feature of the new edition will be this. Since not even the seem-
ingly most irrelevant line or stanza, actually found in a Mahabharata
manuscript collated for the edition, is on any account omitted, this edition
of the Mahabharata' will be, in a sense, more complete than any previous
edition.'^ It will be a veritable thesaurus of the Mahabharata tradition.

Undc'r the scheme outlined above, a tentative edition of the Viratapar-
van was prepared by the late Mr. Narayan Bapuji Utgikar, M.A., and
published by the Institute in 1923. Copies of this edition were distributed
gratis among leading Sanskritists — Indian, European and American — ^with
a view to eliciting from them a frank expression of their opinipo on the
method worked out by the then editor-in-chief. The opinions received were
very favourable and highly encouraging. The valuable suggestions made

by many eminent authorities have been to a great extent followed in the
subsequent work.


COLLATION OF MANUSCRIPTS

Collation of the manuscripts is being done, regularly, not merely at the Insti-
tute, but also at the Visvabharati of Rabindranath Tagore in Bengal under the
supervision of Pandit Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya, and at the Saraswati Mahal
in Tanjore under the supervision of M. R. Ry. Rao Saheb T. Sambamurthi Rao
Avl., B.A., B.L. These outside centres were at first intended chiefly for the colla-
tion of the Bengali and the Telugu-Grantha manuscripts respectively. But provi-
sion has now been made at the Institute itself for the collation of manuscripts
written in any of the seven scripts (Sarada, Nepiall, Maithili, Bengali, Telugu,
Grantha and Malayalam), besides Devanagari, which are ordinarily required for
our Mahabharata work.

The entire Mahabharata stands now collated from a minimum of ten manus-
cripts ; many parvans have been completely collated from twenty manuscripts ;
some from thirty ; a few from as many as forty ; while the first two adhyiayas of the
Adi, which have special importance for the critical constitution of the text of the
entire epic, were collated from no less than sixty manuscripts.

The collation is done by a permanent staff of specially trained Shastris (Nor-
thern as well as Southern) and University graduates. For the purposes of oolla'
tion, each Mahabharata stanza (according to the Bombay edition of Ganpat
Krishna ji, ^aka 1799) is first ^^Titten out, in bold characters, on the top line of
a standard, horizontally and vertically ruled foolscap sheet. The variant read-
ings are entered by the collator horizontally along a line allotted to the manus-
cript collated, ak§ara by aki§ara, in the appropriate column, vertically below the
corresponding portion of the original reading of the “ Vulgate On the right
of each of these collation sheets, there is a column four inches wide reserved for
remarks (regarding corrections, marginal additions etc.), and for ‘'additional”
stanzas found in the manuscripts collated, either immediately before or after £5} the
stanza in question. Very long “ additions ” are written out on separate “ .sodha-
patras ” and attached to the collation sheets. Tlie collations are regularly checked
by a batch of collators different from the one which did the collation in the first
instance, before they are handed over to the editor for the constitution of the text.

THE CRITICAL APPARATUS

GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

It is by no means easy to answer the question how many manuscripts of
the MahaBharata there are in existence ; firstly, because, no complete list of
these manuscripts has ever been compiled ; and, secondly, because the ex-
pression “Mahabharata manuscript’’, as ordinarily used, is ambiguous in
the extreme ; it may apply to a small manuscript of the Bhagavadgita alone,
as well as to a complete manuscript of the Mahabharata, in several volumes,
containing all the eighteen parvans. Moreover, the parvans are mostly
handed down separately, or in groups of few parvans at a time, at least in
the oldest manuscripts now preserved. Therefore, in taking stock of Maiia-
bharata manuscripts, it is best to take as unit of measurement a manuscript
of a single parvan.



PROLEGOMENA


15


As a very approximate computation, I may state that there are known
to be about 235 manuscripts of the Adi, counting only such as have
come within my knowledge from catalogues of private and public libraries
accessible to me, as also those manuscripts whose owners have sent them to
the Institute for collation or inspection. But this is probably by a long
way not the total number of extant manuscripts of this parvan, because
there must be quite a large number of manuscripts in ‘private hands, of
which we know next to nothing. It has been the experience of most
manuscript collectors in India that when one takes the trouble to look for
the manuscripts, they^ turn up in quite astonishing numbers, though they
are as a rule late and of questionable worth. Of these 235 manuscripts of
the Adi, a little less than half (107) are in the Devanagarl script alone. The
other scripts are represented in this collection as follows : Bengali 32,
Grantha 31, Telugu 28, Malayalam 26, Nepali 5, iSarada 3,^ Maithili 1,
Kannada 1, and Nandiniagari 1.

Of these manuscripts of the Adi about 70 (i.e. a little more than 29
per cent of the total) were fully or partly examined and collated for this
edition. And of these again about 60 were actually utilized in preparing
the text. The critical apparatus of the first two adhyayas gives the colla-
tions of 50 manuscripts. Many of these were, however, discarded in the
sequel as misch-codices of small trustworthiness and of no special value for
critical purposes. At the same time a few other manuscripts (such as the
Sarada and Nepali codices), which were not available in the beginning,
were added to the critical apparatus subsequently. A table given below
supplies all the necessary details of the critical apparatus as to where the
collations of the different manuscripts begin, where theyi end, and so on and
so forth.

£6} The choice of the' critical apparatus is not easy matter, owing to
the astonishing bulk and the amazing variety of the material. The number of
exact duplicates among these is decidedly small and almost negligible. An
exception to this rule is formed only by manuscripts of commentators' ver-
sions, which show inter se little difference. So that what has been said by
Kosegarten with respect to the manuscripts of the Pahcatantra,, applies,
generally speaking, equally well to the Mahabharata manuscripts'*: quot co-
dices, tot textus. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the choice of our criti-
cal apparatus has not been entirely arbitrary. Efforts were made to secure
manuscripts written in as many different Indian scripts as possible, which
is the same as saying, manuscripts belonging to as many different Indian


^ Of these three, our is one, while the other two are paper manuscripts,
written in madem <Saradla characters, with Nilakantha’s commentary, in the
Raghunatha Temple Library; cf. Stein’s Catalogue (1894), p. 196, Nos. 3712-32,
3951-79. They represent probably the Nilakantha version.

provinces as possible. Old manuscripts, even though fragmentary and
partly illegible, were selected in preference to moderndooking manuscripts,
though complete, neatly written and well preserved. Within the version,
discrepant type's were chosen in preference to similar types.^ Of the Nila-
kantha version, only three were selected, though it is by far the most nume-
rous group ; because, firstly, it is one of the late^ versions ; and, secondly it
has been edited several times already, though not as well as it should be ;
and, thirdly, there is little difference between the individual manuscripts of
the group. The only important scripts unrepresented in our critical appa-
ratus are : Kannada, Uriya and Nahdinagarl.

Besides the manuscripts collated specially for this edition, I have made
occasional use of the collations of manuscripts preserved in European libra-
ries made by Theodor Goldstucker, photographic copies of which were
presented to the Institute, for use in connection with this project by the
University of Strassburg, through the kind offices of the late Professor Emile
Senart, as also of the collations intended for the edition planned by the
International Association of Academies and made by the pupils of Geheim-
rat Professor Dr. Heinrich Luders, which have been plated at the disposal
of the Institute in pursuance of a resolution on the subject passed by the
Indian Section of the XVIIth International Congress of Orientalists, held
at Oxford, in 1928.^

Sixteen of the manuscripts collated bear dates, ranging from the 16th to
the 19th century. The oldest dated manuscript of our critical apparatus is a
Nepali manuscript which bears a date corresponding to a.d. 1511.*

The other dates are: a.d. 1519 (K3), 1528 (VJ, 1598 (DJ, 1620 (Da^),

1638 (KJ, 1694 (KJ, 1701 (Dr3), 1739 (K,,), 1740 (BJ, 1759 (B.),

1786 (B,), 1802 (Dn), 1808 (Dn,), 1838 (Mo), and 1842 (M,). The

Nilakantha manuscripts are' not all dated, but they can scarcely be much
anterior to the beginning of the eighteenth century, since Nilakantha himself

^ Consequently, our critical apparatus tends to reflect greater diversity in the
material than what actually exists, but that was unavoidable.

2 Th^ Resolutions were worded as follows :

No. 2. That in view of the eminently satisfactory manner in which the work
is being done by the Institute, this Congress is of opinion that the MSS. collations
made, and the funds collected, for the critical edition of the epic planned by the
Association of Academies, be now utilized for the purposes of the critical edition
being prepared in India, without prejudice to the original project of the Asso-
ciation of Academies.

No. 3. That this Congress therefore recommends that : (a) such collations
of the Mahabharata text as have already been prepared by the Association of
Academies be placed, on loan, at the disposal of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research
Institute

manuscripts do bear dates, but since they refer to a cyclic era, it is difficult
to calculate their equivalents.

CLASSIFICATION OF MANUSCRIPTS

The manuscript material is divided naturally into recensions by the
scripts in which they are written. Corresponding to the two main types of
India'n scripts, Northern and Southern, we get two main recensions of the
epic. Each of these recensions is again divided into a number of sub-recen-
sions, which I have called “ versions ”, corresponding to the different provin-
cial scripts in which these texts are written. This principium divisionis is
net as arbitrary as it might at first sight appear. The superficial difference
of scripts corresponds, as a matter of fact, to deep underlying textual diffe-
rence's. It is common experience in India that when we have a work hand-
ed down in different versions, the script is invariably characteristic of the
version.! The reason for this concomitance between script and version ap-
pears to be that the scribes, being as a rule not conversant with any script
but that cf their own particular province, could copy only manuscripts
written in their special provincial scripts, exception being made only in favour
of Devanagari, which was a sort of a ” vulgar ” script, widely used and
understood in India.

While the principle mentioned above is not entirely mechanical or arbi-
trary, it is also not ideal or perfect. It is often contravened in practice,
mainly through the agency of the Devanagari, which is the chief medium cf
contamination between the different recensions and versions. Thus we come
across Devanagari copies of the commentary or version of Arjunamisra, who
was an Easterner ; similar copies of the commentary or version of Ratna-
garbha, who was a Southerner. There are again Devanagari copies of the
Grantha and the Sarada- versions. Dn the other hand, a popular version
like that of Nilakaintha may be copied in any script. I have come across
manuscripts of the Nilakantha (Devanagari) version written in Sarada,!^ Ben-
gali,'* Telugu and Grantha scripts. Another cause of disturbance was this.
Along the boundaries of provinces speaking different languages or using dif-
ferent scripts, there are invariably bi-lingual and bi-scriptal zones. In these
zones there was an ever operating impulse, tending to introduce iijpovations,
obliterating the' differentiae and normalizing the text. Nevertheless, though
nothing is impossible, it would be passing strange if we were to find a copy
of the pure Sarada version written, say, in the Malayalam script, or cf the
Grantha version in the Nepali script.

at p. 64, of his Detailed Report of a Tour in Search of Sanskrit MSS. made
in Kasmir, Rajputana and Central India, a report printed as Extra Number
of the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1877.
The lines of writing of the MS. run parallel to the narrow side of the leaf.
There are, on an average, 24 lines on a page, and 36 aksaras ( i.e. a little over
a sloka) in a line. A page, therefore, contains, on an average. 26 (anustubh)
stanzas. Each folio bears, on its reverse, in the left-hand margin, near the
bottom, a cipher representing the serial number of the folio and a signature
indicating the title of the work, as well as the name of the parvan. — The MS.,
which is unfortunately incomplete and fragmentary, must have originally con-
tained at le'ast the first three parvans (Adi, Sabha and Aranya), written, as
far as one can judge, by the same hand. The extant portion contains the
Sabha in its entirety, but only fragments of the other two parvans, the begin-
ning of Adi and the end of Aranya being lost. The Adi, which appears to have
extended from the beginning of the volume up to fol. 154, is particularly frag-
mentary ; a continuous text begins only* from fol. 63 (our adhy. 82). Of the
first 62 folios, the extant portion contains only the lower segments (with 10 to
15 lines of writing on each page) of fol. 24-25, 36-37, 39, 47-48, 53-57 and
61-62 ; the initial 23 folios as also 15 other intermediate folios (viz. 38, 40-46,
49-52, 58-60) are entirely missing ; while only 10 of these folios are complete.
Folio number 96 is repeated. The Adi ends at fol. 154a. The colophon repeats
the stanzas of the Parvasarhgraha giving the number of adhyayas (230) in this
paiwan, as also its extent in “ slokas ", i.e. granthas (7984). The writing is neat
and careful ; erasures and corrections are few and far between. Occasionally one
comes across variant readings (cf. fol. 115b), entered (probably by the same
hand) in fet smaller letters between the lines ; on fol. 116a, there is a stanza
written in the upper margin, which is meant to be added after 1. 162. 15, and
which is found, otherwise, only in K^, in other words is\n interpolation pecu-
liar to §1 Kj. Many of the marginal additions are glosses, which are rather
numerous in the first 15 (extant) folios, evidently note's made from some com-
mentary by a student who intended making a careful study of the text. In
a few places — perhaps about half a dozen— corrections have been made with
yellow pigment. Some of the adhyayas bear (serial) numbers, written pro-
bably by a different hand ; the first (legible) figure that we come across is 43,
corresponding to adhy. 32 of our edition, involving a difference of 11 in our



PROLEGOMENA


21


enumerations of adhyayas ! The last adhyaya number noted in this parvan
is 100, corresponding to our adhy. 87 : the difference between our enumera-
tions thus rises to 13 in 55 adhyayas. The Puranic raconteur is here called,
throughout, Suta, not Sauti. Moreover, the prose formula of reference gene-
rally omits [11} (resp. ^5:)^ and gives, as in S MSS., merely the name
or designation of the speaker, such as However, from the fact that

towards the middle and end of the parvan, the full forms containing
(resp. ) do occur sporadically, e.g. 1. 94. 64 (fol. 73a); 98. 1 (fol. 75b);

99. 36 (fol. 77a) etc. : it follows that the usual etc. are only abbre-

viations. The names of the sub-parvans are generally added, in the colo-
phons, agreeing mostly with the corresponding divisions of our edition. The
extant fragment begins (fol, 24a) with the words a^qq*. i ^?qw4

(cf. V. 1. 1. 26. 10). — A facsimile of the folio (154) containing the' end of the
Adi and the beginning of the Sabha is given, facing p. 880.

The- MS. contains the first three parvans written in the same hand, the
date coming at the end of the Aranya. The writing is clear and fairly correct ;
a few corrections of scribe’s errors are noted in the margin, probably by the
same hand ; otherwise the margins are clean. The colophons give adhyaya
numbers sporadically, and names of adhyayas, sub-parvans or upakhyianas
generally. On the last folio (181) of the Adi is given, in different hand, a list
of major parvans with the corres[X)nding number of their adhyayas and
stanzas, in a tabular form.

Indian Paper.

A moderately trustworthy, though some’what modern and very incorrect
transcript of a :^rada exemplar. Even the outward form and get-up of this
MS. are suggestive of Kasmiri origin. The lines of writing, as^in Sarada
(bhurjapatra) MSS. run parallel to the narrow side of the folio. The signa-
tures in the margin are like those found in Kasmiri books. The numerous
clerical errors, which disfigure every page, betray the writer to be a profes-
sional scribe, not thoroughly familiar with the awkward Sarada script, and
still less so with the language of the text, easily misled by the deceptive simi-
larity between certain letters of the Sarada and Devanagari alphabets. He

frequently writes ^ for ^ (e. g. for ^f%); ^ for ^ and e. g. m\ for

sional corrections, in the body of the text, by yellow pigment. The pages from
42 to 45 are left blank, while 41b and 46a contain only a few lines of writing.
Besides Adi, the codex contains also Virata, Bhi§ma and a portion of Anu^-
sana (Danadharma), breaking off at the first half of stanza 39 of adhy. 83 of
the Bombay ed. According to statements at the end of the Bhisma and the
beginning of the Anusasana, the MS. was written in V. Sarhvat 1839 (ca. a.d.
1783), by a Brahmaaia named Gopala, residing in Laksmimatha ; but the
writing of the volume is not quite uniform. It is, therefore, uncertain, in my
opinion, whether the Adi was written by this same Gopala, in the said year ;
contra Eggeling, Catalogue of the Skt. MSS. £12} in the Library of the In-
dia Office, Part VI (1899), p. 1158, who regards the entire volume as written
by the same scribe. The colophons, which are short, sporadically give the
adhyaya numbers. This is the' only MS. of the Adi belonging to a European
Library that was available for collation at the Institute and used for this edi-
tion !— The reference ^ f before stanza 8 of adhy. 1 indicates the inten-
tion of the scribe to “ illuminate ” the MS. by writing the alternate letters
( fl, ) which are missing, in red ink.

The date of the MS. is giveh as a chronogram corresponding to V. Sahivat
1676 (ca. A.D. 1620). Double dandas in red ink are inserted indiscriminately
in the middle of the text. The writing, which is full of mistakes, is uniform
but not neat. No corrections are, however, to be seen, the MS. being, per-
haps, not much used. Notwithstanding the fact that this MS. agrees, page
for page, with Daj, there are many small differences between them ; neither
can be a direct copy of the other ; they must go back to a more remote com-
mon source. It appears to be older, and is less corrupt, than Daj. In the
numbering of the folios, figure 1 is repeated. The colophons contain the
names of adh5^yas and sub-parvans generally ; but sloka numbers or adhyaya
numbers only sporadically. The MS. has a few blanks in the text and com-

£25} TESTIMONIA

As testimonia, or aids of a partial or subsidiary character, there are
available, besides the numerous commentaries, the following three important
epitomes of the eleventh century : (i) the Javanese adaptation BMraiam
(ca. A.D. 1000), (ii) the Telugu adaptation Andihra Bhdmtamu by the
Telugu poet Nannaya Bhatta (ca. a.d. 1025), and (iii) the Sanskrit adapta*
tion Bhdrai\amanjari by the Kasmiri poet K^emendra (ca. A.D. 1050) ; as
' also an important Persian rendering made some centuries later (ca. a.d. 1580)
at the instance of that enlightened and sagacious Emperor of India with
catholic sympathies, the great Akbar.

The commentaries collated for this edition are dealt with below, under
the Devanagari versions. Here it will suffice to observe that, even when
accompanied by the (epic) text, the commentaries are, for reasons which
will be explained later on, evidence only for the actual lemmata and the
pafhantaras cited. The absence of commentary on a stanza or a group of
stanzas or even on an adhyaya is, in general, no proof that that particular
passage was lacking in the text used by the commentator. For, clearly, his
text may have contained the passage in question, but he may not have
deemed it necessary to comment upon any portion of it. Nevertheless when
the commentary ignores a lengthy and difficult passage, then there is a strong
presumption that the text of the commentator did not contain the passage.
A case in point is the Kanikaniti, a passage of 186 lines, which is entirely
ignored in Devabodha’s commentary (but has evoked lengthy comments from
both Arjunamisra and Nilakantha), and which is missing in the Kasmiri
version.

As regards the old Javanese adaptation, from the reports of Dutch
scholars^ who have studied the original Javanese text, it apix^ars that only
eight out of the eighteen parvans of the Mahabhiarata have been traced so
far ; namely, Adi, Virata, Udyoga, Bhi:§ma, Asramavasa, Mausala, Maha>
prasthana and Svargarohana. Three of these (Asramavasa, Mausala,
Mahaprasthana) were the subject of a doctor dissertation, submitted to the
Leyden University by Dr. H. H. Juynboll, as early as 1893. The Javanese
original was edited by the doctor in Roman characters and rendered into
Dutch. iTiirteen years later (1996) the same scholar published the text of
the Adi (with different readings) in Roman transcript.^ Of the old Javanese
Adiparvan, only a few episodes have been as yet translated, to wit : the
Parvasairhgraha, the Paui§ya, the Amrtamanthana, the story of Parik^it and

the Sauparna. Unfortunately these translations are not available in India ;
at least they were not available to me.

The chief value of the Javanese adaptation for us lies in the fact that
throughout the old Javanese text are scattered Sanskrit quotations, which
appear to have “ served as landmarks for writers and hearers or readers.”
The text prepared by Dr. Juynboll, which is based upon eight manuscripts,
is reputed to be very accurate. But it is admitted that the Sanskrit excerpts
in the extant Javanese manuscripts are extremely corrupt, and it is a {26}
que'stion how far the conjectural restorations by the editor correctly represent
the original readings. It seems to me likely that in his reconstructions
Dr. Juynboll was to a certain extent influenced by the wording of the Vulgate,
which is certainly not always original. To give only one instance. On p. 70,
the Javanese manuscripts read (in the sakuntala episode) :

paripatyadayah sunu, harajnirenugunditali |,
which is corrupt ; it conveys no sense. In the text the editor gives :
pratipadya pada sunur, dharanirenu gunthitah 1 ,

which is nearly the reading of the Calcutta edition (3040). Though the
Javanese manuscripts are palpably corrupt, yet they have preserved the cor-
rect patipatya (for pratipadya of the Vulgate), which is the reading of the
Sarada and K manuscripts of our edition. We have here to thank the Vul-
gate for the pratipadya of Dr. Juynboll’s text !

Notwithstanding, that the period from which this adaptation dates is
comparatively speaking recent, it yet precedes the known date of the manus-
cripts by several centuries and is hence of considerable importance for critical
purposes, as a witness^' independent of and uninfluenced by the main line of
our extant Indian witnesses. Most of the Sanskrit quotations of the Javanese
text can be traced both in the Northern and the Southern recensions, as may
be seen from our Appendix II, at the end of this volume, which contains a
concordance of the Javanese extracts with the Critical Edition, the Calcutta
Edition, and Sastri’s Southern Recension. A few of the quotations are to
be traced to the ” additional ” passages in the Northern manuscripts, but
none to the specific Southern “ additions.” The conclusion is inevitable that
the text of the Sanskrit Adiparvan used by the Javanese writers* must have
belonged to the Northern recension, a conclusion already suggested by the
sequence of the Sakuntala and Yayati episodes, which is the Northern
sequence. This does not necessarily mean that the entire Javanese Bharatam
represents the Northern recension. It is quite likely that some of the parvans
utilized by the Javanese adapters belonged to the Southern recension. The
late Mr. Utgikar^ was inclined to think that the Javanese Viriataparvan

1 Particularly valuable, as the Indian MSS. are mostly conflated.

was of the Southern type. The point will have to be re-examined in the
light of further evidence.* The books were preserved and handed down
separately ; consequently the genesis of each parvan must be investigated
separately.

The Telugu adaptation, the Andhra Bhdratamu} is a metrical epitome
of the Mahabharata, commenced by Nannaya Bhatta, a court poet of the
Eastern Calukya king Vi^uvardhana, who had his capital at Rajahmundry,
on the East Coast of India, and who appears to have ruled between 1022
and 1066.2 The torso of the Telugu rendering left behind by Nannaya,
consisting of a version of the first two parvans and of a part of the third, was
completed many years later by two others poets. Nannaya’s version is valuable
for the light it throws on the condition of the Southern recension — or, strictly
speaking, of the Telugu version — in the eleventh century of the Christian era,
especially in view of {27} the fact that Nannaya has included in his poem an
accurate rendering of the Parvasamgraha, giving the number of slokas in
each of the parvans of his Mahabharata.-' The figure for the stanzas of the
Adi is 9984, which shows that the text used by Nannaya must have been
substantially of the same size as that preserved in the extant Southern
manuscripts. The poet is reported to have followed the original fairly closely.
Notable is consequently his omission of Brahma s visit to Vyasa.^*

Curiously enough, the third old important epitome of the Mahabharata
which we possess, the Bharat amah jari by Ksemendra," belongs to the same
century as the two epitomes mentioned above, since this Kasmiri poet must
also be assigned to the middle of the eleventh century.^* Buhler and Kirste
have given in their Indian Studies, No. 2 (pp. 30 ff.), the results of a careful
comparison of K^mendra’s abstract with the Bombay text of the Maha-
bharata. They show that K^emendra’s text contains both additions and
omissions as compared with the latter." Of the omissions they note : adhy,
4, 24, 45-48, 66, 94, 139, and parts of adhy^ 141 and 197 of the Vulgate.
Of these, adhy. 4 is, as pointed out by Buhler and Kirste, a short introduc-
tory chapter, a variant of adhy. 1 ; adhy. 45-48 are a repetition (with
variations) of adhy. 13-15 ; adhy. 66 is a variant of the preceding adhyaya ;
adhy. 94 is a variant of adhy. 95 (prose), which is selected by Ksemendra

for his purpose finally, stanzas 44 to end of adhy. 197 are a repetition of
a part of adhy. 169. The reason for the omission of these adhyayas is thus
clear : they are mere repetitions. The remaining adhyayas, which are missing
and whose omission Buhler-Kirste could not account for, namely, adhy.
24, 139, and 141 (stanzas 1-19) are also missing in many of our Maha-
bharata manuscripts and have accordingly been omitted in the constituted
text as well. To these must be added the important omission of adhy. 140
of the Vulgate, the Kanikaniti, which is likewise omitted by Ki^emendra, an
omission which appears to have been overlooked by Buhler and Kirste.

The collaborating authors felt justified in concluding that the omissions
and additions “ are just such liberties as any Kavya poet would take in
making a similar abridgement.” They were also of opinion that the original
cannot have differed very essentially from our current texts, that is, the
Vulgate. This is correct up to a certain point. A comparison with the
different versions shows that K^mendra’s version agrees, as was to be ex-
p)ected, most closely with the Sarada. On comparing the divisions of the
Mahjari with those given in Bombay or Calcutta editions of the Mahabharata,
Buhler and Kirste were struck by the fact that the Mmjari divisions
agreed better with the course of the narrative ; and they give examples to
show tiiat the arrangement of the Manjari is more logical. That is quite
natural, because the' old Northern manuscripts, which this edition £28} fol-
lows, fully support the arrangement of the Manjm, whereas the divisions
adopted in the Vulgate are secondary and quite corrupt.

The Persian translation^ of the Mahabharata, made in the reign of
Emperor Akbar, being still unedited, could not be consulted. A very full
account of this rendering has, however, been given by the late Dr. Sir Jivanji
Jamshedji Modi in a paper read before the First Oriental Conference at
Poona in November 1919 and published in the Annals of this Institute.'^ Of
all the Sanskrit works Akbar got translated, the Mahabharata, it appears,
had his most earnest attention.

Several eminent poets and scholars had a hand in translating the Great
Epic of India into Persian. The A'in-e-Akbari gives the following namqs :
Naqib Khan, Maulana ‘ Abdu’l-Qadir Badayuni, and Shaikh Sultan of
Thanesar, to which the Muntakhab-ut-Tawankh adds the names of Mulla
Sheri, and Shaikh Faizi (the brother of Abu’l-Fazl).

ity of contemporaneous chronicles, “ two out of the eighteen sections. Mulla
Sheri and Naqib Khan did a part of the work andi the rest was completed
by Sultan Haji of Thanessar. Shaikh Faizi converted their ‘ rough trans-
lation into elegant prose and verse, but he did not complete more than two
sections.’ Sultan HajI then revised these two sections and verse. Not only
did he do so, but he also revised his work which formed a large share of
the work.” Quoting Badauna, Sir Jivanji continues ; “ The Haji aforesaid

revised these two sections, and as for the omissions which had taken place
in his first edition, those defects he put right, and comparing it word for
word was brought to such a point of perfection that not a fly-mark of the
original was omitted ” ! The preface to this translation was from the pen
of that gifted courtiet of Akbar who has left us such an admirable account
of the Emperor’s reign, Abu’l-Fazl. This Persian version appears to have
been a free rendering of the original, made by Muslim poets and scholars
at the Court of Akbar, to whom the sense of the original had been explained
by Hindu pandits, under the orders of the Emperor.

There are numerous other vernacular abstracts of the Mahabharata
besides the Telugu abstract mentioned above, but most of them are of a
late date. Moreover, they are all far too free to be of much use to us in
reconstructing the text of the Mahabharata.

Besides these abstracts and adaptations, there are parallel versions of
certain passages or even of whole episodes to be met with in other works.
Thus we have a parallel version of the Sakuntala episode (adhyf 62 ff.), in
the PadmapuiSiija of the Yayati episode (adhy. Ti ff.), in the Matsya-
purana of the story of Rum (adhy. 81T.), in the Devibhagavata ; of a
portion of Samudramanthana (adhy. 16 f.), again in the Matsyapurana ; of
a portion of a cosmogonic passage (1. 60. 54 ff.) , in the Raimayana. {29} There

(1. 119. 6) has been cited in the Dhvanyaloka of Anandavardhana, as by
Maharii Vyasa. There are probably many stanzas which remain to be
identified.

It is perhaps well to add in this place that a certain amount of caution
is necessary in making any critical use of citations of stray Mahabharata
stanzas we meet with again in other works. We must, in the first place,
bear in mind that most of the other works have yet tjo be properly edited.
Even in critically edited texts we must take into account the various readings
of the passage in question in the manuscripts collatedi Then in the case of
citations we must allow for failures of memory ; since in ancient times the
stanzas were almost invariably quoted from memory, and the quotation was
never compared with the original. Moreover we must never forget that
probably from time immemorial there have existed local versions of the
Mahabharata. The citations made even by very old writers were from these
local versions. A citation by a writer of the eighth century or even the sixth
century proves nothing for the Ur-Mahabharata, that ideal but impossible
desideratum ; though the citation is far older than our manuscripts, it is
evidence only for the text of the local Mahabharata in the eighth, respectively
the sixth century, notwithstanding that the differences between the various
recensions and versions of the Mahabharata must diminish as we go back
further and further.

EXPLANATION OF THE SIGLA USED IN THE ABOVE PEDIGREE

N .is the ultimate source from* which all versions of the Northern recen-
sion are, directly or indirectly, derived.

V is the lost archetype of the North-Western group, appreciably shorter
than any of the other known versions {textus simplkior),

K is a specific Devanagarl version allied to the Sarada (or Kasmiri)
version (sharply distinguished from other Devanagarl versions), of which
one MS. (Ki) is the direct copy of a Sarada original. The version is largely
contaminated from MSS. of the (central) sub-recension (y), and in part,
also from some unknown Southern sources. Exact provenance of the version
is unknown.

y is the intermediate (inflated) source from which all versions of the
central sub- recension are derived (comprising the Eastern and Western
groups), occupying a position intermediate between the North-Western and
the Southern groups. It contains a considerable number of secondary addi-
tions (including repetitions), as also a very large number of verbal altera-
tions and corruptions.

£ is the lost archetype of the Eastern group (comprising the Nepali,
Maithill and Bengali versions), which is free from the additions and altera-
tions made later in certain Devanagarl MSS.

S is the ultimate source from which all versions of the Southern recension
are, directly or indirectly, derived and which is appreciably longer than N,
and far more elaborate {textus ornatior).

a is the lost archetype of T G, containing a large number of corruptions
and secondary additions, from which M is free.

{31} A CRITICAL SURVEY OF THE RECENSIONS AND THEIR

VERSIONS

THE TWO RECENSIONS

The textual criticism of the Mahabharata proceeds from the incontro-
vertible fact that the text of the Great Epic has been handed down in two
divergent forms, a Northern and a Southern recension, texts typical of the
Aryavarta and the Daksiniapatha. With the realization of this patent con-
trast began the Mahabharata textual criticism nearly fifty years ago, when
Protap Chandra Roy brought out his popular edition of the Mahabharata
(1883-96), under the auspices of the Diatavya Bharata Karyalaya. A brief
account of the controversy to which the publication of this edition of the
Mahabharata gave rise is to be found in Roy’s writings.^ We are told there

that the appearance of his edition was hailed by The Hindu of Madras,
that great bulwark of Dravidian Hinduism, in its issue dated November 22,
1885, with the publication of a bellicose letter, headed “ Another edition of
the Mahabharata'\ purporting to give an account of the proceedings of a
public meeting held at Mayaveram, and containing an outspoken and trench-
ant criticism of Roy’s edition by one Mr. Sreenivasa Sastrial. This worthy
gentleman thought Roy’s edition to be “ sadly defective in the text and that
this defect is detrimental to the religious interests as many portions support-
ing the Advaita and Vdsishta-advaita (sic) doctrines, but unfavourable to
the Sakti worshippers of the North, have been omitted “ It was sad,
therefore,” bemoaned this aggrieved protagonist of the Southern Recension,
“ that the generous gentleman of the North, Protapa Chandra Roy, that
undertook to edit the text, should decline the responsibility of editing the
text as correctly as possible and to compare various manuscripts of the text
from Southern India.” Mr. Sreenivasa Sastrial, it is reported, “ instanced one
or two portions of the Mahdbhdrata, omitted in the Calcutta edition, which
can be proved by indisputable testimony to have existed in the earliest copies
of the work.” One wonders, where and how this estimable gentleman could
have got hold of “ the earliest copies” of the work ; or rather, just how early
were the copies he was referring to. ” Again, many verses ”, complained this
Vaisnava propagandist, ” quoted by the great philosophers of the South in
support of their respective doctrines, are not to be found in Mr. Protapa
Chandra Roy’s edition ” !

The reply of Protap Chandra Roy is not altogether without interest.
He ruefully admitted — what we must even now admit — ^that “ there can be
no edition of the Mahabharata how carefully edited soever, that would please

scholars of every part of India Like other ancient works that have come

down to us from century to century by the method of manual transcription,
large interpolations have been inserted in this great work,^ To settle, at this
fag-end of the nineteenth century, what portions are genuine and what other-
wise, is, except in a very few instances, simply impossible”. With highly
commendable {32} objectivity, Roy then proceeds to enunciate a critical prin-
ciple, which, simple — ^nay, obvious — as it is, many a reputable scholar of India
will find it difficult to appreciate even at the present day. “ / know of no
method ”, wrote Roy, nearly fifty years ago, “ except that of taking that only
fli5 undoubtedly genuine which occurs in all the manuscripts of the East, the
North, the West, and the South ” ! “ As far as my edition is concerned ”,
he continued, “ it is substantially based on that of the Royal Asiatic Society
of Bengal, published about forty-five years ago under the superintendence of
a few learned Pandits of Bengal aided, as I believe, by an English orientalist
of repute. . . . Manuscripts had been procured from all parts of India (the
South unexcepted) and these were carefully collated. Although editedi with

such care, I have not, however, slavishly followed the Society’s edition. I
have compared it carefully with the Mahalrajah of Burdwan's text in the
Bengalee character which was edited with still greater care. About 18 manus-
cripts procured from different parts of India (the South not excepted) were
carefully collated by the Burdwan Pundits before they admitted a single slaka
as genuine. I have very frequently referred to this Burdwan edition also for
checking the Society’s text. . . . Besides the published texts, I have now and
then referred to certain manuscripts. These, however, are all of Bengal. I
am willing to consult any approved manuscript of Southern India.... I
conclude' by repeating that I have ncV complaint against Mr. Sreenivasa. On
the other hand, I freely admit that ah edition like the one projected by him
will be a valuable accession to the libraries of all scholars in India and in
countries out of India. Only the same remarks that he has applied to my
edition will, I am confident, apply tci his, when a Pundit of Northern or
Western India takes it up for notice or review, unless, of course, the learned
Sastrial includes, without critical examiation, every passage bearing on both
the Advmta and the Qdkta worship. I; may assure Mr. Sastrial, however,
that in that case, in his attempt to ple'ase everybody he will, like the painter
in the fable, please none, particularly among readers of judgment an<r critical
discrimination. The fact is, that the divergences of manuscripts are so great
that it is perfectly impossible to produce an edition that could at once satisfy
both Arydvarta and Ddkshindtya'* That edition, alas, so bravely and enthu-
siastically planned by Mr. Sreenivasa Sastrial, to which reference is made
in the above extract, appears never to have seen the interior of any printing
establishment !

I have quoted Protap Chandra Roy in extenso, not merely because of
the interesting sidelight his remarks throw on the question of the different
editions of the Mahabharata, projected or planned, in or just before his time,
but also because of some remarkably sound principles of textual criticism,
briefly, but clearly, propounded therein by him. Protap Chandra Roy had
grasped the Mahabharata Problem in all its essentials. But the time was not
yet ripe for the actual preparation of a critical edition of the Mahabharata.

The differences between the two recensions of the Mahabharata must not
be underrated. Between them there lies, to start with, the irksome barrier
of scripts. It is no exaggeration to say that in India to the Northerners, the
Southern versions written in Southern scripts, ordinarily speaking, were and
are sealed books ; on the other hand, the Southerners, with the possible
exception of a few learned Pandits — who, in fact, after a half-hearted admis-
sion of epic poetry into the realm of literature, cheerfully leave the {33} study
of the bulk of the Mahabharata text to their less gifted brethren — could not
and cannot decipher the Northern scripts, perhaps with the exception of the
Devanagan.

When one laboriously surmounts this initial obstacle, and starts to com-



f^RoLEGOMENA 45

pare the two recensions, one finds, to one’s surprise, that the difference be-
tween them begins, as a matter of fact, with the very division of the Maha-
bharata into its various parvans ! Against the commonly accepted, conven-
tional division of the epic into eighteen books (parvans), there is the Southern
division into twenty-four.^ More surprising still is the fa'ct that the Adi-
parvan itself, the very first book of the epic (with which alone we are, in
fact, here concerned), is sub-divided in Southern manuscripts into three (Adi,
Astika and Sarhbhava), or at least into two (Adi and Sariibhava) separate
major parvans.- Let me emphasize that it is the main large divisions (par-
vans) of the epic I am here referring to, and not the hundred (sub-) parvans
(also called upaparvans or antahparvans). The sub-parvans, in point of fact,
could not come into question here at all. Only the Northern manuscripts, as
a rule, mention in their colophons the names of the sub-parvans ; the South-
ern manuscripts ignore (as far as I can say at present, uniformly) this detail,
very rarely mentioning, in their colophons, the name of the corresponding
sub-parvan.^ We have, therefore, no means of knowing precisely the number
and the limits of the sub-parvans in the Southern scheme, except, of course,
the meagre and ambiguous data of the Parvasarhgraha (Adi 2) itself.^

It is true that the Southern (printed) editions (not excepting Professor
P. P. S. Sastri’s critical edition of the Southern recension, as far as it has
gone) follow the division of the epic uniformly into the conventional eighteen
books.^ But in so far as they do that, the editors, it seems to me, must be
overriding knowingly (but without giving the fact inexpedient prominence)
the clear and unmistakable testimony of Southern manuscripts. They prefer
to sacrifice the Southern manuscript tradition and make their editions har-
monize with the data of the Parvasairhgraha : always a grave blunder ;
because, clearly, the data of the Parvasamgraha can be manipulated far more
easily than those of the manuscripts of the text. The Parvasairhgraha, if

1 See the remarks of Burnell, A Classified Index to the Sanskrit MSS. in the
Palace at Tanjore (London 1879), p. 180; and Winternitz, Ind. Ant. 1898. 122.

In most Southern manuscripts the adhyayas of these different parts of our
Adiparvan are separately numbered. In our critical apparatus a new beginning is
made with (our) adhy. 54 in all Southern MSS. except T^ (which is a misch-
codex), an adhyaya which marks the beginning of our Adivarhsavataraiiaparvan ;
in the colophons of the Southern MSS. it is called the first adhyaya of the Sarii-
bhavaparvan.

^ On the other hand, the Southern MSS. (and in fact even most of the
Northern MSS.) frequently mention the name of the Upakhyana or the name of
the adhyaya ; but even this is never done regularly and systematically.

4 ilie Parvasarhgraha gives only the names of the (100) sub-parvans, and
the contents of the (18) major parvans. But from these data, we cannot say from
what adhyaya to what adhyaya a particular sub-parvan extends.

5 Thus, from these Southern ed., one can never elicit the fact that in the
Southern Recension our Adi is divided into two parts (parvans) and that these
parts have separate numbering of adhyayas !



46


prolegomena


compiled, originally, on the basis of some Northern version,^ would certainly
liOt fit the Southern recension exactly, even when the Parvasamgraha was first
compiled.

{34} The! difference! between the recensions does not end there by any
means, unhappily. The manuscripts of the two recensions show numerous
other, big and small, discrepancies : discrepancies in the spelling of most ordi-
nary words (e.g. N 3^|^or^o5r ), especially of proper names (e.g.

S ii^ the readings of words, phrases, lines, stanzas, groups of

stanzas (passim) ; in the sequence of all these elements (passim) ; in the rela-
tive position of single adhyayas or of a small group of adhyayas (passim) ; in
the relative sequence of whole episodes (e.g. the Sakuntala and Yayati episodes,
Adi, 62 If., and 70 ff.). What is more disconcerting still is that the recensions
show also complicated displacements of portions of adhyayas ; cf., for ex-
ample, the long notes on 1. 106. 11 (p. 474 f.)„ and 1. 144. 20 (p. 624).
Besides these variations in spellings, readings and sequences, there are addi-
tions (or omissions, just as one may happen to regard them) of single lines
(often “ inorganic ”, i.e. such as can be added or omitted with no effect upon
the grammar or continuity), of short passages (passim) and long passages
comprising more than a hundred lines (cf. App. I, No. 55, a passage of 125
lines, setting forth the story of the Kasi princess Amba). These additions
(respectively omissions) and verbal variants sometimes go to such a length
that, at times, there emerges in the end an entirely different story. Compare,
for instance, the two versions of the highly popular episode “ Rape of Subha-
dra” (Subhadraharana) in adhy. 211-212 of our edition and passage No. 114
of App. I (comprising over 460 lines !).- We find that the Southern version
of this story is enriched with many entirely novel and startling features, such
as Arjuna’s masquerading as a peripatetic monk (yati), or his fierce battle
with the Yadava forces led by Viprthu, which he, of course, routs, alone and
unaided, or rather merely with the help of his newly acquired, valiant and
resourceful wife, who acts as his charioteer !

A notable feature of the Southern recension is that it is considerably
longer than the Northern. The constituted text of the Parvasalrhgraha (1. 2.
96) gives 7984 “slckas” (that is, probably, what is technically called
    grant has) as the extent of the Adi :

1 This is! clearly suggested by the fact that the longer Table of Contents (1. 2.
72-233) follows the eighteen-parvan division, which does not harmonize with the
data of the colophons of the Southern MSS., which have the twenty-four-parvan
division.

2 Even the Sakuntala episode gets a somewhat different colouring in the
Southern recension.



J^kOLiiGOMliNA


4 ?


The extent of the Vulgate is computed to be about 8460 “ stanzas'’. The
length of the Southern text of the Adi edited by Professor P. P. S. Sastri is
given by himself as 9984 “ stanzas ”, slightly in excess of his own Parva-
satrhgraha figure (M. 1. 2. 102)., which differs as regards this figure (as in
many other figures in adhy. 2) from our edition. This latter figure (9984)
is perhaps a trifle in excess of the presumable extent of the (normal) Southern
recension, since P. P. S. SastrTs text contains some clear instances of inter-
polation (from Telugu, Tamil and even Northetn sources),^ which need not
necessarily be put down to the already swollen account of the Southern recen-
sion. The difference between the Vulgate and Sastri’s text is about 1524
” stanzas ”. But even the common Southern text, which will be appreciably
shorter than SastrTs, may confidently be £35} reckoned to contain approxi-
mately 1300 “slokas” (i.e. granthas) more than the longest Northern version
of the Adi !

This excess in the Southern recension is not due to the addition of any
single lengthy passage or just a few of such passages even, though there are
undoubtedly among them some fairly long passages. The excess is due to
additions, large and small, distributed almost evenly throughout the parvan.

Not only is the Southern text thus appreciably longer than the other,
the story itself of the Southern recension, as compared with that of the
Northern, is, owing to many of these additions, much richer in details, leav-
ing little or nothing to the imagination of the reader or the hearer. Thus, for
example, in the. Northern recension, the father of Satyavati or Matsyagandha
(Vyasa’s own mother) is a nameless king of fisher- folk, making a living, on
the banks of the Yamuna, by fishing. This is rather unsatisfactory. That
the name of Matsyagandlia’s father — he is really only her foster father —
according to the fable — should not have been preserved, seems a shocking
piece of negligence on the part of the historian, that is, the story-teller, since
history as it is narrated (as has been well said) is a kind of roman a these.
The Southern recension here comes to our help. It has carefully procured
the nahic of the foster-father of Kali Matsyagandha alias Satyavati : it was
Uccaihsravas (a high-sounding Aryan name), if we are to believe the South-
ern recension. He was named after the great snow-white Stallion of the
Gods, which came out of the ocean when it was being churned for Ambrosia
by the Gods and the Titans.

Then again, the Purohita sent by the Yadavas to the forest retreat of
Pajiiidu in the Himalayas was a Kasyapa. He was required, of course, to
perform all the little Aryan rites for the Papdavas. Moreover, it is best that
kings always have their Riajaguru by their side, to advise and help them on
all occasions. The Nothem recension does not even tell us that the Yadavas

1 For instance the iSvetaki episdde (M. 1. 214, 29-98H» which, in the form
printed there, is missing in all MSS. of his own critical apparatus !



48


J’kOLEGOMENA


had sent any Purohita at all to Paidu'sl hermitage ; so there, no question of
his name arises.

But a really illuminating instance of the richness of information fur-
nished by the Southern recension is supplied by an “ additional ” adhyaya’
in this recension, which gives us some new and interesting chrmological de-
tails about the Paindavas themselves. These details disperse that haze of un-
certainty and vagueness which overspreads the ordinary account.

The Southern recension informs us that when the P^nidavas first arriv-
ed at the Court of Hastinapura from the forest retreat, after the death of
their father, Yudhi§thira was exactly slixteen years old, Bhima fifteen, Arjuna
fourteen, the twins thirteen. We are further told exactly how long the
P^^iTicJu brothers stayed at the Kaurava Court, in the Lac House (Jatug^'ha),
in Ekacakra, at the Court of the Paficala King, then again at the Kaurava
Court, then in Indraprastha, and so on. Yudhi§thira died at the ripe old
age of 108, which is a mystic number. Arjuna was younger than Kr$na by
three months, which was also exactly the difference between the' ages of Kr?na
and Balarama. And so on and so forth. Almost all these useful details are
lacking in the Northern recension, and I doubt whether they can even be
reconstructed from the meagre data of this recension on the^ points.

{36} The Southern recension impresses us thus by its prmsuM, schema-
tization, and thoroughly practical outlook. Q)mpared with it, the Northern
recension is distinctly vague, unsystematic, sometimes even inconsequent, fnorc
like a story rather naively narrated, as we find in actual experience.

The Southern recension of the Adi at least is thus not merely longer, but
also fuller, more exuberent, more ornate than the Northern. It may there-
fore be fitly styled, in relation to the Northern, the iextus ornatior.

Notwithstanding these and other discrepancies, there persists through-
out, between the recensions, a distinct and undeniable family resemblance,
and there cannot be the slightest doubt that they both spring from a com-
mon source, albeit a distant and somewhat nebulous source. Follow the
course of these divergent streams as far back as one will, the elusive source
seems to recede still further and lose itself in the mists of antiquity.

It was pointed out above that a noteworthy feature of the Southern re-
cension was that it was appreciably longer than the Northern. The charac-
ter of the principal Additions may be seen from the following list of some of
the more important and lengthy passages peculiar to the Southern recension,

The discrepancies between the two recensions, as already observed, are
so numerous and so multifarious, that any attempt to enumerate and classify
them must remain incomplete and unsatisfactory. Nevertheless it may be
useful to begin a cursory survey of the divergences, noting at the same time
the typical characteristics of the Southern additions ”, characteristics which
recur with fair frequency in the Adi, and which are likely to reappear in
other parvans. These notes may prove useful for distinguishing between
the different ** hands ” which haVe been at work in shaping this imposing
monument of Indian antiquity, when the entire text has been treated in the
manner proposed here, and we have sufficient data for undertaking a minute
and systematic study of the variations and evaluating them.

(b) Important variants, which make a considerable difference in the
sense, and of which the critique must take account. Of such variants, rela-
tively speaking, there are only a few ; e. g. discrepant divisions of the epic
into parvans and adhyayas ; variants of the titles of the sub-parvans (e. g.
S 3I3t3^513 : N g3?3R33), ^ numbers of adhyayaS and ^Idcas in
the Parvasairhgraha (the figures for slokas differ, at times, by thousands).

— An exatnple of a different character from another part of the Adi is the
variant jjrj in the stanzas which refer to the duration of Arjuna’s
exile. According to the Northern recension it is thirteen yeafs ; according to
the Southern, only thirteen months ! Cf. 1 . 204. 28. ^ ^ g[j^ ( S%

JfraRC., we# etc. ) ^( S WT 205. 30 # ( S weiW,

we#,WeR;. ^ ).* — Then we have in 1. 3. 21 the variant How

was the infinitive really made ? — And so on.

2. Larger variations between continuous passages, as a whole, the total
   extent remaining approximately the same.

We find them (a) mostly in the long lists of names : e. g. of the hundred
sons of Dhrtara^tra (adhy. 108),, of ancient kings ( 1 . 1 . 166 ff.), or serpents
( 1 . 52. 5ff.), of kings present at Draupadi’s svayalmvara (adhy. 177) ; but
(b) also when there are transpositions of whole or parts of adhyayas (e. g.
the prose genealogy, adhy. 90) ; or again (c) when there is free paraphrase
of a passage (passim).

3. Expansion of the text in S without materially altering the nature of
   the contents or the course of the narrative.

(<i) By multiplication of the items of a list. For instance :

In adhy. 20, S (with K 4 marg. Dn marg.) adds seven lines of praise
to an existing hymn addressed to Garuda. In these lines, Garueja

is identified, in turn, with all the principal gods, and with everything that is
pre-eminent in the world :

In adhy. 64, S (with K 4 Dn D^.g) gives an additional short list of sciences

of items in Subhadra's dowry, which, taken along with what has gone be-

example :

in a^y. 155 and in App. I, No. 79 (after adhy. 128) ;


(ii) the theme of the amuang experience of a maiden, who, on praying to
Mahadeva for one husband five times, was granted, as a boon, five husbands at one
time— a story which seems to have been very popular in the South— is used, with

variation, in S, no less than three times in the course of the Adi ; cf. adhy. 157, 189
and passage No. 100 (of App. I)

(iii) account of the tragi-oomic experiences of the Ka^i princess Amba, who
was passed on in turn by Bhi§ma to iSalva and Salva to Bhi§ma, repeatedly, like a
shuttle-cock, a story which is really the subject-matter of the Ambopakhyana in Ud-
yoga 173 ff. (Bom. [40] ed.), apparently a favourite piece, is anticipated in
passage No. 55 of App. I (cf. adhy. 96) and forms a bulky addition of 125 lines !

(iv) the future of the royal family, which is the subjectrmatter of the addi-
tional dialogue between Bhi'§ma and his step-mother, Satyavatl, in S, in passage
No. 57 (of App. I) is only a continuaition and repetition (with v. 1.) of the dis-
course between the same parties in adhy. 99.

(v) Surya’s warning to Karna about the designs of India to supplicate Kanja
in the disguise of a Brahman, in passage No. 60 of App. I, which is an anticipation
of the story told in Aranya 300 (Bom. ed.).

(c) Additions in S, due to the explicit mention of the observance of the
correct and complete Brahmanic ritual and ceremonial on the proper oc-
casions. Thus, in adhy. 68, at the birth of Bharata :

625* f^i: I

In adhy. 92, at the birth of i^aimtanu :

(d) Expansion in S of existing scenes by the addition of speeches or

detailed descriptions and by other digressions. Examples :

[41] (i) in App. I, No. 9, in the account of the churning of the ocean

(samudramanthana), we are incidentally told of the drinking of poison by Siva, which
had exuded from the mouth of Vasuki during the churning ;

(ii) in 998*, we have nine additional lines depicting the humiliating treat-
ment meted out to Bhi^ma at the court of the king of Ka^i, during the Svayaihvara
of his daughters ;

(iii) passage No. 59 (of App. I) depicts the persuasion of the shy and re-
luctant Kunti by Surya for intercourse, by alternate threats and promises, like a
real Don Juan ;

(iv) in passages No. 68-69, the Southern recension has tried to develop a very
pathetic scene indeed, depicting the death of the father of the heroes, P^du : an
incident which must have been considered as deserving fuller and more sympatlie-
tic treatment than the perfunctory notice we find preserved in the Northern re-
cension. At the sight of the corpse of her husband, Kunti falls to the ground in a
swoon, like a felled tree. Then the five brothers come up in a single file, and in
the order of their ages, and recite their little mournful dirges : Yudhi^thira gets
8 lines, Bhima 7, Arjuna 4, the twins' (in chorus) only 3 lines together.^ Then
follow long-winded farewell orations by Kunti, Madri and the reist of the company,
which are followed by a touching scene describing Aladri mounting the funeral
pyre ;

(v) passage No. 78 gives, in 119 lines, the details of a fight, which, in the
Northern recension, at least originally, is cfisposed of in two lines ! The latter I
consider adequate treatment, taking everything into consideration ;

(vi) passage No. 93 is a Southern addition of 37 lines giving fuller details of
the titanic struggle between Bhima and the cannibal Baka ;

(vii) 1737* adds a hymn (in Trii§trA)h metre and pseudo-vedic style) by Va-
si§tha, addressed to Surya, when Vaa^ha presents himself before that luminary
on behalf of Samvaraija ;

(viii) 1828* ff. describe in turn the discomfiture of each of the suitors for the
hand of Draupadi ;

(ix) pasisages No. 100-101 add to the existing stock two new anecdotes — al-
ternative explanations — ^narrated by Vyasa to prove to Drupada and his son, that

^This schematic treatment perhaps betrays the hand of the interpolator more
dearly than anything else.

the polyandrous marriage proposed by Yudhi^thira, though apparently immoral and
illegal, is a most righteous and necessary union, being pre-ordained by the gods
themselves for the accomplishment of their cosmic plans : these are the well-known
legends of Najayani and Bhauma^vi ;

(x) passage No. 106 gives an almost complete inventory of the presents Dru-
pada gave to the PSndu brothers when they left with Draupadi, for the Kaurava
Court, at the invitation of Dhrtar^tra. The Northern recension ignores this huge
mass of presents completely !

(xi) passage No. 110 is a farewell scene containing short orations by Kr^na,
Yudhi^thira and Kuntl, when Kr§iia sets out for Dvaraka ;

£42} ( xii) passage No. 112 contains the farewell of Arjuna to Citr^gac^,

telling her that she must not give way to sorrow in his absence, as they would meet
again vsoon at the Rajasuya, which is going to be performed by Yudhi^fhira : a pro-
phetic utterance ! And so on and so forth.

(e) Additions of little ethical, moral and sententious maxims, to which
S, permeated as it is by a conscious didactic purpose, is particularly partial.
We meet with the same old proverbs over and over again in S :

Made apparently with the object of correcting the laxity of sexual re-
lations implied in the old narrative. In adhy. 67, the royal Purohita, a handy
person, quickly but surely and secretly, performed the marriage of I>ub?anta
and Sakuntala, in order to legitimize Bharata, the eponymous ancestor of the
Bharatas, who has given his name to the country of his birth and to the
Great Epic of India, altogether an important personage in ancient Indian
history :

In adhy. 77, the marriage of Yayati and iSarmi^fha is celebrated semi-
secretly, in a secluded comer of the Asoka grove, in the palace grounds, with
the usual baksheesh to the Brahmins, in the presence of counsellors, chap-
lains, priests and so on, but unknown to Devayam ! All this was done to
legitimize Puru, the eponymous ancestor of the Pauravas :

In passage No. 114 of App. I, Subhadra and Arjuna were likewise secret-
ly and hastily married in the presence of gods, r§is, and elders, while Bala-
rdma was away jrom the scene, to legitimize Abhimanyu (the father of tlie
famous Parifc§it and grandfather of Janamejaya, to whom the epic was nar-
rated). Cf. lines 281-286 of the passage :

Most Grantha manuscripts (G^.^ of our critical apparatus : ^ and

were secretly but regularly married. Cf. passage No. 36 of App. I, which is
a somewhat lengthy passage describing with circumstantial detail the nup-
tial ceremony at which the ancestors of both the bride and the bridegroom
are invoked, all the details of the regular Hindu marital rite are scrupulously
gone through, and the marriage is solemnized in the presence of Vasi§tha,
Yajfiavalkya and other great Ri§is living in the Naimi^ forest !

5. Additions in S, due to the 0mg out of lacunae {real or imaginary) .

Examples of such additions are :

482* whidi gives a summary of the last five parvans of our Mahabharata
text, and passage No. 79 (of App, I) giving an account of Drupada's birth.
It appears, from the latter account, that Drupada was bom in the sa!me mira-
culous way as two of his contemporaries Drooa a!nd Krpa, due to the per-
turbation of his father at the sight of a beautiful Apsaras. Ascetics invo-
luntarily emitting semen at the sight of heavenly nymphs, broad-hipped, fat-
breasted, fair-clad, pleasure-fraught, and the miraculous germination of the
semen into human beings, is the regular Puilajoic appatatusJ for the genera'-
tion, of the great men of the past, about wHose birth nothing exciting was
specially known to the chronicler.

{45} 6. Multiplication of fights and battle-scenes,

I have drawn attention above to the expansion of the description of a
battle (in which the Kurus and the Paji^lus calpture Drupada), and of a fight
(betweai Bhima and Baka).^ Analogous to it is a battle scene described in


^ App, I, Nos. 78 and 92-93 respectively.



PROLEGOMENA


59


an additiofial adhyaya in the Southern recension (App. I, No. 1!03). This
stages a little war between the cousins, a miniature replica of the Great War
to colne. Here also Kurus plan the destruction of the PiiOKjavas, who are re-
siding in Kampilya as the guests of Drupada. A regular council of war is
held, in which iSakuni and Karina advocate hostilities, while the nameless &yn
of Solmadatta counsels peace and conciliation. The bellicose party has the
upper hand in the council chamber. The Kuru army matches against the
Paodavas with their allies, the P^calas. The Kaurava forces are, of course,
easily repulsed. No great damage is done. The status quo is immediately
restored : things go on just the same as before, as though no battle had ever
taken place. There is also no other reference to this battle in the whole of
the Mahabharata, The present parvan does not offer much scope for the
full development of this tendency. We shall probably meet with it again in
the battle-books (6-9).

7. Omissions in S, as compared with N.

These are quite numerous and scattered almost evenly over the whole
parvan, but short and contextually unimportant, as a rule. An exception is
the somewhat lengthy iSvetaki episode (App. I, No. 118). Since, on the one
hand, all reference to the episode is missing in the whole of the Malayalam
version, as also in some manuscripts of each of the reimaining two versions
(T G) of the Southern recension, while, on the other hand, those T G manus-
cripts that do contain some mention of it insert a variant version at an entire-
ly different place, therefore the episode may legitimately be considered a
Northern interpolation which has insinuated its way, by conflation, into some
Southern manuscripts. It is a story in true Purple style. King iSvetaki sac-
rificed with such phenomenal zeal ahd keenness that his priests, in the end,
refuse to sacrifice any more ! Svetaki practised penance on the Himalayas
with the object of making Rudra his satrificial priest. Rudra, however, ex-
cused himself, asking iSvetaki to apply to Durvasas, who was his part-incarna-
tion (amsa). Durvasas completed the sacrifice, and Svetaki poured libations
of clarified butter into the fire for twelve years continuously. As a result,
Agni had a severe attack of indigestion ! He refused after that every offer-
ing, and became enfeebled. At Brahnra's direction, he set the Khl^ijdava
forest on fire, ahd tried his best to bum the forest down ; but the denizens of
the forest put the fire out, over and over again. He reported his discom-
fiture to Brahma, who then asked him to betake himself to Arjuna and
Kr5|i>a, the part incarnations of Nara and Namyana, with whose help alone
Agni would be in a position to bum the KhaOdava forest.

It diould be made clear that the variants and passages cited here are
merely by way af illustration, and comprise only a small fraction of the total
number of deviations.

The presence of an astonishingly large number of additions, some of
which are undoubtedly late and spurious, should not be allowed to impair

PROLEGOMENA


our appreciation of some real merits of the Southern recension. It would be,
in fact, a grievous error to ignore on that account the Southern recension or
underestimate its value. This recension is an {46} indispensable aid for con-
trolling the deviations of the Northern recension, both in point of readings
and sequence. In comparison with y it has unquestionably preserved a very
large number of original readings, proved by actual agreements between S
and V, as well as by their intrinsic merits. The superiority of the Southern
recension in comparision to the Vulgate may be said to be quite evident. It
may, however, quite easily happen that in a particular instance, the whole of
the Northern recension is corrupt, and the true reading is preserved only in
the Southern recension.^ An instance of this is 1. 214. 5. The Vulgate reads
(B. 1. 222. 5) :

Nilakaijtha’s gloss is ; qt 3?^^ 1 I

The stanza has been translated by Manmath Nath Dutta as follows :
“ Having obtained him as their king, they obtained a monarch who was de-
voted to the study of the Vedas, who was a performer of great sacrifices, and
who was the protector of all good works.” Protap Chandra Roy's transla-
tion reads similarly : And the subjects having obtained Yudhisthira as their
king, obtained in him one that was devoted to the study of the Vedas, one
that was a performer of great sacrificed, and one that was the protector of all
good people. ”

But the translations of both these scholars are generally free and arbi-
trary. As it stands, the stanza can be translated only as follows :

“They, (i.e. the people) obtain for a king, one who studied Brahma
(para)y employed the Vedas in a great sacrifice, and protected the blessed
words.”

This pedestrian stanza will satisfy most people as it has satisfied a long
succession of critics, commentators and translators in the past. About it one
can only say that there are worse dtanzas in the Mahabharata. Only a reader
endowed with a fine sensibility and critical acumen will feel that there is
something amiss here. We are face -to face with the danger of acquiescing
in a seinse which might satisfy us, but which would not have satisfied the an-
cient writer. The Northern variants do not offer much help ; even the ^Srada
and K manuscripts have Substantially the same readings. It would, conse-
quently, not be easy to reconstruct from this sad wreck of a Dipaka, the epi-
grammatic original, which is preserved intact only in the Southern recension,
which the constituted text here follows (1. 214. 5) :

No glosses, translations, exegetical notes, and such other accessories are
necessary for the elucidation of this stanza ; for it is self-luminuous. The
correctness of the Southern reading is confirmed by the very next stanza (1.
214. 6), which is also an epigrammatic period of the same type :





II


It should thus seem that the infidelities of the Southern recension are
confined mainly to a tendency to inflation and elaboration. In parts unaffect-
ed by this tendency, £47} it is likely to prove, on the whole, purer, more con-
servative and more archaic than even the best Northern version. The
Southern variants, therefore, deserve the closest attention and most sympa-
thetic study.

After this brief survey of the interrelationship between the two recensions,
we shall proceed to the consideration of the various provincial versions, into
which each of the recensions breaks up.


CHARACTER AND MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE VERSIONS AND THEIR

MANUSCRIPTS

THE ARCHETYPE v
The §dradd Version.

The archetype v comprises the two versions : Sarada and K

The iSarada version is represented in our critical apparatus by the frag-
mentary codex Sj, belonging to the Bombay Government Collection (No. 159
of 1875-76), which sefems to be the only extant genuine representative of the
old version of KasmTr. The manuscript, which is undated, may be three to
four centuries old. For reasons which will appear in the sequel, I have made
the Sarada version the norm to follow.

The text of the Adi (as of other parvans of the Mahabharata) according
to the different printed editions, as is well-knowp, varies considerably, not
merely a's regards the readings, but also as regards; the extent. The length
of the Adi, according to the Calcutta edition, as already observed, is esti-
mated to be about 8460 “stanzas”, of the Bombay edition, 8620,^ of the
Madras edition (i.e. Sastri’s Southern Recension) 9984 (according to
Sastri’s data), of the Kumbhakonam edition 10889.^ Now, in a statement
following the colophon (or forming part of the long colophon) of our &rada
manuscript, the length of its text is given as 7984 in a stanza cited from the


^ This is the figure given in Lele’s edition of the text with Marathi transla-
tion (Wai, Saka 1818).

PROLEGOMENA


Parvasaimgraha ; cf. the accompanying facsimile of fol. 155 a of the Sarada
codex. To judge by the amount of textual matter which an average folio of
the fragmentary iSarada codex holds, this estimate of its extent appears to be
approximately correct.* Assuming then that to be the length of the Sarada
Version, it becomes the shortest known version of the Adi, and may, there-
fore, appropriately be called the textus simplicior.

While it is the shortest extant version, it is a demonstrable fact that it
contains relatively little matter that is not found, at the same time, in all
other versions of both recendons. It is clear, therefore, that it must contain,
relatively, less spurious matter than any other known version. That is pre-
cisely the main reason why it is! taken as the norm for this edition.

Since our codex (i§i) is fragmentary, it must !be considered a piece of
singularly good fortune that there has been preserved at least one nearly com-
plete Devanagari manuscript of the Adi. namely, Indial Office No. 2137, tliat
may, as will presently be shown, be used, without hesitation, to supplement
the missing portions, since it undoubtedly is a moderately trustworthy,
though comparatively late and slightly contaminated and incorrect transcript
of a Sarada exemplar.

m Further particulars of the Sarada version will be found under the
account of the ‘‘ K '' version.

The accompanying facsimile of a page of the Saradia codex (fol. 155a)
contains the end of the Adi and the beginning of the* Sabha. The Parvasarh-
graha stanza, mentioned above, giving the extent of the Adi, will be* found
in lines 2-3 of the facsimile.


The “X” Version.

This version, as already explained, is a specific Devanagari version,
closely akin to the iSarada version and clearly differentiated from the (so-
called) Devanagari version.

The affinity of the manuscripts comprising this version is illustrated by
the following concordant readings, selected at random. The references are to

It was remarked above that Kj ( = India Office 2137) was a manuscript

Ki may be regarded as a copy of some iSarada original. The KaiSmiif diarac-

These concordances are sufficient for postulating the archetype v, com-
prising the versions !§aradia and K, a hypothesis which will be confirmed by
further agreements which are mentioned below.

The K version, though comprising manuscripts akin to each other and
clearly distinguishable from those of the Devanagari version, is by no means—
as is natural— quite homogeneous. Only Ko.i represent the version K in a
comparatively pure form, while the £51} remaining manuscripts of the group
(i.e. K 2 -^) are really nothing more than misch-codices, being conflated either
with y or with S. On the other hand, just owing to this conflation, some of
the other composite Devanagari manuscripts (particularly D 2 . 5 ) have so many
features in common with K, that they may as well be separated from D and
classed under K.

The contamination of with y is illustrated by the following passages :
No. 14 of App. I (found in K4 marg., and R Vj B D ) ; No. 41 (in K3.4 and
^^ 2.3 Vi B D except Dg) ; No. 42-43 (in K 3.4 and Vi B D except D 5 ). K 4
includes passage No. 61 (of App. I) and 1131*, like N B D. The contami-
natiop of K 2 _ 4 ,« with y is illustrated by 116*, 119*, 122*, 124*, 125*, 128*,
132*, 137*, 139*, 142*, 143*, 144*, 145*, 151*, 157*, 160*, 162*, 166*, 167*,
168*, 172*, 173*, 189*, 190*, 191*, 221*, 228*, 245*, 281*, 305*, 354*,

372*, 405*, 416*, 417*, 438*, 487*, 490*, 523*, 536*, 564*, 692*, 694*,

824*, 1000*, 1035*, etc., etc.

The contamination of K 4 _e with S is exemplified by the following among
other facts, Kg.g contain 22*, ^ 25*, K 4 49*, K 4 (suppl. fol.) passage No. 55

(125 lines) and No. IDO (118 lines), of App. I. : all of these are Southern

passages.

K 4 _^, moreover, contain the Brahma episode*^ in adhy. 1 (a slippery pass-
age, which migrates from place to place), while K 4.6 have found place even
for the venerable elephant-headed Gainesa, who is unquestionably a late Nor-
thern intruder. In K 4 these interpolations are written out on separate folios
(called here ) , and inserted at appropriate places, which shows the in-
terpolations on the high road to recognition as genuine parts of the Maha-
bharata.

Important omissions which distinguish v (really only t§i Ko-^) from all
other manuscripts are these :

(i) the adhyaya giving a naive account of the' birth of Dublialia (Bom.
adhy. 116), which uncommonly looksf like being an afterthought (App. I,
No. 63) ;

(ii) a passage of about 25 lines describing how Drama’s son A^vatthaman
is given flour mixed with water, which he drinks in the belief that it is milk
(App. I, No. 75);

^ See notes on passage No. 1 of App. I.



PROLEGOMENA


67


(iii) an adhy. (Bolm. adhy. 139), in which there is an incidental allusion
to the installation of Yudhii^thira as Yuvaraja,^ and which is repetitious and
incoherent (App. I, No. 80) ;

(iv) the so-called polity of Ka|ni(ih)ka, Kaii}i(!h)kaniti (Bom. adhy.
140), which is a replica (naturally with many additions, omissions and vari-
ant readings) of the advice given by Bharadvaja (apparently a gotra name
of this very individual) to tSatrumjaya, and duly communicated by Bhi§ma to
Yudhisthira in the tSanti (App. I, No. 811) ;

(v) the crossing of the Ganges by the Painidavas (Bom. adhy. 149), a
superfluous adhyiaya, which only serves to confound the already confused
geography of the narrative (App. I, No. 85).

These five passages are found in all manuscripts collated except Ka-^,
but it is worthy of note that even apart from their omission in v the docu-
mentary evidence with regard to at least two of them, is confused and
unsatisfactory. Nq. v (crossing of the {52} Ganges) is inserted in different
groups of manuscripts at different points of the text. In No. iv (Ka(nikaniti),
on the other hand, most of the Southern manuscripts repeat, after the' inter-
polation, the imm^iately preceding portion of the original, apparently in
order to restore the context broken by the intrusion of extraneous matter.^

Of important additions in v, I can recall only one, that of an adhyaya
of 42 lines, at the very end of the Adi (added probably as an Appendix),
which is a variant, abbreviated version of the Svetaki interpolation. It is
found only in !§i Kq 1.4 and therefore cannot even be said to be characteristic
of the whole of v (App. I, No. 121). Instances of small additions are
Nos. 349*, 449*, 451*, 516*, 565*, etc. etc. found in K with or without some
Devanagari manuscripts ; while 969*, 1855*, 2077*, etc., are found in iSj K,
with or without some! Devanagari manuscripts : all these passages are miss-
ing in B. S.

That §1 and K are not identical but independent (though allied) sources,
may be concluded, for example, from 449*, 452*, 491*, 492*, 516*, 565*,
750*, 866 * etc., which are found inserted in some cr all manuscripts of the
K version, but which are conspicuous/ by their absence in iSi (sometimes
with Ki).

It was remarked above that v is the shortest of the extant versions of
the Adi. Let us examine, without bias, this feature of v. Those passages
that are lacking in v in comparison with the other versions, cannot all be
omissions in v whether accidental or intentional.


1 Cf. remarks of Holtzmann, Da$ Mahabhmata, 2. 33.

* The reasoln of these repetitions has been explained by Jacobi, Das Rama-
  yotya, p. 34, with reference to the Ramayaaja. The same explanation is applicable
  here, mutatis mutandis.

PROLEGOMENA


They cannot be intentional omissions, notwithstanding that these missing
passages are mostly of inferior character, intrinsically worthless, repetitious,
superfluous, or finally such as scholars have already (even before the discovery
of this version) marked as likely interpolations.^ For, this Saradia (KaSmiri)
version of the Adi is not a!n abstract or an adaptation. It claims to be the
unabridged text itself, in all its fullness, and I see no suffllcient reason to
doubt the a priori presumption that it is riot an abridged version.

The explanation that primarily with the very object of excising what
seems to us to be superfluous or repetitious matter, and abridgement might
have been intentionally made in the past by some Kasmiri redactor or a
syndicate of redactors, would be a grotesque distortion of Indian literary
and religious tradition. No one in the past found the epic text too long.
Far from it. It was perhaps not long enough.

Taking away something from the received text of the Mahabharata and
passing it off as the original work is a thing categorically different from
adding something to it. To add small details here and there, embellishing
and amplifying the original, would be merely a gentle and lowly service
ad mujorem glorui\m dei. Even long pieces may sometimes be added, if
they are actually found in other Mahabharata manuscripts ; and occasionally,
even if they are not found in the current manuscripts, provided there is at
least oral tradition to support their claims.

£53} No doubt the received text contained difficulties and obscurities
and repetitions. But they would be merely due to corruptions of the text ;
the difficulties could be solved and the purpose of the repetitions explained by
a really learned Pandit, who knows and understands everything.

That the omisiSions cannot be the result of a preconceived plan to shorten
or to improve the text, follows further from two other facts : firstly, enough
digressions and superfluities still remain in v, which would have all been
swept away in pursuance of the alleged plan ; an.d, secondly, v has its own
interpolations, albeit they are few in number and short in extent, such
as 349* (in K Da 451* (K D 2 ), 516* (K except Dn D,).,

565* (K except KJ, 1499* (S^ K D,), 1735* (S, only), 1855*
(§1 K Ni), 2077* (.§i K except and 3 Vi D^-s), etc.

While these so-called “omissions” cannot be all intentional, they can
also not be all accidental. The text is continuous and complete in itself.
It has no apparent lacunaq, as it surely would have had, if the omissions
had been due to fortuitous less or destruction of some intermediate folios of
a parent manuscript.


1 Cf. Holtzmann, Das Mahabharata, 2. 33, oin adhy. 139 of the Vulgate ;
or the surmises of various scholars regarding the Gaajesa episode (for literature
see the next footnote).



PROLEGOMENA


69

It may further be pointed out that many of the a^pparent ‘‘ omissions ”
of V, in relation to y or the Vulgate (i.e. Nilakaiptha’s text) are confirmed
by the rival recension, the Southern recension ; e.g. the Gape^ episode
(App. I, No. 1), or the anticipation of the list of the hundred sons of
Dhrtara^trai (No. 41), or again the story of the birth of Abhimanyu (No. 42),
or finally the anticipation of the story of the birth of Kama (No. 43) in
the Saniibhavaparvan. These passages ate omitted in S no less than in K.

In these instances, moreover, the intrinsic probability is wholly on the
side of those manuscripts that lack these accretions. It is unnecessary to
dilate on the Ga^jiesa episode, which, on the face of it, is a later addition,
and which has been dealt with so often by different critics.^ As for the
two passages, Nos. 42-43 of App. I., it is sufficient to observe that the adhyaya
in which they occur is meant to be a mere list of the dramatis personae, in
which each aictor in the great drama is identified as the incarnation of some
god, goddess, or titan, taking this or that part in one momentous phase of
an all-embracing cosmic movement. The adhyaya being originally a mere
(metrical) list (as it is in the constituted text and the Southern recension), ^
such storid^ as the account of the birth of Abhimanyu and Kariija are wholly
out place here, and could not possibly have belonged to the original
scheme of the adhyaya. The contrslry supposition only stultifies the original
writer, making him out to be an irresponsible lunatic, scarcely a desirable
conclusion from the orthodox view-point.

Likewise many of the apparent omissions in v in relation to the Southern
recension are confirmed by otlier Northern versions ; e.g. the anticipation
of the birth of Kr§na and Dhr^tadyumna (App. I, No. 79), or the Nalayani
episode (No. lOO), or the account of a battle between the Kauravas and
the Pandavais! (No. 103), which are peculiar to S. In other words, these
“ omissions ” are documented by the whole of N.

£54} One notable feature of v to which I must now draw attention is its
frequent agreement with S against y, especially in’ the matter of isolated and
even unimportant readings, scattered throughout this parvan. I shall cite
a few (out of the hundreds of possible) instahce^ to exemplify this interesting
and important characteristic of v. The readings of conflated manuscripts
which serve only to confuse the issue, have been ignored ; the references are,
as usual, to the adhyayal and sloka.

     Such extensive agreements in petty verbal details must nea‘ssarily be,
     in the main, an original inheritance, and could never be, in their totality, the
     result of contamination or conflation, as one may vaguely imagine they are
     because to acheive them would necessitate more expenditure of energy than
     an ancient Indian redactor or reciter or commentator of the epic would
     bargain Tor. And even if one or the other of them had the requisite amount
     £55} of energy to use in this way, it would appear to him td be a ludicrous
     waste o^ it. We in the present century are apt to get nervous and irritable
     over misprints and varriae lectiones. But an ancient Indian scribe, redactor

or even commentator, not to speak of the common r^iter {pathaka)-A{ I
read aright Indian literary history— was not perturbed in the least by a little
difference in wording or in sequence, especially if -the variant did not give
an appreciably better or appreciably worse sense. The enormous and com-
plicated critical apparatus assembled here, moreover, can leave us in no
doubt as to the attitude of the custodians of the epic tradition towards
paltry verbal details : it was that of total indifference.

Addition or omission of passages is, I naay add, a variation of an entirely
different order. If a reciter or commentator came across, in another manus-
cript, an additional passage, there was every chance of his copying it down
somewhere, either in the margin of his own copy, or on a supplementary
folio ; for there would be,, in his mind, always present the possibility that
the passage in question was some part of the original that his own manus-
cript had unaccountably lost. How el^» forsooth, could the passage get
into the other manuscript?

In my opinion, therefore, this fact of the concord between v and S in
small details, coupled with the almost entire lack of agreement as regards
the additions peculiar to v or S, is the strongest argument imaginable for the
indep^.ndence of these two versions, and consequently for the primitive char-
acter of their concordant readings. It is needless to point out that this is a
factor of supreme importance for the reconstruction of the original.

The text of v is throughout of such a character as to inspire confidence. Its
conservatism is proved by its preserving archaisms and the lectio difficilior
1. 2. 144;3^^i 1. 2. 177, 189 ; “frankly” 1. 10. 6;

1. 98. 13 ; 1. 98. 18), often in a corrupt form, while other manus-

cripts have discarded them in favour of modem forms or easy paraphrases.
It is well known that, for purposes of textual reconstruction, the mechanical
corruptions of a stupid but faithful copyist are to be preferred to the intel-
ligent copying of a less faithful one.

Again, v is often the only version that has preserved the correct reading :
e.g. 1. 2. 102 :

where the Vulgate version reads (1.3.138 f.):

submerged in the ocean of the dice-play. The correctness of the text reading,
which is based on that of K, is proved by a stan 2 a in the Sabha (B. 2. 72.

Obviously, the stumbling block was apcT^ of the constituted text, which
is a krt. diff , ; here it means ‘‘ forgotten ", a meaning cited in our dictionaries
g^erally as an uncommon meaning given only by Indian lexicographers !
Unless one here assumes v to be original, it is impossible to explain this
divergence of v, y and S, both of which give a possible though weak sense.

An unbiassed comparative survey of the different versions leads one to
the conclusion that the Sarada (Kasmirl) version is certainly the best North-
ern version, and probably, taken as a whole, the best extant version^ of the
Adi, a conclusion not based on abstract considerations, but one that may be
verified inductively and pragmatically. As is natural, this version is, not by
any mean^, entirely free from corruptions and interpolations. These must be
carefully corrected and controlled with the help of the other versions, parti-
cularly of those of the rival recension.

scripts ; it is, in fact, the most numerous group. Instances of reading which
distinguish y from v S, have been adduced above (p. Liv), to show the agree-
ment between v and S against y. The versions comprising this sub-recension
have, moreover, quite a considerable number of “ additional passages in
common, which clearly differentiate it from other versions. Noteworthy is
the substitution of a lengthy passage of 56 lines (App. I, No. 61) for 1. 105.
4-7, giving a detailed account of the marriage of Pajndu with Kunti and
Madii. This detailed account is obviously secondary. On no other supposi-
tion can one, it seems to me, account for the circumstance that !§i Kq-s and
S should agree in having a short version for the episode for which K4 B D
substitute a considerably longer and more elaborate version, both versions
being embedded in a portion of descriptive text with minimal variation. For,
while it is inconceivable that two (more or less) independent groupjs of manus-
cripts such as Sj Ko-a and S could arrive at the same short account independ-
ently of each other, it is, at the same time, extremely improbable that either
group (■§! Ko -3 or S) should have copied the short summary from the other,
discarding altogether its own original detailed account.

C57) The secondary interrelationship of the various versions comprising
subrecension y is documented sufficiently clearly by their having in common
quite a large number of lengthy passages which are missing in v S, and which,
on independent (intrinsic) grounds, have been or may be declared spurious.
The following passages, given in App. I, are instances of such interpolations :

(1) No, 12 (N1.2 Vi B D), a duplicate and superfluous description of
the ocean, a similarly worded description having occurred only in the preced-
ing adhyaya ;

(2) No. 14 (K4 N Vi B D except D^, D. on suppl. fol.), a short Pura-
nic story relating how Surya resolves to bum the world down, whereupon
Garuda, at Brahma’s behest, brings his brother Aruina, over the east that he
might act as Surya’s charioteer, shielding the world from the heat of the
enraged Sun — a digression suggested by the casual mention of Aruina in
adhy. 14 ;

(3) No. 41 (K3.4 Vi B D except D^), a list of the hundred sons
of Dhrtar^tra^ — an anticipation of adhy. 108, whose occurrence here (like
that of the two following interpolations in the same adhyaya), as has been
explained above, is obviously contrary to the original plan of the adhyaya ,

(4) No. 42 (K3.4 N Vi B D except D5), an account of the scene which
was enacted in heaven before the birth of Abhimanyu, a story which is really
meant to explain the mystery of his premature death ;

(5) No. 43 (K4 N Vi B D except D^), the open secret of the mysteri-
ous birth of Karpa, which is an anticipation of adhy. 104 ; and, finally,

(6) No. 81, lines 193-230 (K4 N B D T^), meant to be a summary

of tte Jatugfha -episode, which is, however, a gtxrbled md incohmnt version
of the original story.

' The view that v and y may stand in genetic relation to each other does
not receive much support from the facts of the case. Neither v nor y can be
derived from the other. Each possesses original features that the other lacks,
as is evidenced by their alternate agreement mth S, even in the matter of
petty verbal details. All these coincidences need not, of course, be original.
Some could be indeed secondary changes, made independently in the same
direction ; others again may possibly be explained as the result of contami-
nation. There will remain still an obstinate residue of agreemoits between
V and S, or between y and S, that must be set down as the expression of the
ultimate connection of the respective concordant versions through the lost
original source.

Contamination between v and y, owing to the contiguity of the areas in
which the respective versions were current, was inevitable, and must, in any
case, be assumed to have existed ; on the other hand, contamination between
y and S cannot be altogether denied.

Particularly interesting is a small group of passages of doubtful character,
to which reference has already been made. These are certain passages that are
common to y and S. and are missing in Sj K 0-3 only ; in other words, they arc
found in all manuscripts collated except K 0 - 3 ; for example, the Kajnika-
nlti. There is usually other evidence against the passages. Thus the second-
ary character of the Kanikaniti is quite unexpectedly confirmed ; firstly, by
the illogical repetition in certain Southern manuscripts (T^, G 2 . 4 .:,) of two
preceding adhyayas (129-130) ; and, secondly, from the fact there is no
reference to the Kajnikaniti in K§emendra’s Bhdtatamanjari, in the Javanese
version, as also in Devabodha's {583 commentary. It may, of course, happen
that in particular cases there is no collateral (confirmatory) evidence of this
character available ; e.g. in the puerile account of the birth of Duhsala (App.
I, No. 63). Here the evidence of documentary and intrinsic probability is
almost equally balanced ; and documentary probability points in one direc-
tion, while intrinsic probability points in the other.

I have in such cases hesitatingly followed v ( =§i K), taking into
account, on the on^ hand, the superiority of v in general trustworthiness, and,
on the other hand, the special characteristics of y and S, which are versions
rather of the inclusive than of the exclusive type, prone to amplification and
elaboration. Fortunately for us such cases are comparatively rare

The rejection, on the evidence of v alone of the whole of the incoherent
adhy. 139 of the Bombay edition (our App. I, No. 80), an adhyaya which
contains only some needless repetition, besides minor absurdities, would not
have called forth any comment from me, but for the fact that with its omis-
sion disappears the only reference, I think, in the whole epic to this alleged

installation of Yudhi^thira as heir apparent to the throne of Hastinapura.
The Kasmiii version, which omits the entire adhyaya containing the reference,
unexpectedly justifies the indignant outburst of Holtzmann {Das Mahd-
bhdrata, Bd. 2, p. 33) : “Geradezu Falschung ist es, wenn 1, 139, 1=5517
behauptet wird, der blinde Dhrtardshtfa habe mit Uebergehung seiner eigenen
Sohne den Yudhishfhira zum Kronprinzen {yuvardja) ausrufen lassen/' One
of the main objects in interpolating this adhyaya seems to have been to exo-
nerate Arjuna from the blame or sin of fighting with his own guru (Acarya
Drcjria) in the Great War, by making the Acarya himself exact from his pupil
in the presence of all his kinsfolk — for no reason that is adduced or can be
seen— the solemn but senseless promise that he (Arjuna), when challenged,
would not refuse to fight with Drona. Cf. B. 1. 139. 13 :

available for collation.

tnanuscripts iSj, and The version is closely allied to the Bengali,
with which the agreement of one or the other of the three manuscripts is al-
most constant. That even the manuscripts of distant Nepal are not wholly
free from contamination from some Southern source or sources (direct or in-
direct) follows, for instance, from 224*, 263*, 819*, 991*, 998*, 1096*,
1246*, 1470*, 1569*, 1748*, 1768*, 1788*, 1828*, 1910*, 1957*, 2133*,
etc., etc. as also passage No. 112 of App. I — interpolations common to S and
some of the Nepali manusaipts. One of these manuscripts (fsTs) happens to
be the oldest of the dated manuscripts (a.d. 1511) belonging to our critical
apparatus.*


The MmthiR Version.

Of the Maithili version, which is the version of North Bihar, only one
manuscript (Vi) was collated for this edition. Vi and K agree sporadically
against all other manuscripts (cf. for instance, 1. 1. 8, 49, 162), but such
agreements are few and far between, and it would not be safe to draw from
them any far-reaching conclusion regarding the relationship of Vj and K. As
in 306*, 321*, 328*, 346*, 378*, 418*, 450*, 541*, agrees, on the other
hand, with the typical Bengali-Devanagari group against all other manus-
cripts. Vj contains 1548*, a Southern passage, found otherwise only in Dn


The Bengali Version.

The Bengali version of sub-recension y was studied more carefully than
either the Nepali or Maithili. The study of this version was facilitated by
the extreme courtesy and kindness of Pandit Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya,
who has, now for many years, kindly and unselfishly supervised the work of
our collation centre at the Visvabharati, a centre organised by Professor M.
WiNTERNiTZ, when he was residing at Bolpur as a Guest Professor in Rabindra-
nath Tagore’s University. With the co-operation of a select batch of advanced
students, Pandit Vidhushekhara has been good enough to supply the Insti-
tute regularly with carefully prepared collations of a large number of valuable
old Bengali manuscripts in the rich collection of the Visvabharati, as also
of other manuscripts placed at his disposal by different Bengali Institutes
and scholars, among the latter, my kind friend Professor Sushil Kumar De,
of the University of Dacca. Of the large number of manuscripts thus collat-
ed, ultimately five were selected for inclusion in the critical apparatus

te«t, towards the end of this volume, the diacritical mark of N has bixrfcen off in
many places ; but, on examining the passages carefully I found that the context
almost invariably shows whether one has to read N or N.

of the edition. Notwithstanding considerable variation in these manuscripts
as regards petty verbal details, the material appears sufficient to settle the
text of this important version.

{60} The Bengali version is closely allied to the Vulgate, but is un-
questionably superior to the latter in so far that it is happily free from a large
number of late accretions which encumber the Vulgate. Of such “omis-
sions ”, exhibiting the superiority of the Bengali version, the following will
serve as illustrations :

(1) The entire Brahma-Ga)nesa complex in adhy. 1, of which the
Bengali version contains not the remotest trace. The spurious character of
this passage has been discussed and demonstrated so often that it is unneces-
sary to dilate upon it here.'^

(2) The short dialogue of 8 lines (71*) between Parasurama and the
shades of his ancestors, in the beginning of adhy 2, which is wholly unneces-
sary here, and is, as a matter of fact, only an excerpt from a detailed des-
cription of the principal Indian tirthas, which occurs in the Ara|nya (B. 3.
83. 29ffi).*

(3) ‘A short passage of only six lines (cf. App. I, No. 13), which
represents a somewhat feeble attempt (as unnecessary as it is unsuccessful)
to fill out an apparent lacuna in the original.^

(4) A long interpolation (App. I, No. 78) of 119 lines in adhy. 138
(Bom. ed.), which gives an inflated account of the defeat and the ultimate
capture' of Drupada by the Pl^davas. It is one of the miniature Bharata-
yuddhas — mere by-play for the benefit of the gallery — which expand and em-
bellish the Southern recension and the Vulgate. The older version disposes
of the battle in two lines, which, taking everything into consideration, is after
all perhaps not a very inadequate treatment, as already remarked.

(5) More than usual interest attaches to another omission in the Ben-
gali version, which concerns a well-known and popular scene describing the
discomfiture of Kaiina at Draupadi’s svayarhvara, which is commonly be-
lieved to be one of the main reasons why he always entertained feelings of
such deep and implacable hatred towards Kr§!na (DraupadI), and lost
thereafter no opportunity to hurt and humiliate her.

This passage deserves a detailed consideration. Ramesh Chandra Dutt,
who had to make a very careful selection of the incidents of the epic in com-
pressing the story, has made this scene the centre of his poetic account of

the marriage of Draupadi, and given a vivid rendering of the passage in
his Epic of the Bharotas :

** Uprose Kama, peerless archer, proudest of the archers he,

And he went and strung the weapon, fixed the arrows gallantly,

Stood like Surya in his splendour and like Agni in his flame', —
Pandu's sons in terror whispered, Kama sure must hit the aim !

But in proud and queenly accent Dmpad’s queenly daughter said :

' Monarch's daughter, bom a Kshatra, Suta’s son I will not wed.'
Kama heard with crimsoned forehead, left the emprise almost done,
Left the bow already circled, silent gazed upon the Sun ! "

The situation is, undoubtedly, full of dramatic possibilities. Just at the
moment when the prize was going to be snatched away from the heroes of
the epic by an upstart, £ 61 } the brave little Draupadi comes to the rescue
and snubs openly, in the presence of the assembled princes, the* semi-divine
bastard, the understudy of the Villain of the piece, the unwanted suitor, who
thereupon withdraws discomfited ; and everybody breathes a sigh of relief.
A tense scene !

Unfortunately, this melo-dramatic interlude, to judge by the documen-
tary evidence, appears to be the handiwork of a very late Vylasai'd, as it is
found only in K4 5^2 Dn D2, 4. 5, that is, one manuscript of the K group,
one Nepali manuscript, and three composite Devanagari manuscripts, besides
the Nilakantha version ! All of these are late and inferior or conflated manus-
cripts. It is missing, on the' other hand, not only in the Saradia version and
the Southern recension (as in the case of many of the interpolations of the
Vulgate), but for once, also in the entire Bengali version !

It might seem a piece of sheer vandalism or perverseness to omit this
seemingly beautiful little passage, which has won its way into people's hearts,
from any edition of the Great Epic of India, relying merely upon documen-
tary evidence. A little' reflection will, however, convince any one that the
loss to the epic is not as serious as one might, at first, suppose, since it is a
palpably faked and thoroughly unreal situation. If one thinks about it at all,
one fails to understand how Draupadi, who was, after all, then only an unexpe-
rienced maiden in her teens, had recognized the King of Ahgas (whom she had
probably never seen before) and known him for the son of a coachman, unfit
to wed a princess. He had been invited by her father. At least he was
given a seat of honour among the princes. He is specifically named by
Dhr^tadyumna among the suitors ( 1 . 177 . 4 ). Moreover, it does not appear
as if the bride elect had much choice or voice in the matter, at the time of
these elaborate and formal state functions notwithstanding that they were
called svayamvaras. She had to wed any competitor who excelled in the
particular proficiency test which had bden arranged by her father or guardian.
She was vtryaStdkd : she was given by her guardian to the highest bidder.

the price paid being heroism, or rather proficiency in marksmanship. This
is quite evident from the words of Yudhisfhira, addressed later to the Purohita
of Ehupada ( 1 . 185. 23 f.) :

We accordingly find, as a matter of fact, that without murmur or hesitation,
she follows an unknown and apparently undistinguished Brahman boy —
Arjuna in disguise — ^who happens to have hit the mark. She does not know
him from Adam, but she makers no inquiries about his status or lineage.
Even if this were regarded as a case of romantic love at first sight for the
handsome and heroic bowman (which it certainly is not), she never opens
her lips when Yudhi$thira proposes that she should be the common wife of
the five brothers, which must have shatt^ed her romance to smithereens, but
quietly submits to (what is made to appear) as a most unusual and un-
natural, if not a shocking, proposal, and from which even her old father and
brother r^oil with perplexity and amazement. It seems to me, therefore,
that the documentary evidence* is amiply supported here by intrinsic probabi-
lity.

£62} Examples of other important '' omissions in the Bengali version
which distinguish it from the Devanagari are : 54*, 60*, 71*, 152*, 171*, 274,
277*, 689*, 1171*, 1205*, 1270*, 1614* (proverbs, one of them being a
citaticMi from Manu), 1714* (a short list of sacred rivers), 1788*, 1827*,
1841*, all of which occur in the Vulgate, but are missing in the Bengali
version.

Occasionally Bengali manuscripts agree in their readings with the South-
ern recension, standing in opposition to K (with or without D) ; e.g. ;

1. 22 B S : K ( mostly ) D ( mostly )

1 . 42 B S • ^ 0 - 2-4 D ( mostly )

7. 3 B D ( mostly ) S : K

39. 10 B D ( mostly ) S K ( with a few D ) 3 ^:.

64. 29 N B D S wm : K etc., etc., etc.

Other examples have been cited under the description of the K version.

In these cases, I have, as a rule, given preference to the agreement bet-
ween B and S, on the postulated principle of the originality of the* agreement
between independent versions, adopting in the constituted text, the concor-
dant reading ; but owing to the circumstance, that sporadic contamination
between B and S, as a whole, cannot be altogether denied and that there are,
as a matter of fact, some Bengali manuscripts that stand, palpably, under

the influence of the Southern tradition, even in the matter of minor readings,
it is impossible to be perfectly certain about the' originality of a reading com-
mon to B and S. I am, however, of opinion that the probability is always
on the side of the concordant reading, though the evidence of this agreement
may be rebutted by other considerations, such as intrinsic probability or the
evidence' of pertinent testimonia.

The Devmdgarl Version.

The Devarfigari script plays in the Mahabharata textual tradition the
important role of being the commonest medium of the contamination of
different Mahiabharata versions. A Devanagaif manuscript of the Maha-
bharata may, in fact, contain practically any version or combination of ver-
sions.

Of the four “ Devanagari ” scholiasts whose commentaries were collated
for the Adi, Arjunamisra is certainly an Easterner, and bases his commentary
on the Bengali text ; Ratnagarbha appears to be a Southerner, and his text
is evidently a blend between the Northern and the Southern texts ; while
Nilakaiotba is quite definitely a Westerner, though he seems to have written
his commentary in Benares. The provenance of the fourth and the last
commentator mentioned above cannot be determined with certainty ; but it
might be surmised that Devabodha was a ‘‘ Northerner ” ; in any case, his
text (to judge by the lemmata in his commentary) shows remarkable affinities
with the North-western or Kasmiri version (v).

Most of the Devanagari manuscripts, as already remarked, are eclectic
on no recognizable principle : now they approach the Southern tradition (S),
now the purer Northern (v). If any one were to maintain that just this
composite' text was the original, a patchwork of disjointed ancient passages,
which had later split up into the Northern ahd Southern recensions (as might
easily be implicitly assumed by the protagonist, say, of Nilakantha’s version),
it would) be a thesis difficult to substantiate. It (63} seems more natural to re-
gard, as already observed, the Devanagari as a sort of “ vulgar” script (like
the Latin, in Europe), the script understood by the savants all over India,
into which many of the local versions were, from time to time, transcribed,
a circumstance which facilitated contamination and conflation.

It has befen mentioned above that the Devanagari version contains many
more interpolations than even the Bengali. It would be no exaggeration to
say that the Devanagari manuscripts, which are by far the most numerous
of Mahiabharata manuscripts, are, at the same time, the least important of
them, with the possible exception of those of the adjoining version, Telugu.

Thei Devanagari Version of Arjunamisra.

This is in a sense a mi^omer, because this Devanagari version, as already
remarked, is nothing but a Devanagari transcript of the Bengali version.

The name of the commentary is variously given as {Mahd) Bharatdrtha-
{pra)dipikd and BhdratmmhgraUadipikd^ The commentary on the different
parvans has been handed down singly or in groups of a few parvans at a
time*. Complete manuscripts of the commentary are said to exist in Bengal,
but even there they are not common. The manuscripts, which are written
in Bengali or Devanagarl characters, have various dates in the seventeenth
or later centuries ; the earliest hitherto reported date is V. Samvat 1676
(ca. A.D. 1620). Arjunami^ra, who styles himself Bharatacarya in the colo-
phons of his commentary, was the son of isana, who was a “ Reciter ''
(pathaka) or “Prince of Reciters'' (pathakaraja) of the Mahabharata, and
who appears to have borne, like his son, the title Bharatacarya. Arjunamisra
is cited by name' by Nilakantha once in his commentary on the Mahabharata
{ad B. 3. 291. 70) and was, therefore, certainly anterior to Nilakantha, who
belongs to the last quarter of the seventeenth century. Arjuna, in turn, men-
tions, among his predecessors : Devabodha, Vimalabodha, Sandilya, Sarvajna-
Narayana (also known as Narayana-Sarvajna or merely Narayana). He
appears to have based his scholium closely on that of Devabodha, from whose
commentary Arjuna often cites, verbatim long extracts, without specifically
naming the source. Arjuna wrote also a commentary on the Puru^asukta,
to which he himself refers in the Dipikd on B. 14. 25. 26. Telang^ surmises
that he is posterior to the Vedantist Sairhkaracarya ; and Holtzmann^ assigns
him to the thirteenth or fourteenth century, both without mentioning any
cogent reasons for their assumptions. Arjuna has treated the Harivarhsa as
an integral part of the epic, elaborately defending this position ; his commen-
tary, therefore, embraces the Harivarhsa also.^

{64} Following the example of my predecessors, I have utilized Deva-
nagari manuscripts of his commentary and treated his version as a sub-division
of the Devanagarl version. The two Devanagari manuscripts utilized by me
are, however, extremely corrupt. Moreover, the text they contain is evidently
contaminated from the Vulgate, as proved by the glaring discrepancies that
e'xist between the readings of the text and the lemmata in the commentary

(e. g. 1. 1. 17, 22). This corruption of the Arjunamisra manuscripts, I could
not explain at first, but now it is clear that it is due to their being faulty
transcripts of Bengali originals. Two such Bengali manuscripts^ (unaccom-
panied by the epic text) were sent to me subsequently by my kind friend Pro-
fessor Sushil Kumar De of the' University of Dacca from the collection of
the Dacca University. These manuscripts are far superior, as is but natural,
to the Devaniagari manuscripts. It would seem, therefore, expedient to secure
and use, whenever possible, good old Bengali manuscripts of Arjunamisra's
commentary, treating his version as an offshoot of the Bengali version (with
the symbol Ba) ; or, still better, such Bengali manuscripts of his commentary
as are unaccompanied by the epic text. The reason of the last precaution
will be presently explained.

A word of caution is here necessary in regard to what are cited in the
critical notes as the readings of Arjunamisra. The readings found in the
(epic) text accompanying the commentary have, as a rule, been taken to re-
present the readings of Arjunamisra. The commentary was consulted by me
only occasionally, in case of doubt or difficulty, or when a pathantara was
noticed during a hurried perusal of the commentary. It is, therefore, more
than likely that, since the (epic) text of our Arjunamisra manuscripts is con-
flated with various types of texts, in particular with the Nilakaiiitha type,
some errors in our readings have crept in.^ Such errors can, however, be
rectified only by carefully working through the whole commentary word for
word, and comparing the lemmata with the (epic) text of the manuscripts.
Even then one can, of course, be sure only of the words and passages actually
cited by the scholiast.

In passing, it may be mentioned that the practice of combining text and
commentary in one manuscript is probably not very old. It is almost cer-
tain that the autograph copy of the commentator was not made up on the
tripartite' system' of combining the epic text and commentary in such a way
that [the] text occupies a central strip of the folio, while* the commentary is
written in two narrow strips, one at the top and the other at the bottom of
the folio, which is the proftotype of the Bombay pothi-ioxm editions. The
scholiast must have written his commentary, certainly at first, on separate
leaves, especially in the case of voluminous texts like those of the two epics.
Accordingly the commentaries of Devabodha and Vimalabodha have been
handed down always unaccompanied by the epic text. Those of Arjunamisra
and Nllakaintha, on the other hand, are generally accompanied by the epic
text, but the two Dacca manuscripts (lent to me by Professor De), as was
mentioned above, contained only the commentary. The two elements— text and

commaitary — appear to have been combined into the tripartite form by pro-
fessional scribes. If this combination was done under the supervision of the
commentator or at £65} least in his lifetime, there is some chance of the
scribe’s reproducing, in an approximately correct form, the text of the com-
mentator. But if the combination is made independently of him and especially
if made some time after the death of the commentator, there is every chance
that the scribe would combine the commentary he was copying with some
text known better to himself than to the scholiast. In the latter case, there-
fore, it must remain doubtful how far the epic text of such a manuscript re-
sembles the text actually commented upon by the ^holiast. It is conse-
quently best to use always texts of the commentary unaccompanied by the
epic text, though it is an extremely laborious process to collate such a manus-
cript with any given Mahabharata text ; but we eliminate in this way auto-
matically all chances of avoidable errors of commission and omission.

The Devandgmi Version of Nilakantha : the Vulgate.

Nilakantha, considered until lately, at least in India, as the most trust-
worthy guide for the exposition of the Mahabharata, was a Brahmin scholar
of Mahara§tra, with the surname Caturdhara (modem Chaudhari), son of
Govinda Suri and Phullambika, residing at Kurparagrama (modern Kopar-
gaon) on the Godavari.^ Nilakantha wrote his commentary on the Maha-
bharata (and another work called the Gainesa^ta), in Benares, in the last
quarter of the seventeenth century. He appears to be the author also of a
work called Mantrarahasyaprakdsikd.

At the beginning of his commentary on the Great Epic, Nilakaintha tells
us that before writing his scholium, the Bhdratabhdvadlpa, he had compared
many copies of the Mahabharata, collected from different parts of India,
with a view to determining the “best” readings and even consulted the
scholia of old authorities :

We accordingly find that he occasionally mentions (in about 125 places) va-
riant readings and additional passages found in different provincial versions
(most of which can be identified among the readings of the manuscripts com-
prising our critical apparatus), and cites (as a rule, without naming the
source) the explanations given by other scholiasts — information, scknty
though it is, yet of immense interest and value for the history of the received
text. Variants cited by Nilakantha will be found in the footnotes under :

Nilakantha refers to Devabodha, Vimalabodha, Arjunamisra, Ratna-
garbha, and Sarvajna-Narayana, in the course pf his comments on the differ-
ent parvans. Devabodha, who is one of the oldest (if not the oldest) com-
mentators of the Mahabharata hitherto known, he refers while commenting
on 1. 158. 14 ( = B. 1. 170. 15.) :

Not a single word of this stanza, as cited here, is commented on, how-
ever, by Devabodha ! The only word in Devabodha's scholium which might
possibly have been taken from some reading of the stanza before Devabo-
dha is (= 2 ind that does not occur in the reading of the stanza

cited by Nilakaintha. The mention of Devabodha by Nnakantha here, is,
therefore, surely honoris causa. Such mistakes by commentators are far too
frequent to cause surprise or need comment.^ It is, however, noteworthy
that the reason Nilakaintha assigns for considering this as an ancient variant
is that it had been commented on by Devabodha and others. This shows
that^ Nilakantha held Devabodha in high esteem, and reckons him among
the ancient authorities. What Nilakaintha regards as ancient (pradna)
is of course a matter for speculation. Nevertheless I do not think that he
would have called Devabodha a ‘‘ prMna '' commentator, unless the inter-

Devabodha again in B. 7. 82. 2 : 'TiJcT

ArjunamiSra he cites in his comment on B. 3. 291. 70 :

Since Arjunahiisra also cites Devabodha, we can arrange the three com-
mentators in an incontrovertible sequence ; Devabodha — Arjunami^ra — ^NUa-

The text used or prepared by Nilakaiptha is a smooth and eclectic but
inferior text, of an inclusive rather than exclusive type, with an inconsider-
able amount of Southern element.

Nilakaptha's text has acquired in modern times an importance out of all
proportion to its critical value,- to the utter neglect of far superior texts, such
as the Ka^nurl or Bengali.

Nilakaiptha’s guiding principle, on his own admission, was to make the
MahSbharata a thesaurus, of all excellences (culled no matter from what
source). At the beginning of his commentary on the Sanatsujatiya, Nila-
kaijtha naively remarks (Bom. ed. Udyoga 42) :

International Congress of Orientalists, Leiden (1931), and entitled “Miscellane-

That Southern manuscripts were utilized by him is incontrovertibly prov-
ed, for instance, from the fact that he cites at the end of his comment on Adi

which are typical Southern interpolations, not found in any Northern manus-

It would, however, hardly repay, now, the trouble to re-edit, from ma-
nuscripts, the version of Nilakaptha, as there are far better versions that
(xmld be edited instead, for instance, the Kasmrrl.

The manuscripts of the Nilakaptha version (which Show among them-
selves slight discrepancies) contain a number of lines which are not found in
any of the other versions (except occasionally in a few manuscripts of the
composite Devanagari version) ; e.g. 102*, 147*, 276*, 412*, 493*, 574*,
699*, 765*, 838*, 1270*, 1457*, etc. They belong perhaps to the oral tra-
dition which, at one time, had probably as great value and authority as the
writtoi text.

PROLEGOMENA


The Stanza containing the unintelligible word ( v. 1. ) which

NllakaiJtha has great difficulty in explaining :

lcx)ks uncommonly like one of the kuta§lokas, said to be interspersed by
Vyasa at different places in his poem, in order to puzzle and confuse his di-
vine amanuensis, but is, un-{69}-fortunately, nothing of the kind. The
passage is only one of the common instances of “ conflate readings. The
stanza cited above is the Southern variant (473*) of the Northern stanza,
which, in our edition, reads (1. 55. 8) :

Wg-wNa: I

The in the former stanza is only a mhlection of the original

(often mis-written which is the Southern equivalent

the reference being, no doubt, to the minister cr statesman (mantrin)
Kahika (named after the famous authority Kainika or Kaninka cited in the
Artha^astra of Kautilya), who appears only once in the epic, and that express-
ly for the purpose of expounding his political philosophy to the Kauravas.

As another instance of conflation which has had a rather disastrous effect
on his text, I may cite Nilakaajtha’s version of the story of Dirghatamas.
The addition has been made in such a manner that one sentence oj the ori-
ginal has remained hanging in the air and cannot be construed at all ! The
story begins at B, 1. 104. 9. All goes well till stanza 28 :

qwirflR II

Then we read 29 :

si am ii

“ Having spoken thus among themselves, they [sct7. the inmates of the
hermitage] to the anchorite Krghatamas. Then that wife also, having
(already) obtained sons (?) (from him) did not (seek to) please the hus-
band.”

Kiisma, who is narrating the story, then goes on quite unconcernedly to
speak about the wife (of Dirghatamas) Pradveji or Pradvi§anti ; about the
maryada made by the exasperated Dirghatamas, and so on. But what the
inmatpg of the hermitage (aSramavasinah) did to Dirghatamas, we never
learn fr<«n the Vulgate. All modem translators try to eke out a sense by
interpolating into the text some words to complete the sense. A reference to



PROLEGOMENA


the constituted text and the critical notes will, however, show that the text
of the Vulgate is conflated ; it is a most clumsy blend of interpolations from
two entirely different sources (y and S)., which, as is but natural, alters the
situation considerably and confuses the narrative hopelessly. By athetizing
either passage we get a tolerable text ; by athetizing both we get the original,
which is the constituted text.

The Devandgarl Version of Ratnagarbha.

The critical notes contain only specimen collations of this version, which
is a blend between the Northern and Southern recensions. Like the Tdugu
manuscripts, which will be described presently, it is eclectic, following now
the Northern tradition, now the Southern. It seems to be an attempt to
combine the two recensions by superposition, like the Kumbhakonam edition.
Its composite character may be seen from 24*, 25*, 27*, 114*, 138*, 149*,
170*, etc., etc. It contains the additional passages of the Southern recen-
sion, as well as the Ganesa episode, which latter is found only in late Nor-
thern {70} (Devanagaii) manuscripts : exactly like the Kumbhakonam edi-
tion. The collation of this version was discontinued after the second adhyaya.
The version may be safely ignored as useless for critical purposes.

The Devandgarl Version of Devabodha,

A commentary older and more important than the Arthadipikd of Ar-
junami^ra, and one more neglected still, is the Jndnadipikd of Devabodha,
cited here as Cd. Devabodha is certainly earlier than Vimalabodha, Arjuna-
mi^ra and Nilakaijtha, all of whom cite him with great respect, and probably
earlier than Sarvajha-Narayaira and Vadiraja. He is, therefore, most likely,
the earliest commentator of the Mahabharata hitherto known, and, in my
opinion, also the best. The commentary is in any case most valuable, and its
evidence, both positive and negative, of supreme importance for the consti-
tution of the text.

The Jndnadipikd is a concise tika ; that is, a running commentary, ex-
plaining, as a rule, only the difficult words and passages in the text. Occa-
sionally it offers explanations of constructional obscurities and grammatical
difficulties, and gives the gist of passages ; in the latter case, usually, under
citation of entire verses (i.e. half slokas) from the text. The extent of the
commentary on the Adi is given in one manuscript as 1400 granthas. The
homage which Arjuna pays to Devabodha in the Introduction to his scholium
is not a mere matter of form. Arjuna has in fact based his commentary
largely on that of his predecessor. He has copied very large portions of Deva-
bodha's commentary, sometimes verbatim, sometimes in extract. Moreover
even when the two commentaries differ, the influence of Devabodha is plainly
discernible. In fact, the Arthadipikd may be considered as a revised and



90


PROU^MENA


enlarged edition of the Jndnadipikd. The similarity of the names is sugges-
tive and worthy of ncte.

Unlike the commentaries of Arjunami^ra, Nilakantha and Ratnagari>ha,
that of Devabodha is unaccompanied by the epic text. The question what
was Devabodha's text cannot, therefore, be answered with any high degree of
certainty. The entire Southern recension and even the Vulgate may, how-
ever, be* definitely ruled out. There remain the Bengali, §arada and “ K
versions. With the latter two, the pratikas of Devabodha seem to show
greater affinity than with the Bengali version. For instance, Devabodha has
no comment on any of the six adhyayas (including the Kanikaniti) of the cen-
tral subrecension (7), which are missing in sarada and K. Wortliy of special
note is the absence of all reference to the Kanikaniti in Devabodha's commen-
tary, since the passage has evoked lengthy comments from both Arjunami§ra
and Nilakantha. Still greater probative value has an addition which is peculiar
to the Ka^mlrl version. This version adds at the very end of the Adi a sup-
plementary and superfluous adhyaya, — an addition which is only a variant
of the well-known Purainic tale of Svetaki’s sacrifice., occurring earlier in the
course of the same parvan. Curiously enough, the king who is called Svetaki
in the first version is here called Svetaketu ! That the version of Devabodha
contained this additional adhyaya is revealed by the concluding remark of
Devabodha’s commentary on the Adi : TOT This remark will

not apply to any version which has not the additional adhyaya peculiar to the
Ka^miri version. These considerations tend to show that the version of De-
vabodha was of the Sarada-K type. And the inference is confirmed by many
minor agreements, which need not be cited here.

{71} The Composite Devandgan Version.

The fourteen manuscripts comprising this version are misch-

codices of small trustworthiness and of no special value for critical purposes.
Consequently, half of them {D8.14) were disccntinued already after adhyaya 2.
The characteristics of these manuscripts may be briefly noticed here.

Dj is akin to Dn and looks imcommonly like a Nilakaiptha manuscript
7ninus the commentary. Yet it differs conspicuously from the ordinary Nila-
kaihtha manuscripts by the unaccountable omission of the entire Brahma-
Gane^a complex (that is, both the visit of Brahma and the employment of
Gape§a as a scribe, which arises out of the visit) as well as the description
of the battle in which the P^i>(Javas capture Drupada and hand him over as
gurudak§ipa to their preceptor, Acarya Drona (App I, No. 78). The omis-
sion of these episodes points rather in the direction of Bengal, since Ka§mir
is excluded by the mass of other interpolations which Di contains, as also by
the almost complete lack therein of readings peculiar to i§i K. The manus-
cript may be a blend of Bengali and some composite Devanagari manuscript

or manuscripts.— D 2 (like Dg) is akin to and might have been with
advantage classed with them : see, for instance, the critical apparatus per-
taining to the list of the contents of the Arapyaparvan in adhy. 2. — D 3 is
palpably under Southern influence, to prove which it is sufficient to point out
that it transposes the ^kuntalS and Yayati episodes, a transposition which
is quite peculiar to the Southern tradition. — D 4 contains notably large addi-
tions from Southern manuscripts, additions which are either altered on the
margin or, when the marginal space would net suffice, written on suppleroen*
tary folios. The Southern influence is illustrated by the following passages ;
587*. 594*, 596*, 598*, 599*, 602*, 603*. 604*, 605*, 609*, 610*, 611*,

612*, 613*. 617*, 621*, 623*, 624*. 628*, 629*, 630*, 633*. 634*, 635*,

637*, 670*, 671*, 713*, 715*. 1255*,. 1256*, 1257*, and scores of others.

Cf. also the following passages given in App. I : 35, 46-48, 52, 53, 55, 56,

59, 64, 67-69, etc., etc. — Dg (like D,) often stands in oppesition to other
manuscripts of this composite class, agreeing with K-.,,, with which it might
have been with advantage classed. Like K 4 . 3 , it contains Southern additions
as well, e.g. 1565*, 1579*, 1580*, etc., and passage No. 89 of App. I. — The
manuscripts were discontinued after adhy. 53. Frequently they are
found tc- be in opposition to the Vulgate and agreeing with the manuscripts
of the c group. They also show 230*, which is a Southern passage.

D«-14. as already remarked, were collated only as speciniMS for the first
two adhySyas and discontinued thereafter. — Of these, Ds. 12.14 are palpably
under Southern influence, as is evidenced by their containing one or the other
of the following typical Southern insertions : 18*, 21*, 22*, 24*, 32*, 42*.
45*, 48*, 49*, 56*. 80*, 81*, 89*, 114*, 117*, 138*, 149*, 170*.-D,3,
which is a fragmentary manuscript, beginning almost at the end of adhy. 1 ,
is used in this edition practically only for adhy. 2 , as it is discontinued at the
end of that adhyaya. The text shows strong affinities with the version of Ar-
junamisra. — The text of D 14 is a ocmplex. It contains some old readings
such as are preserved only in the KaSmlri manuscripts, but also an ^ra-
ordinarily large number of individual readings, not found elsewhere (cf. 1 . 1 .
50, 63 ; 2. 101, etc ). At the same time, it is contaminated from some Sou-
thern source, perhaps the MalaySlam version !

£72} The Devanagari manuscripts of the Mahabharata in the Tanjore
Library seem to have been all copied during the regime of the Maratha Chiefs
of Tanjore, and are a blerid of the Northern and Southern recensions, and as
such, of little value for text-critical purposes.

The Tebiiu Version.

The Tdugu version, situated as it is on the boundary line which divides
the Northern from the Southern recension, was particularly open to contami-
natiem from the Northern tradition. We accordingly find that the majerity
of Telugu manuscripts are eclectic on no recognizable principlesi presenting

somewhat the aspect of a mosaic of the texts of the Northern and Southern
recensionSi, not unlike the Kumbhakcnam edition. Tj is one of the extremely
few Southern manuscripts which contain the (Northern) salutational stanza
^or the Northern element in the make-up of Tj, cf. 29*, 30*,
95*, 97*, 98*, 106*, etc., etc. As compared with Tj, To shows a purer Sou-
thern tradition and has distinct leanings towards the Grantha version. — T 3 only
replaces the fragmentary manuscripts To, which breaks off at the end of
adhy. 181.

Important variants of one other Telugu manuscript (Tanjore 11809) are
now given by Professor P. P. S. Sastri in his edition of the Southern recen-
sion. It does not differ appreciably from our Telugu manuscripts.

The Grantha Version.

The Grantha version is the version of the Tamil country, and is written
in the so-called Grantha script. It is one of the two important Southern ver-
sions. the other being the MalayMam. The Grantha version — to judge by the
manuscripts utilized for the Critical Exlition, and for Professor P. P. S.
Sastri’s Southern Recension — is more heavily interpolated than the Mala*
yalam, and is also more influenced, on the whole, by the Northern recension.

For the beginning of the Adi. we get, temporarily, the sub-groups Gi _3
and G 4 .ft, but soon the configuration changes to Gi. 2 . 4 . 5 . versus G 3 . g- The
latter group (Gg.g) represents the purer Southern tradition, agreeing with M
against the other Southern manuscripts, whereas the four MSS. Gi-a^-s
not merely heavily interpolated but stand palpably under Northern influence.
All Grantha manuscripts are probably contaminated (directly or indirectly)
from Northern sources in different degrees. Gg shows, on the whole, little Nor-
thern influence, but 419*, 494*, 603*, 1310*, 1312*, 1885*, 1975*, and pas-
sage No. 73 of App. I, show that even Gg is probably net entirely free from
contamination, since all these (Northern) passages are missing in M.

Sastri’s edition of the Southern recension gives the (most important)
variants of five Grantha manuscripts of which three, and 31 (the latter
being Sastri’s “principal text”) are identical with our G^, G^ and Gg res-
pectively. Extracts from a Grantha manuscript belonging to the Royal
Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland (Whish Collection, No. 65) have
been given by Professor Winternitz^ and compared with the text of the
Bombay edition (t^ka 1799). The passages which differ from the Bombay
edition { 73 } have been underlined in his extracts, and the corresponding
passages of the latter are given opposite each line : a convenient arrangement
which shows, at a glance, the relation of the two texts to each other for the

passages excerpted.^

The clearest proofs of the contamination of Gi. 2 . 4.5 from some Northern
source is furnished by 294*, a Northern passage, added in this sub-group
irrelevmtly before 1. 20. 1. The two lines comprising this passage must have
been interpolated in a remote ancestor of Gi. 2 . 4.5 by a clumsy scribe, who had
missed the right place by four stanzas, and have remained there ever since,
fortunately. Another rather transparent interpolation in Gi. 2 . 4.5 from a late
Northern source is a passage referred to already, No. 14 of App. I, which des-
cribes the circumstances under which Arujna becomes the charioteer of the
Sun, an irrelevant digression. Cf. also 1373*, 1375*, 1377*, and passage No.
76 of App. I.

The sub-group contains an amaizingly large number of interpolations,
whiich have not been found, so far, elsewhere, and of which a few may be men-
tioned as illustration^ : 320*, 322*, 326*, 330*, 337*, 345*, 351* (third
line!), 357*, 363*. 364*, 368*. 371*, 373*, 382*, 386*, 387*, 388*, 406*,
519*, 584*, 636*, 705*, 706*, 741*, 755*, etc., etc.

But the Grantha version itself inclined to admit freely new lines. In-
stances 0 / rather lengthy interpolations of G are furnished by passages No. 35-
39, 73 and 93 of App. I . Most of the interpolations are however short, con-
sisting, as a rule, of less than 10 lines, e.g. 500*, 501*, 502*, 504*, 507*,
509*, 510*, 511*, 520*, 552*, 569*, 570*, 693*, 814*, 841*, 897*, 1259",
1268*, 1312*, 1313*, 1316*,, 1319*, 1320*, 1372*, 1435*, 1441*, 1447*,

1868*, 2009*, 2040*, etc., etc.

G 7 , which is one of the few Southern manuscripts containing the (Northern)
mantra etc. is, like Tj, a typical blend of the Northern

and Southern tradition, and was, on that account, discontinued after adhy. 2.
Its composite character may be seen from : 29*, 30*, 96*, 97*^ 98*, 106*,
145*, etc., etc.


The Malaydlam Version,

This isi the version of Malabar, the Southernmost extremity of India.
It is, in tny opinion, the best Southern version. It is not only largely free
from the interpolations of a (=T G), but appears to be also less influenced
by N than cr, wherein lies its importance for us.


1 The collation of the text is accompanied by notes in which Winternitz
draws attention to the roost striking points of difference between the two versions,
without entering into a full discussion of all the various readings. The notes con-
tain nevertheless many valuable text-critical observations.

words, with the Asdkaparvan. replace these manuscripts in the Sambha-
vaparvan, which is the name under which the remaining portion of the Adi is
known in the Southern recension. This practice of writing the two portions
of the Adi in separate volumes is worthy of note, as an archaic survival. It
is, in my opinion, the reflex of some half-forgotten factor connected with the
cctmpilation of the Adi, and seems to me to be text-critically highly impor-
tant. It should seem that the South has never completely assimilated the
{Northern) division of the epic into the conventional eighteen parvems.

This version has several striking agreements with Si, a fact all the more
impressive, because M, a Southern version, hails from the province at the op-
posite end of India from the province of Sj, a Northern version ; for instance,
Malayalam supports Si (against T G) in omiting the spurious parts of adhy.
128-129 of the Bombay edition.

WiNTERNiTZ has published, in Devanagarl transcript, portions of a frag-
mentary Malayalam manuscript belonging to the Royal Asiatic Society of
Great Britain and Ireland (Whish Collection,, No. 158), which contains
twelve chapters of the Sairhbhavaparvan.^ The extracts contain the beginning
of the Puruvamsanukirtana (our adhy. 90), the passage referring to Sakun-
tala and the birth of Bharata (our 1. 90. 27-34), and the end of the adhya-
ya (our 1. 90. 93-96). The manuscript correctly shows the Southern trans-
position of the Sakuntala and Yayati episodes. It is interesting to observe
that this manuscript also further shows the anticipation of 1. 89. 1-16, before
the YayMi episode, which is found in our Malayalam manuscripts? (cf. note
on p. 282) and in the conflated MSS. G4. 5 (cf. note on p. 992), and which
is text-critically highly important.

Readings or features which are peculiar to M or such as distinguish M
from G (with or without T) will be found under : 1. 1. 3. 35, 45, 122, 128, 168,
176, 179, 184, 189 ; 2. 100 ; 4. 4 ; 7. 10 ; 24. 1 ; 36. 3 ; 39. 2, 16 ; 53. 31 ;
54, 6, 7 ; 57. 81 ; 61. 98' ; 67. 28 ; 68. 16, 51 ; 69. 9 ; 73. 33 ; 77. 9 ; 78.
23 ; 80. 2 ; 84, 14 ; 86. 1 ; 92. 45 ; 93. 14 ; 94. 9, 27, 32 ; 95. 8 ; 96. 2, 57;

132. 1 ; 136. 1 ; 138, 10 ; 139. 11 (om. in M) ; 142. 19 ; 150. 10, 26 ; etc., etc.

With regard to the versions described above, it must be frankly admitted
that they do not, by any means, form water-tight compartments. The isolec-
tional boundaries, as is natural, do not coincide, but are independait of each
other ; in other words, the textual peculiarities, which are, in final analysis,
the real basis of our classification, never have, as a matter of fact, an identi-
cal area of distribution. The manuscripts cannot always be squeezed into the
same moulds consistently. Thus, for instance, in the beginning of the Adi,
the Grantha version, as already remarked, shows two sub-groups Gi_3 and
G4 _q ; but soon the configuration changes and, from about adhy. 25 onwards,
we get the grouping Gi.2.4.r, : G^.^. Not only that. Individual manuscripts,
groups, or even versions often overstep the boundaries of their particular re-
cension. Thus, for example, on the one hand, Gi.2.4.5- frequently agree with
5^ Vi B D ; M agrees with iSi ; iSi and Dn agree with S ; against other manus-
cripts of their respective recensions.

These discrepancies, as is shown in thte sequel, are due chiefly to two
different causes : firstly, initial fluidity of the text ; and, secondly, subsequait

contamination or conflation. As regards fluidity : to conceive of the Epic of
the Bharatas — or for that matter, of any true epic — as a rigid or fixed com-
position like the dramas or poems of Goethe or Milton, or even of K^i-
dasa or Bhavabhuti, would be manifestly grotesque. Such a view can origi-
nate only in a fundamental misconception of the origin, growth and function
of epic poetry.

In the case of the Mahabharata, we find, however, the fact of the fluidi-
ty of the original reflected in the tradition as preserved even to this day.
Only a very late interpolation in some inferior Devanagan manuscripts speaks
of the text as having been written down by Gainesa to the dictation of Vyasa,
a fantastic story that we may ignore with an eaisy conscience. On the otlier
hand, we are plainly told that the epic was first published, at an elaborate
sacrificial session, in the form of a free recitation by Vaisaimpayaina, a direct
pupil of the author, before king Janamejaya and the assembled guests. It
was again recited by Suta (or Sauti), who had heard it only at the first reci-
tation, and somehow committed the whole poem to memory. After just one
single hearing, he obviously could not reproduce such a voluminous text ver-
batim et literatim. In the b^inning, therefore, it is clear that the poem, which
was committed to memory, was recited freely, as faithfully as the particular
leciter could contrive. This mode of transmission is net calculated to pre-
serve rigid textual purity in any high degree, without stringent precautions,
such as were adopted in the case of Vedic texts, but which never existed, as
far as one knows, in the case of the epics. This fact also we find unexpectedly
preserved by tradition (1. 57. 74 f.). Vyasa, we are told, taught his Bharata
to his five pupils. Sumantu, Jaimini, Paila, Suka, and Vaisampayana. And
the five rhapsodists — the direct pupils of the aluthor — it is reported, publish-
ed five separate vermns of the epic :

{76} i

As is well known, there is preserved a work which actually passes for the
Asvamedhaparva of the Bharata of Jaimini (whether it is actually so or not)
and which is totally different froim our A4vamedhaparvan.

Here, I think, we have a clear glimpse of the early history of the text.
Two facts emerge rather clearly out of the chaos : firstly, the text was migi-
nally committed to memory and recited freely ; secondly, different rhapsodists
recited differently. This has indeed been aissumed by many writer's on the sub-
ject.^ All that is quite natural and intelligible. As a matter of fact, from
generation to generation, from place to placq, from bard to bard, the wording,
even the contents* would vaky a little, until the text is committed to writing,
which is the beginning of a different phase in its history. The view that the
epic has reached its present form by a gradual process of addition and alte-

ration receives strong support from the fact that this process is not stopped
even by scriptal fixation.^ The study of the manuscripts thetoselves, which
belong to a very late phase in the evolution of the text, shows that texts must
have been constantly amplified -and altered by conflation. Su^ derange-
ments, it may be observed, do not totally destroy, as might be imagiHed, the
value of our division of the manuscript material into recensions and versions,
but merely complicate its use and interpretation.

CRITICAL PRINCIPLES FOLLOWED IN THE CONSTITUTION

OF THE TEXT

As already remarked, the MahaWrarata versions when they first come
within our ken appear already dispersed in several distinct groups. The ori-
ginal, from which all these versions are derived, is itsdf preserved in no au-
thentic copy contemporaneous with, or even reasonably close to, its period
of compositimi. We can <Mily reconstruct the original, approximately., by
comcwuative methods. We recognize today, as already explained, two recen-
sions, descended from the original, each recension embracing a plurality of
versions, each version being divided into a multiplicity of sul>groups. The
ultimate-problem is to unify, as far as possible, this manuscript tradition : to
evolve, by comparative methodi a form of the text that will explain this phe-
nomenal wealth of divergent and conflicting texts, and justify it.

Before I elucidate the critical principles followed in preparing the cons-
tituted text of the Adi, I must review briefly other principles of textual cri-
ticism and textual reccmstruction, and discuss the applicability of these prin-
ciples to the Mahabharata Problem.

The Classical Model

The method that naturally presents itself first to our mind is the tioMi-
honoured method of Classical Philology The older school of classical frfii-
lologists distinguished four stages in the work of preparing a critical edition of
a classical text : (1) Heuristics, {77} i.e. assembling and arranging the aitire
material consisting of manuscripts and testimonia in the form of a genealogi-
cal tree ; (2) Recensio\, i.e. restoration of the text of the archetype ; (3) Emeu-
datw, i. e. restoration of the text of the author ; and, finally, (4) Higher Cri-
ticism, i.e. separation of the sources utilized by the author.

Excellent as this method is for the purpose for which it is devised, it
should not be forgotten that it depends ultimately upon there being a mOTe or
less complete concatenation of copies and exemplars reaching finally back to a
single authentic (written) archetype ; and, consequently, can be applied to

the MahabhSrata with great limitations.^ Indeed our ideal is the same as
that of the classical philologist : restoration of the text, as far as possible
to Its ongmal form. But the original of a Sanskrit poem and that of a classi-
^ P(^_ : how entirely different they are ! Particularly, in the case of the
MahSbharata, where, one may well ask, is the original of a whole literature?

In the Mahabharata we have a text with about a dozen, more or less
independent, versions, whose extreme types differ, in extent, by about 13,OQO
stanzas or 26,000 lines ; a work which, for centuries, must have been growing
not only upwards and downwards, but also laterally, like the Nyagrodha
trw, growing on all sides ; a codex which has been written in nearly a dozen
different scripts assiduously but negligently copied, chiefly as a source of reli-
^ous merit, throu^ long vistas of centuries by a legion of devout and per-
haps mostly uneducated and inefficient copyists, hailing from different comers
of a v^t sub-continent, and speaking different tongues ; a traditional boc4c
of inspiration, which in various shapes and sizes, has been the cherished
hentage of one people" crmtinuously for some millennia and which to the
present day is interwoven with the thoughts and beliefs and moral ideas of
a nation numbering over 300 million souls ! The classical philologist has
clearly no experience in dealing with a text of this description, an opus of
such gigantic dimensicms and complex character, with such a long and intri-
cate history behind it

THE DIFFICULTIES OF MAHABHARATA TEXTUAL CRITICISM

The capital difficulty of the Mahablfirata problem is just this that there
are hardly any clear objective criteria which may enaWe us to discriminate
with precision and certainty between the data of the rival recensions, to eva-
luate correctly and confidently the amazingly large mass of variants. Only
an inconsiderable fraction of these variants represents clear “ mistakes ”,
which can be corrected with confidence. As a rule, the variant readings, if
they are not mere synonyms, convey a slightly different meaning, but almost
always a possible meaning. From the grammatical point of view also, they
arc both equally valid. One of the variants may be a trifle more suitable
than the other ; for instance, in the diswiminatioo between the Simple and
the Periphrastic Future, or the Parasmaipada and the Atmanqiada. But
can we legitimately premise that the original must necessarily have been quite
flawless from the point of view of the PSininian grammar ? Is it not at loa s t
likely that the supposed solecism may be a genuine lapsus calami of the
author, or (should that suMXisitiai be considered inadmissible or unaccept-
able) that the usage fluctuated ?

Then again, as we have seen, there are numerous passages, short and Imig,
that are found in one recension and are lacking in the other, what I call'

zeitung, 1932, 276 f.

“ additional ” passages. No { 78 } convincing proof can in gmeral be given to
establish either the originality or the spuriousness of any given passage of
this type. What may fairly be regarded as interpolations are in general so
ingeniously fashioned and so cunningly fitted in that, except under very
favourable circumstances, the intrinsic (contextual) evidence is inccmclusive.

For these and other reasons it is n(A always easy to correlate the diverg-
ent recensions, to discriminate between the variants, and to constitute a wholly
unobjectionable single tert.

This difficulty , has its origin in the circumstance that in the MahatMrata
manuscript tradition, perhaps as much as in any literary tradition, the tex-
tual critic is faced with a bewildering profusion of versions as also with an
amazing mixture of versions. Contrary tendencies have been at work in the
evolution of the text. While, on the one hand, some elements have been work-
ing, from the earliest times, for the development of different types ; on the other
hand, there were not wanting elements that operated against the evolution of
sharply differentiated types. To understand the phenomenon of this luxuriant
growth and indiscriminate fusion of versions, one must appreciate certain de-
tails oi* historical moment, certain special factors in the transmissimi of the
Mahabharata, traits which distinguish our work from every other known
text except the Ramayapa and perhaps other similar ancient epopees.

Let us examine closely the character of the differences between the two
recensions to start with.^ The differences are Of three kinds. Broadly speak-
ing, each recension differs from the other, firstly, in point of readings of the
common stanzas ; secondly, in point of additions (or omissions) of short and
Irnig passages ; and, thirdly, in point of sequence of the text-units. How do
these differences at all arise ? .

Our first thought would be to attempt to explain the additions or omis-
sions as the result of conscious editorial revision, or of clerical error, or partly
of one and partly of the other. But the frequent differences in sequence, es-
pecially when no material gain is perceptible in either arrangement, rather
support the explanation suggested above that both recensi<ms are, in final
anal3rsis, independent copies cf an orally transmitted text. The suggestion
is confirmed by the consideration of the variation of the first type, namely,
minor differences in the readings of the stanzas common to the two recen-
sions, whidi confront us step by step throughout the parvan, nay, through-
out the qjic, as the i>artial cdlations of the other parvans now available at
the Institute clearly show.

It will be found for one thing perfectly useless to try to derive mechani-
cally one set of readings uniformly from the other. Hundreds and thousands

of the mlpor readings are nothing more than mere synonyms or paraphrases,
grammatically and semantically equivalait, but graphically totally unrelated.
They, therefore, cannot be all corruptions, in the ordinary sense of the word,
of a written archetype. The vast majority of these variants cannot again be
due to the zeal of a purist trying to correct the solecisms of the received text,
or to the whim of a minor poet endeavouring to polish its diction or style.
Had that been the case, we should find that the enthusiasm of the reformer
had evaporated long before he had reached the middle or at least the end of the
first parvan. The £79} Herculean task of cleansing the Augean stables would
be child’s play compared to a systematic purification of the Mahabharata text,
according to later standards. Under these circumstances, however great might
be the divergence between the two recensions in the beginning, it is bound to
vanish or at least diminish towards the middle or the end of the poem. We
find, on the other hand, as already remarked, that the stream of variation
flows with unabated volume from the beginning to the end of the epic. This
fact can in no way be reconciled with the hypothesis of a single uniform re-
vision (or a series of them either) of a fixed and rigid text.

All the difficulties in the explanation of this phenomenal variation
vani^, however, as soon as we assume that the epic was handed down from
bard to bard originally by word oj mouth, as is clearly implied by tradition.
That would explain, without any strain or violence, the existence of the mass
of variants, of differences in sequence, and of additions or omissions. If the
text has been preserved, for any considerable period of time, only in memory
and handed down by word of mouth, those are just the changes that could
not possibly be avoided. It is evident that no gr^t care would be lavished
on the text by these custodians of the tradition to guard it against corruption
and elaboration, or against arbitrary emendation, and normalization : to re-
produce the received text, which was not guarded by canonical authority or
religious sanction, with any degree of precision would be neither attempted
by the bards nor required of them. Whenever and wherever the text was then
written down— and it was probably written down independently in different
epodis and under different circumstances— these transimissicMis by word of
mouth must have contaminated the written text and introduced innupierable
variations in it. The assumption of some of such complicated derangemait,
beyond the normal vicissitudes of transmission, is necessary to account for
the abnormal discrepancies and strange vagaries of the Mahabharata manus-
cript tradition. In other words, we are compelled to assume that evm in its
early phases the Mahabharata textual tradition must have been not uniform
and simple, but multiple and polygenous.

Moreover, a study of the critical apparatus shows that diere has inter-
vened a long period in the history of the Mahabharata in which there was a
free comparison of manu^ipts and ext^ive mutual borrowings. A natural
and inevitable source of confusion of the tradition has always been the

marginalia, comprising glosstes, variae lecHones and additions. The copyist
of a manuscript with such accretions copied sometimes the original readings
and sometimes the marginal. It may be incidentally remarked that an exami-
nation of the marginalia shows that the variant readings are taken mostly from
manuscripts belonging to the same version, or at least the same recension.
But there is no reason, theoretical at any rate, why readings of the rival recen-
sion could not creep into a manuscript of the text by the medium, say, of
a popular commentary such as Nflakantha’s. And, as a matter of fact, we
do find, occasionally, readings of the opposite recension noted in the margins
of manuscripts. Under these circumstances it was inevitable that the true
reading, especially if it was a lectio difficilior or an archaism or a solecism,
would be partly suppressed, being preserved to us in one or two manuscripts
only.

Furthermore, the texts may be improved by a comparison of manusaipts
is not by any means a modem discovery. The process has been known and
practised for ages : £80} the difference is merely in our ideas of what is meant
by “improvement” of the text. I have cited above the instance of Nila-
katittha, who himself says that he had collected and compared Mahabharata
manuscripts from different parts of India in order to ascertain the “best”
readings. The other com'mentators also, Devabodha, Arjunamisra and Ratna-
garbha, cite pdtkdntaras and speak apapdtkas (“bad readings”). These
they could have got only from a comparison of different manuscripts.

The text favoured by the ancients apikar to have been of the inclusive,
rather than of the exclusive, type. This is proved in the case of Nilakaiutba
by a remark of his cited above, where, he naively admits that he had put
together the stanzas which had been commented on by the ancient Bh^ya-
karas, and others he had found in modem manuscripts, with the idea of
making a “ thesaurus of exoellenoes.” The remark does not apply by any
means exclusively to the Sanatsujata episode, to which it is appended, at any
rate as far as Nilakaiotha is concerned. In the Adi, we have abuiidant evi-
dence that he has borrowed, according to his fancy, passages, short and long,
from the Southern recension. The critical notes will show that his text in-
cludes a large number of Southern passages which are not found in any other
Northern version, such as, for example, the catalogue of forest trees, which
serves in a modest way for a description of the sylvan scenery amidst which
Uparicara Vasu finds himself :

taining some details which did not fit into his own text. This he has done,
be it noted, at the risk of making his text wholly unintelligible, without a word
of apology or explanation. Professor Winternitz, while criticizing Dahl-
MANN’S Dm Mahdbharata, has pointed out this incongruity^ : The story. . .
which relates how Mrghatamas is insulted by his wife Pradvesi, aiid how he
consequently establishes the fixed rule {maty add) that henceforth a woman
shall always have to adhere to one husband, whether he be alive or dead, and
that a woman who goes to another man shall go to hell, thus forbidding any
kind of remarriage of widows. . . .is strangely out of placed in a chapter treat-
ing of Niyoga.” As was pointed out above, in consequence of the intrusion
of this foreign matter, the first half of the stanza of the original text is sepa-
rated from the second half by 27 lines ! That in itself is, however, not a very
serious matter in Mahabhiarata textual tradition, where such transpositions
are a common occurrence. But in the present instance, this transfer has Jiad
the unexpected and undesirable result that the subject of the sentence, which
was left behind in the first half of the stanza, remains the end without its
predicate, which latter, being shunted off to such a remote distance, was
furnished with a new and entirely different subject ! The effect of this
arrangement on the original story may be easily imagined.

{81} Conflation is in general not so easy to detect and prove as in the case
of NSlakaiotha. We can date Nilakaiotha with fair accuracy. Again, Nila*
kahtha, who is one of the latest of our commentators, has himself vouchsafed
some information as to how he has prepared his text. We have no such re-
liable data in the case of the majority of the manuscripts or versions of our
critical apparatus.

Take, for instance, the case of the sub-group Gi. 2 . 4.6 of the Grantha ver-
sion. In opposition to other manuscripts belonging to the same recension and
even the same version, Gi. 2 . 4.5 contain, as shown above, an astonishingly large
number of passages which are found otherwise only in some inferior manus-
cripts of the Northern recension. Now is this a case of contamination of the
four MSS. Gi. 2 . 4.5 21 Northern source ; or are the common passages a

remnant of the lost archetype, which were somehow lost in the remaining
manuscripts of the Southern recension There is apparent agreement here
between independent versions. But is this agreement original ? The clumsy
interpolator of a remote ancestor of Gi. 2 . 4.5 happens to have supplied us
with the means of answering these questions. He has left behind, quite un-
intentionally, an impress of his ‘‘ finger-prints,” so to say, by which we can
emity and confidently trace him and examine his handiwork. The said manus-

cripts contain a Northern stanza (belonging to manuscripts of class y) — 3,
mere string of attributes of Garuda^ — ^wedged in at a place where it can be
construed neither with what precedes nor with what follows. This proves
incontrovertibly that these four manuscripts Gi. 2 . 4.6 have been compared with
some Northern manuscripts, and makes it highly probable that the other
doubtful stanzas, which they have in common with the Northern recension,
have crept into their text in the same surreptitious way. At least this is the
most plausible explanation of the anomaly. But even such confirmatory
evidence is not always available.

The reader need not be sceptical about the possibilities of such indiscri-
minate conflation and addition. The critical apparatus, if closely scrutinized
and properly understood, will reveal numerous instances of a similar charac-
ter. Even a close study of the Kumbhakonam edition, prepared in our own
times by two excellent Southern Pandits, will throw some light on the men-
tality of the old redactors of the Mahabharata : parallel and even contradic-
tory versions are placed quite unconcernedly side by side, regardless of the
effect on the reader, regardless of the fact that sentences are left hanging in
the air, -that passages do not construe. Here one notices above all the
anxiety that nothing that was by any chance found in the Mahabharata
manuscript should be lost. Everything was carefully preserved, assembled in
a picturesque disarray.

Another important fact that must be kept in view in dealing with these
interpolations is this. The older the borrowal and the more interesting the
passage borrowed, the wider will be the area over which it will spread in its
new habitat. It then becomes difficult to prove the borrowal.

Thus there is a certain group of passages which are found in all ver-
sions except ini Sj and K (that is, in the group v), for example, the Kaiqi-
kamti.^ In the particular case of the Kaaiikaniti, there appears to be sufficient
extrinsic and intrinsic evidence to make it [82} highly probable that the pas-
sage is spurious, and the corresponding agreement between some of the
(more or less) independent versions is unoriginal.

There are indeed yet more difficult cases, where the evidence pf€ et cmtra
of documentary and intrinsic probability is equally balanced, as far as we
can at present judge. In sudi cases we are forced to look for small things
which look suspicious and lead us to probabilities, not facts.

The problem is clearly not solved by formulating a priori a hypothesis as
to the interrelationship of the different versions and fix the text in terms of
some preconceived formula ; for instance, by assuming as absolutely inde-
pendent a certain number of these divergent versions, and laying down an
arithmetical rule that whatever is ccwnmon to two or more of such and such


1 App. I, No, 81,

versions nmst be original. In this method, we can easily deceive ourselves and
others ; for the results arrived at will s^ppeav sounder than in reality they
are. Even though the formal operations may be a piece of flawless logic,
nevertheless the results, being based on premises possibly unsound though
apparently clear and definite, may be wholly fictitious. The study of the
manuscripts themselves must first teach us what their interrelationship is.
And they unmistakably indicate that their interrelationship is of most com-
plex character. The critical apparatus is a veritable labyrinth of complicated
and intermingled versions, each with a long and intricate history of its own
behind it. We have unfortunately no single thread to guide us out of the
maze, but rather a collection of strands intertwined and entangled and lead-
ing along divergent paths. With the epic text as preserved in the extant
Mahabharata manuscripts, we stand, I am fully persuaded, at the wrong
end of a long chain of successive syntheses of divergent texts, carried out —
providentially — in a haphazard fashion, through centuries of diaskeuastic
activities ; and that t4/ith the possible’* exception of the ^aradd {Kasmn)
version, which appears to have been protected by its largely unintelligible
script and by the difficulties of access to the province, all versions are indis-
criminately conflated.

Now it goes without saying that the genetic method (operating with an
archetype and a stemma ccdium) cannot strictly be applied to fluid texts
and conflated manuscripts ; for, in their case, it is extremely difficult, if not
utterly impossible, to disentangle completely, by means of purely objective
criteria, their intricate mutual relationships. The documentary evidence is no
doubt supremely important, but the results, arrived at from a consideration
of the documentary probability, must be further tested in the light of intrinsic
probability. No part of the text can be considered really exempt from the
latter scrutiny, when we are dealing with a carelesdy guarded text such as
we have in the present instance. A careful study of the critical notes will
show — if, indeed, the foregoing remarks have not made it abundantly clear—
that all the problems which present themselves for solution in editing any
text from manuscripts are present in the case of the Mahabharata on a colos-
sal scale and in an intensified form. We must, therefore, clearly recognize
that a wholly certain and satisfactory restoration of the text to its pristine
form — even the so-called satasdhasn samhitd form — may be a task now be^
yond the powers of criticism.

CRITICL EDITIONS OF THE DIFFERENT VERSIONS

No doubt, in view of some of these difficulties, one schdar has sug-
gested that to expedite and facilitate the work, we should, as ai first step,
before any attempt is made {83} to constitute the final text of the Mahfi*
bharata, critically edit all the different versions.^ That, it must be said, is a


Cf. Lesny, Archiv Orienfdltd, vol. 5 (1933), p. 159,

105


rather tall order, as any one will admit, who has any practical experience of
editing the Mahiabhlarata in any shape or form, critical or otherwise. But
perhaps funds and workers — not to speak of patience — can be found to edit a
dozen or more lakhs of stanzas comprising the dozen or more versions of the
Great Epic.i There remains, however, yet another and a more fundamental
difficulty, which appears to have wholly escaped the attention of the learned
critic. The difficulty is that it is practically impossible to edit even a single
version of the Mahabharata — or for that matter of any other text — ^wholly
satisfactorily, without considering the entire evidence, that is, without, at the
same time, consulting the readings of all other versions. Suppose we examine
six manuscripts of a version (Grantha) in order to prepare a critical text of
that version. It may happen that four of them (Gi.2.4.5), which are con-
flated manuscripts, have a “secondary’’ reading, while only two (G^.c) have
the correct reading. In these circumstances, the true character of the variants
could never be inferred from the readings of this version (G) itself ; it would
be shown only by other versions (T or M or N). In fact, there is no way
of finding out whether any of the manuscripts of a particular version are
conflated (if they happen to be conflated) without consulting the other
versions. And, if for the editing of each of the indivual versions, we have
to scrutinize and weigh the entire evidaice, we might as well get busy with
the work of preparing the final text, assuming of course that a final (critical)
text has to be prepared.

That consideration apart, even if we assume, for the sake of argument,
that all the dozen or more versions lie before us in a critically edited shape,
our main task is not made any easier on that account. One has to go through
the same mental processes in picking out or reconstructing the correct read-
ings, whether, as at present, the variae lectiones are concentrated on a single
page of the critical edition or have to be searched in a dozen or more different
provincial editions, arranged round about the critic in a semi-circle. Prepar-
ing all these different editions would not by itself give us the correct readings.
Some of them, moreover, would but slightly differ from each other, for
instance, the editions of the Bengali arid the Devaniagari versions, and it
would mean useless duplication of labour. All that is really needed to facili-
tate our work is a critical edition of the Southern recension. An attempt
to supply that need is now being made by Professor P. P. S. Sastri in his
edition of the Mahiabharata, referred to already.

THE VULGATE AS BASE

Another high authority, while full of apparent admiration for the
way in which the work is being done at present at the Institute, has with
much pathos and eloquence deprecated this hastily pr^ared, eclectic text.
All that we need to do at present, according to this scholar, is to reprint the
Vulgate, giving merely the variae lectiones of the manuscripts collated an 4

PROLEGOMENA


leaving each individual reader to constitute his own text, unhampered and
uninfluenced by the obtrusive personality of some editor who stands like a
monitor between the reader and his author. The learned critic is evidently
of opinion that any average reader, who picks up an edition of the Great
Epic for casual study is better qualified to reconstruct the text than the editor
who has made a special study of the £84} problem ! That is a paradox
natural to the subtle mentality of the learned critic. But we need not take
it too seriously. Whatever the Average Reader might or might not be able
to do, I beg to submit that the Critical Reader, like the learned scholar whose
opinion I am quoting, would not be any the worse off, if he is put in posses-
sion of this “ Recension of Poona For, who and what is to prevent him
from constituting his own text from this critical edition ? Whoever makes the
text — even if Brhaspati himself were to come down and constitute the text —
the Critical Reader would undoubtedly reject it as it would surely not fit
in with his ideas of what is right and what is wrong. The Critical Reader
has the same freedom of action whether he has before him the critical
text or the Vulgate. The Vulgate, as far as I can judge, is no better suited
for serving as the base than the present text.

It may, however, be that the hesitation of the learned authority is
really due to a categorical rejection to interfering in so definite a manner with
the received text. Should that be the case, it is certainly difficult to appre-
ciate the veneration of this scholar for the form of a text which was made up,
probably, also in great haste but with inadequate and insufficient materials,
only in the last quarter of the seventeenth CKitury, that is, early about 250
years ago. It is surely illc^cal to assume that a text which has been Iniilt
up largely on unscientific ocmjecture is now beyond the reach of conjecture.

A simpler and more probable explanation still of the hesitating attitude
of the learned critic might perhaps be that his theoretical misgivings are
based on a rather hasty study of both the Vulgate and the critical text. For,
the text of the Vulgate is so corrupted and so obviously contaminated that it
would be a criminal neglect of his duty for any intelligent editor now to re-
print the Vulgate, when he has at hand the material to control its vagaries
and to correct its absurdities.

ONE SELECTED MANUSCRIPT AS BASE.

No doubt to remedy the inherent defects in the last method as also to
avoid the dreaded semhara of pramai^as, it has been suggested by other
scholars that the best course would be to select one manuscript, the best
mmiuscript extant (of any versitoi presumably) and print it, with minimal
change, correcting caily the obvious and indispensable clerical o-rors and add-
ing the variants of the collated manuscripts.* This expedient, though un-

questionably simple and “safe”, and in most cases indubitably effective,
fails totally in the present instance, for two reasons : firstly and chiefly,
owing to the negligible age of our manuscripts, which are barely five hundred
years old ; and, secondly, owing to the systematic conflation which has been
carried on through ages of revisional and amplificatory activity. By follow-
ing any manuscript — even the oldest and the best — ^we shall be authenticating
just that arbitrary mixture of versions which it is the express aim of this
method to avoid !

This ^ggestion, however, has special interest, because the principle
underlying it has now been, partly and timidly, put into practice by Profes-
sor P. P. S. Sastri, in preparing his edition of the Southern recension, whereas
the three foregoing methods are mere castles in the air of theoretical critics.

£85} A CRITIQUE OF PROFESSOR SASTRl’S METHOD

Professor Sastri’s edition is an excellent demonstration of the inade-
quacy of the underlying principle, which has been repeatedly advocated,
showing up its defects as nothing else could. What Professor Sastri set out
to do is (to quote his own words) : to print the text as it is in the original
patm-leaf, liberty being taken only to correct scriptorial blunders,^ to weigh the
different readings in the additional n^nuscripts and choose the more import-
ant ones [scil. readings] for being added to the text by way of footnotes
How difficult it is to carry this out verbatim in practice and at the same time
to present a half-way readable text may be realized when we see how Sastri
has had to doctor his text. A few examples may be added to elucidate the
point. To begin with, Sastri does not follow the parvan division, nor the
adhyfiya division, of his basic manuscript, adding and omitting colophons
arbitrarily, in ordet to reach some imaginary norm. Secondly; he adds an
adhyaya of 40 lines after his adhy. 164, which is not found in his manus-
cript ! Thirdly, he omits one whole adhyaya of 40 lines, after his adhy. 180,
where ali Southern manuscripts, without exception (including his own exem-
plar) have it, and is moreover unaccountably silent about the omission !
Fourthly, in one place (his adhy. 122) he has omitted fourteen lin^ of the
text of his manuscript and added instead thirteen lines which are not found
in any Southern manuscript Fifthly and lastly, in yet another place (his
adhy. 214) he has added an interpolation {updkhydna) of 114 lines of which
not a singk tine (as actually printed in Sastri’s edition) is to be found in
any of the six manuscripts utilized by him ! These are some of the' things
that an extremely orthodox Southern Pandit actually does when he sets out
with the avowed object of printing up a Southern manuscript as it is, correct-
ing only “ scriptorial blunders.'’ I will not here speak of a certain number

of spurious lines which appear to have crept insidiously into his text from
the Vulgate and whose existence even he probably does not suspect.^ The
changes mentioned first are of a different order : they have been made' by
Sastri consciously and intentionally.

Let me not be misunderstood. I do not blame Sastri in the least for
taking such liberties with his manuscript, which is a tolerably good manus-
cript (though probably not very old), but has its faults like any other manus-
cript. I myself have had to proceed similarly, only more thoroughly, more
systematically. Our methods are similar in practice, though not in theory ;
that is, in hh theory. Sastri’s text is eclectic (an epithet often used by critics
with a tinge of reproach, the? ground of which it is not easy to perceive) :
as eclectic as any other Mahdbhdrata text, printed or in manuscript, that I
have seen. I have adduced the above instances chiefly to show what correct-
ing merely “scriptorial blunders” in Mahiabharata textual criticism really
ends in.

Thus it will be seen that the method of printing a Mahabharata manus-
cript as it is, viewed as a rigid principle, is a deplorable failure. The lateness
of our manuscript material {86} and the peculiar conditions of transmission
of the epic are responsible for the defection. They force upon us an eclectic
but cautious utilization of all manuscript classes. Since all categories of
manuscripts have their strong points and weak points, each variant must be
judged on its own merits.

WHAT IS THEN POSSIBLE ?

The Mahabharata problem is a problem sui generis. It is useless to
think of reconstructing a fluid text in a literally original shape, on the basis
of an archetype and a sternum codicum. What is then possible? Our ob-
jective can only be to reconstruct the oldest form of the text which it is pos-
sible to reach, on the basis of the manuscript material available.'^ With that
end in view, we must examine as many manuscripts — and above all as many
classes of manuscripts — as possible, and group them into families. We must
try to ascertain and evaluate the tradition of each family, eschewing late and
worthless material. We may then consider the relation of these traditions
in regard to the variae lectiones, and the genuine and spurious parts of the
text. Beyond that, we have to content ourselves with selecting the readings
apparently the earliest and choosing that form of the text which commends
itself by its documentary probability and intrinsic merit, recording again most
carefully the variants, and the additions and omissions. A little critical re-

tions ard really negligible.

maniement of the text need causd no alarm. For, as I have already observed,
it is hardly logical to assume that a text which is largely based on conjecture
is now beyond the reach of that principle. Of course there will always re-
main many doubts, but that consideration should not prevent us from cor-
recting those parts which can be corrected with confidence’ ; moreover, that
limitation applies to our comparatively well preserved classical texts, despite
the guarantee of the careful editings they have? undergone. However, owing
partly to the fluid character of the original and parly to the fragmentary and
inadequate information we possess as regards the origin, growth and trans-
mission of the text, it is incumbent on us to make Conservatism our watch-
word. We must abstain from effecting any change which is not in some
measure supported by manuscript authority.^

THE METHOD OF RECONSTRUCTION EXPLAINED

The method I have followed in reconstructing the text cannot, unfortu-
nately, be presented in the shape of short general rules. I shall endeavour,
however, to explain it as briefly as possible.

The’ main principle underlying all speculation as to authenticity is the
postulated originality of agreement between what may be proved to be {more
or less) independent £87} versions. The principle I have tried to follow reli-
giously — and I hope I have never deviated from it — is to accept as original a
reading or feature which is documented uniformly by all manuscripts alike
(N=S).

For instance, we frequently come across three-linedl stanzas, one of whose
lines is an “ inorganic line ”, that is, a line which can be added or omitted
without detriment to sense or grammar. These seemingly superfluous lines,
if proved by both recensions, have not been deleted ; they have been kept
scrupulously intact. A more important instance is of the initial adhyayas
of this parvan. The connection betweai adhy. 1-3 and what follows, as also
the connection between the three adhyayas inter 5e, is of most loose character.
There is further the suspicious circumstance that adhy. 4 begins precisely in
the same way as adhy. 1 ; both adhyayas have in fact the identical opening
(prose) sentence :

^ Few scholars, I imagine, would endorse the view of Pandit Vidhushekhara
Bhattacharya {Modem Review, Calcutta, for August 1928, page 176), that the
first prose sentence of our Mahabharata etc.), though found
in mss. without exception, diould be deleted from the Criticil Edition, because
it is intrmsioaUy inappropriate in the context. He writes : " They Iscfl
those lines] are to be found in dll the different versions of which MSS. are
collated for the present edition, though with some variant readings, but can we be
satisfied only with this ground as to their being genuine ** ? That is a little too
radical ! This edition cannot and should not proceed so far.



no


PROLEGOMENA


In Other words, adhy. 4 begins as though nothing had gone before ! The prose
sojtence seems to fit better the context of adhy. 4 than the context of adhy. 1 ;
but that is not material to my argument. It would have been possible to
athetize the first three adhyayas in order to remove this anomaly, relegating
them to the Appendix. But as all the four adhyayas are handed down in
exactly the same form (with the usual amount of variants) in all manuscripts
of both recensions, they were left perfectly intact. Here we have an old con-
flation of two different beginnings. They were not harmwiious in juxtaposi-
tion, but each was too good to lose, in the opinion of the ancient redactors.
They therefore put both in, making but a poor compromise.*

Another passage that may be thought to need some radical treatment is
the account of the cremation of PSindu and Madri. We are first told that the
king died in the forest, and Madri mounted the funeral pyre and was burned
with him (1. 116. 31). After this we read that their “bodies” {dartre) are
brou^ to the capital of the Kurus (1. 117. 30), and an elaborate royal
funeral takes place. In the account given in the following adhyaya (118),
from the description of the annointing and dressing of the king’s body, and
from Ihe remark that the king Icoked as if he were alive (1. 118. 20) ;

it is clear that no former burning is imagined. After PSijdu had been burned
with his favourite queen J/Edri on the funeral pyre, there could not have
been (as Hopkins* has justly pointed out) much corpse left or not enough
to dreSs and smear with sandal paste ! But the manuscripts do not render
us any hdp here. The passage is handed down in identical form in all manus-
cripts of both recensions.

The above examples will show that the diaskeuasts did not always em-
ploy any great art — ^I may add, fortunately — in conflating two discrepant ac-
counts of an incident, which is by no means an easy task. To resolve such
anomalies, however, is beyond the scope of this edition, since the entire
manuscript evidence unanimously supports the conflation, which is too old
and deep-rooted to be treatal by the ordinary principles of t^ual criticism.
If we wdit about, at this stage of our work, athetizing such passages as were
self-contradictory or as contradicted the data of some otho: part of the epic,
there would not be much left of the MaMbhSrata to edit in the end.

critical notes ; of these about {91} thirty have no variants at all, while the
remaining (seventy) show only insi^ificant variants, such as transposition,
substituticm of synonyms, and so on. The number of the latter daiss of
stanzas could naturally be easily augmented, by increasing the latitude of
permissible variation. Being handed down uniformly in all manuscripts
alike, they may be regarded as authentic (as least as far as manuscript evi-
dence goes), forming so to say, pieces of firm bedrock in the shifting quick-
sands of Mahabharata poetry. As such they will be valuable for the study
of epic style, dicticm, vocabulary and so on.

To return to the question of text reconstruction. The rule arising out of
the agreement between independent recensions or versions is easy to compre-
hend and simple to api^y ; only its sphere of operation is rather restricted.
Difficulties arise when there is fluctuation ; and that is the normal state.
When there was ffuctuatbn, the choice fell, as a corollary of the previous
rule, upon a reading which is documented by the largest number of '{what
prima facie afiirear to be) or less independemt versions, and which is

The presumption of originality in these cases is frequently confirmed by a
lack of definite agreem^t between the discrepant versions. The commonest
application of this rule is when iSi K or B (with or without D) agree with
S against their own agnates. Numerous examples of this type of agreement
have been adduced above (pp. liv, lxii).

Occasionally we get “ double ” agreement, that is, agreement between two
or more groups of each recension (N^ = and Nj = Sj) ; for example, when
( 1 ) Si K = M, and simultaneously B = TG,

or (2) Si K = TG, and simultaneously B = M.

Here one, of the agreements must, generally speaking, be accidental, since
both can hardly be original ; and either may be ad(q>ted, if th^y have equal
intrinsic merit. Owing to the much greater correctness and reliaWlity of Si
K, I have, as a rule, adopted the readings of this group, other things being
equal.

When the two recensions have alternate readings neither of which can
have come from the other and which have equal intrinsic merit (N : S), I
have, for the sake of consistency and with a view to avoiding unnecessary
and indiscriminate fusion of versions, adopted, as a stop-gap, the reading
of N. This rule is of very common application, since one constantly comes
across readings which are but paraphrases of each other and between which
it is impossible to discriminate. Examples of such alternative readings are :

When the above tests break down or when they give only a negative
result, the expedient adopted by me was to find a reading which best explans
how the other readings may have arisen. The true reading in this case has
often proved to be a lectio diffeilior, or an archaism or a solecism, the desire
to eliminate them being the cause of the variation. Here follow some

EMENDATION

Emoidatkxi has played a very incwi^icuous rSle in the preparation of
the constituted text. Interpretation has in general been given preference over
emendation. Even in the case of corrupt passages, the reading of some
manuscript or other gives sense, though it may not be the original sense, not
even a wholly satisfactory sense. Precipitate emendation is, however, to 1^
d^recated ; for experience has shown that but a small pri^rtion of sdiolars’
correctkms are really amendments. Moreover, in this special case, we know,
as yet, too little about the epic idiom and the epic world altogether ; as also
about the vicissitudes of the Q>ic text Besides, who can say that the original
was linguistically uniform, .and ccxiformed to any particular norm ? What

would be the style of a work which in the main is obviously a compilation ?

The text, as it has been fixed by me, contains about 35 emendations.
The corrections are generally very slight, being concerned mostly with single
isolated words, never with whole passages. Wherever even a single letter has
been added, omitted or altered, without the authority of any of the manus-
cripts, I have inserted an asterisk (*) in the text.

Only in very few instances do the emendations effected in this edition
make any difference to the sense , e. g. 1. 41. 5 nHss , where the

word ( an has been [93 ] added to the pMa, a word found only in D 2 ; the
other readings are :

( hypermetric ! ), seven combinations, each having a

different syllable between ^ and ! In a few cases the emendation affects
merely some grammatical form of the stanza in question; e. g. 1. 86 . 5
where the readings for are

( corruption of last ? ), ^ ( hypermetric 1 ).

But tiie large majority of our emendations concern merely metre and
sandhi My study of the manuscript material led nnte to the conclusion that
there was an ever growing antipathy, firstly, to hypermetric padas, in fact to
any form of metrical irregularity ; and, secondly, to forms of sandhi not
sanctioned or countenanced by Pmiini's great grammar. In particular, there
is noticeable a strong aversion to hiatus, evett where it wm permitted by rules
of grammaf. Hiatus between padas also came to be disapproved and was
removed by such expedients as that of adding a meaningless g or ^
at the beginning of the posterior pada.

Manuscripts betray the surreptitious efforts of the scribes and redactors
to eliminate hiatus ( sometimes even when it is grammatically permissible )
in the following instances among others : 1. 2. 91 ( between padas )

It is important to remember that emendation has been resorted to merely
for the purpose of unifying divergent and conflicting manuscript evidence,
never in opposition to clear and unanimous testimony of manuscripts. The
emendations are thus not amendments of the text in the ordinary sense of the
word, made in order to eke out a better sense when the manuscripts yield no
sense or an unsatisfactory sense ; they are rather an effort to find, so to say,
a hypothetical focus towards which the discrepant readings converge.

THE ** ADDITIONAL '' PASSAGES

The uniformity of the interrelationship of the different manuscripts, ver-
sions or recensions, as has been already explained, is disturbed chiefly by
comparison and conflation of manuscripts. A constant and fruitful source
of confusion, as was pointed out above, has always been the marginalia.
A more dangerous and troublesome source was the practice of incorporating
into one’s text — ^without stating the source and without much explanatory
comment— passages found in other versions. It may be surmised that cele-
brated places of pilgrimage like Ujjayini,^ Ramesvaram, Kia^I, and others,
with recitations of the epics held periodically in their famous shrines, have
played an important role in the dissemination of the knowledge of local ver-
sions among the pious visiting pilgrims, whose number undoubtedly included
the bards and the professional reciters of the epics.

{95} Much light is thrown on the origin of these misch-codices by the
MS. K 4 , a manuscript belonging to the Bombay Government Collection depo-
sited at the Institute. In this manuscript we find long extracts from other
cognate versions (such as y) as also from the Southern recension, written out
on separate folios and inserted at appropriate places in the body of the ma-
nuscript, with the words written on the margin of the original

1 Baija’s Kddamban (ed. Peterson, p. 61) refers to a recitation of the Mbh.
on the fourteenth day of the half month in the temple of Mahakala at Ujjain, which
the queen attends.

folio, near the place where the passage is to be interpolated. Should this
manuscript happen to be copied again and should the copyist insert the
passage at the place indicated by the previous scribe, the interpolation would
become an integral part of thei new text which is exti/erwlly ^xbsolutely indis-
tinguiskable from the rest of the text.

This! leads us to the question of additional passages in general. Our
attitude with regard to them is quite clear, in my opinion. The first and
foremost source of our knowledge as to what the Mahabhiarata comprises, is
and must remain the manuscript evidaice itself. For example, the question
—which seems to trouble a great many people, judging by the inquiries on
the point received at the Institute — whether the Uttara^ta, Gajendramok§a
and Anusmrti are parts of the Mahiabharata, must be answered by the
manuscripts themselves. If none of our manuscripts contain these passages,
it is prima facie evidence that they are not parts of the Mahabharata. There is
nothing to suggest that our Mahabharata manuscripts have suffered any
serious loss at any time. There never was any lack of manuscripts, many of
which were preserved carefully in temples, and which must have been copied
repeatedly, for the enhancement of merit. There is no evidence of any break
in the tradition at any time or any place, within the confines of India at
least. The probable inference is that cur manuscripts contain all that was
there originally to hand down, and tnore. What late writers and commenta-
tors have said about passages not found in our manuscripts is always a mat-
ter of secondary importance ; it cannot ipso facto nullify or override the pri-
mary evidence of manuscripts. Such extrinsic testimony has only local or
personal value ; it can always be rebutted by the evidence of the Mahabhiarata
manuscripts.

Likewise, whether an episode, adhyaya, passage, stanza or line may be
regarded as belonging to the Mahabharata or not must primarily depend up-
on whether the manuscripts contain it. Extrinsic evidence, in so far as it is
valid, will principally hold good only for the period or locality to which it be-
longs. Intrinsic evidence may be considered ; but, being of a subjective cha-
racter, it must be used with caution. Our primary evideince being the ma-
nuscripts themselves, we are bound to view with suspicion, as a matter of
principle, any part of the text which is found only in one recension, or only
in a portion of our critical apparatus. Therefore, the evidence for such pas-
sages as are contained only in one manuscript, or a small group of manus-
cripts or versions, or even in a whole recension must be pronounced to be
defective. Consequently, all lines belonging to one recension only, and a
fortiori such as pertain to a combination of manuscripts amounting to less
than a recension, for which there is nothing corresponding in the other recen-
sion and which are not absolutely necessary for the context — all linesj, in
short, with a defective title— have been placed in the footnotes or tho Appen-
dix, pending further inquiry regarding their credentials.

Such passages are not all necessarily spurious. There might be a hun-
dred good reasons why the questionable passages are missing in a particular
recension or version. It Might conceivably be, for instance, that the shorter
recension represents (as certain {96} scholar has said) “a mutilated and
hastily put together compositicMi of the Middle Indian Redactors, who could
not lay their hands on all manuscripts of the Mahiabhiarata The shorter
version might again be, theoretically, a consciously abridged or expurgated
version. Or, more simply, the omission might be due to mere oversight of
some scribe who had quite unintentionally omitted the defaulting passage and
this mistake of the first scribe had been perpetuated by the other copyists.
And so on and so forth. But all these are mere possibilities. All these reasons
in general and particular must be adduced and proved, or at least made pro-
bable, in any given case. Moreover, the manuscripts clearly show that there
has been in progress, through centuries, constant comparison of manuscripts.
In view of this circumstance, the explanation that the omission of a passage
in la whole version might be due to a scribe’s omission loses much of its force.
Omission is as much a fact in Mahdbhdrata textual tradition as addition.
And it is( fair to demand of a person who alleges the authenticity of such
one-recension passages why the rival recension does not contain it.^

The general condemnation of a recension or version that it is mutilated,
merely on the ground that it lacks certain passages that are found in a rival
recension or version, is entirely meaningless ; for the argument might easily
be reversed, so that the controversy will resolve merely into mutual vitupe-
ration. What I mean is this. From the fact that one of the recensions, say
N, does not contain a certain passage or a certain set of passages found in
another, say S, it is illogical to argue that N is a mutilated version ; because
such an argument can with equal cogency be applied to S, in regard to certain
other passages that are missing in S but found in N. The ix)int isi so im-
portant and at the same time so difficult to grasp that I shall endeavour to
make my meaning clearer with the help of a concrete illustration. My con-
tention is this. From the fact that the Southern recension contains, say, the
Nalayani episode (App. I, No. lOD), which is mining in the Northern re-
cension, it would be illogical to argue that the Northern recension is defective

or "mutilated ; because one can, with equal cogency, seek to establish the muti-
lation or defection of the Southern recension by pointing, say, to the Gatije§a
passage, which is found only in certain Northern manuscripts and is entirely
missing in the Southern manuscripts. The argument could have been em-
ployed with greater semblance of reason and plausibility, had there been only
a "mere plus or minus on either side, but is entirely without cogency in the
present instance where there are both additions and omissions on both sides.

{97} Originality and authenticity are, unfortunately, not the prerogative
of any single recension or version or manuscript.^ They must be established,
laboriously, chapter by chapter, line by line, word by word, syllable by syll-
able.2 The optimistic view that any extant manuscript, however old and
trustworthy, of some favoured version or recension, could give us, with a
few additions and alterations, the text of Vyiasa*s Bharata or Mahabharata
is the index of a naive mentality and does! not need any elaborate refutation.

The argumant in favour of any particular recension or version or text
is frequently sought to be strengthened by a reference to the authority of the
Parvasalmgraha (Adi 2), a week reed on which every tyro leans rather heavi-
ly in the beginning, and it would be well to examine the argument here.

THE PARVASAMGRAHA ARGUMENT

Until lately high hopes had been entertained that the Parvasalmgraha-
parvan (Adi 2) would supply the clue to the solution of the perplexing ques-
tion of the reconstruction of the original Mahabharata. But the paradoxical
situation created by the circumstance that two different editors of the Virafa-
parvan, both of whom rely mainly on the data of the Parvasalmgraha for es-

stanzas;^ has created grave misgivings in the minds of unbiassed critics as to
whether the Parvasalmgraha can render us any help at all in reconstructing the
text of the Mahabharata, and these misgivings appear justified by the facts
of the case.

The exaggerated importance which the late Mr. Utgikar was inclined to
attach to the numerical data of the Parvasatrhgraha, was, I believe, mainly,
if not wholly, due to his mistaken belief that there was complete agreement
between the two rival recensions in all material particulars as r^ards the
text of this adhyaya. This erroneous and wholly unfounded notion seems to

have been induced by the ambiguous and thoroughly misleading character of
the text of the Khumbhakonam edition, which claims to be an edition “mainly
based on South Indian texts ”, but presents a version of this adhyaya which
has been unblushingly copied from the Bombay and Calcutta editions, ignor-
ing wholly the Southern divergences, which are quite considerable.

Not only are there discrepancies between the two recensions as regards
the numbers of the adhyayas and the slokas in the various parvans, there is no
complete agreement even between the different versions of the same recen-
sion. Take, for instance, the case of the Adiparvan itself. Our constituted
text (following the iS^rada codex) gives (1. 2. 96) the number of ^okas in
the Adi as 7884. But this is not the only reading of that number. For the
digit representing the thousands alone, the choice lies between seven, eight,
nine and ten ! There can, therefore, be no doubt that the text of this adh-
yaya also has been tampered with and designedly altered, from time to time
in various {98} ways, in order to make it harmonize with the inflated version
of a later epoch. It will thus have to be admitted that the parvasarhgraha
argument is of secondary importance and must not be pressed too far.

Be that as it ma!y, it is extremely problematic whether we could make
any use whatsoever of the Parvasaimgraha enumeration of Slokas in the case
of the Adi at leasts because it will be difficult to compute the extent of this
parvan and that for two reasons. Firstly, because this parvan, as is well
known, contains two lengthy prose adhyayas (3 and 90). Taking the figure
of the Parvasairhgraha to represent the exact extent of the whale of the Adi,
it is not clear how the prose portions were computed by the compilers of the
Parvasairhgraha. Most of the modem computers add the numbers of stmzas
to the number of their respective prose sections, and arrive at the length of
the Adi in slokas ! But this is bad arithmetic. P. P. S. Sastri offers a solu-
tion which is more ingenious than convincing. He holds the compiler of the
Parvasaimgraha down to the letter of his statement. The Parvasarhgraha
tells us, says Sastri, merely the number of slokas which the different parvans
contain. Nothing is said about the prose sections. He therefore ignores the
prose adhyayas in computing the extent of the Adi, and is satisfied that his
text exactly agrees with the data of the Parvasamgraha !

The other difficulty in the way of using the Parvasaimgraha figure in
the case of the Adi is that this parvan contains a large number of Tri^tubh
stanzas, which again introduce an element of uncertainty in the computation.
Was each Tri§tubh stanza counted as one sloka ; or did the Bharata-cintakas
(mentioned in 1. 2. 172) compute the exact equivalent of the long-metre
stanzas in Slokas ? It is difficult to say. The difference in the reckoning will
be, however, between 40 and 50 per cent, of the total ! As a very rough esti-
mate, the Adi may contain something like 5(X) long-metre stanzasL This fac-
tor alone would introduce a difference of about 225 stanzas !

PROI^GOMENA


These are some of the obvious difficulties in the way of making any prac-
tical use of the figure recorded in the Parvasarhgraha for text-critical purposes.
The computation ujay have some value in the case of a parvan in which
there is no prose at ail, which is almost wholly in anustubh metre, and for
which finally the Parvasaimgraha figure is certain, the manuscript evidence
being unanimous.

It is quite within the range of probability that the apparent extent of
the critical text of a parvan may fall appreciably below or rise appreciably
above the figure recorded in the Parvasalriigraha, as is actually the case with
other editions. Moreover, unless it can be made probable that the compi-
lation of this “ Table of Contents '' is nearly contemporaneous with tlie pre-
sent redaction of the Great Epic, these discrepancies will be without much co-
gency in matters relating to the constitution of the text. The value of a
manuscript}, version, oil printed text of the! Mahabhiarata must not
be thought to depend exclusively or even mainly upon its algreement with or
discrepancy from the numerical data of the Parvasalriigraha. It must in final
analysis be regarded as depending upon the place it occupies in a logical and
convincing scheme formulated to explain the evolution of the different extant
versions and types of Mahabharata manuscripts.

It should further be carefully borne in mind that even if there be exact
agreement as to extent between the Parvasalriigraha and any constituted text,
this fact alorie is no guarantee of the absolute correctness of the entire text,
line for line, because the samel £99} number of stanzas could be made up in
innumerable different ways by accepting and rejecting stanzas of doubtful au-
thenticity and uncertain documentation, of which there is always a plentiful
supply in every parvan. The difficulty will finally not be solved even if we
happen to light upon a unique manuscript which agrees with the Parvasarii-
graha exactly as to the number of stanzas in any particular parvan and we
should adopt its verbcUim ; because there is every probability that while
it satisfies the one criterion of extent given by the Parvasarhgraha, it may not
satisfy, in every respect, other and more exacting critical tests, when compar-
ed line by line and word by word with other extant manuscripts.

In the above discussion I have implicitly assumed, as is done by most
writers on the subject, that the word sloka in the Parvasariigraha chapter has
the usual meaning “ stanza This interpretation was called into question,
by the late Mahamahopadhyaya Haraprasad Shastri, who offered a new in-
terpretation, which I cannot but think is far more plausible, although I do
not agree with all the conclu^ons he deduces therefrom.

The really valuable discovery of the Mahamahopadhyaya, in my opi-
nion, is that the word ilcka cannot mean here stanza or verse of anything of
the kind, but must denote (as in the parlance of scribes and vendors of ma-
nuscripts) a unit of, meamemmt af written matter, comprising 32 syllaWes

of ak§aras.^ The difficulty of computing prose passages and the l<mg-metre-
stanzas mentioned above finds a satisfactory sdution at once in this interpre-
tation of the word “41oka”. And that is moreover the only interpretation
of the word which, as far as I can see, can successfully solve that difficulty,
in view of the circumstance that the text is heterogeneous, consisting of §lo-
kas, prose, and Icmg-metre stanzas. But in this supposition we shall have to
count, not only the actual text (consisting of prose and verse), but the whole
of the written matter. And that enumeration, whether it be 7884, 8884,
9884 or 9^4, will include not only the text properly so called but also the
colophons and the hundreds of the prose formulaic references (like

) besides perhaps the captions of adhyayas, sub-parvans and parvans,
and even the numerical figures denoting the numbers of 41(4ras, and so on.

The number of adhyayas in our editirm (225) does not tally with the

number given in the Parvasaimgraha (218), any more than in any of the

previous editions : the Calcutta edition of the Adi has 234 adhySyas, the

Bombay editions vary between 234 and 236, while the Kumbhakonam edi-

tion reaches the astcxiishing figure 260, though the Parvasarhgraha figure in
the case 'if each of these latter editions is the same, 227.

It may be pointed out that the adhyaya division in our extant manus-
cripts is extremely arbitrary. The average length of our adhyayas should be
about 35 stanzas ; but adhy. 12 and 22 of our edition contain only 5 stan-
zas each, while adhy. 57 (to mention only one instance) has over 100 stan-
zas. As regards the contents of the adhyayas also there is mudi inomsist-
ency. Thus we frequently find that one adhyaya ends with the remark that
a certain person spoke as follows, and his speech, which may be quite short,
forms the beginning of the following adhyaya. Then again the manuscripts
are far from being unanimous in the matter of marking the coloiffions :
they show in fact wild £100} fiuctuaticms. Even the reading of the Parva-
saihgraha figure is not entirely free from doubt (e.g. our Saradfi cod^ gives
the number of the adhySyas as 230 !), though the reading 218 seems highly
probaUe.

Under these circumstances, nothing would be easier than to manipulate
the colophons, by arbitrarily combining the conflicting data of the different
recensions or versions or even manuscripts and arriving at my required
figure. This has actually bear done by Professor P. P. S. Sastri in his
edition of the Southern Recension, which thereby adrieves the dubious dis-
tinction of being the only edition of the Adiparvan in which the adhyaya
number agrees exactly with the Parvasaimgraha figure but the colophons are
mostly at the wrong places. This procedure is the less excusable in his case

as he is at great pains to create the impression that he is just reprodudng
the text of one selected manuscript, correcting only “ scriptorial ” blunders.
Now his basic manuscript (i '= our G«) divides the Adi into two separate
major parvans, Adiparvan and Sanhbhavaparvan, with 40 and 200 num-
bered adhySyas respectively,' which makes a total of 240 adhyayas, and which
is nearer the Kumbhakonam figure (260) than the Parvasaihgraha figure
(218). While correcting “scriptorial blunders”. Professor Sastri has, so to
say, spirited away 22 colophons before our very eyes

A more careful study of the manuscript evidence may tend to reduce
the discrepancy between the constituted text and the data of the Parvasaih-
graha as regards the number of the adhyayas, or at any rate may enable us
to account for the difference, though at present it seems impossible to har-
monize the manuscript evidence (consisting of the actual colophrms) with
the Parvasamgraha.


INTERPOLATION

There has been an extraordinary reluctance among schc4ars to face the
fact that the Mahabharata manuscripts may contain and do contain quanti-
ties of spurious matter. But there is now no excuse for such recalcitrance.
The critical apparatus of this edition contains a unique record of hundreds
of lines which are evidently and unquestionably spurious. Here is a list of
passages from our Appendix, each found in one manuscript only : App. I,
No. 2 (in Kg marg. : containing 4 lines); No. 4 (Kj : 14 lines); No. 5
(B* : 23 lines) ; No. 7 (Gi : 4 lines) ; No. 16 (K^ : 9 lines) ; No. 25 (D^ : 4
lines) ; No. 26 (B^ : 6 lines) ; No. 31 (K 4 : 27 lines) ; No. 34 (K 4 : 6
lines) ; No. 44 (Dj : 24 lines) ; No. 49-50 Da^ : 21 lines) ; No. 66 (D« :
47 lines) : No. 70 (Gi : 8 lines) ; No. 74 (B^ : 9 lines) ; No. 94 (D^ : 31
lines) ; No. 98 (D^ : 50 lines) ; etc., etc. These are passages from the Ap-
pendix alone, to which many of them have been relegated on account of either
their, length or their irrelevancy ; but the foot-notes contain hundreds, nay
thousands, of lines of precisely the same character. Then there are also lines
whidi are found in <Hily two or three manuscripts, of which I have counted
some 300 instances. A number of new additions have been now given by
Professor Sastri, who has examined other Telugu and Grantha manuscripts
for his editicm of the Adi in the Southern recension. And I am fully persuad-
ed that if we examine yet other manuscripts, we diall still find fresh passages
which had never been seen or heard of before. No sane person would main-
tain that these are all original passages lost in all manuscripts except the few
late and inferior manuscripts in which they happen to occur.

{ 101 } It is not always easy, as has already been remarked, to prove
that these “ additional ” passages are interpolations. The epic metre is easy
to imitate ; the epk grammar is flexible ; the epic style is nondescript. The
additional lines are generally fashioned with skill, and fitted in with curaflng.

An interesting instance of a passage which is betrayed by its contents is
an extravaganza in some Grantha manuscripts. This bizarre interpolation^
describes among other things, with circumstantial detail, the marriage of Pa-
rasara and Satyavati (alias Matsyagandha). At this ceremony, the shades
of the ancestors of both the bride and the bridegroom are invoked, all the de-
tails of a r^lar Hindu marital rite are minutely observed, and the marriage
is solemnized in the presence of Vasi§tha, Yajnavalkya and other great R§is
living in the Naimi§a forest, with the distribution of baksheesh to Brahmins.
It is an interesting speculation whether credulity can go so far as to regard
e\’en such passages as an authentic part of the original Mahabharata or Bha-
rata of Vyiasa, just because the passage is found in some MahabhSrata
manuscripts.

The foot-notes contain a rare selection of passages that are either palpab-
ly absurd, sometimes ccmtradicting the immediate context, or else have little
connection with the ccmtext in which they lie embedded : quotations, glosses,
fanciful additions of details, the jetsam and flotsam of Mahabharata poesie.

These bewildering fluctuations in the text are quite unique, being pecu-
liar to the Mahabharata. TTiey are not found in the manuscripts of the Vedic
literature or in those of grammatical, philosophical, or rhetorical texts or of
the works of the classical poets and dramatists. This only proves that the
Mahabharata was peculiarly liable to inflation and elaboration.

When I say that the MaMbharata manusaipts contain quantities of
spurious additional, I intend no disparagement or condemnation of the text
or of the manuscripts. The process is normal, inevitable and in a wider sense
wholly right. If the epic is to continue to tie a ^ital force in the life of any
progressive people, it tmist be a slow-changing hook ! The fact of expurga-

tion and elaboration is ony an outward indication of its being a book of inspi-
ration and guidance in life, and not merely a book lying unused and forgotten
on a dusty book-shelf. Those are probably just the touches that have saved
the Mahabharata from the fate of being consigned to the. limbo of oblivion,
which has befallen its sister epics like the Gilgamesh.

£102} To give only one illustration. The awkwardness of the sexual
relations of some of those epic characters of bygone ages must have been in-
deed a puzzle and a source of constant tribulation to the reciter of the epics
(IPauraipika) , who was called upon to narrate, explain and justify those old-
world stories to his devout and impressionable audiences, in the course of his
recitations, which were, in the post-epic period, nothing more than edifying
popular sermons. It is then no wonder that the shrewd ones among these pas-
tors of the people, these professicKial keepers of their morals, should have oc-
casionally taken the bull by the horn, so to say, and boldly added or subs-
tituted, bona fide, details which harmonized better with their own conceptions
of right and wrong or with those of their pious flock.

A PROBLEM IN “TEXTUAL DYNAMICS”

After what has been said above, it is needless to add that the constituted
text is based on all versions of both recensicms and prepared on eclectic prin-
ciples. I have given in the text whatever in each case appeared to be support-
ed by the balance of probabilities, but all important deviations in the manus-
cripts are noted in the critical ai^ratus, so that every reader has, at his dis-
posal, the entire material for controlling and correcting the constituted text,
where necessary. All important elements of the text — lines, phrases, signi-
ficant words and even word-parts^— that are less than certain, are indicated by
a wavy line printed below them. Sli^t differences in the spellings of words,
of pro^r names (e.g. ) and some minor details (such as the ex-
pletives or the prose formulae ^ are ignored for this

purpose. This device is, by nature, hard to apply strictly, and there are
bound to be many inconsistencies in its application. I have retained it all
the same with the express object of obviating all false sense of security. This
wavy line, running through the entire length of the text is, to my mind, the
symbol and constant remembrancer of this essential fact in MahabhSrata
textual criticism that the MaMbharata is not and never was a fixed rigid teM,
but is fluctuating q>ic tradition, a theme mec variations, not unlike a popular
Indian melody. Our objective ^ould consequently not to be to arrive at an
archetype (which practically never existed), but to represent, view and explain
the epic tradition in all its variety, in all its fullness, in all its ramifications.
Ours is a problem in textual dynamics, rather than in textual statics.

To put it in other woras, the Mahabharata is the whde of the q>ic tra-
dition : the entire Critical Apparatus. Its separation into the constituted text
and the critical notes is only a static representation of a constantly dianging

epic text — a representaticti made for purpose of visualizing, studying and ana-
lyzing the panorama of the more grand and less grand thought-movetnents
that have crystallized in the shape of the texts handed down to us in our
Mahabharata manuscripts.

WHAT IS THE CONSTITUTED TEXT?

To prevent misconception in the mind of the casual reader, it is best to
state at first what the constituted text is not.^ The editor is firmly convinced
that the text {103} presented in this edition is not anything like the auto-
graph copy of the work of its mythical author, Maharsi Vyasa. It is not, in
any sense, a reconstruction of the Ur-Mahabharata or of the Ur-Bharata, that
ideal but impossible desideratum. It is also not an exact replica of the poem
recited by Vaisairhpayana before Janamejaya. It is further wholly uncertain
how close it approaches the text of the ix)em said to be recited by the Suta
(or Sauti) before iSaunaka and the other dwellers of the Naimisa forest.

It is but a modest attempt to present a version oj the epic as old as the
extant mmuscript 7mieriai will permit us to reach with some semblance of
confidence. It is, in all probability, not the best text of the Great Epic, pos-
sible or existing, nor necessarily even a good one. It only claims to be the
most ancient one according to the direct line of transmission, purer than the
others in ^ far as it is free from the obvious errors of copying and spurious
additions. It may be regarded, if the editor has done his work properly, the
ancestor of all extant manuscripts, or, to be precise, of the manuscripts exa-
mined and collated for this edition. The constituted text cannot be accurate-
ly dated, nor labelled as pertaining to any particular place or personality.
Since our manuscripts are comparatively modern, our text cannot claim to be
very cld. It goes without saying that (precisely like every other edition) it
is a mosaic of old and new matter. Thait is to say, in an average adhyaya
of this edition (as of any other edition) we my read a stanza of the second
century B.c. followed by one written in the second century a.d. Sometimes
the gap will occur in the middle of a line, precisely a's in every other edition.
This unevenness and these inequalities are inevitable, conditioned as they are
by the very nature of the text and the tradition.

^ The Vulgate text of the Mahabharata is fairly readable and will appear
in places, at first sight, to be even “ better ” than the critical text, because the

^ Thus Professor Sastri (Southern Recension, Vol. I, Introduction, p. xiii)
writes about this edition : “Whilst the Poona edition lays claim, to constitute tlie
text of the Mahabharata as closely as {103} possible W Vydsai'^^ version of the
same, the principle underlying this edition ” etc. Even Professor Sylvain L^:vi, in
a revieM of this edition (//I. ‘Oct. — ^Dec. 1929, p. 347) wrote : “Si j’osais me per-
mettre une suggestion dans ce domaine, je conseillerais a I’editeur de renoncer, par

former has been purged by the cQntinuous emendations of scholars for cem
turies. A whole army of anonymous scholars aind poets must have worked
at the text to make it smooth and easy of comprehension, and to increase its
popularity and usefulness by adding to it interesting anecdotes, incoirporating
into it current and popular versions and explanations, bringing it in a line with
the ethical, moral, religious and political ideas of essentially different ages.

The reader will find that the cc«istituted text is by no means smooth. It
contains fresh instances of loose and archaic linguistic forms and construc-
tions, anacoluthons and lack of syntactical concord. There remain many
contradictions and superfluities There is evident lack of finish in the hidden
parts. These blemishes — if they be blemishes in epic poetry, which is dyna-
mic poetry, with no necessary pretensions to niceties of style, in the narrower
sense of the term — must have been inherent in the old poem. Where they
are met with in the critical text, they are not speculative fiction ; they are do-
cumented by the manuscripts themselves or at least are inferable from them
with a high degree of probability.

[104} For the shortcomings mentioned above, the constituted text has
merits also. It cleanses the text of puerile modern accretions and obvious
errors of repetition, which lengthen and weaken the text. It solves a certain
number of textual riddles (bogus kutas), which were the outcome of long
standing corruptions and unskilful conflation. It rescues from undeserved
oblivion many an authentic archaism, which had been gradually ousted in the
course of transmission of the text.

Sooner than print up the text of one manuscript, however reliable it
may be, declining to shoulder the responsibilities attaching to the work of an
editor, I have ventured on the perilous path of text reconstruction, in the
hope and belief that it will present a more faithful picture of the original
than any extant manuscript could do. That to prepare such a text is a phe-
nomenally difficult task, no one can realize bettei than the editor himself. It
is as certain afe inevitable that in preparing a text like this the editor will
frequently make blunders, even gross blunders.

It is to be feared that there is no royal road in this incomparably diffi-
cult field. The only path left open to us by which we may return to the ori-
ginal Mahabharata or Bharata is the rough, narrow, scientific foot-path of
repeated trial and error. More than one attempt will probably have to be
made before the ideal is attained. It will, therefore, be prudent not to claim
too much for the first critical edition, nor to expect too much from it.

OTHER EDITIONS

Of the old editions it must be said that they are creditable performances,
but they lack the critical apparatus. We do not know on what manuscripts
they are based, according to what principles the editors have prepared the

text, information essential on account of the wild fluctuations of the manus-
cripts. That is why they have been almost wholly ignored in the present
edition.

The editia princeps (Calcutta 1836) remains the best edition of the Vul-
gate, after the laipse of nearly a century. The later text editions, as is unfor-
tunatdy too often the case with our editions, add to the editio princeps only
a fresh crop of spurious lines and misprints.

The well-known potlfi-iorm Bombay editions (published by Ganpat
Krishnaji in Saka 1799,, and Gopal Narayan in 1913, and others), which
include NJlakan'tha’s scholium, are supposed to represent Nalakaiotha's text ;
but they contain many readings and lines which are not to be found in the
Nilakantha manuscripts, and are therefore net wholly reliable.

The Kumbhakooam edition, which is said to be “ mainly based on the
South Indian texts ”, is a fine representative of the composite Telugu version ;
it has been of immense help to me in the study of what may be called “ con-
flate ” readings. In former years its chief value lay in that it gave the reader
glimpses, however imperfect and confused, of the important Southern recen-
sion. IlTs now rendered obsolete and superfluous by P. P. S. Sastri’s new
edition of the Mahabharata, which will presently be described, and which is
unquestionably a better representative of the Southern tradition.

005} The Grantha edition (Sarfojirajapuram 1896) and the old
Telugu edition (Madras 1855) were not examined : they are not likely to
contain anything of high importance that is not found in the other editions
or manuscripts collated for this edition.

The editions accompanied by vernacular translations, which form a very
numerous class, are mostly bald reprints of one or the other of the earlier
(printed) editions and may be completely ignored here ; they are perfectly
useless for critical purposes.

The new edition^ of the Southern recension of the Mahabharata by Pro-
fessor P. P. Subrahmanya Sastri of Madras, now in the course of publica-
tion, which has been referred to several times already, is a laudable attempt
to supply a long-felt want. He deserves the cordial thanks of all lovers of
Sanskrit literature in general and of the Great Epic in particular, for his
courageously undertaking such a stupendous and exacting task and pursu-
ing it steadfastly, single-handed, during the sicanty leisure permitted by his
official duties as •Professor of Sanskrit in the Presidency College of Madras,

sense rendered superfluous by the Critical Edition, although most of the in-
formation it contains is cr will be included, in some shape or other, in the
present edition. The gulf between the Northern and the Southern recensions
is so vast, that it is extremely difficult, if not practically impossible, to re-
construct the Southern text, completely and correctly, from the critical notes
of this edition.

The principles on which the text of this edition of the Southern recension
of the Mahabharata is prepared have been set forth and briefly discussed
above. The editor, it was pointed out, fondly cherishes the unfounded be-
lief that he is printing a Grantha manuscript as it is, but consciously and un-
consciously he has introduced so many important innovations, that the text,
as a whole, must be pronounced to be eclectic; as eclectic as any text — at least
as far as the Adiparvan is concerned— published so far. For far less important
deviations from the manuscripts have I condemned, above, the editions of
the Vulgate. Judged as an eclectic edition, it must be pronounced to be in-
ferior. The i>rinciple Sastri has laid down is a simple one to follow ; in
fact nothing could be simpler ; he is to print the text of a selected manuscript
as it is, only correcting clerical errors. And it is to be greatly regretted that he
dees not follow rigorously this principle. Fie constantly flouts it, in pursuit of
some imaginary norm. Clear as his principle is, his actual procedure is some-
what paradoxical. He has left innumerable minor “inferior” readings in
possession of the text (when he could have with perfect confidence, if net
certainty, put into his text the correct readings), because he ostensibly wants
to present the text as it is in one selected manuscript ; on the ether hand, he
has light-heartedly, on utterly insufficient grounds, effected very substantial
additions (in one instance extending to 140 lines), omissions and other un-
warranted alterations (such as transpositions of adhyayas), in the utterly mis-
taken (though unquestionably bona fide) belief that he is correcting only the
“ scriptorial blunders” of his exemplar, when the> are in reality (as is shown
by the evidence of cognate versions) nothing of the kind.

{106} The sub-title “ Southern Recension ” is perhaps a trifle ambi-
tious, at least as far as the Adi is concerned ; because, firstly, he has utilized
only six Southern manuscripts (1 Telugu and 5 Granthas), even less than the
number (18) of the Southern manuscripts collated for our edition; and,
secondly, he has completely ignored one whole Southern version, the import-
ant Malayialam version, in my opinion, the most important of Southern
versions.

Further, it may be questioned whether the edition deserves to be called a
critical editicn at all, since, as was pointed out above, the. editor is avowed-
ly aiming only at reproducing the text, of one manuscript, categorically re-
nounieng the obligation of the textual critic to restore the text, as far as pos-
sible, to its original form.

The inclusion in Sastri’s text of a certain number of stray lines and even
a few lengthy passages which are peculiar to the Northern recension and
absolutely foreign to the Southern/ throws much light on the unconscious
process of the growth of the epic and the irresistible influence which the Vul
gate exerts on a text that is coming into being, in other words, on that subtle
process of textual osmosis (if I may term it so) by which the epic texts have
become conflated. Sastri’s explanations in his Introduction as well as his
procedure elucidate much of the psychology for the ancient scribes and re-
dactors, who have in the past shaped our Mahabharata texts for us. Uncon-
sciously he seems to have worked on the identical principles on which the an-
cient scribes have worked. His edition is a true lineal descendant of the Ma-
habhaiata manuscripts of South India.

In preparing Appendix I of this edition ( in which there is a strong pre-
ponderance of the Southern element), I had to go rather carefully over
Sastri’s text of the Adi, when I came across far too many inaccuracies in the
passages for which I checked his text and critical notes with the collations of
the manuscripts common to our critical apparatus. The critical notes of the
edition l^ve much to be desired. He has mostly shown correctly the addi-
tional passages in the manuscripts examined by him ; but he fails, as a rule,
to note the transpositions, omissions, and above all repetitions, which often
are, critically, highly significant, probably again in the erroneous belief that
they are negligible “ scriptorial blunders.” Some of them are undoubtedly
so, but not all. Likewise he has not always shown correctly the additions
and omissions of the colophons, and yet he is evidently most anxious to
reach the number 218, given by the Parvasalrhgraha. All deviations, however
trivial they may seem to him, he should have scrupulously noted, as a matter
of principle, because he must realize that with his utterly negligible critical
apparatus — comprising only five or six manuscripts out of a total of more
than three hundred manuscripts of the Adi — it is wholly impossible for him
to understand and explain the full significance of all the textual features
and anomalies of the manuscripts examined by him. I will not take him
to task for the numerous wrong readings which have inadvertently crept
into his text, because I know, from personal experience, that it would be
a physical impossibility to combine any high degree of accuracy with the
pace at which he is compelled to bring out the volumes. But it is inevitable
that the discovery of such inaccuracies should give rise to a sense of insecur-
ity and suspicion ini thej mind of the reader in respect of those matters that
he has to take from the editor on trust.

materially from the many merits of the work, from the incalculable advant-
age we derive from having a Southern version of an entire parvan in Deva-

niagait transcript, printed in handy volumes, because thei Southern manusc-
cripts are really most inconvenient for the purposes of rapid consultation.
I should be indeed very ungrateful if I did not frankly admit that Professor
Sastri’s edition has been of immense help to me, personally, for the study
of the Southern recension, and I have no doubt that it will also help other
workers in the field in future.


There remains for me the pleasant duty of recording all the encouragement and
assistance I and my colleagues on the Mahabharata Editorial Board have received
from different quarters in the course of our labours in this connection.

To Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, B. A., Ruler of Aundh, whose libera-
lity made it in the first instance possible for the Institute to undertake this ambitious
project — the greatest philogical enterprise undertaken in India within living me-
mory — I have to tender on behalf of myself and other people like myself interested
in the study and regeneration of our great National Epic, our most sincere and cor-
dial thanks. For the numerous marks of personal kindness with which the Chief
Saheb has favoured me, in this connection, on all occasions, I have to offer him the
expression of my profound gratitude. His unflagging zeal and irrepressible optimism
have helped me to carry on the work in the face of heavy odds. The Chief Saheb
has been pleased to enliven the dry and scientific character of the work by contri-
buting to this edition excellent paintings of scenes selected from the Great Epic,
paintings especially prepared under his expert guidance and supervision, for the
purposes of this edition.

I have next to record the gratitude of the promoters of this scheme to various
distinguished donors : the Imperial Government of India ; the Provincial Govern-
ments of Bombay, Madras and Burma ; the Governments of H. E. H. the Nizam
of Hyderabad, H. H. the Maharaja of Mysore, H. H. the Gaekwad of Baroda ; the
Chief of Phaltan and other enlightened and patriotic Rulers and Chiefs of Indian
States ; the University of Bombay ; and diverse other generous donors : who have
all rendered valuable financial assistance to the scheme and contributed their share
to that measure of success which has already been achieved. In this connection I
must not forget to mention the kind offices of my old friend the Honourable Mr.
Mukundarao R. Jayakar, M. A., Bar-at-law, Member of the Legislative Assembly,

whose selfless interest in the success of this project has moved him to exert his

influence for enlisting the sympathy and securing the help of some of the distin-
guished donors mentioned above.

I must next record my grateful thanks for help of various kinds I have received
from my colleagues on the Mahabharata Editorial Board, namely : Prof. S. K.
Belvalkar, M. a., Ph. D., I. E. S.; Prof. A. B. Gajendragadkar, M. A., B,
E. S. ; Mr. P. V. Kane, M. A., LL. M ; Principal R. D. Karmarkar, M. A. ;
Prof. V. G. Paranjpe, M. A., LL. B., D, Litt. ; Prof. V. K. Rajavabe, M. A.;
the! late Mr. N. B. Utgikar, M, A.; £108} Prof. P. L. Vaibya, M. A., D. Litt.;

Mr. V. P. Vaibya, J. P., B, A., Bar-at-law; Prof. M. Winternitz, Ph. D.; and

the late Rev. Father R. ZiMMEa?MANN, S. J., Ph. D. No Board of which I have
been a member has worked, eVer since its inception, more smoothly and harmo-
niously.

But I desire to make a special mention of my indebtedness to Mr. V, P.
Vaidya, Bar-at-law, of Bombay, and the late Rev. Father R. Zimmermann, S. J.,
whose advice and ready help accompanied my labours from' the time I first under- ^
took the responsibilities of the work. The interest of my late lamented fellow-stu-
dent and friend Father Zimmermann in this project did not flagl even as he lay,
in 1931, in a Nursing Home at Faldkirch, waiting prepared to meet his Maker !
Nothing encouraged me more in the early stages of this arduous and fascinating
work than the active and unwavering interest with which these two friends fol-
lowed it.

Nepal and Kashmir in the North and Tanjore anjd Travancore in the South
are known to contain vast treasures of unpublished and valuable Sanskrit manus-
cripts ; and the course of Indological studies of the last two or three decades may
be said to have been dominated by discoveries of outstanding importance made
during that period in the three last mentioned centres. On the other hand, in re-
gard to the large and well-stocked public and private libraries which are known to
have been in existence in the country, Nepal decidedly appears not have contri-
buted its quota to the stock of fresh material which is now required for unravell-
ing further the tangled skein of the history of Indian literature. Satis Chandra
ViDYABHUSHANA and Haraprasad Shastri among Indians, and Sylvain htvi and
Giuseppe Tucci among Europeans have undoubtedly done valuable pioneering work,
but in view of the immense possibilities, what has been achieved thus far must be
said to be tantalizingly little.

Under these circumstances, we cannot be sufficiently grateful to Rajaguru
Hemaraj Pandit, C.I.E., IMrector of Public Instruction, Nepal, through whose
go^ offices the doors of the rich store-house of the Nepali material were thrown
open to us — material which is all but inaccessible to Indologists — and we have been
placed in a position to publish, for the first time in the history of Mdhabharata
studies, collations of valuable Nepali manuscripts. This supremely unselfish and
profoundly learned patron of Sanskrit studies has really done more than merely sup-
plying to the Institute, free of cost, collations of Nepali manuscripts available to him
in local libraries. Realizng that there were valuable manuscripts to be had outside
Kathmandu, the headquarters of the Rajaguru, he caused a search to be made, at his
own expense, throughout that distant outpost of Hindu culture and civilization, for
old Mahabharata manuscripts, and the find of the valuable Ms. N 3 , the oldest of the
dated manuscripts of our critical apparatus, is the unexpected and welcome fruit
of the Rajaguru’s exertibns in the cause of Mahabharata research. Only those who
know the difficulties in the way of obtaining any manuscript from Nepal will be
in a position to appreciate fully the debt which the editor and the other members
of the Mahabharata Editorial Board, and beyond that the whole world of Indolo-
gists, owe to the Rajaguru. Sanskritists have much to hope for from the dispassion-
ate efforts of this truly patriotic and cultured Rajaguru, who loses no opportunity
of placing bis immense learning and unbounded resources freely at the disposal of
all serious workers in the field of Sanskrit research.

£ 109 } In connection with other help that has been received from extra-mural
collaborators, I must put on record our special obligation to Pandit Vidhushekhara
Sastri Bhattacharya of the Visvabharati, and to M. R. Ry. Rao Saheb T. Samba^
murthi Rao AvL, B. A., B. L., of the Saraswathi Mahal, Tanjore. These gentlemen
have been good enough to supply the Institute, for many years past, with care-
fully procured collations of manuscripts which are in their charge or which were
kindly procured by them, on loan, for the purpose, unselfishly supervising the work
of their collation centre, at great sacrifice of their tiipe and labour. To Profcs^r

K. Rama Pisharoti, then Principal of the Sanskrit G)llege at Trippunittura in
Cochin State, I am indebted for the collations of Malayalam manuscripts for the
first two adhyayas of this parvan.

My special thanks are due to the Managing Committees and Trustees of the
following libraries and institutions for supplying me with the manusaipts required
by me and allowing me to retain them as long as necessary : the Adyar Library,
the Baroda Oriental Institute, Benares Sanskrit College, Mysore Oriental Library,
Shri Yadugiri Yatiraj Math (Melkote, Mysore) and the India Office (London).
The latter deserves speaal mention as the only Euroi>ean library I know, which
sends out freely its Indian manuscripts, on loan, back to India, for the use of In-
dian scholars. A few manuscripts were sent to me by my kind friends Professor
Sushil Kumar De, Head of the Department of Sanskrit and Bengali, Dacca Uni-
versity, and Professor Bhagavaddatta of the Dayananda Anglo- Vedic College,
Lahore, to whom I wish to thank for this kind help. I am obliged also to Sardar
Kibe of Indore for the loan of a Nilakaptha manuscript. The Chief of Idappalli,
Mr. Anujan Achan, Mr. Kallenkara Pisharam, all of Cochin, as also the Pro-
prietors of the following estates in Cochin, Poomulli Mana, Avanapparambu Mana.
Nareri Mana, have put me under heavy obligation by sending me freely Malay^am
manuscripts in their possession, for collation, at a time when it was rather difficult
for me to secure any Malayalam manuscripts at all.

I desire further to express my gratefulness to various scholars who have fol-
lowed the publication of the fascicules of this volume with keen interest, periodi-
cally publishing reviews of them in the Journals of different learned Societies, re-
views expressive of their interest and appreciation ; to wit, Professors Banerji,
Sastri, Barnett, Belloni-Filippi, Charpentier, S. K. De, Edgerton, R. Pick,
Jayaswal, Konow, Krishnaswami Aiyangar, Lesny, Kalidas Nag, Weller,
WiNTERNiTZ and others. These kind reviewers have adopted uniformly a most
courteous and sympathetic tone in their reviews. Their sympathy and courtesy
have always reminded me of thase classic lines of Bhartrhari :



I must next record my thanks for the ungrudging assistance I have uniformly
received from the members of the permanent staff of the Mahabharata Department
of the Institute. Mr. S. N. Tadpatrikar, M.A., Supervisor of Collations, was
always by my side, helping me with useful suggestions, when I constituted the text
of the Adi. Mr. Tadpatrikar has been associated with the work, in various capa-
cities, since 1919. He has assisted my predecessor, the late Mr. Utgikar, in pre-
paring the Tentative Edition of the Viratparvan and seeing it through the press.
The compiling of the critical notes (printed at the foot of the page) was entrusted
by me to Messrs. B. G. Bhide and D, V. £110} Naravane. For the conscientious
manner in which these two gentlemen have discharged their duty, I feel greatly
obliged, since it is a most tedious and trying piece of woric to collect the variant
readings from the different collation sheets, and to arrange, in a prescribed form,
according to stringent rules of sequence and enunciation, that ponderous mass of
variants which is and will remain the unique feature and abiding achievement of this
edition. The ^rada codex was collated by the Head Shastri of the Mahabharata
Department, Shankar Shastri Bhilavadikar. The comparative paucity of printing
mistakes in this volume is largely due to the vigilence and conscientiousness! of the
Collator and Reader, K. V. Krishnamurti Sharma, Sastri, of Erode (South India).

These and other members of my staff have uniformly worked with exemplary zeal
and untiring patience, to make a success of this edition, and I gladly take the op-
portunity of putting on record their loyal help and willing co-operation.

It is but right that I should also mention here that the Manager iand the ex-
pert compositors of the renowned Niranaya Sagar Press have! rendered ungrudging-
ly every assistance in carrying out the typographical arrangements which appeared
to me best suited for the purpose of the work, meeting requirements that would
have tried the patience and exhausted the resources of any other press in India.

Last but not least, I must express my profound gratitude to my revered Guru
Geheimer Regierungsrat Professor Dr. Heinrich Luders of the University of Berlin.
What little merit there may be in the present work is due wholly to that excellent
though somewhat rigorous and exacting training in philological methods which I
had the benefit of receiving at his hands in the Indogermanisches Seminar, as a
student in the University of Berlin. It is my firm conviction that there is no living
scholar who has a deeper insight into the history of the Indian epic and the compli-
cacies of its tradition than Geheimrat LOders. It was, therefore, an unlucky day
in the annals of Mahabharata studies when, for lack of sympathetic co-operation
and adequate financial support, he must have been compelled to abandon his epic
studies, and our Great Epic lost the benefit of redaction at the hands of one of the
greatest living philologists. His early Mahabharata studies, Ueber die Granthmecen-
sion, ,Die van R^yasjnga and the Druckprobe have been to me like! beacon
lights in the perilous navigation of the Mahabharata Ocean. May this work be to
him a small recompense for the great trouble he has taken to initiate me in the
mysteries of textual criticism !
