title = "The minimal triangle circumscribing a semicircle"

+++
Consider a fixed semicircle with center at
![O](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "O")
and radius
![r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "r").
Let ![\\triangle
ABC](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+ABC&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\triangle ABC") be the isosceles triangle which circumscribes it
(Figure 1).

What will be the characteristics of the minimal form of the said
triangle, i.e. triangle with minimum perimeter, which will circumscribe
the said semicircle? Let the base angles of the isosceles triangle be
![\\angle
x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle x"). In order to determine the equation for the perimeter with
respect to this base angle this we perform the following construction
(Figure 2):  
1\) Join point
![O](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "O") to
one of the points of tangency of the circumscribing triangle ABC and the
semi-circle (Point ![I\_1,
I\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_1%2C+I_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"I_1, I_2")).  
2\) This gives us two right triangles ![\\triangle
OI\_2C](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+OI_2C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\triangle OI_2C") and ![\\triangle
AI\_2O](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+AI_2O&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\triangle AI_2O").  
3\) Using their sides and ![\\angle
x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle x") we can determine the lengths of the segments
![\\overline{OC}, \\overline{I\_2C},
\\overline{I\_2A}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOC%7D%2C+%5Coverline%7BI_2C%7D%2C+%5Coverline%7BI_2A%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{OC}, \\overline{I_2C}, \\overline{I_2A}") (Figure 2). Twice
their sum will yield the equation of the perimeter of the triangle. It
is:

![P=2r\\left (\\tan(x)+
\\dfrac{1}{\\tan(x)}+\\dfrac{1}{\\sin(x)}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%3D2r%5Cleft+%28%5Ctan%28x%29%2B+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctan%28x%29%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csin%28x%29%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"P=2r\\left (\\tan(x)+ \\dfrac{1}{\\tan(x)}+\\dfrac{1}{\\sin(x)}\\right)")

[![triangle\_circumscribing\_semicircle2](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/triangle_circumscribing_semicircle2.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/triangle_circumscribing_semicircle2.png)Figure

Thus, we will get the minimal triangle when the function ![y=\\left
(\\tan(x)+
\\tfrac{1}{\\tan(x)}+\\tfrac{1}{\\sin(x)}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cleft+%28%5Ctan%28x%29%2B+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctan%28x%29%7D%2B%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csin%28x%29%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y=\\left (\\tan(x)+ \\tfrac{1}{\\tan(x)}+\\tfrac{1}{\\sin(x)}\\right)")
attains a minimum (Figure 3).

![semicircle\_triangle\_minim](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/semicircle_triangle_minim.png?w=637&h=433)Figure

The derivative of this function is (Figure 3):  
![y'=\\left (\\dfrac{1}{\\cos^2(x)}-
\\dfrac{1}{\\sin^2(x)}-\\dfrac{\\cos(x)}{\\sin^2(x)}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%27%3D%5Cleft+%28%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ccos%5E2%28x%29%7D-+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csin%5E2%28x%29%7D-%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ccos%28x%29%7D%7B%5Csin%5E2%28x%29%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y'=\\left (\\dfrac{1}{\\cos^2(x)}- \\dfrac{1}{\\sin^2(x)}-\\dfrac{\\cos(x)}{\\sin^2(x)}\\right)")

We get our minimum when
![y'=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%27%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y'=0"). Thus at minimum,

![\\dfrac{1}{\\cos^2(x)}=\\dfrac{1}{\\sin^2(x)}+\\dfrac{\\cos(x)}{\\sin^2(x)}\\\\\[7pt\]
\\sin^2(x)=\\cos^3(x)+\\cos^2(x)\\\\\[7pt\]

Putting
![y=\\cos(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Ccos%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y=\\cos(x)") we get the cubic equation
![y^3+2y-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E3%2B2y-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y^3+2y-1=0"). It can be factorized as ![(y + 1) (y^2 + y - 1) =
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28y+%2B+1%29+%28y%5E2+%2B+y+-+1%29+%3D+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(y + 1) (y^2 + y - 1) = 0"). From which we get the roots as ![(-\\phi,
-1,
\\phi')](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-%5Cphi%2C+-1%2C+%5Cphi%27%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(-\\phi, -1, \\phi')"), where
![\\phi=\\tfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%2B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi=\\tfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}") is the Golden ratio and
![\\phi'=\\tfrac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}=\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%27%3D%5Ctfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D-1%7D%7B2%7D%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi'=\\tfrac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}=\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}").
![x=\\arccos(y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Carccos%28y%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x=\\arccos(y)"). Since
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x") is
the base angle of an isosceles triangle,
![y=\\phi'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cphi%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y=\\phi'") is the only valid value for which the
![\\arccos(y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carccos%28y%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\arccos(y)") may be taken. Thus we get,

![x=\\arccos(\\phi') \\approx
0.9045569](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Carccos%28%5Cphi%27%29+%5Capprox+0.9045569&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x=\\arccos(\\phi') \\approx 0.9045569")

Thus, when the base angles of the isosceles ![\\triangle
ABC](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+ABC&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\triangle ABC") are
![\\arccos(\\phi')](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carccos%28%5Cphi%27%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\arccos(\\phi')") then we have the minimal circumscribing triangle of
a given semicircle (Figure 4).

![triangle\_circumscribing\_semicircle\_shrI](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/triangle_circumscribing_semicircle_shri.png?w=640)Figure

The special features of this triangle can be seen in Figure 4, where the
radius of the fixed semicircle is taken to be a unit: It is made up 2
right triangles whose sides specify the equation of
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi"), i.e.
![\\phi^2-\\phi-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%5E2-%5Cphi-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi^2-\\phi-1=0"). The various powers of
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi") are captured by it. The perimeter of the minimal circumscribing
triangle is thus ![2r
\\phi^{5/2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2r+%5Cphi%5E%7B5%2F2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2r \\phi^{5/2}"). The 2 points where the triangle touches the circular
arc of the semicircle are specified by the angle
![\\arcsin(\\phi')](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carcsin%28%5Cphi%27%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\arcsin(\\phi')").

This triangle has a special place in the great geometric manifestation
of the Bhairava and the Bhairavī, known as the Śrī-yantra, versions of
which are worshiped in the Paścimāṃnāya (Kubjikā; Western lodge) and
Dakṣiṇāṃnāya (Śrī-kula; Southern lodge) of the kaula tradition. This
yantra is described in a key text of these traditions, the
Saundaryalaharī, thusly:  
caturbhiḥ śrīkaṇṭhaiḥ śivayuvatibhiḥ pañcabhir api  
prabhinnābhiḥ śaṃbhor navabhir api mūlaprakṛtibhiḥ ।  
tryaś-catvāriṃśad vasu-dala-kalāśra-trivalaya  
tri-rekhābhiḥ sārdhaṃ tava śaraṇa-koṇāḥ pariṇatāḥ ॥

![shrI\_yantra](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/shri_yantra.png?w=640)Figure

The above verse from the Saundaryalaharī may be rendered as:  
The (tri)angles in what constitute your dwelling, which is built of 9
mūla-prakṛti-s, i.e. the 4 Śrīkaṇṭha-s and the 5 Śiva-yuvati-s, all
\[stationed\] apart from Śambhu, along with the lotuses with Vasu- (8)
and lunar-digit- (16) petals, the 3 circles and the 3 lines, are 43 in
number. (modified version of the translation of Subrahmanya Shastri and
Shrinivasa Ayyangar)

This verse precisely captures the essence of the structure of the
Śrī-yantra. The 9 mūla-prakṛti-s are the 9 basic triangles that
constitute to the yantra. They represent the 9-fold form of the Bhairava
of the Paścimāṃnāya, namely Navātman-bhairava. They are in turn divided
into: 4 upward-facing or liṅga triangles, which are termed Śrīkaṇṭha-s.
These are the manifest forms of the Bhairava. 5 downward-facing or yoni
triangles, which are termed Śiva-yuvati-s. These are the manifest forms
the Bhairavī. The central point, the bindu, lies apart from from them
and represents the Bhairava in his state as the unmanifest singularity,
i.e. Akulavīra. In contrast, the rest of the yantra with is manifold
geometric structures can be seen as his śakti, Kaulinī, who manifests
diversely as the kula-s of Yoginī-s. These Yoginī-s inhabit all elements
of the structure: For example, the 8 mātṛkā-s (Caṇḍikā, Brāhmī, Rudrāṇī,
Kaumārī, Vaiṣṇavī, Vārāhī, Indrāṇī, Cāmuṇḍā) inhabit the 8-petalled
lotus (This is as per the mūla-prakrīyā of the Ānanda-bhairava
tradition. Other paramparā-s place the Kāma-yoginī-s from Anaṅgapuṣpā to
Anaṅgamālinī in these petals). The 16 Śrī-nityā-s inhabit the
16-petalled lotus.

The 43 triangles are reckoned as the 42 outward-pointing triangles and
the inner-most triangle formed by the intersection of the 9 basic
triangles. The outermost of these has 14 triangles known as the
Saubhāgyadāyaka in which dwell the Sarva-saubhāgyadāyaka-yoginī-s. The
second rung with 10 triangles is known as the Sarvārthasādhaka with
eponymous yoginī-s. The third rung again with 10 triangles is the
Sarva-rakṣākara with the 10 yoginī-s of that kula. The 4th rung with 8
triangles is the Sarva-rogahara with the 8 Vāgdevī-s as its resident
yoginī-s. The 5th rung with the central triangle around the bindu has
Kāmeśvarī as its yoginī.

So, where does our above minimal triangle figure in all this? It defines
the Śrīkanṭha-1 which is the first triangle to be drawn while
constructing the Śrī-yantra. Also, notably, the first Śiva-yuvati is an
isosceles triangle formed by welding two 3-4-5 right triangles along the
side of length 4. As we have seen before, this 3-4-5 triangle, the most
primitive of the integral right triangles, emerges naturally as the
maximal triangle defined by [the characteristic ellipse of a right
triangle](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2019/07/18/discovering-bronze-in-the-characteristic-ellipse-of-right-triangles/).
Thus, the two primary triangles of the Śrī-cakra natural feature as the
ultima of certain problems of triangle geometry.
