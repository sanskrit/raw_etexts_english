A recent conversation brought to mind the our famed oxalate experiment.
Oxalic acid first caught my fancy in the summer vacations of 6th class.
I was intrigued by it and sought to extract if from the sorrel that grew
abundantly in my late grandfather’s garden. Then my greater aunt
provided me with that lost text of chemistry, which introduced me to the
possibility of making stains with silver oxalate. One day 3 years later
I had gone to pay obeisance to vR^iShadhvaja at the intersection beyond
the buffalo pond. By some chance while return I ran into Mis-creant who
was eager to have a look through my microscope. We decided to make the
silver stain but ended up with an interesting result :-). I reasoned
that silver oxalate or silver tartrate should be ideal substances for
the purpose. Mis-creant had smuggled silver nitrate for us through a
“senior” contact. Having made sure that there was no one at home we
began our experiments. The nitrate was mixed with a mixture of organic
acids and we got a precipitate that we decided to heat in the kitchen
gas stove to remove water. We left it there and heard a several minutes
later a peculiar noise. We also noticed a strange discoloration on the
kitchen ceiling which intrigued my parents to put it most mildly for a
long time to come. The rest of the experiment is left to one’s
imagination.
