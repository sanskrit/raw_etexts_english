### (*New York Times* May 3, 1894)

An interesting social incident of last evening was the lecture given by
Swami Vivekananda in the parlors of the home of Miss Phillips. 19 West
Thirty-eighth Street. A large number of invitations had been sent out,
and the many guests present showed great interest in the discourse of
the Hindu lecturer.
