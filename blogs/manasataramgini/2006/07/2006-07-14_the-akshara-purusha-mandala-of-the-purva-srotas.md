The five faced one manifests as the inactive matter at the origin, the
all-pervading matter in the universe and the vaccuum from which all
emerges. Hence is worshipped as:  
shAntAya namaH | sarvagatAya namaH | shUnyAya namaH |   
These three states of the deva are stationed in the akShara puruSha
maNDala. The five short vowels are the faces and the 7 long vowels are
the limbs of the body. They are conjoined with the nasal bindu. The
visarga is the mighty astra, the trishUla of tatpuruSha. All this is
shiva and the core is his mahAmantra hauM.

To begin his worship the sAdhaka shall perform the mahAmudrA which is
form of the paschimottAsana, with his hands grasping his feet and his
head touching the feet. Then he shall perform the nyAsas and meditate
upon the maNDala with the mahAmantra.
