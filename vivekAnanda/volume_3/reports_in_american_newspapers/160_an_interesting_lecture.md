## AN INTERESTING LECTURE

(*Wisconsin State Journal*, November 21, 1893)

The lecture at the Congregational Church \[Madison\] last night by the
celebrated Hindoo monk, Vivekananda, was an extremely interesting one,
and contained much of sound philosophy and good religion. Pagan though
he be, Christianity may well follow many of his teachings. His creed is
as wide as the universe, taking in all religions, and accepting truth
wherever it may be found. Bigotry and superstition and idle ceremony, he
declared, have no place in "the religions of India".
