*To Sister Christine*

228 W. 39TH STREET  
NEW YORK

*12 December 1895*

DEAR CHRISTINA,

I am going away out of town from the 24th of this month and will come
back on the 2nd of January. From the 24th — the 2nd I will not be here.
I will settle the dates for Detroit and Chicago after hearing from you
and from Chicago.

\[Paragraph excised from the original letter.\]

My love to Mrs. Phunkey \[Funke\] \[excised\] and all other friends.

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA
