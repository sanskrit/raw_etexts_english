*To Sister Christine*

ON BOARD *PRINZ REGENT LUITPOLD  
3rd January 1897*.

DEAR CHRISTINA,

By two p.m. today I reach Port Said. Asia once more. I have not heard
from you \[for\] long. Hope everything is going on well with you. How
are Mrs. Funke, Mrs. Phelps, and all other friends?

My love to all. Write when you feel like it.

VIVEKANANDA.
