## CLXXXIV

*To Swami Turiyananda*

102 E. 58TH STREET,  
NEW YORK,  
*18th July, 1900*.

MY DEAR TURIYANANDA,

Your letter reached me redirected. I stayed in Detroit for three days
only. It is frightfully hot here in New York. There was no Indian mail
for you last week. I have not heard from Sister Nivedita yet.

Things are going on the same way with us. Nothing particular. Miss
Müller cannot come in August. I will not wait for her. I take the next
train. Wait till it comes. With love to Miss Boocke,

Yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.

PS. Kali went away about a week ago to the mountains. He cannot come
back till September. I am all alone, and washing; I like it. Have you
seen my friends? Give them my love.

V.
